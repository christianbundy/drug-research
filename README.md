# Erowid Research Project

A research project analyzing the  [experiences](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml) available from [Erowid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erowid) in the interest of harm reduction.

## Usage

You can read through the `json` folder, or you can run `main.js` with:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo

I'm currently working on getting rid of the `header` properties in the JSON object, and translating them to meaningful doseage properties that can be added to their parent object literal.

## Copyright

These experiences were downloaded from Erowid and [should *always* have their citation attached](http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_copyrights.shtml), which identifies both the author and Erowid as the source of the content.
