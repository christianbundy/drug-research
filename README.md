# Erowid Research Project

This research project is an effort to analyze the [experiences](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml) available from [Erowid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erowid) in the interest of harm reduction.

## Usage

To get the current dataset in JSON, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node toJson.js
```

## Todo

The task at hand is converting the HTML of these 20,571 experiences to content-rich JSON which will be used in analysis.

## Copyright

These experiences were downloaded from Erowid and [should *always* have their citation attached](http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_copyrights.shtml), which identifies both the author and Erowid as the source of the content. If you use information from this repository, please mention where you found it. Thanks!
