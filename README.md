# Erowid Research Project

A research project analyzing the  [experiences](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml) available from [Erowid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erowid) in the interest of harm reduction.

## Results

* There were 20,537 experiences on Erowid.
* Males wrote 81.2% of the experiences, 12.4% were female, and 6.3% didn't specify their gender.
* TBA

## Usage

You can read through the `json` folder, or you can run `main.js` with:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Todo

The JSON object literals need to be cleaned up so that they can be analyzed easier. Other than that, this data is ready to be plugged into an application.

## Copyright

These experiences were downloaded from Erowid and [should *always* have their citation attached](http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_copyrights.shtml), which identifies both the author and Erowid as the source of the content. If you use information from this repository, please mention where you found it. Thanks!
