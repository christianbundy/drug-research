  "Well, I have huffed before many of times and this was the start of the crazy events. I was in the room with my cousin who was playing the guitar when I told him I would be back in 5 minutes and that I was gonna 'Hit the gas can.' I went outside to the carport and started huffing in the deepest breaths possible. I have passed out many times before so I walked to the grass and sat down. Didn't really but I thought I did.",
  "I woke up about twenty minutes later with my head bleeding, my eyes bleeding, lips bleeding from my teeth going through them, my nose bleeding and a big ass cut on my chin. Thats not all folks...I went inside to my cousin and started freaking out and pulling my hair out in chunks...lol. But then my cousin said smile, I did and he started laughing really hard.",
  "I chipped about 3/4 of my tooth off. I started laughing really hard and thought about what I should tell my grandma, who was sleeping in a rocking chair in the living room. I started brushing my teeth (didn't hurt at all, nothing did) to get the smell off my breath and then went outside and pulled the handlebars off my razor scooter. Then I woke her up and told her that I was going to her car to get a CD out of it to listen to while I go to bed and I was on the scooter and it slipped when I was getting off it.",
  "I stayed out of school for about a week to get rid of the black eyes and bruising on my face. I am still 'Hitting the gas' can to this day. I am hardheaded and on my way to Alcoholism because I have a lot of experiences in this category too."
