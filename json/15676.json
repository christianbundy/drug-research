  "<p>I started taking Effexor XR in April of 2003 for panic disorder. It was supposedly going to be a short-term treatment, but here I am, still taking it. to tell the truth, Effexor is a nightmare. I consider myself experienced when it comes to drugs. I have done almost every kind of readily available illicit drug, from shroomies to crystal to e to lsd and back again. But I have never come across something that feels this bad to come off of-- not even heroin! Heroin made me vomit and itch when I came off, yes, but I was not convinced I would die, and it did not give me such bad tachycardia that I could hardly breathe for the pain of my heart racing. But that is Effexor. A nightmare.",
  "I thought I'd have no problem stopping, but I have tried 4 times now to wean myself off it, and the fact remains: I cannot spend weeks in bed, dope-sick... and it does take weeks.",
  "I suffered from serotonin syndrome when some asshole doctor at mental health upped my Effexor dose to 150mg. If my boyfriend hadn't been on top of it, I probably would've died. The symptoms I experienced: profuse sweating, asthma, dilated pupils, racing heart, hyperthermia, mania, delusions, visual hallucinations (think cartoon acid). It was really scary, but I had no idea what was going on-- I was far too ill.</p>"
