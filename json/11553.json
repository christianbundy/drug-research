  "<p>I was prescribed hydrocodone after some routine oral surgery. I had been trying to quit smoking off and on for years. The chemical depression of stopping always got the best of me and within a few days, I would give up my attempt.",
  "Quitting with hydrocodone is a breeze. No depression, irritability, or cravings. There was the thought of smoking, but it had no urgency. I took the hydrocodone as directed, and when I ran out, that was it.",
  "I no longer smoke and had no problem with needing any more opiates - although it the opportunity arises ....</p>"
