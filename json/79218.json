 "report": "<p>I went to Emergency for intractable back pain, and was given 2 shots of morphine by the nurse. Each time I got a shot, I felt 5 seconds or so global pain, head to foot. Then a warm feeling, like liquid fur, settled over me. In fact, my tactile/hearing synesthesia kicked in, and I actually thought I felt soft, really soft fur caress my left cheek. I felt happy for the next few hours, then lay down for a nap. Normally, I feel depressed and anxious even though I'm being treated for that. The morphine relaxed and elated me at the same time.</p>",
