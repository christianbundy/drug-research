 "report": [
  "<p>This is my first trip report so please bare with me.",
  "Background: I have previous experience with cannabis, methylone, mdai, mpa, cocaine, MDMA, 5-meo-dalt, 6-apb. I workout on a daily basis, and eat very healthy. Not on any meds, no depression problems.",
  "Setting: It is new years eve and preparing to go to a rave. Very well rested. Had acquired a good amount of methylone from a friend along with a bunch of MDAI I had lying around (both tested consistent with marquis reagent). Ate 3 healthy meals stopping about 2 hours before the drop along with preloading vitamin c, magnesium, and 5-htp. I'm in a great mood and excited to see my friends and dance to some great music. I arrive with my female friend (A) at my male friends house (T). Before we head off to the rave we decide to take a few hits of cannabis. It comes time to leave and we all decided to drop our first doses of Methylone as the venue is only minutes away.",
  "T+0 - I bomb 220mg, T takes 220mg in a capsule, A emptys 180mg into mouth and washes down with water.",
  "T+25 - we arrive at the venue. A begins to feel the first effects while myself and T have absolutely nothing.",
  "T+45 - A claims to be full on rolling. Yet, absolutely nothing for T and myself. A is not dosing anymore the whole night and goes off on her own.",
  "T+1:00 - still nothing for T and myself, we weigh out another 150mg of methylone and bomb it. Start dancing.",
  "T+1:30 - starting to feel a bit more alert and energetic, T and myself foolishly take 100mg of MDAI.",
  "T+1:45 - T and I both start coming up, and a serious 0-60 in one second feeling. Heart is absolutely beating out of my chest to the point where I start worrying and almost have an anxiety attack (very normal for me while coming up) after a few minutes pass the anxiety goes away.",
  "T+2:15 - Absolutely rolling face at this point. Pupils are the size of dinner plates. Empathy and euphoria are in full effect. Heart rate has evened out. No real body buzz or waves of pleasure yet.",
  "T+2:30 - That 100mg must be kicking in because my heart rate is through the roof and I'm experiencing EXTREME euphoria. It feels absolutely MAGICAL; like the first time I took MDMA. Almost to the point of being overwhelming! But I assure myself I'm okay and welcome it.",
  "So much energy; can't stop dancing. Light shows are absolutely euphoric, practically orgasmic. I'm zooming around making friends with and talking to everyone. Probably making an ass out of myself. Getting waves of absolute EUPHORIA that start down at my toes all the way up to my head. So intense at points in songs that I stop dancing and just run my fingers through my hair saying 'oh my god' to myself.",
  "This is the hardest I have ever rolled in my life",
  "T+3:00 - Things start to get a bit hazy at the rave and T and myself continue to dip our fingers into the magical bag of MDAI for the next two hours just absolutely rolling, dancing, and loving life. Everything was perfect. Neither of us got sick, or felt overstimulated.",
  "T+5:00 - Still absolutely peaking at this point with no end in sight. We finally find A and she is very tired and wants to leave.",
  "T+5:20 - peak effects feel like they are wearing off T and I decided to split up the last 80mg of Methylone, we take it sublingually. A few more hits of cannabis and minutes later, feel as if I'm peaking all over again.",
  "T+6:20 - Still very much rolling laying in bed, body waves of euphoria still present yet very tired. We all decide to head to sleep. And actually occurs really easily for all.",
  "T+11:00 - Woke up abruptly, can't fall back asleep. Have a great afterglow feeling, pupils still massive. Decide to drive home at this point and try to nap.",
  "T+14:00 - Wake up from nap and feel great physically but I have this horrid depressed feeling. Can't quite pick out what it is. Just this feeling of absolute nothing-ness.",
  "I assume the feeling will pass as it usually does with me. But it's now almost 60 hours later and I have never had this depressed of a feeling in my entire life. I am scared to death to be alone. I try to keep myself occupied as much as possible but everything feels wrong. It feels as though my whole world is ending. Completely unmotivated to do anything. I become extremely aggravated and aggressive over nothing. Mood swings left and right. Random spurts of crying. No thoughts of suicide at all, but just a bleak outlook on everything. It's only getting worse as time goes on.",
  "Overall: One of the best nights of my life. No nausea, no freakouts, just a very long and intense roll. I've only ever had good encounters with methylone and MDAI despite what many say, actually almost prefer them over MDMA. I however do not recommend re-dosing like I was. That is where everything went downhill. If I could go back I would most certainly have brought a set amount of chemicals with me. I am almost positive all the re-dosing brought on this absolutely horrible mind state I am currently in. Hoping that others will read this and learn from my experience.</p>"
