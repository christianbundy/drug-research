 "report": "<p>I would just like to add this report for those of you that have been killing your lungs with the leaves of this plant.  The flowers might be good to smoke but the smoke from the leaves and plant material is harsh so I thought about it before I smoked it a second time.  I figured the smoke would be better if I smoked it like a pipe smoker; or cigar smoker, smokes strong tobacco.  I would have to say this was not at all like when I had smoked it last.</p><p>Last time it made me sick and itchy when I inhaled the rough smoke, but when I held it in my mouth and blew it out instead of inhaling this time I was impressed with effects of this sacred plant.  It numbed my mouth a bit and then sedated me similar to marijuana, but with no exhaustion or feelings of laziness.  The smoke is a tiny bit bitter for the first 3-4 hits and then my mouth is too numb too feel it or at least that is how it treated me.</p>",
