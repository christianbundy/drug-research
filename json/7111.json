 "report": [
  "I had been experimenting with B. caapi and Syrian Rue of late.  I had the usual good feelings once I got past the taste of the tea.  One night before my daughter's karate practice, I wanted to see if adding a mushroom would enhance the feeling, it did!  I ate one large mushroom before I made some tea from 5 sticks of Caapi + 1/4 teaspoon Rue, I used hawaiian punch and microwaved the mixture of Caapi and Syrian Rue for 10 minutes. I felt great during the practice, but when I was leaving, I started having 'glitches' in time. It seemed that time was standing still. ",
  "As I got home, I noticed my vision was switching from near to far and back and forth,  and I was seeing flame-like visions with the changes. I thought it was something like deja vu, one eye registering in short term memory and the other in long term. Then I thought it was my left eye vision registering in my right brain and vice versa, so I closed one eye and to my dismay it was still happening. What a trip! This lasted for about 2 hours then slowly went away. I was seeing geometric shapes, I stared into the light bulb, closed my eyes and focused on the orange circle in my mind, I opened my eyes and the circle was blue and moving on the wall. I will try this mixture again."
