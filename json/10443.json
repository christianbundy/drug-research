 "report": [
  "Due to having severe back pain and herniated discs I would go to the doctor and always get prescribed dilaudid or oxycontin, after becoming addicted to these opiates and then getting clean I still needed something for severe pain, my doc recommended ultram.",
  "This morning I took 8 of the 50mg tablets(I only weigh 150 but have rapid metabolism and a high drug tolerance)",
  "I wasn't expecting much, but boy was I surprised. I know I took a large dose, but it is 6 hours later and I feel like I've eaten 3 or 4 lortab 10mg or 60-100mg of Morphine. It works and, even though it is not an opiate, it gives me a great warm fuzzy buzz that lasts far longer than any opiate I've tried(hydrocodone, oxycontin, dilaudid, demerol, fentanyl, codeine, etc).",
  "Having taken 400mg I am extremely high and have waves of euphoria, but am having trouble with balance and coordination."
