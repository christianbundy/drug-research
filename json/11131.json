  "I ordered a gram of Salvia Divinorum 60x online a few weeks ago.  Well today I decided to try it.  I smoked a bowl of it.  At first I was thinking well this is not really doing anything.  So I smoked some more.  The I felt like I was rolling over and over.  Faster and faster.  I can't say I saw any visuals other than distance was really hard to judge and I could not think.  All I could think of I want this to stop.  It seemed to take forever.  Finally I started to sober up then my head hurt really bad.  I picked up the pipe and what was left and put it in the trash. ",
  "I don't want to do anymore of that stuff for the rest of my life.  I have done shrooms,Ketamine, and LSD once.  However its been along time, but this is nothing like that."
