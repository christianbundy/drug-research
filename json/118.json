 "report": [
  "After reading much about nutmeg, I was eager to try it, but was wary about dosage, since I could not find a recommended 1st time dose.  I decided to take one heaping teaspoon of powdered nutmeg, since that's about half of the minimum dose I'd seen. I took it at 11:00 on a Saturday morning, and was surprised to find the taste not at all unpleasant. Definitely strange, but not bad. What was bad was the texture of the nutmeg grains, but a few good drinks of water washed it all down.",
  "At the time, I was in good health both physically and mentally, and my mood and life in general were pretty good.",
  "Thirty minutes after ingestion, I began to feel the need for some caffeine, so I quickly downed a can of soda.",
  "As the standard caffeine buzz began to wear off two hours after taking the nutmeg, I could definitely feel a change beginning. It took about one hour after that to reach peak effects, nice euphoria, not overpowering, I was able to walk around, talk to people and go about my business with not the least trouble. There was only a slight dry mouth sensation, but there was no nausea, headache or any other unpleasant side effects. Four hours into it, the high had diminished, and I felt only calm and sleepy.",
  "Sleep was not necessary however, and after walking around for a while, I came down fully, and felt no after effects for the remainder of the day.",
  "In conclusion, my experience with nutmeg was good, but not mind blowing by any means. I think I'll try it again at a slightly higher dose when I have more time to spend with it."
