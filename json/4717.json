  "Ive been using heroin for several years intravenously and have a daily habit of approx. 5 bags. One day I couldnt get my hands on any dope and someone I live with who has a persription for fentanyl patches gave me one to ease the withdrawl symptoms.",
  "When worn on the skin correctly fentanyl patches take several hours to start working, so I squeezed the gel inside the patch directly into the resovoir of my insulin needle by taking the plunger out of the back. when I administered the fentanyl iv I remember a very strong taste when I hit the plunger and took the blast. I dont even remember taking the works out of my arm after I took the shot, after that, all I know was what I've been told by my family who called 911 when the found me. in the ambulence paramedics gave me a shot of narcon which brought me back. I was told I almost died that day. The person who gave me the patch died last week from a fentanyl overdose administered intravenously. To anyone about to take the blast or shoot a fentanyl patch be careful, because it could be your last. ~r. I. p. M. casper~"
