  "I finally got around to trying 2C-T-7. A friend of mine had always been on my back to try it, so a couple days ago I did. I loved it. Here's the itinerary for my night:",
  "12:30am- I snort about 35mg of 2C-T-7. (snorting 2C-T-7 hurt my nose worse than any other drug- meth, crank, mdma, even AMT. And it hurts for like 15 or 30 minutes)",
  "12:45am- Everything I look at waves around as if there are heat waves being emitted from the floor. My nose still hurts.",
  "1am- Nose stops hurting. I feel like I'm on the best MDMA I've ever had and the hallucinations are very profound. Rotating 3-D octagon shapes are inside every object I look at. Very overwhelming.",
  "1am-3am- Feeling and hallucinations continue, feeling tapers away and is gone by 3:15am. The hallucinations continue. I am finally able to leave the house.",
  "3:30am- Go to a park and play for an hour or so. My hallucinataions taper down slowly and I am done by around 9am. I could have easily fallen asleep at around five, though.",
  "So thats how it went. I suggest this drug to anyone expierienced with acid, definately not a drug for a first time psychedelic user."
