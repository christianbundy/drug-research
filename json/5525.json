  "<p>In the past several years my dream experiences have diminished to one or two a month at best (I suppose I'm talking about dream recall).  I put a lot of effort to remind myself during waking hours to recall my dreams but to no avail.  About two weeks ago I stumbled calea info during a google search for dream induction.  I immediately ordered 2oz.  I had heard that drinking the tea was a bad experience so I went to my local health food store and bought the empty pill capsules made of gelatin.  The pill capsules were labled 'OO'.  I'm not sure if this is the size or wall thickness.  Nevertheless, I estimated that these were approximately 500mg capsules.  I ground the leaves into a powder and filled each capsule.  I've experimented with taking eight of these capsules before bed.  I dream all night long.  Dream recall has improved dramatically. ",
  "I did not experience any type of hallucinations (auditory or visual) nor have I experienced any changes in digestion or bowel movements from consuming it.  I plan to increase the dosage to see if this intensifies the effects.  Hopefully this will help me to experience lucid dreams.</p>"
