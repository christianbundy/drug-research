  "Psilocybe mushrooms do, indeed, have a mind-altering effect when smoked!  Like most folks, I've been told repeatedly (even by Paul Stamets himself) that smoking psilocybes destroys the psychoactive ingredients; however, at the urging of this visitor, who kindly offered his supply, we agreed to try to smoke some.  After placing a small amount of powdered mushroom in a one-hitter that could have been used for smoking MJ, we lit it up and inhaled.",
  "The effect was a short-acting tryptamine buzz that was somewhat similar to a mild N,N-DMT dose (~5-10mg).  It lasted around 15-25 minutes, had no noticable open-eye visuals, and was characterized by a mild, but enjoyable, tryppy feeling. Overall an interesting effect forsuch a small amount of mushroom used!  Might try setting aside a little bit of my next oral P.Cu. dose to smoke while trypping."
