 "report": "<p>in the summer of 1998 i started smoking weed and it was cool, but one day at a party i smoked a whole spliff fast being stupid. i lay down on the sofa and everyone left the room thats when i started to think hard then i heard a ringing noise got up and stated to panic i thought i was dying. this feeling lasted for about 2 hours until my friend calmed me down. the next couple of day i felt wierd like i werent there (depersonalization) but i managed to snap out of it after two weeks.</p><p>but i didnt learn i started smoking again. i smoked a whole skunk spliff at a friends house and left cause i started to panic but i controlled the dying feeling...but was going though some mad paranioa. since then i keep having these wierd attacks where i feel like im not here and about to die cause nothing makes sense any more.  its depersonalization that i have from it and sometimes the feeling make me freak out into a panic</p>",
