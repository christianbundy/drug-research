 "report": "<p>I heard of what gingko biloba could do to stimulate my mind and memory. Upon hearing that, I went to the store and bought a bottle of the pills. The effects I felt were not anything that I expected it to be. Instead of having my mind stimulated, I felt as if the herbal extract was hindering the functioning of my brain. When I was sitting during a class lecture, it just caused me to stare out into space for a prolonged period of time. My clarity fell asleep instead of being awakened.</p><p>The herbal extract jumbled my thinking instead of organizing it. After 3 days of use I stopped. I don't know why I was reacting negatively to gingko biloba, but I do know that I didn't like it.</p>",
