 "report": "<p>Is was in the emergency room when I first discovered the amazing power of opiates. The nurse injected 12 CC's of morphine into me at 11:30 at night. A very warm feeling started surging throughout my body. My head felt as though a large amount of blood rushed to it, Similiar to the way one feels after inhaling isobutyl nitrate. The morphine started working very quickly. I felt many mixed feelings. Analgesia and euphoria where present. It acted as a truth syrum. I felt as though I could tell anyone anything.</p><p>After I went home I was suprised to find myself in a motivated state of hyperactivity. I didn't get to sleep untill 4:00 a.m. This could be because I was excited to be on this drug. The next day after it wore off, I took 2 7.5mg Generic Hydrocodone tablets. I felt a heavy feeling throughout my body. I found myself taking 2-3 pills everyday untill my prescription ran out. My experiences with opiates where not eye opening or rewarding but it was enjoyable. It helped me relax and enjoy my day.</p>",
