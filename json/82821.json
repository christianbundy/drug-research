 "report": "<p>Oddly enough I had just had the whole DXM causes false positives for PCP conversation with a friend of mine who was going to take a drug test. I told him I had never experienced this and I am a regular DXM user (daily). I went with him to take his test and wouldn't you know when he came out he had tested positive for PCP.  I was blown away. I guess it just depends on how much you have in your system when you take the test. Personally I have taken tests for probation while on DXM with no problems, but I guess this really does happen.</p>",
