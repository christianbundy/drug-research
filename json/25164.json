 "report": "<p>I was prescribed to Effexor XR about 7 months ago. I started out with 100 mg. then my dosage was progressively raised to 250mg over a period of 3 months. At 150 mgs/day about 2 months later: I was at my bf's house one day and hit the bong and woke up not knowing what the fuck just happened and everyone was crowded around me asking me if I was okay, I was just like... '??????'  it appeared that I hit the bong, had a seizure and took a face dive straight into the mud! This was my very first seizure, but definitely not my first hit of bud.</p><p>From then on, I had numerous experiences/day with seizures only while I hit any source of marijuana.  At first I didnt know what the fuck was going on, then my bf suggested it could be the Effexor. Now I have slowed myself down to 75 mg/day and I no longer have seizures. I just pass out depending on how much I smoke, how much I have eaten, how much I have slept, etc...</p>",
