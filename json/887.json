  "I was at home really bored so I thought about taking mass amounts of vitamin C for enhancement of visuals for bud. I am an experienced bud smoker I have been smoking more than once daily for about 2 years and before that I smoked occasionally for about 5 years. Well to get it all started I decided it get the vitamin C first so I would have time to metabolize it, so I drank 2 20, Oz glasses of OJ. 1 pouch of HI-C, and ingested 2 cough drops. So thats an assload of vitamin C. then I smoked a bong load.",
  "Wow after about 10 min of smoking the bowl I started to see color patterns on the carpet they would change every few seconds really fast then I looked up on my wall and saw vividly another place and I thought I was there really I thought I was somewhere else like an acid trip it was crazy. The visuals were great but hard to explain."
