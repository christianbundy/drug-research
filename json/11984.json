  "<p>I soaked an oz of green and orange material in 151 for about an hour, then added a bunch of water to the mix and boiled the brew for several more hours adding water as needed. When the leave lost much of there color I strained them and boiled off the water into a paste and then further into a powder.the result was about 2-3 grams of potent 'hash'. Smoking a bowl with orange petals on the bottom with kava kava 40% extract and then some of the dagga hash~ an uplifting buzz with anti-anxiety--- of course some bud can really add to the psychoactivity of the blend.",
  "It was time to try a tea of this mix before work! The result was a very energized and very focused productive. With a hint of  buzz going on in the brain as well as a sense of wellbeing. Latent memories seemed to participate with the hear and now I am drinking the tea now I feel speed up, clear and buzzed able to operate heavy machinery and talk to anyone about anything! ",
