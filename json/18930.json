 "report": [
  "<p>I'll start off this report by saying I have experienced alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and LSD all more than once but had never tried any combination except for tobacco & alcohol and tobacco & cannabis. Ever since first trying LSD I've been interested in psychadelics but unfortunately they are hard to come by where I live. When I heard about a friend of a friend getting tabs I immediately jumped on the opportunity and was ready to buy 5 or so, but then I heard that they didn't contain LSD but instead 25I-NBOMe. After reading trip reports and researching them for a while I decided to buy one 1000ug blotter just to try it out, and was ready to take it that weekend before a party.",
  "T+0:00. At 4:48PM I placed the tab underneath my tongue while waiting for a bus I was taking to the liqour store to get some alcohol for the party. Initially I didn't experience any taste and like every other time after putting a tab in my mouth I wondered whether it was actually just a blank piece of blotter and I had just been ripped off. After a few minutes however I began to feel a strong bitter taste in my mouth, different to the slightly metallic taste of LSD, and I could feel the area under my tongue that was touching the blotter was beginning to go numb. While waiting 20 minutes for the bus I checked my pupils which didn't seem to have dilated yet, so I expected a long comeup.",
  "T+0:30. On the bus I swallowed the saliva I had been holding in my mouth for the past 30 minutes at 5:18PM. My wallet had slipped out of my pocket when I sat down, and I only realised once I had gotten off at the liqour store, but luckily the money I was using to buy alcohol wasn't in it. I was afraid that this would be a bad start to the trip as I was worried and annoyed about losing my bank card, drivers license and all my train & bus tickets.",
  "T+1:00. After getting the alcohol I managed to get the same bus driver on the bus back, as it had just turned around and was going back on the same route it had came, and I managed to get my wallet back when I asked the driver if anyone had handed it in. A man who was sitting where I had been before had found it and the relief I felt was incredible, I believe this is when I first began to come up as I felt tingly through my internal organs, and the praise I was giving to the man who found my wallet showed how happy I was; 'Thank you so much, you're a life saver! I can't thank you enough oh my god'.",
  "T+1:30. On the train to meet my friends before we went to the party music got steadily better and I could see that my pupils were almost fully dilated when I looked at my reflection in my phone. I was beginning to get the same feeling as when coming up on acid, that something was different but I couldn't quite place it. I began to see slight rainbow swirls when I closed my eyes - much like what I see after cannabis ever since I had LSD. These got more and more noticeable throughout the train trip and by the end I was able to see them with my eyes open in dark areas of my vision. A large difference I noticed between 25I-NBOMe and LSD is that nothing appeared to melt or move around as it does with LSD, and I didn't get the same type of patterns and fractals although I had experienced similar visuals on LSD. It was as if I was only able to access a certain type of visual, instead of being able to view the entire variety LSD offers, but it was still incredibly complex and beautiful.",
  "T+2:00. At this point when I met my friends I thought I was peaking, as the longest come up on 25I-NBOMe I had heard about was 1 - 1.5 hours, later I would see how very wrong I was!",
  "T+3:00. We arrived at the party and immediately my friend and I finished off the bottle I had bought earlier which was around 11 standards total, so we had about 5 standards each. I hadn't eaten very much earlier that day so I began to feel tipsy within 10 minutes or so, and that's when I realised that I was still coming up in my trip. I began socializing and was having a great time, I didn't care that people knew I was tripping - in a way I wanted them to know because I was having such a great time. I didn't feel awkward at all and had no trouble making interesting conversation with people I had just met, we had got to the party a bit late so there were quite a few people who weren't sober and I felt comfortable in my state of mind.",
  "T+4:00. The visuals I was getting had really picked up at this point, there was no difference between them with my eyes open or closed and they had begun to incorporate parts of what I saw - particularly people's eyes and their pupils which started a chain of concentric circles that lead off into infinitely detailed rainbow structures. One of the people I had just met was using a cigarette holder with her costume for the party and after a few drags she said I could finish the rest because she was trying to quit. The power of that cigarrette was incredible, the light headedness and body buzz combined with the alcohol and separate body-tingling sensation from the 25I-NBOMe was more than I thought my senses could handle. The smoke from cigarettes enhanced my visuals and appeared as rainbow particles some of the time - even though I knew it was unhealthy I couldn't help myself from always looking out for when a friend had one.",
  "At this point my friend and I rolled up some cannabis in the shell of a cigarette as we didn't have any rolling paper, and went out the back to smoke it. We kept getting caught in conversations and losing each other so it was probably about 20 minutes before we were actually ready with a lighter to have it. I took huge drags and held them in for a long time, the sensation of breathing anything into my lungs was incredible. We went to go sit down and that's when it first began to hit us, he had popped a pill of MDMA a few hours ago around the start of the party and we were both amazed by the strength of the marijuana.",
  "T+5:00. I don't know if it was just because I was drunk and tripping and that he was on E but that was the strongest 1/2 joint I have had in my life, it had more of an effect than 3-4 cones in a bong pulled one after another. This was when the 25I-NBOMe also began to peak, I don't know how I'm going to describe what I experienced because it's different to any experience with psychoactives or anything at all in my life - literally out of this world. I was no longer a part of this universe, I was not a person, the table in front of me was like an entire world. My consciousness was a different reality, a reality that was being created and recreated every instant of existence. I tried to carry on a conversation with a friend and surprisingly was able to understand what she was saying. The feeling in my body was unlike any I've ever experienced - it was as if every area where it is possible to feel anything was experiencing the best possible sensation at any time; the palms of my hands, the soles of my feet and every other patch of skin on my body. Time was almost non existant, and the visuals I was getting were so intense that the best way I can describe it is that they could've been an entire reality on their own and yet they were combined with our world which was brighter because of the marijuana. The 25I-NBOMe visuals had completely taken over my vision, although I was still able to see the world as we know it, I cannot explain this sensation any differently as the english language does not have the words associated to those emotions and sensory experiences. Even now when I close my eyes I can catch faint glimpses of that rainbow world I experienced, that other dimension I was allowed to know existed. The marijuana and 25I-NBOMe were working together to distort my depth perception and sense of direction, everywhere I looked was an entirely new world and what was extremely far away before was now extremely close. This peak lasted for at least the next hour, where I watched costumed people dancing to loud music and flashing lights and ate pizza.",
  "T+6:00 - T+7:00. Through the next few hours of the party the effects of the marijuana and alcohol began to wear off, but somehow the 25I-NBOMe was still going extremely strong. I was offered to share a cigarette with a girl I had just met and after a few huge drags my trip was kicked back into almost the full extent of what I experienced before, particularly the body feeling. I managed to find the cigarette holder we used before and had a great time smoking through it, cigarette after cigarette. I was offered opium, which I knew very little about and so decided to save it for another party - cigarettes were enough to allow me to experience an alternate reality. Through the next few hours I became more and more in control, and was able to get home without any major problems. I don't know what time I got home or managed to get to sleep but I remember lying in bed at 2:40AM still experiencing open-eye visuals and listening to amazing sounding music from my phone.",
  "Outro:",
  "I'd definately try this combination again, except I'd prefer to have 100ug - 150ug of LSD to replace the 25I-NBOMe, I don't think anything similar will happen soon as I need to think through what I experienced and make sense of it all before I'm ready to visit that place again. Ever since this happened last night my visual snow has been slightly rainbow, and when I close my eyes the colours and visuals everyone can see naturally are easier to make out, and contain traces of the visuals I got from that other world.</p>"
