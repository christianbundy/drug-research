 "report": "<p>I recently discovered that smoking green tea is an effective way to curb the craving for weed. I was surprised that I couldn't find anything online. It may be there but I couldn't find it. A friend recommended it to me. I decided to try it though the smell alone started to make me think twice but to my surprise the smoke was pretty smooth. It's a subtle high but it's just enough to say 'Ok, this feels good.' It's certainly not weed but if you need something to tide you over I 'highly' recommend it. I was satisfied.</p>",
