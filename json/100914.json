 "report": "<p>Mindset: just got off work feeling a bit excited and anxious due to 8 hours of manual labor and recent delivery of RC's.</p><p>Previous drug experience: Alsmost everything, a lot.</p><p>preparation: some mental preparation</p><p>T+0:00</p><p>Insuffilate 10 mg ethylphenidate. Slight burn, not as painful as most reports report.</p><p>T+0:10min</p><p>Slight mood boost, most likely placebo. Drain not too repulsive.</p><p>T+0:20min</p><p>Definate stimulant properties, not unlike methamphetamine.</p><p>T+0:30min</p><p>Stimulation building. Mild euphoria present, building.</p><p>T+0:35min</p><p>Niiiice, excellent body feeling, mental clarity, rush, moderate euphoria.</p><p>T+0:40min</p><p>Inject 10mg. This is when I lose track of time.  I feel wonderful. Very clean stimulant, with quite a bit of euphoria. Mind is calm yet stimulated.  Body rush still going strong.  Slight dehydration present at this time but nothing more than you would expect from a stimulant. Ingest several alcoholic beverages.  Mixing well.</p><p>T+2:00hr</p><p>Still feeling great with a bit of a moreish quality but altogether feeling very good.</p><p>T+3:00hr</p><p>Coming down.  Not bad at all.  Feel slightly dehydrated and wanting more alcohol. Still stimulated.  Altogether a small dose with a very positive reaction.  Lots of euphoria, nice speedy vibe, easy comedown.  Way better than any ritalin experience I've had.  Definatley a novel RC with potential.  risk of abuse yet to be determined :-)</p>",
