 "report": "</p>\nI just wanted to say that I have taken many drug tests in the past while on DXM without a hitch.  When I say 'on DXM', I mean that I had dosed about an hour and a half to two hours before the test.</p><p>I have one of the tests and it said that the following were tested for:</p><p>Cocaine</p><p>Marijuana</p><p>Opiates/Morphine</p><p>Amphetamines</p><p>Methamphetamine</p><p>Phencyclidine</p><p>Benzodiazepine</p><p>Barbituate</p><p>Oxycodone</p><p>Methylenedioxymethamphetamine</p><p>It was a urine test done in a lab.</p><p>Tolerance MAY be an issue.  I had been taking DXM fairly regularly for approximately four years.  DXM is great.  It drains my soul, but it's fun at the time!</p>",
