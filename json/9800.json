 "report": [
  "My psychiatrist had recommended this drug to help me combat my obsessive thoughts. Obsession depression is characterized by obsessive negative thoughts that are at conflict with the persons moral beliefs. I was basically having obsessive thoughts of negative and disgusting things and I was unable to control them. My obsessional depression was triggered by chronic marijuana use (everyday use). I am no longer using marijuania and I feel that the fluvoxamine is helping to control my obsessive negative thoughts."
