  "<p>I intravenously Injected 75mg of diphenhydramine at about 12:30am. I had difficulty finishing the injection due to the rapid effects. I tried to stand to get a cotton ball and throw away the needle, but my coordination was too poor and I almost fell. I lost consciousness about 30-60 seconds after the drug was administered. I awoke abruptly at 4:00am still feeling quite sedated. I tried to move around but felt very sedated and disconnected. I drank a glass of water and fell back asleep. The next morning's after effects almost none. ",
  "Other than the novelty of losing a few hours, it wasn't really a recreational experience.</p>"
