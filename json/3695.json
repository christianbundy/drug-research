 "report": [
  "A friend and I split 60mgs of 2C-C, measured with a scale readble to 1mg. We gel capped the amount and swallowed the capsule.",
  "At about T+0:45 I noticed a wave of euphoria rush over my body, reminiscent of the onset of MDMA, at about half the intensity level. This was followed by a comfortable light headedness and visuals similar to the breathing and crawling visuals associated with LSD.",
  "There was a definitive peak at about T+2:30, and the effects seemed to last until about T+5:30 followed by a general body fatigue, but no pain or disorientation was associated with the comedown. There was noticeable pupil dilation, but outside of the obvious physical effect this chemical seem to be one that could be ingested in a casual social setting; where you could keep your head yet still be immersed in a vividly different state of consciousness."
