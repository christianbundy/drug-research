 "report": "<p>At first I was pretty excited about 2ct7 but after trying it twice once at 19 and once at 22mgs all I can say is that it was VERY lame for me. In fact the first time I just went to sleep after waiting nearly 4 hours for any effect besides a tightening in the head. The second experience was earlier in the morning on an empty stomach w/ 22mgs and was also disappointing. After 2 hours or so I noticed a light enhancement around and glossiness but besides that no visuals. I also felt cold and my head was tight and zombie like similar to when I take dayquil or something and am sick. Dont get me wrong this drug may be great but next time I am going to have to go for a larger dose or combine w/ some other drug.</p>",
