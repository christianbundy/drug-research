We went around the side of town and country and drank it all in 1 gulp.</p><p>(8:00)no significant effect on the ride home, a little more energetic then usual.</p><p>(8:30)change of mind state everything seems to be shifting.</p><p>(9:00)weird feeling in our stomachs.</p><p>(9:30)strung out all over the small room.</p><p>(10:00)when we lay down it feels like an intense rush like were in a race car.</p><p>(10:30)feeling nausious and a little buzzed.</p><p>(11:00)coming down is like hell.</p><p>(11:30)feeling tired my bro is on the computer.</p><p>(12:00)I feel like I'm dead</p><p>(11:00am)a bad hangover</p><p>All together it was fun and a good party drug with some not so fun side effects.
