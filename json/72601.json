 "report": "<p>T:0</p><p>mCPP down the hatch... bad taste... almost sour and bitter at the same time. Not bad if mixed with Gatorade.</p><p>T:15</p><p>Light nausea onset, not unbearable but uncomfortable. Pupils beginning to dilate. Everything seems bright.</p><p>T:30</p><p>Strong nausea, vomiting. There goes a good lunch.</p><p>T:40</p><p>Hunched over the toilet vomiting again.</p><p>T:60</p><p>Nausea has completely subsided and now I am beginning to finally enjoy the experience.</p><p>T:80</p><p>Pupils highly dilated. Everything seems to be moving slightly. The farther away the object of focus the greater the movement. Looking outside provides an almost earthquake like feeling. A mild paranoia is also beginning to set in. It feels like someone is in the room with me when no one actually is.</p><p>T:100</p><p>Earlier regrets and feelings of why did I do this have completely gone out the window. It feels great. I feel happy without a care in the world. Its incredible.</p><p>T: 2 hrs</p><p>Beginning to worry as I have to be at work in 30 minutes and I have still not come down. Paranoia greatly increased by this worry. Still feeling good over this worry/paranoia.</p><p>T: 2hr15min</p><p>Time to head to work and still flying. Everything outside looks amazing as I walk through the grass, looking down into the grass, everything seems to become greener as I progress, eventually becoming a glowing neon green. 2 cigarettes help to ease any worry about going into work.</p><p>T: 2hr30min</p><p>Arrive at work. To my surprise the only symptom that I am unable to control is the incredible dilation of my eyes and some occasional jitters. Other than that work actually became quite enjoyable in this state (by saying this I do not recommend that anyone goes into work after taking mCPP or any other drug, ultimately I regret doing it).</p><p>T:3hr30min</p><p>Finally coming down. Euphoria less noticeable. Mild headache coming on.</p><p>T:4hr</p><p>Effects of drug, other than eye dilation, have all but disappeared. Headache strengthening.</p><p>T:5hr</p><p>Eyes back to normal. Headache almost unbearable. A few advil taken to ease the headache. After I got past the initial nausea it is all worth it.</p>",
