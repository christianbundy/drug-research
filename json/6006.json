 "report": [
  "   When vacationing with my family in West Virginia.  I waited till everyone was asleep and ventured from the cabin down the mountain to the lake.  I set myself on the steep beach of rocks and clay. And lit up.  About halfway through the makeshift joint, I became aware of nature's music.  Crickets and cicadas singing.  It was so beautiful.  Why did they sing? To attract mates and propigate their species.  Mother nature at her finest. ",
  "It was time for me to embark on a quest.  Looking up at the full moon and stars, I realized for these few hours I would be one with nature, looking",
  "through the eyes of our ancestors viewing the calm, peaceful lake knowing in 8 or 9 hours I would strap on planks to my feet and ride above the waterline, courtesy of the combustion engine of my family's motorboat.  I went on a quest.  I walked down the steep beach of the lake towards the moonlight.  I saw things and heard things I cannot explain. ",
  "I was no longer a part of the physical world. I moved on to the spiritual plane, where time and consequence held no meaning.  I was visted by euphoria. It was then I decided to cultivate the seed.  Two years later",
  "I started a closet garden."
