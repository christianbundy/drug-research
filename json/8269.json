  "Took the compound at 10:30am",
  "11:00am - 12:00pm going up!",
  "12:00pm - 2:pm peaked",
  "5:00pm - back to absolute baseline",
  "The come on was incredible: very euphoric. I was very suprised when, at T+2 hours, I began peaking much harder than I expected. Everything about this compound was more than I expected. I believe I went into it cross-comparing it to 4-ACO-DiPT.",
  "Medium in the visual department: lots of breathing, colors where incredible; music was ORGASMIC and like its DiPT cousin, narrated everything. Medium to strong psychedelics. All in all, it just felt really damn good.",
  "Very clean, not as clear as LSD but felt better IMO. Strangely, as the effects wore off, my field of vision went hay-wire: I was watching a movie and the TV would not stay still. Everything was moving wildly (slightly scary) and very DMT like. This only lasted for about 15 minutes and then the poof: it was done."
