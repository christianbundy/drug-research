  "Trip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, ~10mg",
  "insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots",
  "of psychedelic experience.",
  "Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always",
  "trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.",
  "Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in",
  "a great trip, but the route which I took was quite",
  "reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals",
  "unless you have a scale that can measure the usually",
  "very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a",
  "very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT",
  "and I decided it was a must-try!",
  "At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty",
  "milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of",
  "powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this",
  "opportunity again to warn that these small amounts",
  "really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,",
  "I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into",
  "what I 'thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small",
  "lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would",
  "not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this",
  "was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The",
  "powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount",
  "of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.",
  "I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour",
  "after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for",
  "one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset",
  "to this.  There was little nausea, just barely",
  "perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.",
  "I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated",
  "the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if",
  "you redose on this chemical, the literature says you",
  "have to take more, but I think that up the nose results",
  "in a faster onset and better bioavailibility. ",
  "At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of",
  "low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright,",
  "colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what",
  "one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,",
  "morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The",
  "colors were really something, it was a continually",
  " shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site",
  "cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could",
  "not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of",
  "the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,",
  "but overall I was very much in control at all times.",
  "I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso",
  "with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have",
  "something to do with the amount of control I maintained.",
  "The visual distortions were really something else, fully",
  "3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects",
  "swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared",
  "intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it",
  "turn into flowing sand dunes! ",
  "At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the",
  "effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started",
  "to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the",
  "body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,",
  "like near my belly button for some reason.  That was",
  "the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all",
  "over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen.",
  "At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong",
  "had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the",
  "kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips",
  "along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and",
  "devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and",
  "got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of",
  "fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this",
  "healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten,",
  "although maybe the majority of fruit contributed",
  "something to my cramp, who knows. ",
  "At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting",
  "mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was",
  "sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't",
  "need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,",
  "and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only",
  "night lumination coming through my shaded windows were",
  "very cool, with my shadows 'freezing' in my line of",
  "sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to",
  "appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I",
  "fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of",
  "my alarm clock.",
  "It's now almost two the day after,",
  "and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy.",
  "Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this",
  "substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally",
  "bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,",
  "a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to",
  "say how much I took, although in my research I see",
  "that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and",
  "at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable",
  "trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my",
  "first real experience with a research chemical, and I",
  "must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off",
  "to our country's chemists, always preparing new and",
  "exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration",
  "of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and",
  "say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see",
  "more work done on this and other chemicals so that they",
  "are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be",
  "'reasearched.'"
