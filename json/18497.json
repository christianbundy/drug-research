 "report": [
  "This is what I've written down of an experience that a friend of mine had and told me about:",
  "Background: Male, mid twenties. Extensive experience with a wide variety of mind altering substances. Earlier the same day 1 mg of his prescribed clonazepam and his daily kratom dose was ingested, reportedly not to get high but to keep him from getting sick. This may have dulled his experience.",
  "Mindset: In a normal neutral mood. Hanging out at home, listening to music and chatting with friends on the internet.",
  "T+0:00 250 mg dimethocaine insufflated. Gentle with no burn at all.",
  "T+0:10 Numbing of the face and a slight euphoria beginning to build up. Light soft speediness, unlike the comparatively harsh speediness of amphetamines. Feeling light and talkative and a bit lightheaded actually. Only slight increase in heart rate (maybe + 20 bpm or so) but peripheral vasoconstriction is pronounced rendering hands, feet and foreskin ice cold. No increase in sex drive, but notable shrinkage of external male reproductive organs is present.",
  "T+1:00 Effects beginning to fade. The light euphoria experienced earlier is no longer present but he still feels energetic and in a good mood.",
  "T+1:30 Decides to snort another 100 mg and rectally administer  150 mg.",
  "T+1:45 Feeling a very subtle euphoria coming back from the last refill. Chatting away on the internet with me and reportedly feeling good. Nothing like the real South American thing thou. More of a background feelgood. Got up from the computer to get his phone and felt his heart rate increase fast. Nothing bad and he's back to the previous slight increased rate within a minute.",
  "T+2:15 Basically back to baseline.",
  "T+2:45 At this point he reports still feeling some residual light stimulation, vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. Mood seem to have gone gently back to normal without any crash.",
  "Summary: Nice experience but really subtle. Therefor not really worth it considering the high price at the moment (around 20 per gram from RC vendors in Europe), unless you have a lot of money to spend on novelty drugs that is."
