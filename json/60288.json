 "report": "<p>First let me start out that i'm a 22yo wm with hx of major depression coupled with a mix of antisocial/borderline personality disorders. I was first diagnosed with these things when I was 20, now i'm two years older and I probably owe my life to that miracle drug.</p><p>To anyone who likes to take pharms for their highs...Seroquel is not for them, lol, it'll knock them on their ass, that is, unless they like the drowsy, lightheaded-until-you-pass-out, antipsychotic that it is.</p><p>Anyways, I used to have lots of problems...I was a serial monogamist, err, meaning I hooked up a lot and then dumped them shortly after getting what I wanted, which was pretty much only sex. Man I was so smooth too, lol. My parents owned a few businesses so I had plenty of cash to spend, so I could pretty much get whoever I wanted. I remember being called an 'asshole,' I guess that pretty much described me at the time.</p><p>After talking to a psychiatrist about some depression I was going through she Dx'd me with a personality disorder plus major depression and we started going through all kinds of drugs trying to find the right one. After a few months we started on Seroquel, first at a low dose like the manufacturer and USP says to, and then going up to around 250-350mg a day with about 1/3 of it taken during the day and 2/3 of it at night. This drug absolutely saved my life, with all the self destructive behavior I was going through and the endless abyss of depression I had, I'd be dead by now, if not for the drug.</p><p>Yeah it did kinda fuck with my head the first few weeks, but after a few months it wore off -- I took it it all the time -- and you felt pretty damned good...not in a manic way, but a good way, kinda like I was Jesus Jones...except I condemn religion in my apartment lol. But yeah, anyone out there who is really depressed like I was/am, might want to talk to their doctor about getting on Seroquel, plus an anti-depressant for good measure like effexor or duloxetene.</p><p>Anyways right now, I haven't hooked up in six months or more because well really I don't feel the need to go and use someone just for a night and then ruin their feelings like I used to love doing. Plus I'm comfortable about myself enough to start taking over my families business. I'd call myself a success on Seroquel.</p><p>Oh, big plus: At least for me, it seems Seroquel gives a big plus to my sex life... makes it, uh, more fun, heh. Anyways, for me.</p><p>Later,</p><p>Rooboy</p>",
