 "report": [
  "My grandmother gave me some Tylenol 3s and I heard about how much fun they could be. Unfortunately, tylenol tends to upset my stomach, so I went about extracting the codeine by way of a method I found online of dissolving crushed tablets in warm water and then cooling the water, filtering and drinking it.",
  "I dissolved 11 tablets each containing 8mg of codeine. Unfortunately, after I cooled the solution in the freezer, I set the cup on the counter and went to get the coffee filters off of the fridge and knocked down a box full of top ramen on top of it and spilled it all over the counter. After a few minutes of cussing and screaming I told myself it was no big deal because it's just a stupid fun drug that I got for free.",
  "So I soaked up what solution I could from the counter with napkins and wrang them out into the cup. Surprisingly, I had not lost much of the extract at all, so I added a few drops of lemon juice concentrate, swigged it down, and sat down with my guitar to play along with Pearl Jam's new live album... This was about ten minutes ago.",
  "20 minutes: My stomach feels a little tight and I'm getting a warm feeling coming up over my shoulder. I think it's working!",
  "40 minutes: I'm feeling warm and hazy. I think this will be the extent of it. My stomach is a little uncomfortable but not so much that it's ruining my mood.",
  "50 minutes: I'm still coming up, surprisingly. I feel a little slow, a little groggy. Music sounds real nice. I'm having trouble keeping my eyes and thoughts focused. This is really surprising me that it's having this much of an effect on me. I haven't had much to eat today and my stomach is growling so I'm gonna go try to make some food.",
  "1 hour 15 minutes: I've peaked. Food tastes delicious-cheese quesadilla with garlic and onion powder sprinkled onto it. The sensation of eating seems to be bringing me up a little more. If I wouldn't have spilled the cup, I'm sure I would be feeling a little more buzzed. Next time I'll have to try 13 pills and be more careful. My breathing has slowed a little. I feel good overall. The food settled my stomach after just a few bites. I'm gonna go lay down and listen to some music now."
