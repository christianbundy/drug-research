 "report": [
  "My experiences with Salvia have been mostly uneventfull, usually I become prickly, sweaty, and irritated with a subtle but bizarre shift in consciousness that I don't realize has occurred.  Weird stuff to be certain...",
  "Anyhow a very small amount of Salvia 10x extract was placed in a glass pipe, and perhaps 5mg of 5-MeO-DMT was sprinkled atop it.  It was smoked in one hit(which turned out to be almost a lungful) and held in for maybe 30 seconds.",
  " I was swiftly vaulted into the most intensly Cosmic space I've yet experienced.  It felt like I had entered something REALLY big and REALLY universal.  Intense, folding geometry was all that was was of me, and what I saw and I felt I was no longer me but a part of this 'matrix' or whatever it was.  I cannot emphasize enough how intensly weird, alien, and utterly cosmic this felt- like I'd broken some type of rule or had entered ENTIRELY different universes of some type.  I say 'universes' as it seemed everything was splitting of in all directions at the same time, if that makes any sense.  Also, it felt oddly familiar, or that it was a place that was always there and was 'what's really going on' or some such thing...",
  "   I was frightened of course but was so wacked that I hadn't the time to dwell on this fear or allow it to encompass me.  In laymans terms, I was 'completely fucked-up', and by the time I had gotten some sense of bearing and concern about whether or not I'd 'survive' or return to 'normal', I was coming down.",
  "  As soon as I gained a sense of my surroundings and my place in them, I leapt from my bed and paced about the house, amidst intense visual and cosmic activity.  Everything was 'fractalized', intensly psychedelic, and looked *EXTREMELY* futuristic and otherwise astonishing.  I felt I was moving from place to place by will of my 'mind' or 'being' and had no recollection of using my body.  As though I was moving in small quantum jumps, although I was in no way enjoying or noticing it at the time- I was simply reacting.",
  "  Felt like an atom or quark or something zipping around amongst similar such things, a part of the universe described by physics, not the one we humans move about in/experience/have knowledge of in our day to day lives.",
  "I came down very slowly, I assume due to the longer duration of the Salvia, and was in a diminished/ing form of the state for a good hour.  Physically I was uncomfortable and mildly nauseous and was otherwise eager to be free of the effects.",
  "   In summary the experience was neither that enjoyable or that unenjoyable - it was just very very intense and astonishing.  If I had ANY idea that the effects would be so intense maybe I'd could have expected it and enjoyed it more.  Was quite excited and otherwise giddy for a good bit after I came down - that 'holy shit!' type reaction...",
  "Anyhow, quite a ride, and in the future I'm interested in trying the same combo but perhaps using a bit less of of both ;-)"
