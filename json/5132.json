 "report": "<p>I have heard many variations of codeines recreational use and mine follows suit with most of them with a few exceptions.  I have found the water separation method to be quite helpful in the separation of the codeine from other substances and just to aid in the absorption of the drug itself. </p><p>Taking large quantities (over 160mg) of codeine all at once has caused me some pretty intense headaches that are primarily at the back of the neck.  I enjoy taking the codeine dissolved in a small quantity of water.  I usually dissolve about 400mg of codeine in water and drink down a third of the solution and wait for the mellow hum to kick in.  Then every 20-30min take the water equivalent of about, 50mg of the codeine, water solution.  This seems to calm any adverse reaction to the drug and also greatly prolongs the peak from 1 hour to as much as 3 hours or in my case a whole day (with additional batches).  If youre ever in the mood to just mellow and zone, with out doing a lot of anything else, this is the way to go!</p>",
