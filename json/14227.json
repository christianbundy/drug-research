 "report": [
  "I've tried insufflating MPA for help on my studies, but it didn't produce any noticable good effects, all I experienced was chest tightness and a need to redose.",
  "I've read that by plugging MPA, you get better effects, so I disolated about 35mg in 10ml of luke water and administered it to myself. I watched an episode while I waited lying in bed on my belly.",
  "20 min later mild effects were noticable, talkativeness, mild euphoria, I felt energized and not sleepy anymore.",
  "This lasted for about 2 hours, I didn't redose, even tho I wanted.",
  "In conclusion I would say that sniffing methiopropamine is kind of a waste, if you have the ability to plug it, try doing that instead.",
  "I wanted to forget about that bag of mpa, but apparently it will come in handy on sleepy days."
