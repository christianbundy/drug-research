 "report": "<p>I used to think coke was this magical drug that only movie stars could afford and it created feelings of pleasure so intense that it was up there with heroin.  After a few years of trying it I just realise that it is a flat out waste of money.  You are paying a ridiculous price for something that lasts about 30 min, whereas you can pay the same amount and get enough tweak to last for days. </p><p>I dont see why people will say they hate tweak (amphetamines) and love coke, the high is almost identical!  Imagine snorting 4 lines and feeling like that for 6-8 hours!</p><p>It's alright on very rare occasions, or if you just have a lot of money to waste.. It makes you feel like a champ, but why not pay the same price for something that will last 16x as long?</p>",
