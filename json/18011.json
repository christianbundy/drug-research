 "report": [
  "I was prescribed mirtazapine for some time to help with insomnia and seemed to work well at first. About a month into taking the med I started having bad dreams, very real feeling. I would wake up in different positions every day, positions I have never woken up in before. I would wake up with bruises and scratches all over me and it would take forever to get awake.",
  "I had a family member pull an 'all nighter' to see what I do when I take the medication. They said I tossed and turned and yelled in my sleep (not normal for me) and when they tried to wake me up I was very combative. It's the most disliked drug I have ever tried."
