 "report": "<p>Around two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the 'green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc... I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a 'thujone' high.</p><p>(first time)</p><p>I did the 'thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.</p><p>- didn't really feel anything.</p><p>(second time)</p><p>I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.</p><p>- no effect whatsoever</p><p>(third time)</p><p>This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.</p><p>I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.</p><p>T+0:00</p><p>I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable</p><p>T+0:05</p><p>stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.</p><p>T+0:07</p><p>I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.</p><p>T+0:15</p><p>I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.</p><p>T+0:25</p><p>I feel normal again.</p><p>My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled.</p>",
