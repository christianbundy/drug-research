 "report": [
  "I realize how dumb it was to ingest this much DXM. I was 16 and scored 14 grams of pure DXM powder and was doing it pretty much daily, adding more and more each time. One night I decided I was going to the 4th plateau so I weighed out 2 grams of it and put it in a piece of toilet paper and washed it down with some iced tea.",
  "The next thing I no I'm in a hospital bed with restraints on me and cops everywhere. Apparently I was found in the road unable to walk so they called an ambulance and when I got to the hospital I was being violent and aggressive pulling out my IV and ALMOST ripping out my catheter and lurching out at the cops around me and shit.",
  "I tested positive for PCP and Opiates, neither of which I knowingly ingested so I wonder was this a false positive or just an impurity either way it was hard to explain that I ingested a legal substance."
