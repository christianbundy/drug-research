  "I too tried Butanediol.  While I enjoyed the nodding off sort of high it gave me (kind of reminded me of opiates), I didn't enjoy what happened when I finished my bottle. I had been hitting it daily until the bottle ran out.  I was fine for a day, then I started feeling 'shaky' and developed vertigo (room spinning) so badly I had to hold onto the walls at work.  I actually threw up from the vertigo.  I also developed this nasty sweat on my feet, and my palms and hair also felt sweaty.  I also felt that my neck was stiff and achy. This went on for a day or so, then passed.  I won't be doing it again.  Who knows what's in the industrial chemical version of the stuff which is being sold as printer cleaner, floor cleaner, etc..."
