  "Neutral Mindset, these are the only drugs I take.",
  "Today I plan to use a bit of my focalin which always has some intense after effects to go along with it's superiority of other ADHD & ADD medications (At least I think so). I will use clonidine to battle this after having no luck obtaining benzodiazepines from a Doctor, and over the counter remedies not working i.e. benadryl, melatonin, or valerian.",
  "The Experience",
  "0:00- 20 mg Focalin was taken by grinding and snorting, great euporia, and  a real good time. I enjoy playing guitar while I am under the influence of this Drug. I don't know if it is a result of my confidence being boosted but I might actually be better at playing.",
  "0:30- Effects still linger, but most desirable effects nearly gone without any negative effects yet experienced, due to a normal sized dosage.",
  "0:45- All effects gone, feeling a bit restless. Time for some more. 20 mg again snorted, same type of experience.",
  "1:30- Had enough for tonight, a bit anxious, very restless, no chance of hunger or sleep.",
  "1:35- .3mgs clonidine taken orally with water. 3x the recomended minimum dose by my doctor, but I can take as needed for maximum without exceeding 10, .1mg pills.",
  "2:00- Not doing much for my insomnia .3mgs more taken. I should have waited longer but I want to get rest.",
  "2:30- Quite tired but a bit of racing thoughts, very impressed with how it removed anxiety and paranoia. 0.3mgs taken to stay asleep. asleep by 2:45.",
  "Next day 9:00- Not any real hangover effects worth noting.",
  "This drug worked exceptionally considering the lack of alternatives.  Hope this helps!"
