 "report": [
  "I quit smoking weed a while back because I was smoking heavily and trafficing too much each day, over $150 most days.  I do smoke occasionally because I like the feeling of a good buzz.",
  "I recently purchased a bag of certified organic catnip for my pets, two very hyper cats.  I had heard on several occassions that you could smoke catnip to get high, so I decided that since its a legal high I would give it a try. At first I smoke two bowls in my pipe, which gave me an alright buzz.  But then I had a brainstorm, I decided to try smoking from a gravity bong.  I packed a full bowl in my gravity bong and took a massive hit.  Its actually a good high, its a quite effective substitute for weed.",
  "The feeling itself is somewhat euphoric, a relaxed kind of high.  Its rather enjoyable, definately more so than I first thought it would be.  The smell and taste are similar to weed, and the high is only minutely weaker when smoked through the gravity bong."
