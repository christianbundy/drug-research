 "report": "<p>Seroquel is prescribed for schizophrenia and other similar personality disorders. I myself am prescribed Seroquel and Effexor for Major Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder.....I'm also diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder, but thats besides the point. Anyways, the maximum daily dosage is 800mg, but the usual dosage is between 100mg and 600mg. I, myself, take 300mg nightly right before bed. Seroquel is in the antipsychotic class of drugs and it is HIGHLY sedative. I have been taking it well over a year now and it still knocks me out.</p><p>Seroquel does NOT make me high or even give me a slight euphoria. BUT, if I want to sleep, Seroquel is just what the doctor ordered. It will knock me the fuck out, and it will give me very vivid dreams that I can recall with great precision in the morning and throughout the day. DON'T take Seroquel and drive, or mix with alcohol or any other sedative drugs, unless you have a death wish. I have high tolerance for drugs, legal and illegal, but I do not underestimate Seroquel.</p>",
