 "report": [
  "Because of the fact that nutmeg accumulates in your system and lasts for over a day, it is possible to gradually work up to a high of whatever level you find enjoyable over the course of several days, by taking small doses every day.",
  "I did this one week, taking about a teaspoon a day, in eggnog, or sprinkled on tea.   By about the 4th day, I felt like I was in a dream, comfortably numb, colors seemed brighter, and my eyes were red as heck... but everything just looked strange, like I was viewing it in a mirror. ",
  "But because I didn't take a large dose all at once like most people seem to, I never felt uncomfortable or sick at any point, and I was able to function in my day to day life, including at work."
