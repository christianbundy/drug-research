 "report": "<p>Lavender is a wonderful herb to smoke. It leaves me with a pleasant lavender taste and smell, it is also very easy on the lungs. I make sure to always mix lavender in with my weed and the two go great together. It completely smooths the smoke and prevents any coughing from large bowls.</p><p>Taking 3 bowls of only lavender I started to feel somewhat more relaxed and calm. I also felt some heaviness in my body. The effects were relatively quick to dissipate however, I'd say they only lasted from 5-10 minutes.</p>",
