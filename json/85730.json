 "report": "<p>I take 30 mg of dextroamphetamine daily for ADHD. I found that taking 20 mg of memantine (I started at 5 mg and slowly moved up) substantially reduced my tolerance to amphetamine.  It does blunt the peak a little bit, but it also stretches out each dose so it lasts longer-- useful for ADHD, somewhat undesirable for recreational use. Over time my tolerance to amphetamine went down to about where it was 2-3 months or so after starting, which is pretty good.</p><p>Also, another weird side effect -- it made me quit smoking cigarettes.  I didn't want to quit, and I still was addicted to nicotine for a few days and craved it, but still I didn't want to smoke, b/c smoking just made me feel horrible.  Very effective, I had tried to quit before so many times -- this time I wasn't even trying, and it actually worked.</p>",
