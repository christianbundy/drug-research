 "report": "<p>Out on the back porch, I had only 2 or 3 hits, before a rush of peace came over me.  I became aware I was getting calmer and calmer.  The world was a okay.  Slightly light headed feeling, euphoric.  Very much in control of myself.  Very unlike alcohol's depressing effects.  No stupor or slurred speech, or motor movement interference.  Not habit forming, but simply pleasant.  My dreams that night were vivid and intense.  Nothing scary, just easier to control and remember.</p>",
