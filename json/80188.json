 "report": "<p>I suffer from clinically diagnosed GAD, Major Depressive Disorder, and PTSD.  I have tried many, many, many medications over the years to help.  Most don't work at all, or work too well.  Some work fine for a while, then stop working after 3 months or so.</p><p>My doctor prescribed the mirtazapine at the beginning of the year.  It is, thus far, the best medication I have had.  It helps with the depression while allowing me to feel a full range of emotions.  Taken at bedtime, it also helps me sleep, which is important because I have been a chronic insomnia sufferer.</p>",
