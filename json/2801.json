  "I must say that I have noticed some definite negative effects from long term GHB use (every day, 2-5 times a day). I have noticed the same cardiac problems that have been reported in a couple of post previous to mine. Basically, I would attribute it to similar effects of angina. Also, I have noticed a major increase in blood pressure and heart rate with continued repeated dosing. It is sort of scary, and as a result I have cut my use of the drug way way back. I never had problems with low level use, but when it is abused like I have abused it, it will cause problems. Be careful yall."
