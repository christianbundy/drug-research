  "for approx 3 months time now.",
  "For lack of better control mechanisms, I have been using several software packages, including a database of several old GMAT CAT examinations(THE GMAT Verbal section is gerenally regarded as a measure of intellectual ability), and a memory recall speed and efficiency package.",
  "Here is a breakdown of the percentage change in scores I have experienced",
  "Day 0 - 0% Baseline established",
  "Day 7 - 3% decrease from baseline in GMAT verbal, 2% increase in memory recall speed, 5% increase in memory efficiency",
  "Day 30 - 5% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 4% increase in memory recall speed, 10% increase in memory efficiency/accuracy",
  "Day 60 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 1% decrease in memory recall speed, 8% increase in memory recall efficiency",
  "Day 90 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 19% increase in memory recall speed, 14% increase in memory recall efficiency.",
  "Granted this is not a very good indication of what effects the drugs actually have, as I am just one person, and I have emotional, occupational, and other factors effecting my life, and hence, my test performance, but I thought that the data I collected may assist others considering a regimen of smart drugs. I will update things in a few more months.</p>"
