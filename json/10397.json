 "report": [
  "Ive always gone to school high or drunk on different substances, but Im going to tell you about my day at school on tramadol. I had six 50 mg pills (300 mg).",
  "7:15 Am - Take 5 of the pills",
  "7:20 Am - Arrive at school",
  "8:00 Am - I start to get spacey, still feel pretty normal though",
  "8:30 Am - I can feel a definite change as the pills start to kick in more. At this point I have an overall sense of well being. I decide to take the last pill for the hell of it.",
  "9:00 Am - More of the body high kicks in, theres an overall euphoric feeling and it feels kind of like Im floating.",
  "9:30 Am - This is a period change and when I walked through the halls with the crowd of people they were all pretty much a blur. Of course I had some techno in my headphones to go along with it.",
  "9:30-11:30 Am - just a great feeling most similar to hydrocodone, the high peaked in this time and my vision started to get blurry and slow. Tramadol great for school because I can act pretty normal when needed but all I have to do is close your eyes for a second and Ill be on another planet.",
  "11:30-12:30 - I can feel the high lessening and I start to get a little drowsy but in a dreamlike state, vision still blurred.",
  "12:30 - 2:00 PM - The comedown wasnt hard or anything left me feeling kind of refreshed which is awkward but hey who knows...",
  "The rest of the day I could feel a small buzz from it. I even had a short conversation with the assistant principal and he thought I was a polite young man, ha."
