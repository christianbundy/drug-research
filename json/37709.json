 "report": "<p>I used Blue Lotus (Nymphaea Caerulea) several times. To me, it must be mixed with alcohol to give its full effects. I tried to boil teas, to smoke it (a waste, though it produces some effect), but my favorite preparation is to put 2 big tablespoons of crushed flowers in a bottle of wine. I let it sit for a week MINIMUM (and not on the eve for the next day). If I let it sit just for 1 or 2 days, the taste is milder, but I don't extract all the active products.</p><p>I drink half a bottle of the mixture. Once I had drunk a full one, but it didn't give twice the effects (except for the alcohol part). I also smoke 2 or 3 little weed joints during the evening.</p><p>The effects have something common with opiates. It gives me a feeling of universal love and a nice good heat. The alcohol wears off after 2 or 3 hours but the blue lotus effects last all the evening and a part of the next day (but milder). I dont take lotus more than once a week, but even like this, there seems to be a light tolerance.</p><p>The next day, a light hangover and some irritability takes place in the afternoon. 2 days later, I experience some depression in the morning. If I think about Lotus, I want to take some. All this fades in the following days.</p><p>It happens this way every time. The effects are coming up slowly and long lasting;  the aftereffects work the same way. I think that Blue Lotus is habit forming. I don't agree with reports which state  that tolerance is short lived and that there are no aftereffects. All this is manageable and there are a lot of more dangerous drugs, but my advice is to be careful.</p>",
