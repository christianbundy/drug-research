 "report": "<p>I am a seasoned tripper who has eaten shrooms several times a year for quite a few years now. Recently, I was perscribed Celexa (citalopram) for depression. I also take Abilify (a mood stabilizer). While taking only abilify, I would dose my usual 5 grams of shrooms (dry) with no diminished effects. When taking celexa however, I noticed a significant decrease in the mushroom's effects.</p><p>Last time I dosed I had been taking celexa daily for about 6 weeks and noticed an overall decrease in the trip. Nearly no visuals were noted, and this has been consistent ever since I started taking celexa. I am considering getting off this medication since I really miss my trips which result in a mood lift lasting days after the 'official' trip ended.</p><p>Judging by my experience, SSRI's definitely seem to interfere with much of the shroom's potency. Every 'test batch' of shrooms was freshly grown and expertly dried, so it must be the SSRI's influence.</p>",
