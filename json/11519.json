  "I looked around this site for sleep aids. I came across Melatonin, having tried everything else; I figured I would give it a go. I walked down to the store and picked up a bottle for 12 dollars. I took six 3mg pills last night; just to clarify, I am an insomniac. I still havent fallen asleep. I have a natural high tolerance to everything, so it could just be me. It was a waste of money. It had absolutely no effect on me."
