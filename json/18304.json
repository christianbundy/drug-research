 "report": [
  "This was a dumb idea.  150mg was way too much.",
  "Took 2 75mg pills at around 1:30am.  My effects were in line with most amphetamine usage.  I was talking rather quickly, and for some reason awesome at programming embedded C (had to for class the next day).  Strong desire for menthol cigarettes, though I don't generally smoke. ",
  "I started speeding pretty hard at about 4am.  Could feel my heart almost jumping out of my chest, shaking vision, heavy breathing, numbness in my hands and arms making it a bit difficult to type.  I would have trouble typing words while talking online, but not normal typos.  I would reverse syllables and odd stuff.  Can't remember that too well.",
  "It kept me up through the night and all the next day, until about 7pm or so when I took a five hour nap.",
  "I have a headache today, but not a horrible one.",
  "Generally, though I absolutely loved it at the time, I wouldn't do it again because, in the piercing light of sobriety, it wasn't worth it.  Haven't done any other versions of amphetamine so I can't compare this time release with anything else.",
  "On a brighter note, my code worked."
