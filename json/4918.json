 "report": [
  "After a period of approximately five months taking celexa for social and generalised anxiety disorder, I started to notice that the effects, particularly those concerned with tackling my anxiety disorders gradually started to taper away. Thus making me feel more anxious and self-concious.",
  "My doctor told me this effect is known to occur after a long bout of treatment with celexa, so naturally put me on lexapro which has a similar side effect profile and appears to be of particular benefit to people with anxiety disorders. Because the transition to escitalopram from citalopram was instant, I could feel a noticeable improvement in my symptons by the fourth day (of what is currently a 1 weeks use). I found that my anxiety levels, particularly those concerning my social and general anxiety improved significantly to somewhat about two thirds of what they were before.",
  "The anti-depressant effect seemed to be more prominent on lexapro, in that the 'so what, who cares' mentality seemed to be more noticeable and prominent-when put in comparison to celexa.",
  "I noticed that the side effect profile of celexa and lexapro was pretty similar:- a feeling of wanting to yawn and stretch and a slight distinct 'drugged up' feeling that persists for about a couple of hours. But on the whole, the side effects in my case were easily bearable.",
  "Overall, I feel that lexapro seems to be working well (takes about 3-4 weeks for the full apparent anxiolytic, anti-depressant effect), but it remains to be seen my depression and related anxieties are reduced to an acceptable level."
