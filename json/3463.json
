 "report": "<p>\nIt all began about 11:00 at night, I had just got back from Wal-Mart with my friend, we were ready to extract some hydrocodone. I had 14 10 milligram Watson hydrocodone pills. (Watson is a generic brand of pharmacueticals). If we had ate 7 a piece, we wouldve been f**ked for sure due to acetamineophen, so I extracted them using the extraction method described in the codeine FAQ.  It took about 2 hours to fully extract, but it was worth it.</p><p>12:30</p><p>My friend and I take turns taking swigs of the solution, we get about 3 swigs a piece, I guess we got an even dose, I think we did anyway. I figured we lost some hydrocodone in the extraction, so I didn't know what was gonna happen.</p><p>12:40</p><p>We smoke a bowl of marijuana out of a homemade bong. Then, I get out my glass pipe and we smoke 2 more bowls.</p><p>12:55</p><p>I start spinning very fast, the buzz is like being very very drunk and floating at the same time. I am sure that I am going to puke, I run to the bathroom, but I don't puke and I feel better within seconds.</p><p>1:10</p><p>My friend and I walk upstairs to his room, I can't walk straight. I feel some nausea, so I lay down, we turn on Dark Side of the Mood by Pink Floyd and start to drift away. My friend chats on the computer most of the night</p><p>Heres what the buzz is like:</p><p>Emmense physical and mental high. Feels like I am floating.</p><p>Some nausea, but I am laying down, and it goes away while I am.</p><p>Music is the greatest thing, I start drifting away to the cd and snap back into reality after a while.</p><p>It's very hard for me to keep my eyes open.</p><p>Euphoria is intense and great.</p><p>I have lost all track of time.</p><p>3:00? (I am not sure cause time went so fast)</p><p>I suddenly feel like a hole has been torn in my buzz, I am still high as hell, but I figure that the weed has worn off.</p><p>So, I smoke 2 more bowls with my friend and lay back down, the weed replenishes my buzz and it's just as good as before.</p><p>5:00</p><p>My friend hits the sack, both of us still high as hell, we probably didn't actually get to sleep until about 5:30, but I didn't want to sleep.</p><p>7:00</p><p>We are woke up by my friends grandma, my friend is supposed to go somewhere, but he fakes sick and gets to stay home. We are both still very high, I try not to go back to sleep, but I do.</p><p>11:00</p><p>I wake up with a slight hangover, nothing compared to a night of beer drinking though. I do not feel sick at all, just a bit hungry and very thirsty.</p><p>I recommend hydrocodone to anyone, but extract it!</p><p>If you don't extract it, you are heading towards a night in the hospital.</p>",
