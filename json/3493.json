  "I've tried nutmeg once, years ago. Clueless as to how much my friend and I took, but we tried it with everything; water, milk, soda, straight, and it tastes like shit no matter how you take it. Afterward...nothing. The night went by and nothing happened. However, when I woke up in the morning, the walls were breathing for several minutes. My friend reported spider webs covering the floor of the classroom he was in. Other than that...nothing.",
  "My two cents...it's not worth it."
