 "report": "<p>I'm not noo (Ok, bad joke) to nootropics.  But this just did not come out well.  Literally!!  I work the 3rd shift, so anything that will keep me alert and focused is an absolute plus.   But it's hard to stay alert when you've got a bunch of screamin' meanies making a beeline for your back door.  I know, I know...ick!</p><p>I usually head to work around 9p (I work until 7a) so I popped a  dose 2 - 100 mcg pills around 8pmish.  Everything as fine until around midnight.  Then the cramps started.  And NO before you ask, it wasn't something I ate.  Just a baked potato like I always eat, day in, day out (boring, I know--I'm on a diet). Then Hupie began to work her magic on my bowels and they were making more noise than a porn star in a climax scene - assuming its a bondage flick.   They growled and snarled, boiled and bubbled and reminded me of why its important to study the detrimental effect of cow farts on the atmosphere!!</p><p>That said, I was too distracted by the fact that I was hunched over the toilet most of the night to notice if it made me any smarter or more focused. So, if youve got stainless steel bowels that can withstand a nuclear attack, you might have better luck than I did.  But if not, Id stay away.  Your rear end will thank you!!</p>",
