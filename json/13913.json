 "report": [
  "I decided to make my own smoke blend and infused 1g of AM-2201 with ~30g of damiana. I started dosing by smoking ~30mg and worked up from there. I read AM-2201 has a longer duration than THC but from my experiences this was only true the very first couple tries. After that I felt the intoxication fading faster than THC possibly because of its effects curve. It definitely kicks in faster than THC but who needs that? THC kicks in within 5 minutes anyway. After the rapid comeup, AM-2201 immediately began to fade unlike THC which has a more bell-shaped effects curve.",
  "I only spent ~$65 for 30g of smoke so it's much cheaper than cannabis. The smoke is slightly harsher though. I have mixed THC with AM-2201 with no additional side effects noted."
