  "My daughter has had 2 urine drug tests comes back positive for PCP when she has never even seen this drug. I have had 1 come back positive. We both had a hair test and saliva test plus a another urine test at the same time come back negative for PCP. These test results affect us as they are ordered from the courts and have to do with my children and whether my oldest has her probation revoked.",
  "We are on prescription meds. I am on Effexor and she is on Lexapro. It finally came out that my Effexor will show as a false positive. I have had to fight in court about my daughter and the Lexapro. The court ordered another hair test as it believed me about false/positives. Her hair test came back all negative to prove that these urine tests were in fact WRONG! Even though Lexapro has not been documented as to show false/positives, I guess you could say in a way it has now?"
