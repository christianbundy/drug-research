 "report": "<p>My girlfriend and I were looking for something to try that would be a little change of pace from the usual pot smoking. I came across 2 small pills with the letter 'G' and a '.' on it.  I'm guessing G-spot? I was told it was MDA and planned a date to take it. </p><p>4:00pm  We ate a light lunch around this time.</p><p>6:00pm  We each took our pill at this time and sat down to find some funny cartoons to put us in a good place while we wait for the onset.</p><p>6:20pm  A little stomach discomfort. I took some Pepto and felt fine in 4-5minutes.</p><p>6:40pm  At this time, we weren't feeling anything yet so we decide to walk outside and smoke a joint to get things moving a bit. Boy, did they.</p><p>6:50pm  After sitting for a while and enjoying nature, I start to hear a pretty loud humming noise that seems to rattle my entire body. It only lasts a few seconds but my partner didn't hear it. I was also feeling very thirsty around this time so i grabbed a bottled water and started drinking. It felt so good, we referred to them as 'heaven water' for the remainder of the evening.</p><p>7:00pm  I definitely feel a body buzz at this point and we decide to go back inside the house. It is at this point that I realize that I am really feeling something. I walk right past my car in the garage and it seems as though we are giants walking around the normal things around my house. </p><p>7:30pm  My girlfriend (we'll call her K) is really feeling it by now. Her pupils are really dilated and she is very giggly and happy. I feel a great body buzz and definite perspective shifting. Mostly I feel a euphoric high at this point. </p><p>7:45pm  We decide making our own pizza would be a good idea even though neither one of us is very hungry. K swirls the pizza sauce with a spoon for a long time and eventually blends it and the cheese together into one big mess. The whole experience was hilarious to both of us. </p><p>8:15pm  K is playing with play-doh and I am watching her. There are blue lights in her hands while she is sculpting...almost like i was seeing the kinetic energy that was creating the different sculptures. I am seeing rays of light, plaid and polka dot patterns and also seeing the room shape change on me while not paying attention.</p><p>8:45pm  At this time we decide to smoke a pipe and see what happens. We end up smoking two. This heightens the intensity of the trip and the feelings of euphoria are coming in waves now. </p><p>9:15pm  We start playing games that we made up together. One thing that has definitely happened to K and not to me on this trip, is that her eyes, along with being hugely dilated, were moving back and forth very quickly. She said that I was just tripping and it wasn't really happening, but I know it was. </p><p>10:15pm  The past hour was sort of a blur including spacing out, listening to music, talking about nonsense, and laughing. We smoked one more bowl at this time because we knew we were coming down. It brought us back up for a while and we sat outside smoking lots of cigarettes. Smoking feels really good.</p><p>11:00pm  We layed down for a while listening to music and it just felt good to hold each other. It didn't take long for that to turn to sex...which was amazing to say the least.  </p><p>12:00am  K falls asleep around this time and I stay awake until about 6:00am just because I felt like watching television and lost track of time. </p><p>11:00am  I woke up with no hangover and just a few lingering effects from the night before. </p><p>In conclusion, this drug was a very pleasant experience for me and my partner. A few disclaimers, however. Make sure you have plenty of water or sports drink handy while doing this drug. I did not get hungry at all, but craved water all night long and the next day. Also, i had some minor jaw clenching so chewing gum helped out a lot with that. Overall a really pleasant, and mild trip. I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind wanting to try something new, and anyone who won't abuse it. Have fun and take care.</p>",
