 "report": [
  "Approximately 2 years ago, I went into the ER with very sharp pain in my lower back and down my left leg and was told I had severe sciatica.  This was extremely painful and I was given some painkillers and told basically I would have this the rest of my life.  This was the beginning of my drug addiction to vicodin.",
  "For a while, I got bye taking just one ES Vicodin for the pain and then was really liking the buzz on it.  Sure vicodin helped my back but the feeling I got warm and fuzzy from it was great too.  Currently my daily usage for vicodin is about 70-80mg and for me that signifies a problem.  Anyways, I heard about a drug called Suboxone that contains buprenorphine (sounds a lot like morphine doesn't it?) that helps people get off of vicodin.  I did research and found a local doctor who specializes in this and saw him today.  I was told to make sure I went into the doctors appointment in withdraws and I didn't take any vicodin for about 48 hrs and was feeling it.  Runny nose, ready to jump out of my skin.....you know the drill.",
  "I was prescribed 8mg of suboxone per day (which is quite expensive without insurance) and went home as quick as I could and slid a pill under my tongue.  Within 40 minutes my withdraw symptoms were completely gone and I was in such a great mood!  I had so much energy BUT this sure did and does feel like being high on a nice dose of vicodin.  I got home and just grabbed the lawnmower and mowed the grass, came inside and said to myself 'now what' with all this energy.  I called my wife (not telling her how high I felt) telling her it's the greatest drug in the world my withdraw symptoms are gone.",
  "I just took another 4mg about 2.5 hours ago and feeling very high.  Hard to concentrate and even type this and have read so much that this doesn't get you high.  A friend said it got him a little high the first time and then just felt normal afterwards so who knows........but right now this is unreal."
