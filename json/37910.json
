 "report": "<p>Background:  Other chemicals experienced include Marijuana, LSD, Cocaine, Rohypnol, DXM, MDMA, and Alcohol.</p><p>Mindset & Setting: Well rested, fairly empty stomach, some muscles were sore from previous days workout.  I was in my apartment with no pressing issues or matters for the rest of the evening.</p><p>Preparation:  A digital scale accurate to .002g was used to weigh out 9mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT encased in a pill sized capsule of ice for rectal administration (this is my preferred method of administration for MDMA).  Subsequent dose of 8mg was placed into a gel cap for oral administration.  Final dose of 15mg was wrapped in a VERY small corner of tissue for oral administration.</p><p>Experience: </p><p>7:50pm  9mg administered rectal,  30mg Grape Seed Extract (anti-oxidant) administered oral</p><p>8:08pm  anticipation, but no effects</p><p>8:18pm  some sensation of warmth, slight trouble with concentration, slight GI nuances, slight leg buzzing.</p><p>8:30pm  slightly less of what was above, starting to think some of it may have been placebo affect, no pupil dilation.</p><p>8:50pm  8mg administered oral via gel cap with sips of cola.</p><p>9:03pm  no change.</p><p>9:08pm  slight stomach queasiness.</p><p>9:35pm  15mg administered oral in tissue with sips of cola.  No change.  Left the apartment to get a massage.</p><p>10:30pm- have a feeling of fuzziness, like there is a cloudy separation between my mental being and my physical being.  My body, actions and voice at times seem to be one foot away from me.  I had sex twice, but it was not all that enjoyable, as this also felt like it was happening distant from me.  There is no effect on any of my 5 senses, and besides the fuzziness, none on my mental state either.  Body felt a little warn out and distant from me.</p><p>12:47pm  went to bed, ability to sleep was no different than normal.</p><p>Summary:  I had very minor effects from what is typically considered a moderate dose.  Nothing was felt or experienced that I would consider pleasurable or interesting.  Body felt tired, fuzzy, and distant, with no changes in any of the 5 senses.  The best way I could describe it would be the way I feel after an experience on MDMA or LSD.  Kind of drained and out of it.</p><p>I dont have much desire to try it again, but may give it one more shot at a single dose of around 30-35mg.</p>",
