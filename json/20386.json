  "So I'd like to start off saying that before I did this trip I was already a little bit familiar with how trips work(LSD 2 times before). The last time I took LSD was about 2 months before this. I received a sample of 25c-NBOMe from a vendor off of the big Silk Road and was extremely curious as to how it would work. I should let you know that I did this trip with my buddy Ryan(who had never tripped before) and hoped it would be a good first trip for him. Oh it definitely was.",
  "So on a Friday after school he and I decided to take 1800 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe for the first time. We usually go to our own houses for about 30 mins each day after school and take shits/eat and what not. We put them in our mouths at about 2:30 and proceeded to do our stuff. I was in my house taking a shit after about 15 mins of putting it in and I already started feeling very weird. So I hurried up and went to my friends house. He was already standing by his car and we both looked at each other and said, 'we need to get the hell out of here.'",
  "So we left in his car to go to these woods over by Walmart and a park. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] We thought it would be a good spot to trip there for a while. We parked at Walmart and hurried our asses over to the woods because it was coming on fast as fuck! A complete shift in consciousness and perception was gradually changing this whole time. When we got there every fucking thing was moving like crazy! Everything got cartoony as shit and my friend had no idea what to think of all this because he had never tripped before.",
  "We stayed in those woods tripping balls for about 30 mins when my friend suggested we go out into the park. I said,'hell no dude we aren't ready yet!' But he kept insisting and we finally went out into the park. We were filled with euphoria and energy it was so badass! When we got to the park we saw some of our friends chilling in the parking lot and it was so weird. My first thoughts were like this,'look at those little humans over there doing there own little things. Oh wait I know those humans!' We ran over to them and it felt so good to communicate with them. They told us they were having a party later that night and asked if we wanted to go. We said,'fuck yes!'",
  "After we got done talking with our friends we went walking around the park and town feeling fucking amazing and talking our asses off in such depth. We literally came to so many realizations that my friend and I suggested that psychedelics could literally speed up the evolution process for humans! Not even kidding. The whole time we were walking around we had our shoes and shirts off and we felt like gods. Which later that day we came to the conclusion that we actually are.",
  "When we returned to his car we sat in the Walmart parking lot blasting music for about 30 mins and dancing our asses off! It was the best I have ever heard music sound. We then proceeded to go to my friends party after a while of having a blast. It was about 9:00 pm now. Everyone was drinking and having a good time. Except Ryan and I of course. Whenever someone offered us a drink we told them we were perfectly satisfied and we felt like 'parents' watching over all our friends and making sure they didn't get hurt. We were literally gods. Girls would be all on us trying to get us to do stuff but we just talk to them and told them that there is no need to do that stuff haha!",
  "Anyways after the party my friend and I went walking around on the golf course at night talking all about reality and the universe. It was so sick! Well that's my story. I hope you too can go on the path of faster evolution. This psychedelic is highly recommended! A++++++"
