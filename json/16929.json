  "I wish this was here the first time I stupidly tried snorting my Prozac pills in a desperate attempt to try and disconnect myself from the world a little further.",
  "I figured, I had snorted cocaine and Xanax, what could be wrong with Prozac? So I took apart the pill and was surprised at the amount of powder that came out of the pill. I cut it up into lines as I would normally with coke, and went on a little researching to find out if it's been done before and if it even does anything.",
  "I found nothing, so being to lab rat that I am, I just decided to go for it and I snorted down my first line.",
  "OW.",
  "It burned so bad, my nose felt like it was on fire from my nostril, to my nasal cavity and down my throat, like I snorted Tobasco sauce. My eyes watered for 15 minutes and tears poured down my cheeks. Inside my nose was throbbing and burning and the pain was so bad I didn't even notice anything other than pain. I couldn't even bother with any more lines and promptly trashed the rest of it.",
  "It took an hour and a half for the pain to die down and the nasty drip to stop. It does nothing... so don't do it!"
