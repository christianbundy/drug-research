 "report": "<p>The first time I took melatonin, it was in 5mg capsules.  I was in school, suffering from anxiety, and having a hard time getting to sleep at night.  This led to not being able to get up in the morning...you know the drill.</p><p>Upon taking the melatonin, the first thing I noticed was that it takes a long time to take effect, anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes to kick in.</p><p>The effects are weird.  I don't know how to describe it exactly, but it is very subtle.  You know the feeling when you've had a very long, full day, and it's getting dark, and you can't wait to get to bed?  Melatonin gives me that feeling artificially.  I've heard others say that it's like having the feeling that it's 2:00 in the morning when it may be only 10:00 at night.  This is also very accurate.  For those of you who use marijuana, I can compare it to the peripheral dopey buzz you're left with at the end of the night, long after the high is over.</p><p>A scary side-effect of the melatonin process I noticed is that i may retain some awareness as I fall asleep -- it's almost like being around to watch myself fall asleep.  It doesn't feel like falling asleep usually does. It's more like being slowly paralyzed, and being unable to move a muscle.  When I did fall asleep, I had what were some of the most vivid and odd dreams I can ever remember having.  Very colorful, and very real, all night long.</p><p>I did feel a bit groggy the next morning, which I was told would not happen.  However, I realized that it was due to the high dose I took.  I have settled on 2mg as a sensible dose, and it no longer leaves me feeling groggy in the morning.  In fact, it leaves me feeling refreshed and energetic, ready to take on the day.</p><p>But mostly, I take it for the dreams.  What wonderful, lovely dreams!</p>",
