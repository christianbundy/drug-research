 "report": [
  "<p>Yesterday I was very bored and home alone. I didn't have any marijuana so I started reading user experiences here on erowid, I came across codeine.. I knew I had some aspirin or something with codeine somewhere in the house so I did the seperation trick with hot water, cooled the water and filtered the solution into a glass and drank it.. it wasn't that bad of a taste more bitter than sour, but I wouldn't drink it regularly. I went upstairs and started reading more user experiences on erowid.",
  "I started feeling light headed and kind of tired about 30 minutes later. The strange part about the tiredness is that I would close my eyes and my eye lids would shake until I opened them again. I soon started feeling extremely relaxed, like I could sit in my chair for days on end, I did stuff on my computer, listened to music.. played games.. nothing was really spectacular visually or audibally, but I was so comfortable just sitting there it was unbelievable.",
  "I went downstairs to get a drink and as I was leaving the kitched I turned off the light, at that point I was extremely scared, I had to run upstairs.",
  "I soon went to lay down, this is where it got strange. I couldn't sleep, I was just relaxed and thinking about stuff.. I kept hearing noises from downstairs (real, every day house creeks.. wasn't hearing things :)) at this point I was VERY scared and it was hard to take my mind off it, that kept going on for an hour or two when finally I passed out.",
  "All in all I had a wonderful time on the codeine, I've never felt more relaxed.. I'm writing this the day after the experience and I feel fine.. still generally relaxed and somewhat tired.. no headache or bad side effects.. I did have a MINOR stomach ache earlier but a bit of pepto-bismal fixed that right up..",
  "I recommend codeine for relaxing and every once and awhile.",
  "With all drugs though, watch how much you take.. start off somewhat low. I took just enough to feel good and have no side effects, I'll probably try increasing the dose sometime soon..",
