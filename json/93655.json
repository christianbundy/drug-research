 "report": "<p>Myself and my boyfriend (weight 62kg) took two doses each, first of 70mg and second of 40mg. We both had substantial meals before going out. We had planned a night out in the city as several big dnb DJs and one of our favourite liquid dubstep DJs were playing. This was the first time we'd tried 5-APB. I have had quite a few MDMA experiences over the last 4-5 years and was told by my friend who had already tried 5-APB to expect a fairly similar effect but with less euphoria.</p><p>We got to the club at 9.30pm, when it was supposed to be starting, so we could drop as soon as we got in and come up while it wasn't too busy, but when we got there they said they weren't opening until 10.30pm. We went to a bar instead of waiting outside and I had one measure of Jack Daniels with coke, while my boyfriend had water. We got in and dropped 70mg each at around 10.50pm. It took us two and a half hours to come up, during which it kept sort of giving sneak peeks of what was coming without getting there - all in all a pretty boring couple of hours. At 1am our favourite dubstep DJ started playing and the excitement at seeing him helped us to reach a decent level by around 1.15am. For the next half hour we really enjoyed the music and dancing energetically to it, really felt like we were connecting with the DJ, and couldn't stop grinning at each other. I had plenty of energy and enthusiasm and really wanted to stay until the end of his set, but I felt that I was getting too hot, so went outside for a smoke at 1.45am.</p><p>Smoking enhanced the high, though not quite as much as we find it does with MDMA. We both remarked while we were sitting outside that we also felt much more lucid than on MDMA. When we went back in and dropped the second capsules of 40mg at about 2am, there wasn't any music going on that didn't consist of fairly toneless drum and bass, I had come up even more, and the combination of heat, crowding and the 'wrong' music made me feel like it was all a little bit much. We went outside for another smoke until around 3.15am, when we went back inside to dance. We'd come up again, probably both from the tail end of the original dose and the beginnings of the second. We danced until about 4am and went outside for another smoke, then went in again 15 minutes later by which point we were even higher, danced until 5am and then got a taxi home. I had a little MXE (probably not more than 10mg) and two balloons of N2O, which were fun but I didn't have all of the second one as it felt a bit much. I was still high from the second dose until 8.30am, at which point I had to smoke some weed and take an Etizolam to put me to sleep as my boyfriend was already calming down naturally. He had a much better sleep than me as a result, so I think next time I will leave the Etizolam.</p><p>The only thing that would have improved the experience would have been to time it better. If we'd have been able to go in at 9.30 as we'd originally planned and dropped the second lot at exactly 2.5 hours after the first, we would have spent much more of our time at the club at a decent level. Or maybe even better if we'd dropped the first before leaving at 9 and got there for 10. I have read reports of people coming up in a much shorter time, so I guess it depends on the individual. My boyfriend and I are both fairly slim, active, healthy people with pretty average tolerance levels.</p><p>It was lucid, enhancing, energising, empathetic and very smiley :) It seems to be a suitable alternative to MDMA without the uncomfortable come-up, the shitty come-down, or the messiness and disorientation in between. Just interested to see if any information on neurotoxicity becomes available. I will be using it as my staple clubbing enhancer from now on.</p>",
