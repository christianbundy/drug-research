 "report": "<p>A couple of my friends had gotten their hands on some Methoxetamine and were doing lines and saying how good it was. I had no experience with dissociative drugs but I had done acid and shrooms.  I had no real interest in the drugs (Im more of an acid guy), but my friends offered me a little line (.02grams) so I decided to satisfy some curiosity.</p><p>The line barely stung my nose. Almost immediately I felt drugged. It was a nice calm feeling. For the next few hours I would feel like a puppeteer controlling a marionette body. I felt quite a bit apart from my body. I also felt really good. I took a little more (.01-.02 grams) when it was offered. The dissociative effect was increased with the 2nd line, and again, I felt really good. It felt like waking up and just lying in bed half sleeping and napping. I still felt awake and social though.  I would recommend just chilling out with some friends for this (as with most drugs).</p><p>In comparison to acid, I would say that acid makes me feel all the good things in the world, while methoxetamine makes me feel good. All my friends described a somewhat different set of effects, but they took much more (upwards of .1grams).</p>",
