 "substance": "1,4-Butanediol",
 "bodyweight": "180 lb",
 "report": "<p>Mixture of 100 ml pure 1,4 Butanediol or Butylene Glycol with 25 ml of water is then used to provide a dose of 1.2 ml per 140 lb or 1.6 ml for my 180 lb.</p><p>The dosage is taken at cocktail hour on an empty stomach for general relaxation and stimulation of growth hormone.  Also take a dose before sex and somtimes about 3/4 dose before exercise. Usually take one dose for ease in sleeping.</p><p>When taken about 15 minutes before sex play then wonderful loving encounters typically 1 or 2 hours follow.  Easy to control ejaculation and run multiple orgasms without ejaculating and partner enjoys the relaxed and passionate love making.  Sex play typically 4 to 5 times per week.</p><p>Before exercise gives increased endurance.</p><p>In general best results when no more than 3 dosages in any one day.  I use exercise to keep body fit instead of taking more BD to relax for best results.</p><p>I do not take more then amount unless I want to go to sleep and then I make sure not to take more than a few drops more.  For example not more than 0.25 ml per 140 lb.</p><p>I have used BD for one year and skin much younger looking and general strength and endurance is much better.  About a 50% increase in endurance, as measured by running or weight lifting etc.</p>",
