 "report": "<p>I was over at a friends house. We were really bored and some of the 'crackheads' my friend lives with were going to score some coke. I had come in contact with the drug many times in the past and had always been uninterested in it. It never appealed to me in anyway. From what I had read it wasn't all it's cracked up to be (pardon the pun) and I don't like amphetamine like drugs in general.</p><p>But like I said we were bored and I decided to give it a shot just to satisfy the slight curiousity I had and to cure the bordom.</p><p>So we forked over our money to these shady characters and 30 minutes later they return with an 'gram' of cocaine. In retrospect my friend and I suspected that our 'couriers' had pinched a little for themselves from our bag.</p><p>Regardless we split the amount three ways and we each snorted our lot in a two big lines. I'm really not sure how pure the coke was or how much I snorted so don't quote me on dosage.</p><p>Immediately after we smoked some cannabis in a pipe. I remember noticing that the effects did not become apparent as quickly as I would have imagined. First I noticed my mouth, throat, and sinus areas going completely numb. My heart rate was definetly increased and soon a euphoria came over me that reminded me of my experiences with MDMA. I remember the feeling of it dripping down my throat was not exactly appealing.</p><p>I sat still in my chair for probably 15 minutes. My only comment on the effects was that 'This is interesting.' My friend and I decided to walk to campus. But halfway there I noticed the effects of the drug tapering off rapidly and I was overcome by a general feeling of fatigue and nausea. Nothing too bad, but I remember thinking that higher doses of this stuff could be quite unpleasent to come down from.</p><p>Soon I was in a sore mood and parted with my friend and walked home. I felt a little out of it for a few hours after and was soon asleep.</p><p>All in all cocaine was exactly what I expected it to be; Interesting but nothing special. I have no desire to repeat the experience.</p>",
