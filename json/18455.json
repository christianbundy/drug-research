  "<p>I was given it when I had surgery a year ago. It was given through IV. When it was injected within about 5 seconds I got a strong head rush and everything went black.",
  "From this point on I don't remember anything until I realized I was sitting up awake in the recovery room. The nurse was talking to me but all I could to was sit there and smile, it was very euphoric stoned feeling. After I left to go home the ride home I felt like the car was going 150 mph. By the time I got home I was so tired I decided to just go to bed. I woke up the next day with no problems at all.</p>"
