  "Pill Description",
  "----------------",
  "8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.",
  "Above score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I",
  "guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that",
  "non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]",
  "1:50AM",
  "------",
  "I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT",
  "earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real",
  "snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked",
  "a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or",
  "less at baseline.",
  "2:20AM",
  "------",
  "I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had",
  "any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main",
  "distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and",
  "intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as",
  "comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely",
  "not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar",
  "to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being",
  "the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about",
  "an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe",
  "it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is",
  "more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The",
  "physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a",
  "feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like",
  "tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam",
  "experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its",
  "just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.",
  "2:50AM",
  "------",
  "Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho",
  "from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.",
  "And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak",
  "effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good",
  "deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original",
  "assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some",
  "ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation",
  "is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally",
  "relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge",
  "to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.",
  "As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the",
  "euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual",
  "effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more",
  "subdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much",
  "more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie",
  "down and just relax and absorb the music.",
  "3:10AM",
  "------",
  "I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be",
  "more of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just",
  "listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot",
  "less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.",
  "This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be",
  "easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out",
  "that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically",
  "increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel",
  "very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to",
  "GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk",
  "around, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger",
  "doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather",
  "due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a",
  "little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal",
  "earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None",
  "of my muscles seem to have any tension.",
  "3:25AM",
  "------",
  "Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not",
  "really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or",
  "T+1:45.",
  "3:35AM",
  "------",
  "I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this",
  "snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy",
  "cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.",
  "Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...",
  "though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering",
  "the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last",
  "opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another",
  "hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good",
  "luck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,",
  "then describe it.",
  "3:50AM",
  "------",
  "T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now",
  "strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed",
  "earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from",
  "alcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But",
  "this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far",
  "fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no",
  "feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,",
  "just a drastic slowing of pace.",
  "4:20AM",
  "------",
  "I take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this",
  "report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and",
  "how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be",
  "as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot",
  "less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than",
  "anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much",
  "less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd",
  "like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party",
  "drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find",
  "them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to",
  "seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm",
  "sure I will sleep well tonight!"
