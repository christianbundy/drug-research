  "So I bought a gigantic bag of heavenly blue morning glory seeds and thought that all the information I read was enough to try them (wrong I was). So I crushed up about 600 seeds counting them one by one to ensure the exact dose. I mixed it with a chocolate milkshake, didn't taste half bad.",
  "Several hours went by with absolutely no effect, so the next day I wake up and my body just feels weird, feeling my face felt like I was touching another person. Its been 5 days since then and my body has yet to surpass the numb feeling. I feel like a fucking idiot, ruining my nurves just for a quick cheap trip?"
