  "Me and my cousins were bored one night. Tatum New Mexico is so small everything is just a bike ride away, so we went to town and country and bought a 2000 mg pack of ginseng juice. We went around the side of town and country and drank it all in 1 gulp.",
  "(8:00)no significant effect on the ride home, a little more energetic then usual.",
  "(8:30)change of mind state everything seems to be shifting.",
  "(9:00)weird feeling in our stomachs.",
  "(9:30)strung out all over the small room.",
  "(10:00)when we lay down it feels like an intense rush like were in a race car.",
  "(10:30)feeling nausious and a little buzzed.",
  "(11:00)coming down is like hell.",
  "(11:30)feeling tired my bro is on the computer.",
  "(12:00)I feel like I'm dead",
  "(11:00am)a bad hangover",
  "All together it was fun and a good party drug with some not so fun side effects. I may try it again but I'll research other things first."
