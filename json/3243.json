  "There is no real light dosage for this chemical. Anywhere from 10-20mg's is A Lot and even 5 mg is strong. Here are some notes from our experiments with it:",
  "Smoking- takes about an hour to kick in, not a good idea to smoke it though, possibly even more overly intense experiences. ",
  "Insufflated- it takes about 10 minutes to kick in, and you will end up puking rite when it starts to kick in, for anywhere from 1 minute up to 40 minutes. Not straight through though, on and off.",
  "Effects - Effects last about 8-12 hrs.  Peek time 5-8 hours.  Blurred vision, blinky lights, 'collidascope' vision, vomiting, SEIZURE.... possibly resulting from mixing with 'adderal' [amphetamine]. Overly intense experiences 'trips', too many visuals to handle.",
  "A friend was hospitalized after he snorted 5mg 5-MeO-AMT in New York, ended up in the ICU.  After insufflation, he was running around chasing the cat  for 20 mins, talking jiberish.  Then, he fell to the ground and started shaking in what looked like a 'seizure'.... got to hospital within an hr of falling to the ground and stayed in the ICU for 2 days. [Erowid Note: Jan 2003]",
  "DO NOT MIX THIS DRUG WITH MEDICATIONS, OR IF YOU HAVE PANIC ATTACKS, OR A BAD HEART. DO NOT OVERDOSE ON THIS CHEMICAL. DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 20mg's of this orally, do not take snorted. Recomended oral dose, IF ANY, 5-10mg.."
