  "<p>To start off, I believe in Universal Synchronicity, basically meaning that everything happens for a reason, and if something is meant to happen it will happen in perfect synchronicity. I allow the Universe to guide me, without hesitation.",
  "I was with 2 friends (Abbreviated names M and E for privacy purposes) on a Friday and it just occurred that we would contact our other friend (N) who just got a hold of some 2C-C-NBOMe. In reference to Synchronicity, we asked where we could meet up with him, and he said that we should meet up at exactly the same place that we already were eating for lunch haha! I than realized that it is definitely meant to be. I Start by taking 2C-C-NBOMe in liquid form via liquid dropper bottle; 4 drops equaled out to 1000 Milligrams. [Erowid Note: 'Milligrams' should likely read 'micrograms' given the reported dosages of the NBOMe family of compounds.] M and E took the same dosage.",
  "After we took the dose, N mentioned that he was going to an Art Walk that night, where they played live music with various Art Galleries. We asked if we could go with because it sounded fun and he agreed. I than knew it was meant to be that we all participate in this experience, for if we had contacted him on any other day, we could not have experienced the Art Walk. Perfect Synchronicity.",
  "About 5 minutes after taking the dose I start to feel different, but only slightly. About 30 minutes pass and I start to feel similar to an Adrenaline come down, to where the body feels a little shaky. Music sounds different as well. An hour passes and we start to see visual distortions, but only slightly to where certain things look more appealing than normal. N drives us to the Art Walk and while in the car everything seems different, the act of driving in a car feels almost alien, like the Matrix to where everyone is still plugged into the Matrix, but we are separate from it. Its feels this way most of the time for me due to my spiritual beliefs, I consider myself to be an awakening individual who does not participate in 'normal' activities like the rest of society, I am different. While on 2C-C-NBOMe this feeling was more pronounced.",
  "We Arrive at the Art Walk and get out the car, we are walking towards some live music which N speaks highly of. Throughout the entire trip so far I was in control of everything, it did not disorient or incapacitate at all, the build up was smooth sailing, with no stumbling around. All body functions were normal, I just had a different state of mind, of course.",
  "We get to the music and it sounds so unique, because even from a sober point of view this music is obviously for people on drugs because of how strange it sounds, its much more appreciated by people who are on something, I can assume. The people in the crowd are all so interesting! I study the faces and the dance styles of everyone there, I find staring irresistible, but in this setting everyone is ok with it because they share a mutual desire; to study faces. The energy of everyone there is just so chill and laid back that I feel completely comfortable around everyone no matter who they are, because I know we share similarities, Anyone who can jive to that type of music is my type of person.",
  "I am really tripping at this point at about an hour in, the concept of time by the way is completely irrelevant and distorted, I don't pay attention to the time at all, because it doesn't matter. Everyone dancing seems so alien to me, as If I can sense their their Universal history as a soul, as If I could sense their past life experiences. With each new body; with each Incarnation there are always fragments of the past incarnation and that history is a part of everyone to shape an individuals personality and interests.",
  "The music was alien, the people were alien, even I felt alien which was awesome! I felt like I was in an exclusive event with like minded people who discovered their inner self and embraced it, everyone expressed freely who they were, and they were proud of it. The body high was very interesting, it was almost out of body, but not quite there, and the visuals were distorted having an altered and enhanced perception of color, movement and texture, but not too much closed eye visuals like other substances such as 2C-P which is more visually intense. On a higher dose however 2C-C-NBOMe can be just as visual if not more visual.",
  "We leave the music for awhile and check out some of the art galleries, the paintings portray alot of emotion and the texture of the canvas seems to be fury on certain paintings or it pops out as if it isn't just a regular canvas, there are certain patterns within the paintings as well that move and show emotion. Alot of the paintings, I couldn't decide whether I liked them or not, probably because it wasn't my style of art, which I am into abstract without objects that can be deciphered, mainly focusing on colors and patterns. I did still appreciate the art that I seen though, alot of it was trippy.",
  "To Conclude this trip report, It was a very fun night all in all. I had no negative side effects, and my state of mind was very accepting and positive. I felt at one with everyone with the understanding that we are all one; each person is a reflection of who we are as individuals. We can only attract people to interact with if we match their vibrations to our own.",
  "Do not use this as a party drug, as it can very easily be abused by someone with the intention of consistent use, because it makes a pretty good party drug, but it also has spiritual properties that you should respect.</p>"
