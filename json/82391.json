Here's my experience.</p><p>t00:00- Three 25mg capsules ingested</p><p>t00:15-Feeling of relaxation, chalked off to placebo.</p><p>t00:30-More relaxation, my bed feels amazing. Finding it very hard to walk. Not a care in the world. I wanna see how far I can take this so I took a fourth pill equaling 100 mg.</p><p>t00:45-Really no effect from the 4th pill. Starting to come down.</p><p>t1:00-Normality restored.</p><p>Overall this is a great drug for relaxing.</p>",
