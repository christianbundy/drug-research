  "<p>After reading many of the other dramamine experiences I decided to give it a go. I bought the pills, went home, ate an egg sandwich, then proceeded to pop the 24 pills. This would be my first trip.",
  "Lets just say it wasnt what I expected. I thought the trip would be purple elephants and giant marshemellow men and things of that sort. The only hallucination if you could call it that really was a few dots that would shoot across my field of vision and a gelatin like substance over everything. Sometimes things would look like they were still in that spot even if I moved them. like a transparent image of it.",
  "Later that day about 6 hours after consumption of the pills I had to go see a new physcologist about my ADHD. She knew I was messed up on something, she gave me a few tests and told me to go read them and check the boxes that applied. Well, that would have been easy if I could actually read one single word on the paper, my vision was so distorted and blurry I couldnt even make out a box. I checked many things that were very off. Because of those actions she gave me a lovely blood and urine test for drugs which I failed being a pothead and all. Probably a few other things I wouldnt want her to have seen on that test came up too.",
  "My pupils became very very small and I had a robot like walk. To say the least it wasnt as 'great' as I thought it would be and I dont know if I would do it again.</p>"
