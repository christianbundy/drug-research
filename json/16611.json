  "<p>After about 30 minutes my body becomes heavy. This is further highlighted amusingly when I attempt to walk and discoVer that my legs feel as though weights have been tied to them and as a result, I have to be careful not to topple over, side-ways into walls or worse.",
  "My mind becomes indifferent, relaxed and I am left feeling this almost amorous craving for my bed clothes and pillow. Off I trot with a confuddled smile.",
  "Once in bed, it won't take me long to curl up and fall into a pleasant, deeply refreshing sleep.",
  "I found my state during the day to be lofty, radiant and relaxed. For a short-term aid I've now been taking doses daily for months to alleviate severe sleep problems.</p>"
