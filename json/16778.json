 "report": "<p>I have not seen any reports regarding Marihuanilla on Erowid so I thought I would share my experience with the substance.</p><p>I received an ounce of Marihuanilla via an internet distributer. The first thing that I did when it arrived was attempt to roll a joint of the material...not an easy task! The little flowers are hard to separate from the stems, and they are loaded with tiny 'thorns'. It took about 5 papers to finally get a poorly rolled cigarette.</p><p>And the smoke...not only is does it taste terrible, but it is so harsh that it is nearly impossible to hold it in the lungs! Coughing and gagging, I finally managed to finish the joint. I did notice a very light buzz. It was sort of a 'tired' buzz, comparable to a hit or two of poor quality grass. Smoking the material is simply not worth it.</p><p>Since I did not want to throw away the entire bag, I decided to try making a tea of the substance. I used about 1/4 ounce (roughly 7 grams) of material in a perculator with about 6 cups of water. I let the tea brew for about 15 minutes, then let it cool for a while. The tea was surprisingly pleasant to drink, and tasted similar to regular store bought tea. The effects were also a bit more pronounced than when smoking the material. The buzz was still mild, but was accompanied by a feeling of well-being and very subtle visuals.</p><p>In conclusion, marijuanilla is absolutly worthless to smoke. Perhaps if it were slow dried of cured it would be better, but I cannot recommend it based on my experience. The tea is definately the better option, but don't expect much. At least the substance is inexpensive ($13-$15 per ounce), so for some it may be worth experimenting with. I will move on to other things.</p>",
