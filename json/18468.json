  "This is something I noticed more than an actual experience.",
  "I was recently put on Celexa for anxiety. Despite the new medication, I wasn't really worried about continuing to smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, or use any other drug. I've always had a pretty average tolerance for alcohol. I'm not a lightweight, but I don't drink so often that I need a ton of booze either.",
  "But after my body adjusted to the Celexa (this was only after being on it for a week), I noticed my alcohol tolerance go waaaay down. I had a great buzz on just 3 Mike's Hard Lemonades (5% alc/volume). It probably wouldn't have taken many more before I was really drunk.",
  "Some might see this as a bad thing, but who wouldn't wanna get drunk faster if they could?"
