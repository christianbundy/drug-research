 "report": "<p>So I was bored one day and decided to smoke something. I couldn't quite think of anything that would be good for smoking until I remembered that I had some sage leaves in my kitchen cupboard.</p><p>So anyway, I took a bunch of dried leaves and sprinkled them into half a sticky note with crused wet paper as a filter, rolled up the note and lit up. The taste was sweet but harsh. I smoked the whole thing down and then threw out the 'filter'. I sat for about two hours and noticed nothing at all. Everything seemed to be perfectly normal.</p><p>Synopsis: It's a pleasent tasting herb but has no effect.</p>",
