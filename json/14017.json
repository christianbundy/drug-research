 "report": [
  "I'll keep this short and sweet.  Methoxetamine does nothing to me, even if I take high dosages IV.  With my friends it is a nice party drug when in a dance place with music and lights because it tends to trigger synesthesia and in that sort of environment people don't get too freaked out.",
  "For me, though, it seems to put me in an active mood and bring me out of the depression part of my bi-polar disorder.",
  "I take Seroquel and Lamictal. Perhaps that interaction causes this effect on me."
