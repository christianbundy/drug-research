  "I take 80mg of prozac daily. I smoke marijuana and I do mushrooms occasionally. I've taken acid about four times before.",
  "The first time I took two hits and my friend took one. I didn't feel anything and she was tripping hard. The second time we each took two hits and it took four hours for me to feel it and then it lasted for twenty four hours. The third time I had two and 3/4 of a hit and so did my two friends. They were tripping but I didn't feel anything. This time I had 2 hits and didn't feel anything after about 3 hours so I had 4 more hits and still didn't feel anything after 8 hours."
