 "report": [
  "Just a note: I have Bipolar Disorder, and take 1000mg of Depakote(divalproex sodium) and 100mg of Lamictal(lamotrigine), daily.",
  "Prior to this experience, the only drugs I had experience with (besides alcohol and cigarettes) were marijuana and methylphenidate(ritalin/methylin). I had always wanted to try Ecstasy, but never really had an opportunity to do so until recently.",
  "This is the experience of my second time using 'Ecstasy,' but I'll give a little background about my first. I bought a pill that was sold to me as ecstasy, from a source (a friend, who is also a dealer) that I thought was reliable. I paid $10 for it. After I got it, I checked it out on pillreports.com and was surprised to see that a number of people had tested and taken these pills (orange yin/yangs) and that they were not MDMA, but MDA. I was still interested in taking it. I took 1/8 of the pill, just to see what would happen. An hour later I took 1/2 of the pill, after I started to feel the effects, I took the remaining 3/8. I felt great, and had strong closed eye visuals.",
  "I decided to take two pills ($10/each, bought from the same person) about a week later. I was at home, my family was home. I went in my room, shut the door, and took the first pill (about 11pm). I put on some music and just chilled. My friend called, came over to buy some marijuana, and left. She said my pupils were very dilated. I didn't notice much. I took the other pill 15 minutes later, then insufflated 120mg of methylphenidate. I laid in my room, by myself, with the same techno song playing over-and-over.",
  "About an hour after taking the second pill, I really started to feel the effects. The first apparent effects were closed eye visuals. Then, when I opened my eyes, I still had crazy visuals. The room was dark, with only the red lamp above my lizard's cage, the alarm clock, and my cell phone providing light. The lights danced around the room. Shadows moved. The brightness of the room seemed to increase and decrease randomly.",
  "Time was meaningless (I was really rolling for about 4 hours), I didn't even think about time. I laid down and enjoyed. I was totally content and euphoric. I chewed on a pen for most of the experience, my jaws were clenching, but with something in my mouth, it wasn't bad. I was wearing only boxer shorts, but was very hot. I continuously wiped the sweat off of my body. I drank lots of water. Most of my memory of this comes from text messages I sent to myself and friends throughout the roll, without them, I wouldn't have remembered most of it. My phone fascinated me: the sounds, the lights, the trail of blue light that followed it, when I moved it around. I really felt the music through my whole body. I think it was the best experience of my whole life.",
  "Then the crash came. It came on quick. When it started, I insufflated 80mg of methylphenidate, hoping to feel better. Didn't help. I got sick. I alternated between freezing and sweating. I was nauseous, but couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I had to be to work at 1pm. I thought I had overdosed on methylphenidate, I had insufflated 240mg.",
  "I went to work at 1pm, my pupils still very dilated. I work retail, it was a Saturday near Christmas, and my district manager was visiting the store. I made it through 5 hours before giving up and going home. I was awake, but tired. I took 60mg of methylphenidate, orally, throughout the day to keep me awake. I was sweating, and felt like I was going to pass out when I stood up. My friend picked me up, we stopped at McDonald's and I went straight to bed, trying to eat some chicken nuggets to put something in my stomach. I slept until I had to go to work the next morning. The depression set in, and after crying for two hours, I had planned how I was going to commit suicide when I got home. Luckily, after working 8 hours, I felt much better. After that, I was fine. Five days later, I have experienced no more problems.",
  "I do plan on doing MDA again, but only when I have at least two days to recuperate, and people who know what I'm doing and are going to be able to check in on me during the days following in case the depression gets bad. A few friends who have experience with MDMA suggested using cocaine to help with the crash/hangover, I personally have no experience with cocaine, but may try this combination in the future."
