 "report": "<p>I tried St Johns Wort tea from the grocery store plenty of times and always with the same effect.  The effect was always nausea with pricklyness and increased body heat.  It might just be my nervouse system but this stuff is horrible to me.  I've know plenty of other people who complained about the same symptoms as well. </p><p>I did notice some color enhancement but it was not worth it.  Also I was not on any other substances at the time to blame it on.  Reminds much of eating alot of Jalepenos only not as good and more annoying.  Anyhow I would call it St Johns Puke.</p>",
