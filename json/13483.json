 "report": [
  "I had done K few times before, my favorite drugs are psychedelic tryptamines (DPT, 4-Aco-MIPT, LSD, ...). First I sniffed 10mg line to test possible allergic reaction. After one hour of very mild, but pleasant feelings I decided to go with 40mg. The onset was much faster this time and after 20 minutes I was going.",
  "During peak, I was not able to think clearly, an effect similar to a lot of alcohol or Kratom. Body felt light, but not comfortable. Some people in other room were smoking hash and I was disgusted by the smell (at other time, I would have joined them).",
  "Thoughts were disintegrated, I lost sense of space and laid down on the floor, waiting for it to happen. I listened to music (I tried to play, which was very difficult), but I did not find it enjoyable or interesting at all.",
  "To me, it was much different than Ketamine, sort of pushing all the buttons, having something from opiates, from ket and from alcohol, which is something I do not prefer. I like clear mind that allows me to explore, not a state where I can hardly enjoy hallucinations and take something from it.",
  "For me, it was just wasted time. Not enjoyable, though not 'bad' per-se. I did not feel depressed, sad or very nauseated. Just in a place not rewarding in any way."
