  "My lover and I love deep kissing and rebreathing each other. We are avid scuba divers and often try rebreathing games in our pool while having sex.",
  "One night I decided to take a hit off the whipped cream bottle as a lark and my girl did too. We both bumped around the kitchen, luckily missing some sharp edges around the counter. She put her mouth on mine and started to blow her nitrous filled lungs into me. After a few rebreaths, my mind blew and she starting falling because she nearly passed out!",
  "The next day we purchased whippets, and hooked it up to a buoyancy dive vest. Being wiser, we sat on the sofa, exchanging hits and rebreathing each other until we were close to black out. We extended the play to mutual masturbation and went into the bed room, doing a hit at the time of orgasm.",
  "Sex and nitrous is very addicting, and as scuba divers we have to be careful about the nitrogen in our systems.",
  "Sex and nitrous are our high of choice!"
