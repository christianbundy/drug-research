  "AMT was my first expirence with a psycoactive drug before and i had no idea what affects it would hold. well anyways i purchased two pills containing 2 hits apeace for 40 from my freind who said i needed to try it. smoking pot occasionally i hadnt really hit the big drug scean yet.well i got the pills at school around 4 then around 530 i decided to see what they were all about.so i opened the capsuals and dumped the white poweder in my mouth, to me suprising no taste or anything.",
  "well an hour rolls around and i was suppose to be going ot dinner with my mom nothing happens and i was 14 at the time. we go out to eat at an upscale restraunt in the city. around 730 i started feeling light seeing a small euphorian feeling giggly excited engergetic and my mom doing many drugs in the past noted how large my pupils were as well as my skin tone turned white and blotchy, i felt ok in the restraunt but watched my drink began to swirl by its self beer on the wall and neon lights began to react spinning like a colidoscope.",
  "by this time i was laughing in a full restruant hilariously with the cops out side.",
  "my mom notes im tripping my balls off and takes me out of the restraunt by not 30min has past and my trip really starts to increast heart rate jumped and mild closed eyed visuals were apparent as well as a euphoria of mulitcolored lights around everything. by now were on our way to the local hospital for an overdose. i get to the hospital emergency room tripping my nuts off seeing the floors wiggle the tvs 3D and all sorts of shit starting they put me on the heart rate monitor and i was peaking 220 beats a minute.",
  "Well i fucking tripped and tripped hard the hospital drug tested me nothing came up they said i was fine to go home so i did.i couldnt sleep that whole night i noticed visuals went away around 1 or so in the morning.",
  "i didnt get to sleep that whold day and it was on a monday when i took them the after affects lasted up until about my 3 period class 2 or so after i ate lunch the nasty hangover went away and i felt fine.",
  "my summary in amt as well as all other psycoactives is be cautious and take it only from highly expirenced and trusted people. but I enjoy it is has an awasome power like a slight lsd trip with the speedyness of exstacy"
