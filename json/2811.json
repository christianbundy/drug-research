 "report": "<p>\nFirst you might need some background and stuff...</p><p>I am employed by a pharmaceutical company who produces stuff as diverse as fentanyl patches, to nicoderm, to sudafed, to scopolamine patches.  This experience took place in the commercial lab for TTS (Transdermal technology systems)  </p><p>I was sitting in the lab preparing a release rate analysis for the scop patch (cutting up the patches and preparing them to be placed in the baths, when I spilled some release rate media on my hands.  I quickly ran to the sink to wash it off (I wasn't wearing gloves), and my eye started itching.  Foolishly I touched my eye, and about a half hour later, one of my team members told me that I had scop eye.. My left pupil had dilated...</p><p>I didn't suffer any adverse effects from that, although I did feel confused for the rest of the day.  I ended up walking to the occupational nurses office and going home early.  I learned my lesson though...Don't touch your eyes when you're working with scopolamine</p>"
