  "I have been on Lexapro 10mg for about 2 months and took ecstasy this past weekend, just one roll.  I did drink a little bit of alcohol, but a negligent amount, and stayed hydrated.  I would just like to advise future Lexapro/SSRI users about the experience; I have taken ecstasy 4 or 5 times before while not on antidepressants and this time the roll was NOT WORTH IT.  It was not necessarily a bad time, but it was disappointing because everyone with me was rolling hard while I was not really feeling it."
