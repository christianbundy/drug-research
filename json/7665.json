  "<p>I attempted to prepare methcathinone acetate (I couldn't obtain any hydrochloric acid) from 720mg of pseudoephedrine using the chilled permanganate method.",
  "My friend L. and I divided the powder into roughly ten lines.  We each snorted a line, and realized that too much acetic acid had been added.  We dissolved another line each into water and consumed that.",
  "We did some laundry and temporarily parted ways to do some cleaning. Whenever I sat down, my leg would bounce.  L. reported that she could not sit still.",
  "I got some cramps and felt the need to defecate (but only managed to emit a bit of water).",
  "After about two hours of laundry and cleaning/organizing, we decided to dose again.  L. tried to snort another line, but the burning was too intense, so she consumed the remainder of the line orally.  I consumed one more line orally.",
  "After dosing, we set out on a long walk.  Everything seemed sharp to the both of us.  My senses felt fine-tuned.  I wasn't over-talkative nor irritated, but I was pretty happy in general.",
  "The stronger effects seemed to last around two hours.  For me, the speediness came in waves.  I was never sure if I was plateauing or coming down.  I had done DXM the previous night and the cat cleared up any last 'fuzziness' feeling remaining in my head from the DXM.  I felt a bit physically worn out (I tend to get the tired-but-still-wide-awake effect on uppers).",
  "L. had no appetite, and couldn't get to sleep for around seven hours.  I managed to sleep after a few hours, but the sleep was somewhat interrupted.",
  "(After the walk, I think we consumed a line more apiece in water solution, but my memory is fuzzy... I have about two lines left, so this seems right.)</p>"
