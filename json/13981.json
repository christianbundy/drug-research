 "report": [
  "<p>For my age, I am very experienced drug user.  It should be said, I am prescribed 8mg Buprenorphine (Suboxone) per day and take the occasional benzodiazepine.  Aside from these, my involvement with a local drug court dictates that I abstain from marijuana, so about a year ago, I turned to synthetic cannabinoids.",
  "My friend ordered pure JWH-018 from an internet vendor about a year ago.  He and I smoked at least three times a day for almost eight months.  I had a few intense, unpleasurable experiences, including mild panic attacks.  These included thoughts of impending doom, severe paranoia, and other mentally unpleasant side effects.  Bad as they were, nothing I experienced at that point made me seriously consider stopping the synthnoids. ",
  "About a week ago, 'A' told me he got 'search' (that's what we call research chemicals) and that it was much stronger than JWH-018.  Excited, I purchased a gram from him yesterday morning.  Last night, I put about 10mg on the end of a cigarette and smoked it.  The effects were quite similar to JWH-018, and I had a nice time watching 'Superjail!' on TV.",
  "This story is NOT over.",
  "I woke up at about 4AM this morning, feeling fine.  I took a piss, and decided to smoke again before I went back to sleep.  The following is an account of the worst experience of my life.",
  "0:00-  I dipped the cigarette into my baggie, filling the open end with about 18-20mg of pure AM-2201.  Leaning out the window, I pull hard on the cig, knowing how quickly synthnoids combust and disappear.  I held in the smoke for about 15 seconds.",
  "0:20-  I wake up, rolling around the family room of my house.  My shoulder is fully dislocated, and I am utterly TERRIFIED.  I guess 'wake up' is the wrong term.  I was definitely having some form of seizure.  The Doors lyric comes to mind: 'lost in a wilderness of pain.'  I was completely convinced that I was a SKELETON, and my bones were all dislocated and I was paralyzed.  I distinctly remember looking to my right and seeing my pelvic bone, covered in blood, lying a few feet from my head. ",
  "0:21-  I am obviously still in psychosis, but my dad shows up downstairs in his underwear (NOT a hallucination) and somehow I recognize him, but seeing him does not free me from the insanity.  He tries to hold me down, and I see my arm bones in his hands (keep in mind that I actually did dislocate my shoulder while rolling around on the floor, so the intense pain probably contributed to the nature of my hallucinations.)  This sight makes me panic worse. ",
  "0:30-  I am pleading with my parents to put my body back together.  (At this point, my parents told me that my eyes were rolling back in my head, and I was thrashing about violently while screaming at them to help me.)  My dad is holding my bones together so that I don't fall apart.  I cannot explain adequately the feeling of terror; somehow, my body had been reduced to just bones that were not connected by anything.  I remember shutting my eyes as tightly as possible and focusing on my heart to make sure it was still there.  I started paying attention to my heart, and began to think it was going to stop beating.  I told my parents that I loved them and that I'm sorry I killed myself like this.",
  "0:45-  By the time the paramedics arrived, every muscle in my body was rigid as a board and I thought I was paralyzed.  I was still convinced that I would die when I noticed the lady putting a pin in my arm, which I could not feel.  ",
  "2:00-  I woke up in the hospital, still terrified, but gaining composure.",
  "This experience was so far out of bounds and inconsistent with even LSD and PCP that I have no idea what actually happened.  I am convinced that the AM 2201 led directly to some kind of seizure fit.  My parents are SCARRED.  My mother said, verbatim : 'Michael, that was the worst thing that I can ever imagine having happen to my child.  That was almost as bad as if you had been decapitated in front of me.'  'The Exorcism' cannot touch what I went through last night.  I would much rather be possessed by Satin than have another seizure fit from AM 2201. NON EXPERIENCED SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID USERS BEWARE:  EXTREME DANGER lurks behind this drug.  I cannot imagine a more psychologically damaging experience resulting from drug use.</p>"
