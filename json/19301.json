  "<p>I have not used psychedelics for about 17 years (besides marijuana, and I haven't used that for many years). My previous experiments had been with psilocybin mushrooms and Amanita muscaria. The psilocybin had been a very pleasant and profound experience that has stayed with me ever since, and I've recently become interested in psychedelics again after reading about some of the recent experiments with DMT and psilocybin. I decided, after some research that 4-aco-DMT seemed like a good candidate for a reintroduction, so I obtained some (mine was the brownish, clumpy variety one often sees reports of online) and last night, I decided to dip my toes in the water. ",
  "At 8pm I took approximately 7 mg of 4-aco-DMT fumarate orally, at home, on a mostly empty stomach. It was bitter, but not unpleasantly so. I took nothing else, prescription or otherwise before or during. My girlfriend was with me to act as a sitter and just to be amused. We sat outside next to a fire pit and talked while I waited to feel the effects. I was feeling slightly apprehensive, but was mostly excited to be revisiting this frontier after such a long time away.",
  "Exactly one hour after taking it, I was starting to doubt whether I had taken enough for anything to happen, when I suddenly noticed that I seemed to have come just ever so slightly untethered in space and drifted to my left. The fire pit beside me suddenly didn't seem to be sitting firmly in place any more. It was as if the local space  defined more or less by the light from the fire, and consisting of the fire pit, my girlfriend across from me, myself, and the table next to us  were not on firm ground, but sort of hovering above it, without actually hovering. I leaned from side to side and it felt very unusual. I should say that this wasn't an overpowering or scary sensation at all, just sort of a subtle feeling. The next thing that caught my attention was my girlfriend's car, which seemed to have too many doors. I knew it didn't have too many doors, but something about it just looked wrong. It just didn't look like it was supposed to. Again, this was very subtle. ",
  "Shortly after this, she went inside for something and I moved over to sit in front of the fire. As I watched the fire, I was wanting to go somewhere deeper, but nothing interesting had happened for a few minutes. Then I noticed that the fire pit seemed tilted, and I seemed to be on an angle too, as if I were sitting on a rather steep driveway instead of flat pavement. I kept feeling like I might fall over. Then I looked up the driveway, and I saw a car drive by, and it looked like it was driving through liquid. I'm not sure how to explain that exactly, but that was the sense of it. At the same time, I noticed a very strong, anchoring sense of being in a local space. I was not at that end of the driveway, over there. I was over here, and that part of the driveway was like a separate world. I was looking out of my space into that space over there. An odd sensation. ",
  "At that point, I thought, yeah, this is working. This isn't just me. I sat next to the fire some more and my arm in my peripheral vision started to seem very thin, and I had sort of a sensation of being taller and very, very thin.",
  "After my girlfriend came back, I started to notice a buzz, or euphoria, not unlike what I remember from mushrooms. I felt very peaceful, and a bit spacey. Things were definitely not the way things normally are, but I wasn't ever so far gone that I lost track of reality. This led to a lot of laughter as I would say something and then realize how strange it probably sounded to my girlfriend. And a couple of times I got hyper-aware of how I was sitting and I had to ask her if, for example, the way I was leaning forward and looking at the fire was normal.",
  "It kept seeming as though there was more space between us than there actually was. She didn't look farther away, it just seemed that she was. I didn't notice much in the way of visuals. Colors and textures seemed very subtly enhanced and pleasant to look at, but the most interesting effects were in how things were perceived, how they seemed, more than how they looked. More the definitions and the parameters of reality than the way reality appeared. ",
  "About an hour and a half into the experience, I took another 3 mg. I don't know that this did anything more, but I did have an interesting experience about 2 hours in. I felt a need to stop using contractions in my speech. I felt suddenly very sincere, very peaceful, very grounded and focused in the midst of these wild euphoric winds around me, and my personality shifted. My voice started to sound lower, more confident. My voice sounded to me, and I started to feel like I was, what seemed to be a native american shaman. Although I fully retained my sense of self, I didn't feel quite like my 'normal self.' It was like I was letting a very trusted part of me come out that I was familiar with on some level, but had never been consciously aware of before. ",
  "Just at this point, and without me saying anything about this perception shift, my girlfriend, took my hand and put it on her abdomen. She had been having bad pains there all night. I felt suddenly like I could fix it, make the pain go away. I told her I would see if I could, and she humored me. I closed my eyes, and my hand started to follow a line along her abdomen, and I started to see visuals that are difficult to describe, sort of branching crystalline, not-quite-fractal shapes, and impressions, not-quite-visual, of lots of simple entities and I felt as though I were interfacing with spirits, or what seemed like biological cells, and with pain itself. She told me that I was tracing along the exact place where it was hurting. Instinctively, my hand started to move slightly, in sort of a slow pulsing as I talked to these cells and spirits inside of her, asking them to relax, to let go, to let what is bad come out and what is good flow in, and after a time I started to feel a shift in them, as though they understood and were cooperating, and I took my hand off. She told me to put it back on because she was just starting to feel the pain changing. So I did, and I did more interfacing, and eventually the greenish colors of the crystalline shapes I was seeing as the pain started to dissipate, and then they dropped off very quickly in intensity, and seemed to be as gone as I felt they could get.  And about fifteen seconds after that I removed my hand. She told me that about fifteen seconds ago, she had felt the pain suddenly quiet dramatically. I don't know if there was anything more than coincidence to that, but it sure was interesting. ",
  "I had some more very compelling closed eye visuals later. They were fairly subtle, and not completely unlike what I see when I close my eyes at night and start to drift off and watch dull, subdued colors form and cascade across the blackness. But these visuals were more persistent, and more - what?  I don't know. They seemed to be more than just something I was seeing. There was a synesthesia to them. I could feel them, almost as if they were a part of my body, and/or the space around me. Very hard to describe, but fascinating and mostly quite pleasant.",
  "I tried listening to music at one point, but I felt as though it was just a distraction, and I turned it off to be more present in the experience.",
  "Over the next couple of hours, I was very gently glided in for an almost unnoticeable landing. The total experience lasted about 4 hours. Although I did notice some very minor visual distortions around lights for another hour or so (possibly the 3 milligram booster lingering?). After the experience, I was in a positive mood until bed time, then slept well, and had no unpleasant feelings in the morning.",
  "Overall, the experience was very positive. The only negative was a very minor nauseous feeling that came on about 45 minutes after ingesting, and that passed after about 5 minutes. One unexpected positive that I might as well note, was that after having suffered with a painful bout of an eye condition (which my doctor thinks might be Thygeson's SPK) for about a month, this is the first time the pain has completely vanished. I don't know if I was too distracted to notice it, or if a physiological change took place, but for about 5 hours, I didn't feel any pain or irritation in my eyes.",
  "I feel like this was a great dosage for me to paddle around the kiddie pool, gain some confidence and understand the substance before diving into it. I learned a little about myself and got some tantalizing glimpses of a few of the paths this substance can lead one down. I'm looking forward to trying it again at a higher dose.</p>"
