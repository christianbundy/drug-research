 "report": "<p>Well I heard that chewing california poppy petals will get you high so I decided 'what the hell' and I picked four petals off the plants that were growing in my front yard and chewed them like gum. I immediatly felt a wave of relaxation and drowsiness come over me. After about ten minutes of chewing the petals I really felt like going to sleep. About ten minues later it wore off and I had a general feeling of drowsiness the rest of the day. Do all in all it's good for insomnia but not much else.</p>",
