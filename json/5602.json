 "report": [
  "For some time now I have been taking 5-htp capsules, which also contain valerian, to help regulate my sleep and improve dreams.  I haven't a problem with them until last Friday, an account I am about to reflect upon.",
  "I usually would take about 250-300mg of 5htp (valerian content unknown to me at this time).  At first I found the effects to be almost reminiscent of the spacey feeling produced while beginning to come up on shrooms.  Each time I dosed myself with these pills, the spacey feeling was less and less apparent, until I felt no difference between this substance and straight sobriety.  I dosed an average of 12 times, before the experience this writing will tell, and never dosed more than twice a week.",
  "My room is filled with electronics (computer, tv, playstation, dvd, cd, mp3, gamecube, printer, satellite receiver box, and a vcr)",
  "An hour after getting home from work.  I am a little wired from all the coke I drank, while exhausted at the same time.  I usually don't sleep well while in this condition.",
  "I fell asleep about an hour after taking the pills.  I mainly just watched TV and drank a coke before lying down in bed.   I don't really remember drifting off to sleep.  My last memory was looking at the clock, which read 12:15am.",
  "Enter the dream: ",
  "I open my eyes and see my room exactly as I had before I closed them.  I notice I feel a little spacey (my vision was similar to the way it is while I am on dxm), and decide to get up and get a glass of water.  By the time I got to the door way of my room I realize that I am in a dream, and then, immediately, I am back in bed just opening my eyes.  I realize that I just dreamed getting out of bed and walking towards the kitchen to get a drink of water, decide that I want to get up and see if I am still dreaming.  I get as far as three steps before I realize I am once again dreaming and am immediately transported back to my bed, and the same events ensue with different results in when I realize I am dreaming. ",
  "I get stuck in this time loop about 50 time consecutively (or at least that is how it feels.). I often get pretty worked up when I am in a dream and cannot get out of it and have trouble realizing if I am dreaming or not, and this was no exception.  A few times I plugged in what I thought to myself was a lamp with a weird face on it and a hookah mouth piece.  I sucked from the mouth piece to take a hit of oxygen.  I thought this would help me awaken, but it did nothing and I tried it during more than one time loop ( which could be  because I have, lately, been smoking weed twice every week, on the days I go to my philosophy class.  It seems to help me focus and contemplate things longer.  I often look forward to doing my homework on these days as it seems less tedious and much more effort seems to be put towards it.). ",
  "Somewhat long pauses came in-between the time loops, sporadically.  At once point I was trying to open packages which could not be opened, as once I ripped the wrappings off, new wrappings were already beneath the wrappings being removed ( I have been anxiously awaiting two different packages, one coming from the opposite side of the country, for about a week and a half.)",
  "Suddenly I am completely in the dark, with no mental images other than darkness, and no sense of anything other than this extreme pulsing through out my head, eyes, and gums ( jaw clenching).  This seems very painful and goes on for what seemed like a minute or two, but was probably much shorter in duration.  I was able to jerk myself out of sleep, suddenly as the pulsating was becoming too much. ",
  "The awakening: 3:28am",
  "I awoke somewhat shaken, sweaty, and with a kind of 'lost' spacey feeling.  As I sat up in bed, I noticed my heart was beating somewhat quickly.  I went downstairs, drank an entire bottle of water, threw off my pants and threw a very light blanket on my bed (after removing the heaver comforter I had been sleeping with).",
  "I meditated by my bed for a few minutes, trying to calm down and think about what just happened.  I then slept soundly until about 8am, went back to sleep until 11am and then finally got up at 12:07.  I was expected at work by 2:00. ",
  "I was fine at work, except that at about the 6 hour mark I started to get pretty tired."
