 "substance": "Tramadol",
 "bodyweight": "195 lb",
 "report": "<p>The most note-worthy of effects is that I experienced extreme difficulty in urinating up to 20 hrs after taking the pills.  But I did figure out a way to get around this problem.  When I knew that I had to urinate, but just couldn't, I would go into the bath tub and let warm/hot  water run on my genitals.  After a few seconds of this I was able to urinate freely.</p><p>I am not experienced with opiates, opiods, and pain killers, so I don't know what normal after affects are, but I will note that I seem to be less mentally agile the next day(I am an aspiring mathematician and I found it quite difficult to read mathematical or scientific literature after taking tramadol for a day)</p>",
