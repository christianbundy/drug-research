 "report": "<p>Ive been drinking Mat for about a year now, as a better alternative for coffee (which gave me stomachaches). Browsing online, as I often do, I read about another way to prepare my mate, grinding it and pouring it through a coffee filter.</p><p>I had about five doses left, so I grinded it all up, put it in a mug, which was filled for about a quarter with the powder, added boiling water and left it to soak for 5-10 minutes and I poured it through the coffee filter. The tea was brown instead of green-brownish and smelled very strong. I drank it all up in about a minute or so, five minutes later I felt that the caffeine started to have its effects on me. What struck me as odd was that I didnt get a shaky sensation as I usually do, not a lot of physical energy, but my fingertips and toes started to get numb. My heart rate didnt increase as I expected, but the strange thing was that I started to have muscular spasms: painful cramps in my shoulders and lower back as I stretched out, as I walked up the stairs my legs hurt I cant think of any other reason why this happened, but the mate.</p><p>Ive never believed people claiming that they got high on mate, but Im having second thoughts, since I felt some tickles in my toes and fingers, felt relaxed, yet alert and awake. I wasnt really high as in another state of mind, or extremely happy, but I wasnt quite myself either. Time did seem to pass slower, and I was more productive.</p><p>I guess all I can say is that grinded mat really is more potent, but if I take to much, there is a downside.</p><p>On the plus side, compared to coffee, a mate overdose doesnt make me feel sick, nervous, sweaty and trembling, if you have the choice, choose wise, choose mate!</p>",
