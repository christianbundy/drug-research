  "<p>I feel as though I should share this experience as many others may be in my position, lost, in a haze, reality-lost, and overall emotionless. That's why they gave it to me. So I wouldn't kill myself, so I wouldn't feel sad. I stare in the mirror and see nothing. I think about sad things and my mind instantly sedates my emotions. That's why I haven't cried in months. That's why people think I'm uninterested in anything. Everyone thinks I'm strung out on drugs.</p>"
