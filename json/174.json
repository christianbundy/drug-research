  "So apparently it's customary to begin these sorts of things with some sort of recap of one's drug experience and history. No need for any penis measuring or laundry lists, let it just suffice to say that over the course of the last 12 or 13 years I've explored a lot of ground with psychedelics. LSD in particular has been one of my favorite and most trusted allies along the way, and I estimate I've consumed it several hundred times, often in fairly large doses.",
  "So given my history with LSD, I had a lot of interest when I heard about the release to market of the new ergoline derivatives AL-LAD and LSZ. My adventure with AL-LAD was vastly complex, intense, and deeply transformative, and it will be the subject of another report. LSZ, on the other hand, was not so promising.",
  "Perhaps foolishly, but following my habit with LSD, I started with a 300ug dose, and then boosted it with two more tabs between 45 to 90 minutes after the initial dose, for a total of 600ug taken over perhaps 1.5 hours. The experience was in some respects extremely similar to LSD, especially visually, but it seemed to be lacking almost entirely in the spiritual weight, for lack of a better phrase, that is so pronounced with LSD in its first 3-5 hours of action. Whereas the first half of a strong LSD experience feels like making love with God when it's going well, or getting horse-fucked by Satan when it's not, LSZ felt hollow and empty. Whereas LSD seems to threaten with impossible force to simply obliterate every aspect of personality and self-hood, LSZ is nearly totally impotent.",
  "As the peak continued to build, I remained relatively cogent and in touch with my egoic self, but the body-load and nausea factor increased somewhat significantly. I never vomited, as another report here claims, but I was definitely uncomfortable and came to feel quite bad, physically. I was heavy, nauseated and dysphoric in ways that seemed quite distinct from a typical downer LSD trip. These negative feelings did not seem to have a psychological root, but a pharmacological one  the stuff just made me feel bad.",
  "Fortunately, in addition to lacking in the ego-dissolving capacities of LSD, LSZ also seemed to lack the extreme time-dilating qualities of LSD, so riding out the peak was simply a matter of listening to music and writing notes, and not any kind of epic existential struggle as it might have been with LSD. Once the peak passed and the body load began to return to more manageable levels, the experience became a bit more contemplative and reflective, in the way that the latter half of an LSD experience generally becomes, but again, not to the same degree.",
  "After diverting myself looking at art, reading, playing music and the like for a few hours, I eventually took 1mg of etizolam and slept. Total duration from time of dosing had been around 11 hours, and when I woke about 5 hours later, I felt the familiar post-LSD exhaustion. Ingestion of 11mg 4-AcO-DMT was a perfect sub-psychedelic mood and energy booster for the afternoon, and allowed me to have a relatively productive day despite the psychedelic exhaustion and lack of sleep.",
  "All in all this is nowhere near as good as LSD, at least not in these sorts of doses. Three hundred micrograms is probably the highest dose I'd want to take again, and it might be nice for tripping at a festival or other public place where it would be preferable to keep from getting too out of touch with consensus reality."
