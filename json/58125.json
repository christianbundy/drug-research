  "<p>I have rather obstructive sleep apnea.  Combined with years of insomnia that never went away after a bad bout with depression, I used to only get about 3-4 hours of sleep each night.  This was due to a few different factors:",
  "1.  My insomnia prevented me from getting to bed until the wee hours of the morning.",
  "2.  My apnea-treatment is very uncomfortable.  I usually only get 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep before I wake up and in the past, I usually was not able to get back to sleep.",
  "3.  Even the 3-4 hours I was getting was not very restful.",
  "Since starting treatment with cannabis, I am able to:",
  "1.  Sleep more or less when I want to",
  "2.  Sometimes get 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep",
  "3.  Even if I wake up after 3-4 hours, I can get back to sleep",
  "4.  Each sleep cycle is more restful.",
  "I live in a legal state but I really hope it becomes federally legal for med use.  Its a shame because there are really no side-effects, it is not addictive and there is no hangover.  What more could I ask for from a sleep therapy med - all the others come with a host of side-effects and most synthesized med are, in varying degress, toxic to the body.</p>"
