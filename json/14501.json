  "Last night I found out 5-meo-amt is an extremely potent drug. after recieving 300mg in the mail I proceded to dissolve it onto 30 mg of 190 proof alcahol. Then on three sugar cubes I placed 6 drops (~2.5 mg 5-meo-amt). I was not planning on taking this substance last night, due to the fact I was the The Driver.  I gave one to my friend, (who reported good results) and kept 2 with me in the event anyone else wanted some. Driving up to the rave I began to notice visual distortions, tiredness, and a lack of memory. When we stopped for some food I went to the bathroom to check my pupils and sure enough they were dilated.",
  "The only possible conclusion i can draw is that the 5-meo-amt was inhaled by accident while prepairing the solution, or the 3 drops I got on my hand absorbed into my body, although it is quite possible that both hapened.  Had this been a larger dose i very well may have crashed my car and killed my friends, i urge anyone preparing or handling this substance be very careful!",
  "T+ 0:00 (4:00) accidental dosing",
  "T+ 5:30 (9:30) we leave for the party, mild visual distortions and tiredness set in.",
  "T+ 6:30 (10:30) reaching the peak, i cannot keep my eyes open and ask myfriend to drive, visuals have grown in intensity and eyes are bouncing side to side.",
  "T+ 11:00 (2:00) we return and I am coming down, and decide to sleep.",
  "Reading Tihkal i believe it is safe to assume my dose was somwhere within the 1.5-2.0 mg range. next time i try this chemical I will try to go for a 2.5"
