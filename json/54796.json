 "report": "<p>One day I was bored and had nothing much to do. I felt like getting high, but I had no weed. I had read on the internet that smoking catnip could give you a buzz so i said to myself 'why not?'. I went looking though my house for catnip and eventually found some in my pantry. So I went outside, packed a bowl, and took a few hits. Surprisingly the smoke was not very unpleasent and smelled reminiscent of weed. I packed another bowl and took a monster hit, which I held in as long as humanly possible. This catnip was well dried, making it stay lit in my pipe so I wouldn't have to keep re-lighting.</p><p>I soon felt a kind of mild relaxing buzz that was fairly pleasant. I looked at my hands, closed my eyes, and it seemed as if I could still see my hands even though my eyes were closed. I tried this a few more times and it eventually stopped working. My hands and face started to feel heavy and I was thoroughly relaxed. I almost felt like sleeping. So I sat for a while a longer and then went back into the house. The buzz wore off 20 or so minutes later.</p><p>It was a good experience and I would recommend it to those who are lacking bud.</p><p>Peace</p>",
