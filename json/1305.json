  "As I write this, I am still reeling from the death of my friend. Last Thursday my life was changed when my roommate came home, shaking and crying. It took a minute for her to say it, that Brian was dead. Later, we discovered that he took a few doses of GHB and drank alcohol as well. Since his death was only a week ago, we are still unsure of the exact dosage, or exactly what happened. We do know, however, that Wednesday night Brian went to bed and never woke up.",
  "I am not anti-GHB, myself being experimental with drugs, but I writing this to warn about the dangers of mixing GHB with alcohol. None of us thought that something like this could happen to one of our friends. But, now, we are all effected by this experience.  Not a single one of us will ever be the same, and though we will never forget Brian and are better having known him, we wish he was still with us today.",
