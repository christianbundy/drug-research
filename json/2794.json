 "report": [
  "It's been a long day, I've had sinus problems all day, and been somewhat zonked from a combination of not not feeling good and taking sinus medicine.  Around 11:00 I had taken a Tavist-D which was making me feel pretty drained.",
  "2:00 Mix 5 ml of GVL solution into a shot glass of water.  I have never tried GHB or GVL.  Because my insomnia has been getting steadily worse over the past year, I'm hoping that this will be an effective and legal sleep aid.",
  "2:05 Make first attempt to drink the foul stuff.  Take half the shot then chase with coke.  Tastes like moonshine that has been allowed to dissolve a plastic container.  The aftertaste is worse.  The sweet coke smothers the taste for a minute, only for it to emerge more prevalent than before.",
  "2:10 Finally managed to force myself to drink the rest.  Throat tried to close up to prevent me from swallowing this.",
  "2:20 Rash/flushing that spreads out over my body.  Feels and appears very similar to a Vitamin B6 overdose.",
  "2:25 Flushing gone",
  "2:30 Convinced I 'feel something.' Light-headed, moderate relaxation.  A friend who has tried GVL before tells me it is probably placebo.",
  "2:45 Not really feeling anything at this point, that can't easily be attributed to prior medication, etc. ",
  "Conclusion: A waste of time.  Tasted absolutely horrible, no discernible effect.  Diphenhydramine is definitely a superior sleep aid, as at this point (3:30) I'm more awake than when I dosed.  Glad that I got a trial dose before purchasing."
