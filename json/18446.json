  "A long time ago I found some Effexor XR pills on the ground. I did a little research and took maybe 20mg at school one day. Felt empty, zombified, blank, etc.",
  "I came home from school and smoked a bowl of pot. I lay in bed with my eyes closed for a long time just groovin. I opened my eyes and saw colors and patterns moving all over the place. Identical to a mushroom experience. Effexor + cannabis = trippin balls. Very intense."
