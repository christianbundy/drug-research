 "report": "<p>I have a history of drug abuse and depression. Recently the depression became very hard to bear. This morning I was downer that I thought possible. Closer to suicide or violent behaviour than ever.</p><p>I have 1/2 an ounce of Tabernanthe Iboga root bark somewhere at home. I took shredded / powdered root.  Very soon, I felt something seeting up. Twenty minutes letter, I felt some kind of a stimulation. Then I was 'normal' again. I was baseline, being able to concentrate, not depressed any more. I wasnt euphoric or stimulated, I felt energetic but in a natural way, able to feel the tiredness, but concentrated on the things to do. I'm impressed. This plant is really powerful. I have remained under the level of psychoactive effects, but even like this, I can see why this plant is so respected. The bad side is that it is a bit hard on the stomach.</p>",
