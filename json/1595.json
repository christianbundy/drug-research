 "report": [
  "A woman I know whom I obtained the pill from has MS, and the Provigil is perscribed so that she may have the energy to do more.",
  "I have taken roughly 100mg each time and have found it to be quite enjoyable.  It is a stimulant (sorry, little euphoric value at this dose) without the adverse reactions to amphetamine (similar to caffiene) There is SLIGHT (insignificant, at least in my case) increase in heart rate, and not too much trouble to get to sleep.",
  "There was a strong urge to be productive.  As previously mentioned, slight euphoria.",
  "I've smoked pot with no ill effects several times.",
  "They don't come around often, so I never have a large and/or steady supply, so I can't comment on addiction potential.  Pharmokinetic reports I've read (www.rxlist.com) noted that modafinil does NOT affect the typical stimulant receptors, and that it screws around with some liver enzymes.  Interesting report, you should read it if your a pharmacology buff :-)",
  "It also mentioned many times it acted similar to methylphenidate (Ritalin), pharmacologically."
