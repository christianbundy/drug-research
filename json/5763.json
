 "report": "<p>I was prescribed 20 mg per day.  My doctor told me that this medication was non-addictive.  Even when I described the physical and mental effects I was experiencing from withdrawl, she insisted that this was due only to the bodies struggle to rid itself of a chemical. If this is not addiction then what is? It soon became obvious to me that, after taking the pills for a month, the patient knows far more about them that the doctor and they are, in effect, on their own.</p><p>Two weeks ago I took my last half-tablet after gradually reducing the amount I was taking. The side-effects I have experienced are as follows:</p><p>1. Panic attacks far worse than I experienced before going onto the drug.</p><p>2. disorientation and trouble keeping my balance.</p><p>3. Involuntary crying and the feeling that I cannot cope with the slightest problem.</p><p>4. Depression and sleeplessness.</p><p>5. Stomach cramps and sickness.</p><p>6. Dizziness when standing up.</p><p>7. Tiredness and mood swings.</p><p>I am posting this message because the withdrawl of this so-called non-addictive drug made me feel as though this was my 'normal' state I was returning to. As though this disorientation, that made me feel 'crazy' and out-of-touch with the world was how I was going to feel forever. But this is not the case as i am realising as the time since taking my last tablet increases. My father took Vallium in the sixties and was told at the time it was a non-addictive drug. This is now obviously not the case and I wonder if, in time, the same might be true of paroxetine. The withdrawl effects are severe enough to warrant further tests I'm sure.</p>",
