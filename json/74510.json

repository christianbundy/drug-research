 "report": "<p>I'm a high school kid with way too watchful parents, but I enjoy a good buzz. I am always looking for nice legal highs, and I read up on Lactuca virosa, and I was intrigued. It grows all around my house in central New York, so I pick a bunch, and diced it up really fine, then dried it using a lamp. I made a quick water bong and proceeded to pack and hit it. The sensation came immediately, I felt relaxed and focused, I listened to some Rammstein, which sounded amazing, and felt a distinct body buzz.</p>",
