 "report": [
  "I took 2 pills for the initial dose.  After 45 minutes, I did not feel anything, so I took 3 more.  30 minutes later, still no affect on me whatsoever.  So I said, 'What the hell?' and took the remaining 5.  I eventually started to feel real shaky, and this lasted all night long, to the extent were I could not sleep at all.  The shakiness that I felt was about the equivalance of a couple of diet pills that contain ephedrine.  I felt extremely nauseous, but since the herbal E wasn't doing anything, I had also began to drink, so I'm not sure if it was the herbal E, alcohol, or the combination of the 2 that made me feel queasy.  I paid $25 for 10 pills that only resulted in shakiness, insomnia, and nausea.  In other words, if it seems to good to be true, then it is."
