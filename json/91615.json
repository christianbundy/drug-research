 "report": "<p>Well I was in a bad mood in the morning so I decided to take 50mg (half a pill) of 5-HTP by mixing it in a sprite soda and drinking it. About an hour later my mood got significantly better. About two hours later being the impulsive idiot that I am I decided to have more. I mixed up another 50mg (the remaining pill) and drank it down with another Sprite. About 45 minutes later my face started getting extremely hot. I first disregarded it as nothing until I felt my blood pressure rise like never before. It felt like my head was being stuffed full of paper. Then my heart started beating faster then I have ever felt it causing the worst palpitations.</p><p>Basically I got random strikes of high blood pressure and palpitations during the days which stop after 3 days.</p><p>I got extremely worried I was going to have a heart attack and felt chest pain. Always read up on anything you take and just because it's an amino acid doesn't make it a free ride.</p>",
