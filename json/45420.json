 "report": "<p>This stuff is good! I just bought some Yerba Mate teabags from. It was flavored with a blend of orange peel and cinnamon. Wakes me up! Gives me great mental clarity and alertness, yet it manages to calm me down. I brought a waterbottle of iced yerba to work today (I simply put a teabag in a waterbottle, and shook it up. Then let it steep for like 10 minutes), and I found it kept me on the ball with what I was doing, like tea would, but it was much more relaxing. Good stuff, and great tasting too.</p>",
