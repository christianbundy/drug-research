  "My friend told that nutmeg can get you pretty high, almost like weed. Having nothing better to do on my Saturday I figured.. why not? We each took 3 *heaping* tablespoons full, around 4 in the afternoon. When we went to some local bars around 7. I was starting to feel some effects, I felt pretty relaxed, almost felt like how it feels right before I start rolling.",
  "Around 10 the effects were still pleasent, but I was starting to feel detatched from reality, I could'nt really concentrate on anything. We went home around 11, I started feeling nautious but was able to crash out on his couch. I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, I felt like I was burning up. I was very confused. I hardly knew where I was, but somehow stumbled into the bathroom where I dry heaved in the toilet.",
  "The next thing I knew, I woke up with my arm IN the toilet! I have no idea how long I had been passed out. I heard some friends outside on the front lawn. I went outside to say I needed help, but every few steps I took, I would pass out. Whenever I stood up I would get dizzy and fall over. I dry heaved again and finally *crawled* my way from the driveway to the lawn, where my 2 friends were.",
  "I hardly knew which way was up; I fell over sideways on the lawn, yelling at them that I needed help. They thought it was hilarious, but I seriously thought I was going to die. Anyhow they calmed me down and I sat outside with them for a few minutes. My friend who I took the nutmeg with, said he was alright and didn't feel sick. The cool air made me feel a little better, and calmed me down.",
  "I went back to sleep and woke up around 7. I still felt sick and detatched from reality, but knew I was going to be okay. It took me a full day to feel normal again. My friend found his toilet paper holder broken the next day! I guess I broke it when I passed out."
