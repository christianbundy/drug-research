  "I had read in a survival manual about how my Indian relatives had made blow guns from Arundo donax. Then shortly thereafter I came upon a Sufiuasca reference and theorized that, with passion flower as the MAOI inhibitor, it was a lost medicine of Southeastern U.S. Indians.  Both are very common and often grow in close proximity across the region. So Sufi style I made a shisha with both herbs and on a warm Texas night me and four others experienced something revolutionary and ancient at the same time.  Almost instantly I could feel it and 10 minutes into it the body buzz was heavy and pulsating while my head was clear.  An hour into the trip the classic tryptamine sensations coursed through the body and colors were altered.  Later at the local coffee house the tendency to sit still with a clear head and soak up the surroundings was inescapable.  After 5 hours of this it eased off with no ill effects.  It has been a beautiful discovery because the cane and passionflowers grow all over the south and west and is easily made into smoke or tea.  Spread the Jahlove ",
