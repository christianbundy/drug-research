 "report": "<p>My friends and I have been experimenting with 2c-i for the last several weeks.  Our last trip was a good example.  I will describe three psychonauts:</p><p>1.  (Yours truly) A 220-lb male, who took 16mg</p><p>2.  A 180-lb male, 12mg.  Had just done two lines of cocaine.</p><p>3.  A 210-lb male, 17.5 mg</p><p>4.  A 110-lb female, 12mg</p><p>All ingested at about 7:30 pm on an empty stomach.  First effects were noted sooner than anticipated at about thirty minutes, manifested by a feeling of energy and a tendency to grin and giggle.  At about 45 minutes, mild nausea was encountered.   Subject 2 vomited once.  (He mentioned that cocaine makes him nauseous at times). </p><p>Visuals started at about the 1 hour mark and were most enjoyable for about 2-3 hours.   A simple pattern on the TV screen seemed to shift and change color.  A rhinestone on subject 4's shoe seemed to be animated.   Subject 3 saw rich patterns in the clouds.  Subject 1 noted that everything seemed to take on an extra dimension.  Pictures seemed three-dimensional.  A Buddha statue seemed alive.</p><p>Subjects were for the most part giggly and euphoric.  Subject 2 even with the reduced dose seemed slightly overwhelmed by it all.  Subject 1 noted that it was easy to perceive the emotional state of others, but not easy to vibe with that state necessarily.  </p><p>Effects lasted until about 3am.  Difficult to fall asleep.  The next morning, vision seemed off, with poor depth perception. </p><p>Our recommendations:</p><p>1.  A peron might have to try this substance at least twice to get a good feel for it.</p><p>2. 12mg is a good dose for a lightweight, 15-17.5 for a big boy.   Enough is as good as a feast.  Take it all at once if you plan to get any sleep at all. </p><p>3.  If you have a sensitive stomach, think about taking some ginger or cannibis prior to dropping 2c-i.</p><p>4.  Don't even think about driving until 18 h post dose. </p><p>5.  Alcohol just covers up the effects and makes the trip much less enjoyable.  Cocaine might accentuate the body load.</p><p>6.  Don't take this and go someplace where people fight a lot.  You will consistently underestimate how much your spastically peppy euphoria is irritating the other people at the bar.</p><p>Subject 2 was not impressed.  1, 3, and 4 however felt the experience was beautiful. </p><p>This is not a deep experience, or maybe it is.  Here is what I think it all means. </p><p>We live in the midst of almost unbearable beauty, every day, all the time.  We simply choose not to see it.  Look closely at a child's eyes sometime.  They are incredibly bright and clear.  Imagine how beautiful colors look through those eyes.  How amazing a butterfly must seem, through those eyes.  How rich the imagery in clouds.  How brilliant lights are.   That's what it is like.</p>",
