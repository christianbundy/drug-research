 "report": "<p>I have in the past year stayed clear from mdma and sought less physically taxing ways to have a good time. I found a product called 5-htp , before taking it I did some major research and found in to be on the whole beneficial. 3 months after trying various doses, i have found out the following.</p><p>1. The most important factor is stimulus. 5-htp works far better if I am having a few drinks with mates, or nightclubbing.</p><p>2. Taking on an empty stomach provides more desired effects. (euphoria)</p><p>3. 100mg gives a stamina boost. 200mg gives euphoria, anything higher increases the risk of nausea.</p><p>4. It will never match mdma for pure happiness, but it provides a good compromise.</p><p>5. Personal experience, increased audio awareness, increase smell sensitivity and light sensitivity.</p>",
