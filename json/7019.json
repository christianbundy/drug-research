 "report": [
  "I was prescribed a daily dosage of 30mg of Prednisone and bought the prescription reluctantly.",
  "I took the dosage prescribed and felt the effects within 20 minutes, noticing first the sort of 'speedy' feeling and the very slight tightness in my stomach. During the onset I found that two random activities (drawing with charcoal and a real time strategy game I haven't touched in years) were a lot more fun than they normally are, I spent about an hour on each with a smile on my face the whole time. Never did I feel 'high', just a lot more intensely stimulated and a little mood-swung.",
  "As the hours went by, the feeling spread out into a more smoooth experience as far as physical sensation. About an hour after quitting my activities, the stomach tightness and 'speediness' were gone."
