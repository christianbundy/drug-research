  "I bought 2 grams of JWH-018 and me and my friend decided to give it a try.  I placed a few little crumbs in the pipe on some ash and proceeded to hit it, not a bad taste.  My friend hit it with a few new crumbs.  I put a piece on that was probably 2 or 3 miligrams and hit it, wow really tasted it that time.  My friend hit a piece about the same size. ",
  "I started feeling like I had to move constantly, I started tripping balls and my friend said he was too.  I started thinking that I had severely ODed on this stuff it felt like ketamine and salvia hit me both at the same time and lasted 45 minutes if not a little longer.  I threw up hardcore like 6 times but my friend did not believe because he had not eaten, and every time I threw up I would still be tripping.  The only thing I could do was drink plenty of water and hope it would end shortly. ",
  "I am finding the legal stuff is far stronger then what is illegal.  What is going on? I wonder how long until someone dies on this and it is made illegal, because I seriously think if someone took over 50 or 75 miligrams of the stuff I had they would not be in good shape.  All I have to say is those who are not careful when dosing will regret it severely."
