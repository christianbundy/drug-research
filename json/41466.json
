 "report": "<p>After 10 days of waiting, the mail order piracetam finally came.  I downed four 800mg capsules with a 250mg choline chaser right before leaving for school, in hopes of improving my finals.  The literature I read said not to expect much feeling from the piracetam, for it isn't meant to 'fuck you up.'  That was a very true statement, because I didn't necessarily feel too different....just......better.</p><p>I felt like I had just been sick for a few days (even though I wasn't) and the sickness left.  It was the 'I feel like a million bucks' type of feeling.  The fog in my brain had lifted.  I even wanted to talk to people for the first time in a while.</p>",
