 "report": "<p>I was unable to find much information about TMA-2 except for a few patchy trip reports and Shulgin's info about it in Phikal...so here is my understanding of this substance and what it is like.</p><p>I was going to subcutaneously inject (below the skin, a technique that has worked with 2-CB quite nicely...at least more nicely than snorting it!) but the material wouldn't dissolve. It was like a more kind of powdery organic compound than 2-CB.</p><p>So I took 12.5mg orally...it tasted a bit like herbal washing up powder, and then 45 minutes later snorted the other 12.5mg. This didn't hurt really at all...though the powder was quite thick.</p><p>15 minutes later the substance began to come on and took about 30 minutes to come up to a baseline. It was very clear the material I had was very clear and pure...and I concluded very quickly: this is basically just like mescaline, with more focused twinges to it perhaps. There is the same clarity, mindfullness and clean 'high' of Mescaline. I was walking along the empty beach...working through a few things...and it just allowed this clarity and mild psychic opening that I needed. Somewhat gentle...no real visuals...no nausea or the yawning or the physical strain I get with mescaline.</p><p>I find 2-CB more useful for deeper somatic and whole understanding of my reality. Mescaline for me has always been quite a contemplative psychedelic, though I have always taken low dosages.</p><p>I haven't tried 2CT7, I imagine it being somethign of a cross between TMA-2 and 2-CB, with wildcat elements thrown in.</p>",
