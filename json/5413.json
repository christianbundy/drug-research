  "One night my boyfriend and I were at home together and he asked me if I wanted to try some cocaine I said sure. My boyfriend took his driver license and lined up the coke. I snorted one line first I didnt get a rush or anything so I decided to do some more. I snorted two more lines I felt a little different my heart rate speeded up but I wasnt at all talkative or wanting to run around like a five year old. I sat down watched some TV and about 45 minutes after snorting the coke I went to sleep, the next day I felt fine no headache or anything.",
  "About two months later my boyfriend had some more so I decided to do it again thinking the first time was a fluke I snorted four lines and again I dont see the big deal with coke. I have absolutely no desire to do it again. It had to be good coke because my boyfriend has been snorting for a while and he was messed up. I guess Im one of the lucky ones who didnt get addicted."
