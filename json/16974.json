  "Since the very first time i had heard of research chemicals, i had wanted to try them very much.  One day a friend of mine told me about a site that you could order several chemicals from.  i didnt really have too much of a preference with which one to get, but he wanted to get 2c-i.  he described to me that it was very similar in chemical structure to mescaline, and also that there was an mdma type of effect as well.  the order came about 5 weeks later.",
  "I decided that i would buy a digi to weigh out the doses.  i planned for the digi to go over 2 decimal places.  .02 would equal about 20mg which i read was the preffered dose.  the only digi i could find only went over one decimal place, so i planned to weigh out .1g which would equal 5 doses that i could split up.  it didnt work out that way.  the shits way too sticky or something because it didnt register at all on my digi.  \r[Erowid Note: For substances active at such a small dose, measuring techniques described here are particularly unwise. See related article]",
  "For my first dose, i just smeared some on my finger and put it on my toungue.  it took about 1 hour and a half to kick in.  there were nice trails and some dots of color, but the visuals were very minimal.  the mdma like effect i found to be very nice.  i felt love towards everything.  since it has an mdma like effect, its a stimulant so sleeping was not possible that night.",
  "The next time i dosed, i put the 2c-i in a vitamin c pill that i had broken apart.  im not sure if vitamin c potentiates the trip at all, but i figured it wouldnt hurt.  i took one 1000mg vitamin c pill after taking the dose of 2c-i.  im sure i did a lot this time, however i dont have much of an idea on how much i took.  i had eaten that day so it took very long to kick in.  aproxamintly 2 hours and 15 minutes. ",
  "The first thing i notice was a slight speedy feeling, folowed by very very faint dots of color.  i occasionally checked my pupils until they finally showed signs of dialation.  the visual trails were more intense this time, and i enjoyed them very much.  there were slight shapes that were very faintly colored.  they looked kinda like interlocking eyes. this night i found it very hard to sleep but managed to get a little bit of sleep eventually. ",
  "I also found out that tripping 2 days in a row is possible, unlike most of the other hallucinogenics that im aware of.      ",
  "I belive that 2c-i is a lot of fun, however i dont think it as is potent as i thought it had been made out to be.  im not dissapointed at all though."
