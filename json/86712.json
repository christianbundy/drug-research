 "report": "<p>I've been prescribed mirtazapine for sleep, and I assume un-mentioned depression, and had the dosage halved recently because I would basically wake up in the morning and pass out uncontrollably. In the past few days I've been smoking a bit of bud, as per what I do every now and again, and dropped the 7.5mg at about 8pm, and 10 minutes after a cone.</p><p>Later, I was laying in bed watching a movie, when I was hit by a massive euphoria wave, which made me want to fall asleep. I've been practicing with inducing lucid dreaming for a while, now, and I guess I fell into quite a few physchodelic lucid dreams, because for about 2 hours before I fell asleep, my vision would slowly blur into a screen of patterns and etc; I don't even know what I was seeing, and would jolt myself away with massive surges of euphoria that lasted what seemed like days.</p><p>I've heard of other people saying that smoking weed on them will make them trip balls, but this was nothing like I've ever come across. It felt almost like an LSD-type-feeling, but amplified by nitros? Iunno.</p>",
