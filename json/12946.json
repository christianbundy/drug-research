 "report": [
  "I suffered from severe depression and terrible anxiety/fear for so long. Nothing took it away and my mind troubled me so much.",
  "My first time I took 1 1/2 tsp. of 5x extract. After just a little while I saw things like I've never seen before. Everything seemed right and I felt like I just woke up from being dead for so long. My anxiety was dead and I felt positive about everything. It made me excited when I was at work and my mind felt so steady. It also made me feel slightly feverish. About 5 or 6 hours after ingestion I started to itch all over but it was pretty minor. I felt a wave of nausea for a couple seconds and then it would stop randomly and 20 minutes later the nausea completely took over and I almost vomited. After a half hour or so I felt a lot better and I went to bed. The next day I felt just like I did before ingesting the kratom the previous day with a good mood overall.",
  "After the first time of taking kratom I have no nausea at all and very minor itching.",
  "Kratom was a dream come true for me and I will definitely continue it."
