 "report": "<p>I read through the JWH-018 vault and did not see any mention of a method I've been using with good result.  I acquired 1g of JWH-018 as well as 4 ounces of damiana with a gram or so of dried peppermint, and a quart of acetone.</p><p>The procedure was simple: Put the damiana in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Dissolve the JWH-018 in the acetone, and pour the solution into the baking dish. Allow time to dry. I waited 2 days and stired the leaves several times each day to allow the acetone plenty of time to evaporate.</p><p>I am left with 4 ounces of damiana that contains 10mg/g JWH-018/Damiana. This makes for an easily measurable substrate that yields a decent high from a .3g bowl.</p>",
