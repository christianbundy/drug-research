 "report": "<p>At a party and decided to try the Benzo fury that I had been given as a free sample. Not my usual substance of interest as I prefer perception expanding substances. Was expecting that I would drink less ! Anyway, had the pill in two doses broken in half and taken with about an hour between doses.</p><p>All was well and I enjoyed the effect which was easily managed. However, jaw tension started and I really wanted to bite my teeth together, it was uncomfortable and made me feel self-conscious.</p><p>This was not a problem at first, but after a week the jaw tension and desire to chatter and grind my teeth was quite alarming. Also I had to consciously relax my mouth when talking, one person actually thought that I had my tongue pierced, because of the way I was speaking (this was quite amusing).</p><p>The positive did not in my opinion outweigh the negative. Wont be tempted to try this substance again.</p><p>13 days later and I am still feeling the uncomfortable jaw effect, although it has diminished greatly!</p><p>I'm sure that I have had an unusual reaction, however, this has not happened to me before and I have tested many psychedelic substances.</p>",
