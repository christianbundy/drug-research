 "report": "<p>I am an experienced drug taker. Use of Cannabis for years, numerous experiences with LSD, Mushrooms, Mescaline, MDMA, 2c research chemicals, DMT, Salvia.  Basically if you can trip on it I have tried it. It was this level of experience and the fact that the initial dose did so little that I choose to take the amount of NBOME I took that night. Although the general consensus of the internet is that this chemical is active in the microgram range, and milligram doses such as the one described in the trip report are dangerous. This chemical seems to differ from LSD in that a high dose really does have the potential to cause serious physical symptoms, so use caution trippers. My source for the 2C-I-NBOMe is trusted and known for reliability, but it also possible I received a mislabeled package due to the high amount (4 mg) I was able to take. Smaller doses seem to be causing serious side effects in many people. But I still feel its important to share this story. Perhaps some people just require a higher dose. This drug did not feel like anything I have taken before.</p><p>I revived a 50 mg sample of 2C-I-NBOMe from my source, but was very anxious about this particular chemical. Although I had read much about it online for a while before ordering, having such a volatile chemical in my possession made me pause. Despite my extensive psychedelic experience something about this stuff was giving me a bad vibe. Still after a few weeks I was feeling brave and I decided it was time. I weigh out 1 mg of NBOME and insufflate it. I feel nothing as it goes up my nose, probably because 1 mg is such a small amount. Such a small amount I have to look twice to make sure I actually snorted it. I am generally not a fan of snorting substances, but the idea of not swallowing for an extended period seemed unpleasant.</p><p>I smoke some cannabis as I wait for the effects to come on. Within 10-15 minutes I am starting to feel something more than weed going on. A very mild euphoria begins to creep over me, and colors begin to look brighter. This persists at a baseline level for about an hour, and I am feeling disappointed. I am definitely tripping but it is a mild one, like eating less than a gram of mushrooms. With this dose I was expecting a strong experience as many blotters containing this substance contain nowhere near 1 mg per dose. I am not feeling any sort of body load or sickness like some have described. So I decide to try a bit more. This time I try holding 2 mg under my tongue. Just as I had suspected I find the process disgusting. The substance has a very unique taste that almost numbs your tongue. But I am able to hold out for 15 minutes.</p><p>As I hold it in my mouth I feel things beginning to intensify. I begin to notice an enhancement in music that had not come out before, and think to myself as I reach the higher dose that I can see why people are selling this as acid. Although, I would still prefer LSD when given the choice, and this should not be misrepresented as acid.</p><p>The trip has definitely been taking into another gear at this point. I receive a text from my friend and cannot even read it because the letters are going everywhere. Somehow I manage to text back but at that point I decide dealing with the outside world is just too much at this point and I pack another bowel and enjoy some more music. The visuals when I close my eyes are vivid neon and seem to be dancing to the beat of the music. Like others have described this does not like a more potent version of 2c-I, it has its own unique traits.</p><p>6 hours in and effects are still going strong. Still, I decide to mix in some Ketamine and one final 1 mg bump of NBOME with my evening. I prefer to only use Ketamine when tripping on something else to really bring out its magic. I insufflate 200 mg, and within minutes I am feeling the typical couch lock associated with Ketamine use. I also notice my visuals intensifying. I find myself enthralled with the patterning on a wood cabinet. John Lilly often described the alien presence felt on Ketamine, and all of the sudden I felt it too. The presence of something not human seemed to be suddenly in my thoughts. It began to ask me all sorts of questions, about me, what I believed and why. I literally spent an hour staring at a cabinet while I had a conversation with this thing in my head.</p><p>As the K-hole ended the voice faded, and I dared to try to move a limb. I packed another bowel and tried to take in what had just happened. But I found it hard to even recall a good deal of the conversation. Like a DMT trip you can forget it so quickly, and normally I can remember my k experience a little more.</p><p>The NBOMe lasted through the night into the next morning, about 12 hours total. As I said earlier this is a high dose. But it should be known that doses of a few mg are fine for some people. But there are also stories of doses will below 1 mg creating a strong experience. It seems this chemicals dose may vary allot according to the person. With other psychedelics I do not consider myself to be extremely tolerant. A few grams of mushrooms or a few good hits of LSD are plenty for me to trip. Yet with 25i-nbome I seemed to need a higher dose then many. I never felt any sort of body load, the experience was totally mental for me, which also seems to differ from allot of people.</p>",
