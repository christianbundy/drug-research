  "<p>Made a warm tisane using 5-10g of Mimosa flower (not the bark, and *DEFINITELY NOT* the pods/legume of the tree). This seemed to have a *very* mildly sedative effect (tastes ok too), however, please note that this was a 1 time dose & not taken chronically as it's probably supposed to be taken as. I'm still experimenting with A.j. as well as a few other psychotropic herbs. Other herbs I've been tampering with (by using the whole herb & by making my own extracts) include Bacopa m., Crocus sativus, Scutellaria baicalensis, St. John's Wort and others.</p>"
