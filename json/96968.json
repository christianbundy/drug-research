 "report": "<p>Last night, or I suppose this morning, I had my first psychedelic trip. Im an 18-year-old male whose previous drug experience was pretty meager: marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, DXM and hydrocodone. Psychedelics had always been the ones that interested me though. Until recently, I had never had the slightest idea where to buy them. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of 2C-C-NBOMe, I leaped upon it. While I had set out for one of the classic psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms for my first trip, Im glad I took the chance to experiment with this research chemical when I did.</p><p>At around 11 PM, my friend A and his friend H arrived at my house to meet my boyfriend, J, and me. A brought some marijuana which we smoked in my basement. H had never gotten high before and it was a lot of fun to watch her experience that night. We had just been smoking, talking, laughing and listening to The Avalanches, when A pulled out his wallet to show us a tiny tab over paper with ink on it that apparently was Marge Simpsons eyeball. He announced that it was 2C-C-NBOMe. Having unsuccessfully sought out psychedelic drugs for several months, I immediately offered to buy it from him, saying I would take it right away. A sold me the tab and I placed it between my gums, where I left it for about 15 minutes before swallowing. Very quickly, numbness spread through my mouth and I got a burst of energy. Unfortunately, A and H had to head home around 12:30 leaving me alone with J. I was definitely coming up when they left, about 20 minutes after taking the tab.</p><p>The very early effects were uncomfortable. My heart was beating at an alarming rate and I would get sudden bursts of energy in different parts of my body. All the weed I had smoked probably wasnt helping. I felt confused and afraid. When I looked at Js face as we lay on the couch, it assumed a bizarre and frightening look, but this quickly passed. After this, the drugs effects hit me very quickly. I understood why the psychedelic experience is so often called a trip: I found myself drifting off, feeling as though I were walking around and exploring other worlds, only to find that I still hadnt left the couch. I walked upstairs to use the bathroom and ended up staring at myself in the mirror for a while as my faces reflection bent and warped. I felt as though the part of my brain that recognized faces was malfunctioning; I didnt have the normal associations one has upon seeing a face, much less that this was my own face. Giggling, I walked out of the bathroom, and here I got very confused.</p><p>I have the strange feeling that I walked in and out of the bathroom many times in a row. Sometimes J was standing outside of it in the hall, sometimes he wasnt. I have no idea how long this went on or if it even happened. When I returned to the basement, things got even weirder. I sat at my computer and looked at dumb YouTube videos for a while, taking them completely seriously and not understanding how silly they were. Every once in a while I would look back at the couch. Sometimes J was there, sometimes he wasnt. He suggested I play Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I opened the game and decided it was a terrible idea. I just wanted to do fun, positive things. At one point, J announced that he would go upstairs to make a sandwich.</p><p>It felt like he was gone for an eternity. Time ceased to mean anything at all at this point; I looked at a clock and saw an array of hands all pointing at different hours. I believe it was around 3 by this time. I started listening to some Dan Deacon and the music euphoria was incredible. Every note became intensely meaningful and it nearly brought me to tears. Later I listened to Godspeed You! Black Emperors album 'Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven' which was probably the greatest musical experience of my life. The iTunes visualizer was spectacular. I felt sorry for J who was tired and mildly stoned and just wanted to sleep as I blasted music at top volume from my computer. He was too tired to interact with me very much but I felt very playful and I laughed and hugged and cuddled him. My vision at this point was very wavy and everything had a geometric rainbow corona around it. While the visuals were fun and interesting, on the whole the trip was much more categorized by my headspace than by visuals. Trippy things were not very interesting and I mostly wanted to look at everyday things like the floor. However, I do remember watching the video The Minds Eye 08 - Leaving the Bonds of Earth, a collation of 80s CGI shots of space and flying strung together with pretty music.</p><p>Something that I had worried about was the body load. I had heard complaints about physical discomfort after taking 2C-I-NBOMe and I hoped I wouldnt run into any problems and spoil my euphoria. Fortunately, all the negative feelings from early on left pretty quickly; they may have had more to do with the cannabis than with the 2C-C-NBOMe anyway.</p><p>The peak of the experience was the greatest moment of my life. I felt as though countless things were happening in the universe with every passing moment and by taking a psychedelic drug I had enabled myself to experience all the things I had overlooked. I no longer cared about anything at all. The thought struck me that whatever the universe/life/God wanted me to do, I would do it. I was at one with the universe/life/God. I dont know the words to describe this feeling. After puzzling for some time over how to describe the experience, I gave up and embraced it wholly. Words can only do so much. It felt as though I were in paradise, completely free from pain, from fear, and from negative thoughts. I was not feeling particularly introspective. CEVs were pretty much nonexistent and I mostly wanted to listen to music and dance. I have heard 2C-C described as an entactogen which is pretty consistent with my experience.</p><p>When I started coming down I started to feel sorry for J who obviously just wanted to get some sleep and had tired of my laughter and excessive affection. I told him I was leaving, and in his groggy state he didnt question the wisdom of my actions. I walked out of my house and headed towards a small nearby forest. I was still tripping a bit at this point and along the walk there along a local boulevard I felt wonderful. I skipped and ran much of the way, feeling incredibly good about myself. None of my problems mattered. It was around 4 or 4:30 in the morning at this point and the streets were deserted. I was a little bit scared to enter the woods in near total darkness, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. The silhouettes of leaves and branches resembled birds as I ran by them. It felt as though I was in the woods for the first time, although I had been there hundreds of times before. The woods led me to a somewhat large river. I sat down on the rocks next to it and decided to watch the sun rise. This proved to be a highlight of the experience.</p><p>Although the drug had worn off almost entirely by this point, I was left with a lovely afterglow, and phrases like Wow! constantly flashed through my head as I tried to understand what I had felt during my trip. The river was absolutely beautiful: as the sky prepared for sunrise, all the colors reflected upon the slow, serene river and I noticed they formed a rainbow, which felt simply perfect for the occasion. I heard the first bird songs begin and a pair of geese swam up very close to me, apparently not noticing my presence. A loon called. A few artificial lights blinked far away. I looked at the stones in the river. A few of them together almost spelled out acid in lower case letters, and with great joy I realized that what I had taken as my first psychedelic was not even one of the stronger ones. I had yet to try LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT...the possibilities were endless.</p><p>The sun itself appeared and rose very quickly, and I decided to head back home at that point. By now, the drug had worn off completely and I felt tired and hungry. I walked home, ate some cereal and took a short nap. J fell asleep shortly after I left and he continued to sleep until nearly 2 PM. I tried to read and while I felt I understood characters emotions and motives very well I found it very hard to focus on my book.</p><p>This experience was the best introduction to the psychedelic experience I could have hoped for. After less than stellar experiences with other drugs (except weed, which after tripping seems like a silly toy), I had worried that there was something wrong with my body and that I wouldnt be able to have the same experiences with entheogens that I had read about. I nearly cried with joy when I realized how wrong I was. This experience was both a grand declaration of the beauty of the world and an invitation to pursue advanced studies of that beauty in the future. It wasnt too much of a headfuckat least after the weed wore offand I feel I experienced a little bit of everything this wonderful class of chemicals had to offer.</p>",
