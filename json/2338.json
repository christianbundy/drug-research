  "I raised hell. I never used opiates, and am a recovering mental marijuana addict, who is currently in rehab so don't smoke. I raised hell and was givin a blood anylsis, which is still pending, these results were extremaly devastating to me. In fact I could be put in in-patient rehab. My parents think I am a heroin user now."
