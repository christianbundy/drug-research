 "report": [
  "In general I don't read junk mail, however I had heard on-line pharmacies were easy to order from.  So, one day I decide to click the link to the online pharmacy adivertisement jumbled amongst the rest of the spam in my e-mail folder.",
  "First off I am an avid drug researcher/medical journal reader when free time, at home and work, allows for it.  So, I know quite a bit about pharms and ethnobotanicals alike.  Second, I smoke marijuana a least 5 times per week, and have experimented with mushrooms, ecstacy, a few different painkillers, kanna, wild dagga, ritalin and adderall.  Out of all of these Adderall has continued to interest me, although I do not allow it to become a habit or have the constant resource to do so.",
  "With this in mind I began researching the different diet pills offered on the literally thousands of online pharmacys and attempted to find a pill with a similar effect profile to adderall..  After a few weeks I decided on didrex .  I faked my height to weight ratio and easily recieved the $80 bottle of 30 pills in a few days, I see many problems with this trasaction but thats another story.",
  "I took (chewed) my first pill the next day before work, trying not to expect anything.  In fact the drug isn't half bad.  About 10 minutes into the drive I found myself singing along to the music in my car, my heart rate was midly increased and I had mild to medium rushes of euphoria.  This euphoria is what I was hoping for, since Adderall is so effective at providing it. Once at work I was moderately concentrated, though a bit more jittery than would be the case on an ADD drug. ",
  "The surprising and not so cool part was the short duration I felt energized for.  I took the pill at 7:30 am and by 10:45 I was hungry, my stomach was actually grumbling, which does not say much for the dieting effectiveness of the pill.  On Adderall I do not have an appetite for hours and hours.  Therefore, I chewed another half of the pill and felt the effect return almost immediately.  Well, the jittery felling returned, my appetite decreased, there was no way I could have fallen asleep, but the euphoria from before was significantly reduced.  Also, I felt very mild chest pain, nothing serious, but mixed with a coffee or two some heart palpitations were felt.  Overall, I wasn't too happy with the price I paid, but they are much more effective than coffee and mild euphoria is always fun.",
  "Note on chewing:  the pills have a burning/cooling/numbing sensation and very bitter taste, and it is felt on my tounge and down my throat when I swallow.  I have also found the euphoria is not significantly decreased if I just swallow it whole..but the palpitations are decreased. I supposed it could be snorted as well, but it is a time release pill and removing the onders would not be easy.  I have also taken two with in a short period of each other while drinking yerba mate and euphoria is quite nice, good rushes and body sensations.",
  "I would say the price just barely reflects the fun involved."
