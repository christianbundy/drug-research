 "report": [
  "<p>Two tablets, I've taken first the 2c-i one (10mg), it takes about 1 hour to feel first effect, and two other hours to get on the plateu. Plateu during 4 hours, and down 1 hour. I've taken half of the 2c-t-2 (6mg) 4 hours after the 2c-i ingestion, and the second half 1 hour later.",
  "Pills bought in a smartshop (Substance sure 100%) and consommed in a goa party. I've consumed 1 beer (33cl) and 3 joints while trip, and 4 chai-tea.",
  "Onset: a lot of physical effects as transpiration, cold/hot sensation, muscular tension specially in the legs, light nausea,while moments axiety and oppression sensation. State of mind light changing with very shorts moments of fusion with the music.",
  "Plateau: transpiration and muscular tension persist, light hallucinations (little distorsions, color enhancement),enhanced feeling perception, time perception altered, little dissociative (difficult to talk in an other language). I was searching to get in a fusion with the music, this was possible only during moments (sec to min) and ther was always a come back of lucidity, muscular tension and a light oppression sentiment. Sensations were fluctuating between wellness and strange but not so pleasant. I'd to work hard to stay in a positive state.",
  "Down: while on hour moments of normal lucidity alternating with returns to an altered conscience. Physical effects quickly desappeared, leaving the body in a state of relax very pleasant. after 1h30 any effect was sensible.",
  "After: any physical down in the two days later, and neither after the down of the substance. Only point not negligeable, a sensation of heart oppression and heart fatigue, which desappeared while lying and reappeared while smoking cigarettes or joints, and under effort.",
  "Conclusion: mitigate experience, not negative, not positive. those are very long substances (particular 2c-i), and the effects are not sensationals, i'd really dislike the heart oppresion ,during the 24 hours succeding the ingestion, beacause I haven't had an important physical experience (like dancing all night long,...) so it make me suspicious.</p>"
