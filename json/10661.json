  "I just wanted to corroborate the use of Visine as a false negative producer when faced with a drug test. I smoked May 13 rather heavily then took my test 9am the next morning, adding approximately 5mL Visine to a 60mL urine sample. I was stunned when the test came back negative. I did not drink copious amounts of water of do anything different other than the adulterant. I also do not use any other drugs."
