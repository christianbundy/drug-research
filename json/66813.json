 "report": "<p>I few days ago I posted a report on Intramuscular injecting 2c-b. The results from a 25mg dose were rather overwhelming and somewhat unpleasant.  I tried again with approximately 5mg (my scale only does 100th's of a gram so measured out 10mg and divided it in half). I then set it aside for later.</p><p>I started the day with an experiment with an IM injection of mdma. I was listening to a lecture by Nick Sand where he talked about splitting a 120-140mg dose into two halves and injecting them 10 minutes apart. I decided to start small so Injected 50mg. the wave of euphoria was so intense that I waited an hour before doing another 50mg. As the second dose came on I took 300 mics of LSD.</p><p>T 4:00 </p><p>After going for a walk I mixed up the 2c-b shot (5mg) and administered it. There was an abrupt start in bright beautiful visuals. I hadn't gotten any the whole day, it was like hitting an 'on' button.</p><p>The 2c-b intensified the difficult emotional trip I was having. I went into this trip trying to work out some personal issues and this helped me confront the things that terrorize my subconscious.</p><p>5mg is much more pleasant than 25mg. I still want to try an even smaller dose, and from a baseline. My muscles feel sore near the injection site. I think I was too blown away the first time to notice the next day.</p><p>This combination lasted a total of 14 hours. it's the next morning  and my serotonin feels a bit depleted. I've decided to take a break from my mind voyages for a little while.</p>",
