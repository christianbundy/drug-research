  "I am curious to know if anyone else has had the pleasure of experiencing intense psychedelic hallucinations when coming down from E and smoking pot. These trips are more intense than any mushroom or salvia trip I usually have and also are the most enjoyable.  I have been fortunate enough to experience this effect since my first ecstasy experience and like to refer to it as my 'bonus trip'.  Recently I had my most memorable, intense, and profound bonus trip.",
  "My boyfriend and I had just come home from a psy-trance 'rave' and we were both feeling a little cracked out/tired from an ecstasy induced night of dancing and partying.  As usual, we smoked a few bowls to chill out and headed for bed.  As we lay down, I looked over at the lamp next to our bed, and it was moving back and forth in a wavy pattern.  I was not alarmed because I had become accustomed to these E/pot hallucinations. But tonight I was in for a real treat.",
  "I tried to relax and get some rest but as I looked up at the wall I encountered a long, cartoon like green snake with the ac/heating vent posing as its mouth.  Now things were starting to get a little weirder than I was used to.  I closed my eyes again and who comes along?  Of course, its the white rabbit asking me to go down the rabbit hole!  Ok I thought, never being one to miss an adventurous opportunity.  Looking back up at the ceiling, it became covered in a rainbow of mosaic tiles gracefully moving in a wave motion.  Wow this was great! ",
  "As the mosaics continued around the room, I became entranced and started to focus on the large wall next to my bed.  At first there were more mosaics but then I seemed to receive a telepathic message from someone/thing that this wall was my personal 'TV' and I could see whatever I wanted to.  Soon there were beautiful pink, orange, and yellow flower patterns.  The telepathic communication continued and I became 'one' with some other being.  I dont know if it was another person or what but we shared feelings of comfort, happiness, and love.  ",
  "Suddenly, I saw and felt my body become a translucent hollow vessel with complex mathematical formulas being passed in and out of me.  I didn't understand what these formulas meant or why they were going through me.  This started to freak me out a little bit and I started to repeat 'I don't understand, I don't understand'.  My poor boyfriend, all tired and cracked out tried to help, but just couldn't get on my level. ",
  "After this passed I relaxed again for a while and decided to head to the bathroom.  My normally white shower curtain had diagonal moving stripes of pink and green.  Pretty cool I thought.  The colorful visuals continued as I climbed back in bed.  Luckily up to this point I had been pretty relaxed and was prepared to handle what I was experiencing.  Laying back down my eye caught the green light of the fire-detector.  This green light transformed into a model of the telepathic connections between all living things.  The revelation occurred that if everyone was aware of this connection, great things could be accomplished just by 'thinking' about them.  Doesn't make much sense now, but at the time it was real intense yet comforting.",
  "What happened after that is maybe one of the strangest things I have ever experienced.  I stepped inside my brain and low-and-behold it was composed of millions of small colorful boxes representing every brain cell.  The boxes suddenly spilled out all of their contents and everything I had ever known became all jumbled into a sense-less mess.  Old memories were combined with recent events, nothing made any sense! I didn't know what to think.  At this point I exclaimed to my boyfriend 'I am going to need a serious psychiatric evaluation after this trip'.  Not getting any response form him, I tried to comfort myself my saying that the human brain cell is the most intelligent brain cell on the planet and they are smart enough to find their way back to their proper home. ",
  "Several more hours of colorful hallucinations passed.  I slowly started to come back to reality and was  relieved when I could finally close my eyes and not see any crazy visions and get some rest.  I was mentally and emotionally exhausted.   This was one trip I will never forget.  I have asked other people if this happens to them and have noticed that more females experience this than males.  I would love to hear other people's ecstasy/pot hallucinations.  Its a great bonus tripbuy one ticket, get two rides!"
