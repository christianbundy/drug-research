 "report": [
  "I have taken Neo Doves in pill format, Mephedrone and Methylene previously - but this was my first go at 4-FMP/4FA.",
  "The plastic envelope for 1g of this compound reads:",
  "4-FMP/4-FA",
  "1-(4-Fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine Purity:98.2+%",
  "I inhaled a very thin line [50 mg approx.] as this was my first time and the pain was excruciating, more so than any of the others mentioned above  I thought my nose was bleeding!  But it wasnt.  After a few long seconds the area between my teeth and nose went slightly numb, and then teeth felt a bit sore. ",
  "Also, it left a vestige smell of burnt plastic in my nose, which was disconcerting to say the least.  We got this from our usual source so I think this is just the natural smell of the compound, but maybe Im wrong?  The smell went away quickly.",
  "I only inhaled 50 mg but it was enough to get a mild and pleasant rush of energy.  After about 5 minutes, I could feel it moving down my throat and feeling sort of refreshing.  I had a runny nose for sometime.",
  "I dont think Id be able to snort much more than a couple of lines  next time I think Ill bomb 100mg, but initial impression is good.",
  "Got slightly anxious after a couple of hours and had absolutely no appetite until the next day (I took it at 16:00)  had some difficulty sleeping too."
