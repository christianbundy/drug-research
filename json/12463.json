  "This is my story in terms or marijuana. I believe it's a shame that such a negative light is show on something that has significantly affected my life for the better and the lifes of those in similar situations that I have met. I developed cancer when I was 16. I quickly dropped 40 lbs due to chemotherapy and was givin the gift of marijuana by one of my friends when I hadnt been able to eat for 3 days b/c of recent treatments. It worked like a charm and I was able to eat regularly and keep my body healthy because of it. I gained 30 of those 40 lbs back in the 3 months following that day. I had more energy, I was able to workout regularly and it fully changed the life I was living. Despite missing a whole year of school I was able to catch up and graduate with my class with a 3.9 GPA. Now cancer free I attribute much of my recovery to marijuana."
