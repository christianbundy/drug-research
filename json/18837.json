  "I have yet to talk with someone who has fully experienced the leaves of the Divine Virgin that does not believe there are further dimensions awaiting us in the afterlife.",
  "Within her initial terror, she shows us there is no real fear and thus makes us strong. She twists us down canyons and pulls us through galaxies to show us our true home. The image of mother and being unashamed cradling the inevitability. A thousand universes cut through all life and make us realize its unity. Her children may yet again return to play in thier garden on the earth, but they will always remember their mother.... who awaits to give them birth.",
  "Salvia divinorum is a very curious plant. Please proceed only if you are well prepared to experience the infinite."
