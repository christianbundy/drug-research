  "Well, I had never tried Ambien or even looked for it before really. My vice of choice has always been pills, mostly xanax and painkillers. So when I got ahold of 5 10mg ambien, I said what the hell and decided to try them out.",
  "Things went much different than I expected. I took the first 10mb pill at about 5:30 in the afternoon. After about 40 minutes, I still wasn't really feeling much. So, knowing at the time it was a bad idea, I started to drink a little. So of course after I got a little buzzed, I took two more of the 10s. I think I must have continued drinking to some degree because after this I have only flashes of the next 8 hours. Anyways... turns out I called damn near everyone I know at some point during the blackout-like state. There's no telling what I was talking about to them. At about 2am, someone came over to my house and woke me up. I had the most bizarre feeling like i was seeing everything out a window or something. (Thats the only way i can describe it.) I thought this was all fine and dandy, until I woke up the next day. I felt like total ass the WHOLE day, from the time I woke up until the time I went back to sleep. My reactions were considerably slow and my head felt *really* funny. The short version: Dont drink and take ambien."
