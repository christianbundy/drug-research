 "report": "<p>It was Saturday night me and my friend were really bored. We wanted to find a high. At two in the morning we were looking through websites. We had heard of nutmeg before but had doubted it. We thought we would try it.</p><p>We knew that it was common to ingest nutmeg with a drink but thought it would be cool to experiment with smoking it. We had about 2 grams each for each spliff. It burned well and produce a tastefull aroma. 15 minutes later after a couple of spliffs we began to feel a relaxed state of mild euphoria. Sense were slightly impaired but it was good because there were no side effects exept for a pleasurable drowsyness.</p><p>Next day, sunday morning we thought we would try to go for a high. This time we wanted to experiment snorting the ground nutmeg. I had about 2 grams first, I felt very drowsy because the effect of snorting was almost instant. Half hour later we both snorted about 4/5 grams in one go. We felt extremely stoned extremely quickly. The recreational effects were shortlived and I don't recommend snorting unless in lots of small doses. Snorting induced extreme tiredness and gave head achces- took about 4 hours to recover fully.</p><p>Smoking nutmeg yet it is a pleasurable experience. The smoke is thick but tastes good.</p><p>We are both around 105 pounds or 7+ Stone.</p>",
