  "Two close friends were experiencing urgings for a cigarette after quitting smoking.",
  "I had the idea of picking some fresh Nicotiana rustica leaves, and getting my friends to rub them on areas of skin that receive lots of blood flow, particularly at the base of the wrists and elbow, like how Mazatec shamans use it.",
  "All 3 of us did so. My friends felt a subtle shift, and then had no desire to smoke. I, being a non smoker, felt a subtle shift, and some heat prickling sensations in my scalp and face.",
  "This 'au natural' method of tobacco use provides a natural alternative to tobacco patches or gum."
