 "report": "<p>My expierence with Icey XXX and other spice products has changed my life in such a positive way I feel like I don't know what I ever did without it. This relaxing substance has become my exscape from a very stressful life. I work a very fast faced job that is very taxing on my body. The overwelming joy that this little bag brings me undescribable. I have been useing this substance in very small amounts for about a year now and after all the research and all this time I am convinced it is a miracle. I am a lawful person. I do not break the law and never will. The effects of certain brands I use to plan my activities. If I have somthing important to do I use a shorter acting spice like Smoke or Bonsaid Blend. But if I want a stronger longer lasting product I use ICEY XXX or Spice Diamond. It does not seem addictive, and it doesn't really bother me if I run out for a couple weeks. It's like cold lemonade on a hot summer day.</p>",
