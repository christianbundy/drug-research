  "I wanted to try using St. Johns wort for general anxiety. I bought some last night and per the instructions on the bottle took two 300 mg tablets. I'm supposed to do this 3 times a day but I don't see how it wouldn't kill me. My blood pressure skyrocketed to 170 over 95 (I checked it just before this submission) and I've been sweating like a pig.",
