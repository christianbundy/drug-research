 "report": "<p>I wanted to share my story for those out there looking to try oxycontin. I am a skinny short girl who started out using marijuana everyday and then in 1999 I got pregnant so I stopped but then I had severe back pain due to being born with spina bifada so my doctor put me on 750mg. vicodin, while I was six months pregnant.</p><p>Since I had my first child, in 1999, I then tried oxycontin starting with 10mg.  I saw the doctor every three months and each time I went I kept asking for him to raise the dose. Well he would write for more quantity. I was up over 300 pills a month.  Then he switched me to 20mg. and then 40mg. I am now at getting 90 pills a month (40mg.) and I have since been pregnant and had another baby only this time she was born addicted (she is fine now) but I have tried 80mg. pills and would like to try the 160mg. pill (I believe that is the highest).</p><p>Everytime I run out of my pills I go crazy. I go thru some really bad withdrawls. When I am on my pills, for one thing I do not have any pain and for another I feel like I have so much energy and confidence that I can do anything. When I am not on these pills I lay in bed with deep depression, the coldness and sweats, not eating and thinking of nothing else except what I can get my hands on to help me get over this sick feeling.  I have been without oxy's for two weeks before and it still seems like it would take longer to overcome this addiction.</p><p>I really need to seek help and I plan on doing so because I have two beautiful children that does not deserve a part time Mother and I would not even call myself a part timer. Hopefully the doctors can come up with something else for my pain other than something addictive. So please take it from someone who has been addicted to this great high but destructive lifestyle to never try oxycontin even for the first time. Granted it does not hit everyone the same way but it is listed as one of the biggest ADDICTIVE drug out there.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Still Trying To Cope</p><p>LIL jo</p>",
