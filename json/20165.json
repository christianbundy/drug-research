 "report": "</p>3.5mg IV AMT spiked after a long hot and busy day. Within 5 minutes euphoric effects with notable stimulant. Wheeee! This is fun. Ran round like a headless chicken, didn't impair co-ordination or the scheduling of involved tasks, though it felt like a higher dose may well have. Dose effective as both stimulant and euphoriant for 3 hours. Ate a couple of bits of fruit happily</p><p>Euphoria remained, but stimulant effects wore off after 3 hours. Wanted more energy so...</p><p>Spiked 2nd dose 3.5mg AMT. Woke me up for a bit, now I'm exhausted again 1/2 hr later. Suspect mild liver load. Ate a high carb meal with a salad and lay down for 20 mintues. 80mg 5HTP livened things up for a bit, but eventually I had to sleep about two hours after ingestion of 2nd dose.</p><p>Will repeat experiment on a day when things aren't so hectic</p>",
