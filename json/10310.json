 "report": "<p>Wonderous ! Simply wonderous ! Access to alternate dimensions & realities never been so easy to attain ... all substances ingested to date considered. Used the 'INWARD' mode of access. No projection was required. Simply accepted that which appeared. NOTHING hectic. Guide on hand (Shagraan - light being ) to assist with TRAVELLING wishes. Hillarious laughter & amusement at speed of travel.  Visuals of other planetary civilisations ... granted, only from a distance at this stage ... can`t wait for more intimate contact.</p><p>Travelling at speed of THOUGHT ! Faster than LIGHT itself. Visuals confirmed prior visitations to alternate dimensions & civilisations ... previously only accessed on squares & shrooms ... with a lot more EFFORT & MEDITATION, I may add. Experiences shared between three global entities. Friends. No SITTERS present. Visuals also incorporated other BEINGS of apparent HUMANOID descent ... visual appearance only. Return JOURNEY also accomodated global locations.</p>",
