  "I never have heard of kava before, until about a year ago when a friend suggested it to me saying it was a small trip high. We took some from the local herb store and went to a starbucks to get water for the kava. We had just about 1/4 of a cup of water and poured half a bottle of kava in so it would lessen the burn and awful taste. I held my nose and drunk that nasty drink.",
  "At first I did not feel anything and then about 5mins later I just went in a focused trance. Not full blown tripping but in my mind I was in a very happy calm place. So we drank more until we both did a bottle and a half. The kava high lasts only about an hour but I feel good for most of the day.",
  "The good thing about kava is that it has natural alcohol in it. If I take about 3 bottles I can get drunk or buzzed plus the small tripping high. Kava with weed is really, really, awesome. It makes me trip harder and longer if I take a bottle or more before I smoke. I'm not sure about how well this works but one friend soaked his weed in kava and he dried it. He said he got 'mondo' high. He said it works better but I personally have not tried it. Although I have tried a joint soaked in kava, it does give the weed a sweeter almost good taste instead the nasty liqiud taste. But as for the high it was different but I don't think it was greatly better."
