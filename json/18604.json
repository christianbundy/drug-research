  "Good Things:",
  "Ritalin is defnitely one of my personal faves. Of all the drugs I have tried, ritalin is one of the best maybe second to methamphetamine. After it is administered through a syringe and needle in the vein it puts me on an intense rush but after about 10-15mins it wears off a bit and I start clenching my jaw. I usually spend the rest of the night doing random things to pass the time. And I go to sleep the next day, and wake up feeling allryt but generally pretty shit.  ",
