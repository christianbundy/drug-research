  "<p>A few years ago I was prescribed Welbutrin for depression.  Apparently I developed psychotic tendencies which could be attributed to the Welbutrin, so my psychiatrist prescribed for me Risperdol, an anti-psychotic.  Why he didn't just take me off Welbutrin and prescribe another anti-depressant is beyond me. ",
  "One night I dropped four hits of LSD and proceeded to have a very intense trip.  About 5 or 6 hours later it was time for me to take my usual dose of Risperdol.  I was still tripping very hard, and was not expecting to come down for another 6 hours, but surprisingly enough, I was completely down within half an hour.  I should have realized that this was going to happen as Risperdol is in the same class as Thorazine which is used to end bad trips in the hospital. ",
  "Some interesting side notes about Risperdol.  In short, I hated this drug.  It made me feel disconnected from the world.  I'm usually a person with very intense emotions, but Risperdol seemed to suck all of it away from me.  I didn't seem to care about anything.  I enjoyed spending my time watching tv, and settled into a mundane existence.  After taking the drug for some time I began periodically skipping doses.  This was very pleasurable as I would begin to FEEL again, and my emotions were intensified by the previous numbness that seemed to envelope me.  Overall I think Risperdol did more damage than good.  Luckily enough, I have been free of all prescription drugs for over three years, and even stopped using psychedelics because I felt that I wasn't in the right state to use them and realized that I had begun to abuse them.  It is only recently that I've felt confident enough to be able to use psychedelics in moderation and gain the best from them.</p>"
