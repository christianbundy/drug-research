 "report": "<p>I'm currently working as a horticulturist for a country club and as such it affords me great liberty to experimentaly grow anything I want even at home.  I currently have in cultivation around ten Datura stramonium plants at the flowering stage, one Datura meteloides, and one Datura inoxia the latter two at the fruiting stage.  I have had a complex relationship with this plant as a medicinal aid and a recreational hallucinogen.  This is not a group of plants that anyone should take lightly or believe is meant for tripping.  They are all deadly poisonous. </p><p>Medicinally I would have to say that the plant is best to be smoked for the more immediate and milder effects of anti-inflammitory, pain reliever, anti-spasmodic, and bronchiodialator.  A dose of one large dried leaf or flower is more than sufficient up to cases of extreme pain, broken bones, root canals, sprains and the like. </p><p>Recreationally the plant is taken in many forms though not wisely in most instances.  Smoking is effective of the leaves and flowers, I strongly advise against smoking the seeds for several reasons.  It leaves you simply as nervously detached from reality in an ill state, with headaches, upset stomach and blurred vision almost certain, by the next day after use.  I would also recommend against ingesting any part of the plant raw.  this leads to partial, most commonly temporary blindness, upset stomach and unwanted hallucinations in higher doses.  Cooking with most any part of the plant is a less reactive but definite way to experience a strong 'trip'.  Tea is how I have personally found to probably be the safest and more satisfying a method.  Boiling a few dozen seeds in two to four cups of water depending on your preference of strength. </p><p>It takes a great deal of respect for this plant to experience a pleasant journey.  There is no certain set of effects that you can predict from these plants,  reality is gone and your imagination rules the realm of observable existence.  My favorite experience was for new years eve a while back. i made twenty ounces of tea with around fifty seeds of datura inoxia.  My younger brother in his haste had at one point overdosed with around fifteen whole seed pods boiled in a pot of water for two hours.  This resulted in a four day trip, three in the hospital.  He's fortunate to be alive from that.  I know this is something i will know for a long time and will try to continue to share my experiences.</p>",
