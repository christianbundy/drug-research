 "report": [
  "First off Im very educated when it comes to RCs, meaning I've done my fair share of research with many research chemicals over the last 10 years.",
  "Ive recently come across a sample of 2C-D and have experimented a few times with it at doses from 15-50mgs.I have found 50mgs to be about as much as I want to take. At this level the visuals are nice and the headspace is great and the comedown is very gentle .2C-D tends to be a very forgiving phenethylamine. This night I was thinking about taking a decent dose of some 'cut' 4-FA and later mixing a little 2C-D with it to make it worth my while.  The setting was me, by myself, chillin at home. I had been waiting for this occasion for a week so I was pretty excited to say the least.",
  "4:30pm , I swallowed 180mgs 4-FA in a capsule.",
  "4:45pm ,I cleaned up a little and ate a little chicken just to have something on my stomach because I knew I wouldnt be hungry till the next day.",
  "5:45pm Im feeling good, mild amphetamine mood lift, but also very calm. I threw on some shpongle and got online for an hour or so.",
  "7:30pm  I feel the 4-FA ,but its pretty weak...the supplier had started issuing refunds to customers that bought it because it was found to be cut with table salt.",
  "8:15pm I decided to get the 2C-D ready. I planned to take 40mgs oral but I weighed out 20mgs and decided on a whim to just snort it.",
  "8:30pm I snorted the 2C-D...it burned bad but not as bad as meth would. In less than a minute my vision started to wiggle and I felt the psychedelic effects begin.",
  "8:32pm  the effects rushed up on me like a psychedelic freight train!!I ran to the sink because I started to heave. The world around me started to spin and all I could do was hold on. Sweat started to pour down my face and I began to vomit. I made my way to the bathroom to try to puke everything and be in a place where I could make a mess if need be. Within 5 minutes I was completely peaking.",
  "My ego was destroyed! Visuals so intense the only thing I can compare them to would be 50mgs smoked DMT. The world around me was moving in frames and I could see everything down to an atomic level. All I could do was hold on to the sink and vomit, sweat, vomit, sweat, heave, vomit. It was explosive vomiting .",
  "Even though I was in a full blown Shulgin +3 the vomiting was slightly painful to my throat and stomach.",
  "10:30pm , I spent the last 2 hours vomiting in the bathroom and  trying to grasp reality. I finally started coming down enough to see the mess I had just made and it was a mess! The colors and visuals were still moving around alot but I had stopped throwing up thankfully! I grabbed some towels and started mopping up the mess. Looking back on it I should've just wiped my face ,went into the living room and tried to enjoy myself but I was just happy to be coming down.",
  "12:30 I spent the last 2 hours cleaning up and Im finally down from the 2C-D. I can still feel the 4-FA though. I got online to warn a few fellow psychonauts about my experience.",
  "2:00am  I ate a benadryl to help wind me down and went to bed. I believe I fell asleep quickly because I dont remember laying there in bed for hours.",
  "The next day I woke with a bad headache, took an ibuprofen and it went away. I felt pretty good the rest of the day mentally. Physically I was pretty sore though.",
  "This experience happened 2 days ago and my throat is still soar from the purging. It feels like I pulled a muscle in my Throat. I also have some brusies on me and dont know where or when I got them.  I've pushed the envelope many times but that was one of the most intense psychedelic experiences I've ever had. The crazy thing about this experience was that I was'nt trying to push the envelope. I was expecting alot less .",
  "If there would have been people around they would have freaked out at what was going on. There may have even been a 911 call placed. I was pretty calm during the experience and never freaked out. I believe the combo is what set off the 2C-D. I've snorted about 15mgs 2C-D before and it was maybe a +2 with a come-up that took about 30 minutes to peak. Nothing like this experience.",
  "The moral of this story is that I shouldve thought more carefully about my dose before mixing these drugs. The only thing my experience helped me do was not freak out. I knew the damage was done when I started peaking and all I could do about it was ride it out. Needless to say, the 4-FA, 2C-D combo ride is one I never want to take again!",
