 "report": "<p>Naltrexon is a pure opiate-receptor antagonist and the use of naltrexon in opiate/opioid addicted individuals will lead to acute withdrawl symptoms.</p><p>After spending the night on 55 mg Oxycontin (oxycodone) I decided to use some naltrexon to stop the effects of oxycontin, since it had caused some insomnia in the past. I figured no withdrawl would occur since I'm not a regular user of opioids. I used about 12,5 mgs as a dose. Naltrexon pills are 50 mgs.</p><p>It happened to be a bad idea. 15 minutes after administration I started to feel weird and anxious. I decided to lay in bed but this didn't help. I felt really strange and out of my body. After 30 minutes I looked in the mirror and my pinpointed eyes had turned bigger (probably normal). I felt really weak and sick. I tried to sleep but didn't succeed in the first hour. After that I slept some hours, but in a really weird state and with a lot of sweating.</p><p>To conclude, my experiment was not a success. Though 12,5 mgs did seem to completely reverse the effects of 55 mg oxycodone 4 hours earlier.</p>",
