 "report": [
  "First I infuse 2-3 tsp of the dried herb in a cup of hot water for 15-20 minutes and then drink over a 10-15 minute timespan just before going to bed for dream enhancement. This method for taking Mugwort has worked well for me, but one thing to be aware of with this herb is not to expect dramatic results after one dose. In fact, dont expect dramatic results at all  this herb has a gentle action, it is not a hallucinogen. It does not give me a trip with lots of imagery. However when I take it by the method described above, over two to four weeks I do notice a definite increase in dreaming activity."
