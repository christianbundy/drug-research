 "report": [
  "After some consideration of various sites and pieces of information, I decided to try out insulfating 800mg of Skelaxin as a possible means to a body high.  The idea had been previously raised by my boyfriend. ",
  "Having been a long time user of the medication for a skeletal spinal condition, I had not much explored the idea of recreational use.  I knew from prior discussions with friends that taking 1600mg with a 40oz of beer would make your legs turn to noodles, so the boyfriend and I had tried it with a variety of cocktails.  Personally, I find the medication to be a great additive to a smooth kush or even coupled with something like Xanax.  I know that it is not for everyone though, and I recommend taking it on its own before adding other things to it, to make sure that you do not get sick.",
  "Anyway, this go around, I crushed up an 800mg pill.  It was easy enough to get it crushed to a fine powder, and since it generally tastes like a gritty chalk, I thought snorting it would go easily.  I made a couple lines and used a cut straw to draw it into my sinuses.  I noticed several things immediately:",
  "1. It is so dry that it went straight through to my throat.",
  "2. Upon contact with any mucus or membrane, it made a thick paste, that made snorting more difficult.",
  "3. The taste was more bitter going through the nose than the mouth.",
  "4. It had a sting to it.",
  "These things being said, roughly 400mg went up the nose fairly easily.  I could not, however, bring myself to do another line.  It was just too rough of a snort.  I mixed the rest into some strawberry soda, which masked the flavor easily.",
  "Even with the rough experience of insufflating, I would say that it was a worthwhile venture.  It definitely hit faster and more thoroughly than swallowing the pill whole.  Within an hour, I felt a general full body relaxation with a mind 'floating' sensation in the head.  The only downsides were that the paste was still present in my nose, the sting/burn of it was still present, and I found myself sweating profusely.  Since I didn't have anywhere to go, this wasn't a problem, but it definitely is not #1 for things I enjoy experiencing.",
  "I guess overall I'd give the experience a 6/10.  If I have other means to alter my reality for a bit, I would do that, and possibly add a full pill to whatever it is if I want a boost to muscle relaxing."
