  "<p>Trazodone 25 mg. I have taken 25 mg. Have taken doses of trazodone 3 times as a sleep aid. In my opinion it has no recreational value. It did not feel like an opiate or benzodiazepine, there were no pleasurable effects at all. At 30 min. I felt that I was not tired but drugged and went to bed. I remember all three times having the thought shortly before going to bed that I was not tired, sort of like when someone is really drunk and can't tell they are. I woke up at my normal time after 6,7,and 8 hours sleep with not much in the way of grogginess. I had no physical side effects other than an unusual number of unwarranted erections on the day after. These were not accompanied by any sexual arousal.",
