  "Let me preface this by saying I'm a Wiccan, so some of the stuff I saw might not be understood by people who aren't.",
  "Anyway, it was a Sunday night and I had just eaten and my friends and I got together in my dorm room and started smoking from a water pipe.  In the background, I was playing Brian Eno and an Egyptian group called Musicians of the Nile.  Then we smoked - I got 3 hits from a water pipe over the course of about half an hour.  Then my friends left and I sat alone in my room listening to music.",
  "Listening to the music, I felt like I was one of the drummers and could see myself in their group, playing. Then I felt waves of energy rippling up and down my body  I mean I could really FEEL it, like it was causing me to move with it. Then I briefly felt like I was dying  I could feel my body going quiet and my mind drifting off, but I decided I didnt want to do that, so I sort of jumped and focused on the room, and did a little grounding meditation.",
  "Then the interesting stuff happened.  I sat down on my bed and dimmed the lights, and I felt like all the forests and fields were pulsing with life, and that energy was coming up into me, and I felt like my whole body was throbbing, and then I felt like I was the Green Man, or Pan, or some similar God, and I was alive with the spirit of nature.",
  "Then I saw myself flowing into the Goddess  she appeared to me as a huge tree and simultaneously a woman dressed in white, reaching towards me and embracing me, and saying All is Well, and then, I saw idealized figures of both the Goddess and the God, and they sort of morphed into my own mother and father, and I felt indescribable joy.",
  "Another example of why leafy green vegetables are an important part of any balanced diet."
