  "As many men taking SSRI anti-depressants such as Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, etc know, these drugs can often times cause extremely irritating sexual side effects, which can lead many men (myself included) to cease taking them, even if they are beneficial.  Aside from greatly extending the period of time that it takes to achieve an orgasm, it can also have an effect on one's ability to maintain a strong erection.  Seems kind of counter-productive...I know that not being able to keep it up makes me pretty sad.",
  "Many doctors will prescribe Viagra or similar drugs to combat this, but I really didn't want to mess with that at all. I'm 23. I don't want to take Viagra.  It's hard enough for me to agree to taking an anti-depressant as it is.",
  "I and my partner can attest to this miracle herb's ability to combat SSRI related impotence.  It's great.  I can take my damn happy pill and still perform."
