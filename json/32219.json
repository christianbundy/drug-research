 "report": "<p>It was just a few months ago when I decided to try smoking some mushrooms. Most of the time when I got boomers I got a small amount and just wanted to munch my eighth and get a good trip. Well I had just gotten home from living in the mountains for a while and my friend D from high school had left a message with my parents for me to give him a call a few days earlier. Once we had gotten in touch he dropped me an ounce of boomers with the quickness. They were good, I beamed a few times over next couple weeks and good times were certainly about. I'd been storing them in the freezer, sealed in an air tight bag.</p><p>Anyways I had about half an eighth left and decided I'd smoke it. I'd eaten enough lately, why not I thought. So I broke up some good BC indoor and grinded up the caps that were left in the bottom of the bag. I smoked a fat joint to the head and waited. I was feeling pretty high but wasn't feeling anything else. I sat in my room for a while long and nothing happened. Listening to Jerry jam I realized that I had wasted a journey. I got nothing out of smoking psilocybe mushrooms other than a lousy after taste hanging in my mouth.</p>",
