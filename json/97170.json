 "report": "<p>I swallowed the 1mg pill whole. It took close to an hour to feel some very gentle relaxation and lack of anxiety and worries from the day. It just made me feel better about issues I was dealing with.</p><p>I decided after the first one seemed to be giving maximum effects to try crushing one with my teeth and swallowing. (No taste) Effects were a little faster, just a bit of heaviness in my body, slight euphoria and just a bit more feeling of well being. Nothing too strong, just a relaxed body and calm mental state.</p><p>I know that some people think that if this is nice, way more is better. Not a good plan with this substance, just a little too much can cause blackouts, better to start slow and see how my body handles it. Also, alcohol can intensify the effects.</p><p>I didn't try to save money and buy the powder. The 1mg doses are just too low to accurately measure on most scales. The pills are safer and easy. I like this product in general for those days that you just need some stress relief. It can be addictive, so keep this in mind. It has a fairly short half life, another plus.</p>",
