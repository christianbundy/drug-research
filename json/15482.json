 "report": [
  "I had never tried a 'smart drug' before and decided it would be worth my time to try.",
  "The next day I drove down to my local super market and picked up a bottle of 60 mg. (24% concentration) ginkgo Biloba tablets.",
  "I have previous experience with psychoactive drugs, anti-depressants and stimulants.  I have been taking ginkgo for about four months now.",
  "During the first week I noticed little, if any, effects. At the two week point I started to notice some mild increases in short term memory as well as memory of past childhood experiences.",
  "While on ginkgo, I noticed not so much that I was able to remember things more clearly or thoroughly, it was more like being able to remember that there WAS a date or event to remember.",
  "I also noticed a slight increase in energy, both mental and physical."
