 "report": [
  "I started taking Welbutrin as perscribed by my psychiatrist for a few years now. I also am perscribed Abilify (antipsychotic) and Lexapro for my schizoaffective disorder.",
  "I am not much into anything but pills right now. I crush and snort lines on Welbutrin for fun. It's almost like snorting lines of Ritalin but with no edginess. I take a 200mg tab and it's fine. Then I ingest some, say about 500mg of Welbutrin. I start to feel very confident and awake also colors are brighter.",
  "I snort 200mg, about a half hour later, more and and things start to get a little distorted. I was watching Magnolia at the time and enjoyed it very much but during the sad parts I couldn't cry even when I tried.",
  "I snort another 200mg and am in a dreamy euphoric state. It is true the snorting Wellbutrin burns and tastes nasty but the buring you get used to fast, it barley burns me anymore. I also have glass of vanilla cola by me which by the ways tastes more intense yet I don't have the munchies. Over all I enjoy the experience."
