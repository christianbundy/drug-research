 "report": "<p>A friend purchased a package of Betel Nut.  It was a foil-sealed pouch that came with a dosage scoop.  We each chewed one scoop apiece.</p><p>The nut is initially hard, like cat litter.  The particular brand he purchased was flavored with clove and cinnamon, and thus tasted like Christmas potpourri.</p><p>We held the quid in our cheeks at the beginning of watching Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  Near the middle of the movie, the nut was soft enough to actively chew, but had lost its cinnamon flavor.</p><p>Near the very end of the movie, I found myself chewing frantically.  I experienced a definite stimulation, although it was cool and mild, nothing at all like caffeine or pseudoephedrine.  However, by this time the flavor was so bitter and offensive that I had to spit it out and rinse my mouth with water.</p><p>It is hard to say how potent the stimulation was, although I did end up staying awake all night.  However, I am prone to insomnia if I have any stimulants past noon.  I didn't feel exhausted until around 2 PM the next day.  One pack of cigarettes aided in this.</p><p>Overall, I'd say the experience was pleasant.  However, the partially-chewed nut resembled something that had come out of the south end of a cat, with a comparable flavor.</p>",
