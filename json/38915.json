 "report": "<p>After having sex, I felt so heavy and drowsy. I was talking to the person next to me with my eyes closed. I noticed my self becoming heavy and drowsy, while I was still mumbling my answers to the conversation. I asked my partner to let me sleep because I almost reached another world. Then I discover that I didnt really tell her that, I just felt that I did. And thats when I figured out that Im in a different world. Just a feeling of nothingness where every thought is just so pleasant, for the purpose of experiencing it. I felt it was an out of body experience because I could feel my body and see my self talking to that person. But in reality my soul lifted out of my body and went else where.</p>",
