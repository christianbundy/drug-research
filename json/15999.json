  "I was placed on Paxil CR for SDD.  After being placed on it my personality changed completely.  I was no longer the person that I once was.  It actually made me more depressed than I have ever been in my entire life. ",
  "After remaining on paxil for 3 months I asked my doctor to switch me to Lexapro.  I began to take lexapro 3 days after stopping my dosage of Paxil.  One night I went to go check the mail and received a few bill notices.  So the next thing I knew I was sitting out by a lake, crying, and holding a bottle of Hydrocodone.  I ingested the bottle and went back to the dorm where my room mate saw that there was something wrong with me and called 911. ",
  "I was taken by ambulance to the hospital where my stomach was pumped and I was placed in ICU.  I have never had a history of suicidal thoughts or tendencies.  The strange part of the whole overdose was the fact that I felt like it was not me even taking the pills.  It felt like I didnt know what I was doing.  I was killing myself without the presence of fear."
