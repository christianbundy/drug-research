  "Doc gave me Soma as an alternative to Robaxin (methocarbamol) for recurrent debilitating tension headaches, said take one every six hours as needed. Let me say from the start that I have some VERY odd medication reactions, so am extremely careful about what I take. I make sure people know what I took when and to make sure I check back in at a reasonable time.",
  "Next headache, I took one. OMG that stuff is the absolute all time best deterrent to abuse, it is AWFUL, worse than Robaxin in taste. I lay down, thought my head was going to fall off and felt like I'd had a stroke on one side of my face, kind of frozen, typical of my major headaches.  Muscles finally started to ease up, I rolled over and I passed out, but this wasn't 'sleep' by any means, it was unconsciousness, blank as unused paper and black as tar.",
  "The aftermath was a bitch.  All my muscles ached, I hadn't moved an inch in, wow, a solid several hours and the headache? Well, the tension part was gone, sure enough. The hangover was damn near as bad.",
  "I went back to Robaxin and have stuck with that, although it is losing efficacy as I develop tolerance over time.  I hate the dissassociation of many perfectly legit drugs, and strive to avoid the effect, I'm very attached to my brain and look forward to a long and fruitful association."
