  "<p>I have read about archeaologists discovering cigars made up of rolled up San Pedro skins.  I have tried it many times since first reading about it a year ago. ",
  "On my first experiance after 1-2 bowls in a hookah mixed with homegrown Nicotiana glauca was an intense, fast acting mescaline body high that creeps up on me like creeper weed and brings with it clear colorful mesc. visuals and after one more bowl of just cactus a short but almost full trip ensued. The skin is easy to peel and dry and often I can see orange spots an swirls in it when its dry.  I have a secret method of curing the skins but that is my secret.</p>"
