 "report": "<p>Over the past month I have smoked salvia extract about 12 times. Since I began I've noticed symptoms that I can only describe as HPPD perhaps it is because I smoked a lot of it in a short period of time or maybe Im just susceptible to such things. Anyway the symptoms are Objects seem much bolder and brighter especially at long distance, when I look at blank white surfaces I can see a pattern of little spots and shapes that are very noticeable, (I see this much more strongly when I trip), in addition I can attain a sort of high/tripping state simply by focusing on objects-something I could never do before. I don't know if this is just me or something more common although there is one other report describing much the same thing. While these symptoms dont bother my they are definitely noticeable.</p><p>It may have occurred because I smoked rather often for a short period of time trying to attain a true breakthrough because I have fairly high tolerance. Either way its still a great herb and my last trip was an incredible one.</p>",
