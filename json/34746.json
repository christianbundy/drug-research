 "report": "<p>My wife suffers terrible cluster migraine headaches. After exhausting conventional therapies prescribed by headache specialists, I decided to help my wife by growing some psilocybin after reading ad hoc reports of efficacy.</p><p>I had picked two abhorts (baby mushrooms that stopped growing) since I read that they still had a good dose of psilocybin. I dried them while the outdoors patch continues in its first flush.  When a headache hit last night, I cleaned out the coffee grinder, and ground the dried mushies and then mixed them in a small glass of orange juice.</p><p>After giving her the juice she fell asleep around a half hour later (she regularly sleeps at 10 PM).  At about 10:20 she awoke from a 'bad dream, with all sort of monsters and things.'  She concluded the psilocybin was working.  Her headache had also lessened significantly, and it was completely gone the next morning.</p><p>Her headaches can run 3 days, so this an unusually short, and very bad only before the pysilocybin dose.</p><p>This is an encouraging first report. I'll write again, once we've had several months data on this alternate therapy.</p>",
