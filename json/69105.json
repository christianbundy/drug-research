 "report": "<p>Tuesday, March 3 5:58 AM</p><p>How long can a human body survive without food, and very little water? It has been three days for me. Maybe that's why I smell like I'm rotting from the inside-out? Since Saturday, been living like a weird, smelly, burnt-out, pimply, awkward, creepy addict loser, holing up alone in my house, wandering town only when I must. Soulless, zombie like. I became the walking dead.</p><p>IT BEGINS</p><p>Sunday. At 6am, 10 units IV. Stayed in my bedroom, managed to have a 4 hour nap, was driven out of town, arrived to destination at 11pm. I picked at my face in the bathroom for an hour, showered, shot another 5 units 1am Monday. Felt immediately refreshed! More energized, but no euphoria. I felt... back to normal.</p><p>Monday. I shoot about 2 points total. Spent the day in bed, writing about nothing, making sure windows were opaque, avoiding all phone calls. I tweezed my brows, went through my things over and over, obsessively handled my drugs, missed shots, I was very anti-social and strange. Today I spent 6 hours picking my face.</p><p>Tuesday. I walked to the Medical Clinic today, for the utter discomfort/pain I was going through, and I also had a horrible cough. I felt like a leper when the Dr. reacted to my answers. I almost cried while getting tested. (For all vitals, levels, tox report, ECG, blood, urine, all STD's, + blood borne viruses, etc.) The nurse painfully dug in my arm a lot before filling 10 vials. Hated the feeling of someone else's inexperienced hands controlling a needle in my arm. The whole experience was a vividly dysphoric mind-fuck. Decided to shoot a bit more because I was starting to feel horrid. Thought I overheard, 'She's shooting up in the bathroom!' A stranger offered me a ride home and there I, unexpectedly, fell asleep. Woke 90 mins later, alert, heart racing, fiending. Extreme dizziness upon rising. I white out for a few seconds, and return. Since I am out of drugs, I eat. Throughout the day, I had IV'd approx 3.5 points.</p><p>Following are a summary of effects.</p><p>MOUTH</p><p>- a gross, plaque-y layer of gunk permanently stuck on my teeth no matter what I do.</p><p>- tongue has lots of varying sores</p><p>- yellower teeth with new white stains, visibly receded gumline</p><p>- earlier, my jaw hurt, and I compulsively tongued my teeth.</p><p>- weird, chemical taste</p><p>SKIN</p><p>- sweat + oil + speed bumps + already clogged pores = fucking hideous, infected, scabby, scarred acne sprouting within a few days.</p><p>-has a translucent quality</p><p>- greasy/sweaty odor always present.</p><p>- i require two thick layers of makeup to barely look normal.</p><p>WEIGHT</p><p>Sunday - 129</p><p>Today - 122</p><p>BODY</p><p>- so sore and the worst hasn't yet begun. Feeling very achy and cold.</p><p>- dizzy spells. sharply decreased strength</p><p>- chest and head pains</p><p>- blue, pale skin and bright, peeling red lips.</p><p>- lots of intestinal gas.</p><p>- sharp surges of ear pain</p><p>- a permanent red patch of a swollen, bruised, practically non-functioning injection site in my arm</p><p>- tingly, numb extremities</p><p>- haven't had a shit in 2-3 days</p><p>MIND</p><p>- I don't really think, my brain feels as if it is on autopilot. Mixing up words and making silly mistakes. Extreme paranoia from the claustrophobia of living in a small town where no one is anonymous.</p><p>PERCEPTION</p><p>- I overhear/hallucinate? multiple conversations both about me (how I smell, look, and some gossip) and the drug methamphetamine. I hallucinate music, and whispers of my name.</p><p>- Vision is blurred, wavy. A bit like acid, with 'lights floating on a different frequency'.</p><p>- Things appear to dart across floors.</p><p>I hope my children never experience anything even remotely related with this poison. It is an extreme waste of health, sanity and time.</p>",
