 "report": "<p>I am prescribed 40mg of Prozac a day. I have been on Prozac for about 9 years, reaching 40mg/day almost a year ago.</p><p>At 5pm I ingested 2g of 'Puerto Rican Angels' mushrooms. My last trip on mushrooms had been over 2 years ago. At 5:45pm my friend was feeling it, I was not at all. I ate another gram. 6:10pm- still nothing. I took one last gram.</p><p>6:30pm I was tripping. A very nice trip. Slight distorted vision (faces in smoke and my room felt sloped). TONS of thought loops, epiphanies, and enlightenment. Overall a great trip. The one I have been looking for. Probably what someone not on an SSRI would get after only about 2.5 grams.</p>",
