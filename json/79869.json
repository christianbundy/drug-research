 "report": "<p>I found some old cough and sinus pills lying around and decided to try them out. The only main ingredients were acetaminophen and pseudoephredine. The dose per pill was 500mg/60mg respectively. I have read about people experiencing intense euphoria from pseudoe, and also others have reported that nothing happened at all. </p><p>I took 4 pills. I did not experience anything other then a little bit of jitteryness (is that even a word?) </p><p>Not worth my time</p>"
