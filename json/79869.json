The dose per pill was 500mg/60mg respectively. I have read about people experiencing intense euphoria from pseudoe, and also others have reported that nothing happened at all.</p><p>I took 4 pills. I did not experience anything other then a little bit of jitteryness (is that even a word?)</p><p>Not worth my time</p>",
