  "I smoked some Wild Dagga leaves about an hour ago and it definitely worked, and thus I am happy with the effects. It is very much comparable to marijuana in the variety of effects it produces, but the effects in themselves are entirely unique in their own way.",
  "I noticed that for about 15-20 minutes after I toked I had a pretty strong MJ-like buzz; euphoria, slight pleasant pressure in the forehead and temple region (what I like to call the 'head high'), slight body buzz, heightened sensory perception (to things like music and movement) and a significant change in temporal perception. (The 10 minutes after I smoked seemed to last much much longer, it was nice!) This stuff is less lethargic and more stimulating than pot and a much shorter-lived high. I'd say the obvious effects of the high last to about 40-60 minutes with subtle after effects continuing. No burn-out! just a gradual decline.",
  "I then drove to get some grub, but I strongly recommend not driving under the influence of this stuff. (the place was just a few blocks away) The whole trip lasted about 10-15 minutes but it seemed much longer and more enjoyable.",
  "I rolled it into cigarettes. Bongs might work well too. I've tried smoking it from a pipe but it wasn't nearly as successful."
