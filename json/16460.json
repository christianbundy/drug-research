 "report": [
  "I had a bottle of dimenhydrinate (motion-sickness pills, common brand names are Gravol in Canada and Dramamine in U.S.). I had read that taking between 12 and 25 pills would create a reasonable hallucinogenic-quality high. Just for some background information about me,  my previous drug experience had been limited to weed and painkillers, I was 17 at the time.",
  "I took 17 of the pills one night. They tasted really gross. It took about one or two hours before there was any real effect, and I became quite tired (as they cause drowsiness). I layed down, and I began to feel like I was dreaming (although i was awake). It was confusing - I was talking to a friends that wasn't there and was confused when they left without saying goodbye. It was sort of like I was just re-hashing the events of my day. It was not particularly thrilling, definately not worth what came afterwards.",
  "I began having a serious headache (not just a typical one), it hurt to lift my head, like a deep throbbing pain. I got up to go to the bathroom and I was seriously unbalanced. I had to walk bent over to keep myself from falling down. My muscles felt very light and my head was constantly hurting.  After this, I felt so unpleasant I decided to go to sleep, and when I woke up in the morning I saw that I had thrown up (I didnt remember doing this).",
  "So, I would definately not recommend this to anybody. Or maybe I had just taken too much for my body weight (I'm a fairly small girl). Either way, if you dont like headaches or hangovers, just avoid this altogether!"
