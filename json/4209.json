  "<p>I met an interesting couple at a retreat in July. They gave me a write-up of their first experience with this substance. While I cannot vouch for its veracity, they both seemed genuine and honest.",
  "40 mg., synthesized TMA-2",
  "8 p.m. 40 mg. TMA-2 was dissolved in lemonade. Typical phenethylamine bad taste.",
  "8:20 Mild stomach agitation. Was it real, or was it because I read about 'brief intestinal cramps' in a TMA-2 trip report in PIHKAL?",
  "8:45 Plus one. Nervous, agitated energy. Eyes feeling glossy. K and I keep pacing around. Hard to sit down for more than a few minutes. Conversation between us flowing very quickly.",
  "9:00 Plus two.",
  "9:20 Plus three. TMA-2 takes hold.",
  "The thing I remember the most was the energized, nonstop conversation. We talked and talked and talked. There was a bit of the empathic buzz of  MDMA, but tempered a nice, unattached (in the Buddhist sense) lucidity. Heart-opening stuff, for sure, but in a different way than MDMA. This could be very effective in therapy. When I directed my vision in a concentrated manner the visuals appeared. They were very similar to 2CB visuals, but not as colorful -- morphing surfaces, shimmery 'heat' patterning on light-colored surfaces, some peripheral sparkling. Glowsticks, as always, provided a visual treat, as did a glowing Frisbee and fireflies leaving blurry light trails against the darkness. K's naked flesh feels electrically-charged and tingly against mine.",
  "The comedown was long. This stuff is still working at 9+ hours. Benzodiazepenes were just what the doctor ordered to facilitate sleep at 9 hours.  In fact, it took 2 administrations of Valium before we were able to get some rest. Sex was possible, but orgasm remained just out of reach (similar to MDMA).",
  "Woke up feeling fine. Slight foggy hangover, but that could be due to Valium and lack of sufficient sleep.",
  "Overall, our first experience with TMA-2 was very rewarding. This substance seems to enhance clear, intellectual communication and is also physically energizing without being enervating. Visuals are unobtrusive but can be",
  "summoned with concentration, and can be interesting. During the peak it gets much more visually stimulating. Prepare for a 10+ hour ride. K and I both experienced fluttery stomachs, but mine also felt like imminent diarrhea on a few occasions (which never materialized).  The mild body load was certainly well worth the trip.</p>"
