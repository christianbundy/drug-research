 "report": "<p>On a Tuesday, I was offered a job. I was having an awful day and decided I'd Robotrip, knowning they would drug test, but thinking once they saw me (I'm about 6'3' and 350 lbs with long, ragged red hair) that they wouldn't hire me. At 6:30 I took 20 gel caps (300mg) and by 8 or so I was peaking.</p><p>The next day, Wednesday, I went in for the interview at 10 and they seemed to like me. At noon they called me to tell me they'd like to offer me a job after I was drug tested. At about 1 30 or 2, I was pissing in a cup. I didn't realize until that night when my friend told me that it could show up as PCP or an opiate that I had anything to fear.</p><p>At about 11 a.m. I recieved a call saying that my test cleared and they'd like me to start Friday. All that worrying for nothing!</p>",
