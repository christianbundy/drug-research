 "report": "<p>Ethylphenidate Trip Report</p><p>First off, a little bit about the subject, in this case myself. 19 years old, 178cm tall thin built male weighing in at 63.5kg. Generally healthy, take a daily multivitamin supplement. Experience with substances is substantial- LSD, psilocybin, opiates (oxycodone), stimulants such as methylone, MDMA, MDA, ethylone, butylone, mephedrone; dissociatives including MXE, Ketamine, and DXM. Dabbled a bit in 2C-x's, namely 2C-P and 2C-I-NBOMe (25i-NBOME). Personally enjoy entheogens (MDMA especially) and psychedelics more than traditional stimulants in most cases.</p><p>Sample came via mail, weighed in at 250mg of very fine, somewhat sticky, clumpy bright white powder. Looked like sugar but a different type of clumpy than as if it were wet. This is my first experience with this chemical, although I'm familiar with Ritalin. I take an allergy test of ~1mg sublingual and after half an hour with no ill effects I decide to go through with testing.</p><p>T=8:30pm</p><p>Series of Events:</p><p>8:30pm (T+0:00)- I open my letter up and inside is 250mg of some amazing looking powder. I'm home upstairs in my bedroom with the AC on, under blankets in bed. I insufflate 25mg and instantly recoil. This is perhaps the worst thing to ever go up my nose...absolutely horrific burning sensation fills the front of my face, I'm slightly warm, and I feel slight pressure near my nasal passages. Current state: 0/10</p><p>8:45pm (T+0:15)- First alert; gentle stimulation, could be placebo. Thoughts seem to be pushed or guided in a more motivated and orderly fashion. I insufflate an additional 15mg, switching nostrils. The burn is just as bad this time...it's really caustic feeling and I can imagine with repeated administration there would be significant damage to not only the nasal passages, but the mucus membrane itself. Current state: 1/10</p><p>9:00pm (T+0:30)- Noted stimulation becoming apparent. I peruse experience reports online and look into administration via vaporisation. I decide it's safe enough to warrant a try and load up 10mg in my pipe. Very sweet and acrid smelling smoke, tastes pretty bad. Immediate rush felt upon exhaling and I settle into my bed comfortably. Once the rush wears off I feel as if I'm reaching a plateau. I get distracted for the next 3 and a half hours by the computer, music, and communicating with a few friends. Current state: 5/10</p><p>9:30pm (T+1:00)- Peaking reallll nice, my mind is slightly fuzzy. Only a little euphoria but enough to compliment the social push its given me. I'm motivated to do things I'd normally put off indefinitely. Music sounds more appreciable; I say this because it's not necessarily better but I can pretty much groove to anything. No appetite. I insufflate an additional 30mg and flush my nasal passages. Current state: 7.5/10</p><p>12:00am (T+3:30)- Coming down; suddenly riding a gentle wave down to what feels like will be a manageable yet obnoxious comedown. I insufflate an additional 30mg. Right back where I started, feeling great. Chest tachycardia is pronounced by this point; just enough to be annoying and slightly worrying. It goes away and comes back throughout the night. Current state: 7/10</p><p>12:30am (T+4:00)- I decide to vaporise another 15mg; the rush isn't very pushy, but it puts me at a high pleateau, I'd say a solid 8/10 state. No more vaping for me, the chemical smell and taste isn't worth it honestly and I'd rather insufflate the material. I consider plugging some but decide against it. Vaping this chemical appears to reduce its duration; about 15 min after this dose I feel where I was at midnight. Current state: 7/10</p><p>1:30am (T+5:00)- Urge to redose is compulsive but not so much as other stimulants. I like my dopamine but this chemical doesn't seem to screw with it much so I decide it's worth redosing. I aim high to account for tolerance and insufflate 100mg. Wow OW OW OW worst burn ever, I shed tears almost instantly. Burn wears off after maybe 2 minutes. I'm at a solid 8.5/10 state for the next 2 hours or so. Begins wearing down again and by T+9:30 I'm at a current state of 4/10.</p><p>6:00am (T+9:30)- Last 25mg insufflated, only brings me to a 6.5/10. I'm glad I only had 250mg to test out or I probably would've ended up worse off. This chemical has potential as a vanilla stimulant but it causes pronounced chest pain and increased heart rate. My BPM was 170 at the time of my last entry.</p><p>7:30am (T+11:00)- Still wide awake, settling into the comedown nicely. It's manageable. I'm still pretty motivated but I could use some food and I know I might end up cranky today if I don't sleep. I would consider this a successful trial of ethylphenidate and I would think it similar to cocaine. This chemical is sometimes called 'diet coke' and I find it to be a fitting anecdote from what I've been told about cocaine. The fiendish redosing is partly due to compulsive habits on my part, but the chemical shows potential for addiction on its own. Next time I'll probably set aside a maximum amount for an evening and make the rest inaccessible.</p>",
