 "report": [
  "I decided to try chewing the leaves of a plant in my girlfriends garden. I experienced a calming effect beginning after about fifteen minutes. I suffer from lower back pain which to a large extent is aggravated by an anxiety disorder I've had for 7 years now. I have tried many antidepressants, anxiolytics and pain killers and nothing has worked as good as chewing Brunfelsia Grandiflora.",
  "I experience virtually zero drowsiness, which is a major negative aspect of most anxiolytics. For about two hours after the stuff first kicks in I am 95% plus pain free in my back. This happens every time I chew even when I have done major exercise which usually gives me severe muscle pain. Cognitively speaking it makes me very focused on the task at hand. This is a great advantage for someone with Post traumatic stress disorder due to the negative and fatigue related effects of hypervigilance. I also sleep like a baby every night after I've chewed some.",
  "At present I am taking no pain killers, which hasn't happened for about 5 years now. I also have no need for my anxiolytics at present. I experience no memory problems, in fact my memory [short term] hasn't been this good in years - probably related to decreased anxiety. I experience myself as much more sociable and do not get irritated by the stupid little things that I used to get irritated by.",
  "There is no trip involved in this drug."
