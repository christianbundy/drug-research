 "report": "<p>I was reading about absinth when I discovered that White Cedar leaves are a source of thujone. I remembered that there was such a tree right outside the front door and decided to pluck leaves from it. I chewed as much as would fit in my mouth (yucky) until it felt like a thick paste. I swallowed it and chased it down with water.</p><p>It left the taste and sensation of menthol in my mouth and even more so when I burped (pleasurable). This was all on an empty stomach. An hour later I felt a bit sick (duh). I kept drinking water and the feeling subsided. Next the stimulant effects of thujone began to set in. I became buzzed and felt wide awake for a couple of hours. It was an interesting experience!</p>",
