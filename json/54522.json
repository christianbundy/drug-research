 "report": "<p>I had several positive DXM experiences while taking 150 mg of Effexor XR (venlafaxine) daily.  I took DXM in the form of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough, since it contains only DXM (besides all the icky syrup).  My usual dose was 2.7mg/kg.  My DXM and Effexor experiences took place mostly in the presence of a loved one and/or friends, in a private setting.  Listening to electronic music always was pleasant for me.  Sound would seem like it was coming in waves at times, as opposed to a continuous stream.  Also, visual information, and especially motion, would come in frames.  I found this to be quite entertaining.</p><p>One possibly negative perceptual alteration involved being somewhat cut off from my bodily senses, such that I may not be able to detect my own heartbeat.  Nausea definitely was not uncommon, but I found that not eating anything heavy for a few hours before ingesting DXM was a good idea.  At the same time, I usually would eat something very light before ingesting DXM, such as crackers or bread, so that my stomach would not be entirely empty (which also can contribute to nausea).</p><p>My DXM experiences were not blunted or reduced by being on Effexor, and I had no negative reactions as a result of the combination.</p>",
