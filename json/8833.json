 "report": "<p>\nMy friend was recently suspected by his mom of smoking pot. She then bought a Urine test, but never gives it to him, hoping it will prevent him from smoking weed. Well it has. So we decided to find a good high elsewhere. We have often heard that smoking small amounts of catnip would produce a weed-like buzz, so we figured a lot would get us stoned. We mixed tobacco with catnip (Won't work well otherwise) and starting using Gravity Hits. Almost instantly after holding in a hit, we both felt a buzz. However, the buzz peaks at about 60 seconds then subsides. After smoking 15 bowls we finally realized this. However, we did laugh a bit more for about 30 min, but the felling wasn't even close to smoking low grade weed. Although inhaling catnip isn't too bad, when you exhale a very bad taste engulfs your neck.</p><p>I don't recommend this to anyone looking for a legal or cheap high. The effects are so short that you can't enjoy them. The taste is pretty yucky. If you never had a buzz before, dont waste your time trying to get one with catnip. But hey, you do get to tell people you've smoked catnip before :)</p>",
