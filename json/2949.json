We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</p><p>I had heard from a mutual friend that huffing freon could produce a very good but short lasting 'buzz'.  After learning and studying on how to retrieve the freon from air conditioners, my best friend and I tried it.  It's sweet, tastes almost like honey.  We were huffing in our 'party barn' with hard wood floors and a pool table.  I took in about 4 huffs the first time and handed the bag to my friend.  I started to almost feel as if I was falling asleep and sought the nearest chair.  As I awoke from what seemed to be an hour long trip and saw my friend crawling around like a dog I found myself laughing.  Well, we both 'sobered' up and I tried it again.</p><p>This time I was leaning against the pool table and kept huffing and huffing, telling my friend to grab the bag when I closed my eyes.  The last thing I remember is my face boucing off the side of the pool table.  I woke up in a ear piercing scream that seemed to be coming from my mouth.  And to my surprise it was.  Laying stomach down on the hard wood floor, my chin propped up.  I couldn't move, it was as if I had lost all control over my muscles.  My friend came over and tried to help me up.  When he touched me I screemed in bloody murder.  All-in-all, I had huffed about 10-15 hits, we think, and passed out slamming into the pool table on my travels downward and then onto the floor.  I broke my neck and have nerve damage for the rest of my life.  Unless you're a complete dumbass, PLEASE, do not do this stuff.  Looking for a cheap high, just forget freon, its a bad scene.</p>",
