  "Method of extraction: 10g Cebil onto ~500mg Caapi leaves, using bufotenine IPA extraction tek",
  "t 00:00  4:00. 4 small cones of Caapi leaves infused with Cebil extract were smoked. Unsure of exact dose strength, but aimed mild.",
  "t 3:00  8:00. Feeling of tightness in face and slight nausea, mildly uncomfortable.   Slight 'distancing' from 'normal space', slight balance perceptual alterations when standing up but easy to adjust with very mild concentration.",
  "t 4:00. Lay down on bed in dark room.",
  "t 5:00. Visuals began to start. Built in perceptual level with active concentration.",
  "t 8:00. Nausea and peripheral tightness had subsided almost completely.",
  "t 9:00. Visuals present (closed eye only). Subtle but definite.",
  "Characteristics ",
  "Rapid cycling/flashing through images (approx 5 per second).",
  "Image style  'real world' visuals (i.e. of common day events), i.e. non-psychedelic.",
  "Head space  normal space clarity, but with a dreamy edge. No ontological distortion or adjustments which seems characteristic with other members of the tryptamine family.",
  "t 15:00 (approx). The odd (approx every 30 sec) more characteristic DMT style visual briefly appears overlaying the 5/sec non-psychedelic visuals. Head space  normal space.",
  "t 30:00 (guess). Effects slowly ramp off. Enter into more standard dream state / rest.",
  "Fell asleep after the experience. Dreams particularly vivid and semi lucid.",
  "2 stages of dreams (in both occurrences):",
  "Stage 1  snapshots of images in a surrounding (normal space) with a focus on particular events occurring. Non linear, small snapshot (3-4 second) type sections.",
  "Stage 2  The full dream, but as each dream lead to an event where the stage 1 snap shot was about to happen a realization would occur of awareness of what was about to happen and corresponding lucidness. It was like being aware of the future.",
  "No noticeable after effects. Next day hangover and couldn't see the future, even with thinking about it really hard.",
  "Worth trying more next time as this apparently passes the visuals past the normal space into psychedelic space."
