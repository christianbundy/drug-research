 "report": [
  "Carefully weighing out 120+-mg of pharmaceutical 2C-T-7, I added the crystals to 30 ml of dH2O resulting in a solution of approximately 4mg/ml.",
  "4:00PM Off work, I take an 10cc oral dose syringe out (same one used to measure the water) and draw exactly 1cc (4 mg) of this solution and squirt unceremoniously into my mouth.",
  "4:30 waiting",
  "5:00 waiting",
  "5:30 a slight alert, only barely noticeable",
  "5:45 some mood elevation, slight nausea",
  "6:00 now I am feeling the substance. It has a warm very rosy feel to it, even though it was preceded by uneasy stomach.",
  "8:00 Ok, I know some will say it ain't so, but my curtains are revolving tubes of vertical colors. It isn't a huge visual, and it takes some staring, but it is there. This substance gives a secure and warm feeling. In a dose of 2mg it might be an excellent antidepressant. The edge of psychedelia is there even at 4mg, although I have heard it isn't active below 10mg.",
  "10:00 Down completely, weird background echos, but otherwise normal.",
  "excellent material. I recommend experimentation in both higher and lower dosages, perhaps as low as 1mg. Certainly I went over threshold at 4mg."
