 "report": "<p>I previously had no experience with 2C-I or any of the similar phenethylamines. Throughout all of my experiences with 2C-I, I was not on any medications and taking no one drugs besides smoking marijuana.</p><p>I first tried this drug nasally, and found the dosing for this method to be a little more than required for smoking, but a lot less than oral dosing. The burn was pretty minimal, and the taste was easily ignored. This way took about 30 minutes or so to feel the effects.</p><p>Oral dosing worked out different than I expected. I tried this about 4 times and then stopped using this method, and I don't reccomend it for a few reasons. My friends and I found it hard to tell how much was needed for a person, and went through a few runs without achieving effects. Another reason why I don't reccomend oral dosing is that it produced stomach cramps and head aches in a few people including myself. I found that if I ate a small amount, say 10mg, and then an hour later smoked some it helped. But this was not needed and probably a waste of material. Eating lasted about 8 hours, and would peak at 2.</p><p>Smoking this drug turned out to be my favorite method. The way I would smoke it was in a light bulb, and i would vaporize all of the material and get all of the smoke. 2C-I was never too hard on the lungs, but it smells pretty strange. Onset when smoked was almost instant, and would last about an hour. really good.</p><p>When I am peaking on this drug, it almost feels a little like the buzz of alcohol. This drug does not cloud my thinking, but it makes thinking an unwanted task. I didn't feel this drug was at all similar to ecstacy, for some reason I heard some one say this before. I have never done 2C-B, but I haven't done anything this drug is very comparable to on its own. This drug feels pretty good and is quite interesting, but I didn't think it was anything that special. Combining this drug with marijuanna increases the effects and makes them extremely noticable, and I found that was always the best way to use it.</p>",
