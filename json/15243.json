 "report": [
  "I tried dilaudid for the first time with my fiance, who had obtained the drug from a friend, calling it 'dalotta'. I had never heard of it, but my fiance said it was similar to a heroin high. We crushed up the 2 mg pills, and snorted them. I instantly felt a warmth flowing through my head. It worked quickly, and had no unpleasant burn. (I usually have my fiance blow first, to inform me of the burn factor.)",
  "I sat at my computer, and the words just seemed to type themselves, I had so much to say all of a sudden. About 15 minutes later, I began to feel a burst of energy. It was such a different feeling than what I had been experiencing not much earlier. I felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria and love for all things on earth, and I guessed that this must be what heroin is like. No wonder it's so easy to get addicted. I know it sounds bad to say that I am doing this as a mother, but my children were safely in bed before I even thought about taking the pills. However, I wanted so badly just to wake them up and cuddle them. I just wanted to hug everyone. Intermittent urges to just get up and hug my fiance were irresistible. I wanted to float away. Then about half an hour later came the calming feeling again, and I stretched out on my couch.",
  "I relaxed for about fifteen minutes, and suddenly felt the need to sleep. I couldn't keep my eyes open, like my lids were made of lead. I couldn't even PHYSICALLY pry them open. So we bumped another 4mil. I instantly felt that surge of warmth again, and wanted to dance around. I felt strong. I felt invincible. I felt like none of my thoughts were stupid, and everything I said was so insightful. We talked about music, television, gameshows, people, work, EVERYTHING. I don't even know anything about politics, and all of a sudden, we were debating about presidential nominees and their platforms. About 45 minutes later, I got the tiredness again. It was nearing 11:00 pm, and the tired was taking over me. My eyelids were heavy as before, and I decided it was time for me to go to bed. However, when I stood up, I felt sick. I felt like I had to vomit. But I couldn't. So I went to bed. FIVE MINUTES LATER, I was wide awake. I must have layed down and got up about twenty times, before finally settling in bed.",
  "The next day, I woke up sick. I threw up once, and didn't feel better. But that would be the last of the vomiting. All day, I felt lethargic and tired and sick. I napped it off, and thought about what had been happening to my body. It wasn't an experience I regret, it just wasn't as predictable. Having taken all things into consideration, I would definitely do it again."
