  "Tea Preparation:",
  "1 Tablespoon Damiana",
  "1 Tablespoon Scullcap",
  "1 1/2 Cups Of Water (about a half cup will be boiled away)",
  "1 Tablespoon Sugar",
  "I brought the water to a boil and added the herbs.  Boiled for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.  Strained mixture through a coffee filter into a glass measuring cup.  After boiling I was left with just a bit over 1 cup of the tea.  It didn't really smell that great, so I did not have high hopes for a good taste.",
  "5:30 T-0:00  Drank the tea down real fast.  It didn't taste bad at all!  It had a strong odor and a dark golden color (kind of like urine).  The sugar might have helped the taste, which was somewhat bitter.",
  "6:00 T-0:30  I feel quite relaxed right now, kind of like a very mild stoned feeling.  I'm interested in where this is going.  I put on some music.  I'm kind of paranoid and I don't usually get paranoid.",
  "6:15 T-0:45  Maybe I need to wait it out a while longer, I took a pretty good dose of tea and effects are very mild still.  Music sounds really good.  I'm getting tired.  I'll give it more time.",
  "7:00 T-1:30  Still feeling the mild high off the tea, I smoke a couple bowls of damiana through a water pipe.  Pleasant smoking experience...I feel quite stoned after this.",
  "7:15 T-1:45 WOW!!  I'm spacing out bad.  I feel like a smoked a joint of some goooood weed.  I never expected this kind of a euphoria, this is great.",
  "7:45 T-2:15  For the last 20 minutes or so I have felt a gradual comedown off the high and anything I am feeling right now is very mild.",
  "All in all it was a good experience.  I'm not sure If I felt much effects from the tea, it was barely anything.  When I smoked the 2 bowls I felt a great high for about a half an hour, which is pretty awesome considering I paid $1 for my ounce of Damiana."
