 "report": "<p>Short Story:</p><p>When I went to the doctor several months ago (an addiction specialist who is helping me overcome an opiate addiction) I was asked to submit a urine specimen for testing.</p><p>I had recently been to a Roger Waters: Dark Side of the Moon concert where I had indulged in smoking marijuana as well as ingesting dried San Pedro (Trichocereus Pachanoi) cactus which is 1%-2% mescaline by volume.</p><p>The testing was done right there in the doctors office using what looked like several different over-the-counter testing kits that use multiple 'indicator strips' that change color and appearance when put in contact with the urine.</p><p>I tested positive for most everything, which I expected, but I also tested positive for Amphetamines which surprised me.</p><p>A month went by and steadily that positive indication on each new Amphetamine indicator strip test was slowly fading until I was finally negative for Amphetamines.</p><p>That same week the doctor confronted me with the results of my first urine which he had sent to a Lab for further analysis by GC/MS methods. By this time I had my own working theory that it was the Mescaline that 'flagged' my earlier positive amphetamine test.</p><p>However, the lab results of the GC/MS testing showed no amphetamines were present in any detectable levels. The reason is because although the lab tested for 20+ drugs, 3,4,5-trimethoxy--phenethylamine was not one of the the drugs on the list.. and they look for specifics.</p><p>The next weekend I coincidentally decided to have another mescaline experience. And on my very next doctor visit I tested positive again for amphetamines, surprise.</p><p>The moral of the story is, in my humble opinion, ironically it likely that mescaline will be detected as an amphetamine using low tech Over-The-Counter test kits and the NIDA-5 govt. standard test but the more high tech GC/MS testing methods often do not SPECIFICALLY check for the presence of mescaline unless requested/suspected by whomever is requesting the testing.</p><p>[Reported Dose: 'threshold 200mg']</p>",
