 "report": "<p>It does help sometimes with my insomnia, but the most interesting thing is that sometimes when using valerian root extract I get a huge erection, and I am certain after many tests that it is because of the valerian.  We might have in our hands the next viagra, or maybe I'm just weird.  I'm only 24 so I don't use it for erectile dysfunction, but it might be a good idea.</p>",
