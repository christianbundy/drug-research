 "report": [
  "I decided to try them. I simply went to the doc and he gave then to me with no questions because I have bad knees. Anyway I started out with a low dose cause people reported good experiences with 150 - 200mg it did nothing for me, and I even threw in a couple xanax to boost it still nothing. Finally I said screw it and took 8 of my 50mg pills still nothing. All this drug is good for is relieving minor pain it has no recreational value what so ever to me. I will say it seemed to cause insomnia for about 3 days which sucks since I was expecting a nod like dreamsatate that I get from real opiates."
