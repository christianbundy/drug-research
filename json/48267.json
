 "report": "<p>I ground 500 morning glory seeds in a coffee grinder and mixed them well with a glass of lemonade and drank them down.  Within twenty minutes I was on the phone with my girlfriend and the trip started to set in.  I felt overall just really happy and excited that the seeds actually worked because before taking the seeds I had my doubts.  I must of appeared out of it because it was around 8:00 at night and my mom came in to say goodnight and she ended up getting angry with me because she new I was high.</p><p>After hanging up the phone with my girlfriend I went in the basement where my room was and I began to pace back and forth very confused.  Confused about life and what it would feel like to die and what was beyond all that we know.  At this time  I was lieing on my bed in my room with just my boxers on with my feet over my head and I kept saying this is what it must feel like to die and I kept saying this.  From what I can remember the idea popped into my head to cut myself because I knew that I couldnt feel anything.</p><p>I got out of bed and grabbed a razor blade from my desk.  I slashed my wrist and laughed.  I saw the blood drip from my arm. I slashed my chest and stomach several times and even my penis and drew blood.  At that point I was convinced that I was insane and I told myself how insane are you nick?  I slashed my wrist again and it felt good, an intense feeling but not pain but closer to pleasure.  I pressed the razor to my wrist while I was looking up and dragged the razor along my wrist.  I looked down at my arm and said FUCK I had cut deep and was looking at my muscle.</p><p>I knew I was in trouble so I ran upstairs and down the hallway to my moms room where she was sleeping.  I opened the door and said Mom Im sorry.  I kept saying Mom Im sorry for some reason she saw the blood and jumped out of bed and brought me to the bathroom.  She ran the wound under cold water and called 911.  I was standing in the bathtub when the paramedics came.  The paramedics asked me what I took and I said morning glory seeds.  They bandaged my wound and put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance I went.  I kept going on and on about the morning glory seeds and how good they where how the paramedics had to try them.  And off to the hospital I was.</p><p>After getting to the hospital they wheeled me in and put me in between two curtain like booth things.  A nurse gave me charcoal to drink in a cup with a straw and I remember the charcoal tasting sweet as if it where a smoothy or something.  I drank it down as if it tasted good.  After sitting in a hospital bed all night the doctor finally came to sew my arm up.  He stitched my arm which took over 20 stitches and then I left the hospital with my mom.  Im still high mind you after all this time.</p><p>Me and my mom were headed for Harbor Oaks Psychiatric hospital where my probation officer told me I had to go.  I was at the hospital for a week when they told me I was safe to leave.  From the hospital I went right to court where they had an emergency hearing for me and I was admitted in to the county detention facility where I was awaiting placement or a treatment facility to go to.  I was in detention for a month before leaving for a Youth Center where I was for just under six months.  Now Im home and still on probation and in drug court and am still getting high.</p>",
