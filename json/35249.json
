 "report": "<p>This an overview of my experience with Codeine over the past 9 months.</p><p>I take AC&C pills (aspirin w/ codeine, available OTC in Canada), usually 20 at a time (at 8mg per pill, so 160mg total), filtered with coffee filters, around once a week on average. So far I have not noticed any tolerance or withdrawal symptoms, so I presume my doses are small and infrequent enough to be safe.</p><p>I find codeine to be a very pleasant, relaxing drug that begins to take effect within 20 minutes and lasts around 3-4 hours although it tails off after the two hour mark. As someone else mentioned, the effects are comparable to a few drinks in the evening, but last longer and are more consistent. In fact, I'm surprised that codeine 'abuse' is not more widespread, because I enjoy it a lot.</p><p>There are some side effects, which may explain the above, and which I manage to work around:</p><p>- I sometimes get a bit itchy. This is counteracted by taking a single antihistamine (dramamine) tablet before ingesting the codeine, which incidentally seems to make the trip more relaxing as well.</p><p>- Pupils constricted. No big deal, but someone will occasionally remark that my eyes look really, really blue.  ;)</p><p>- Interferes with digestion. CAN BE A BIG PROBLEM. In the early days I would eat after taking codeine and end up with a stomach ache that would keep me up all night. Not fun at all. To avoid indigestion, I make sure I haven't eaten in at least 2 hours, and will not eat again until AT LEAST four hours after ingestion. This means of course that I cannot eat for six hours straight, and so limits the times when I can comfortably take codeine.</p><p>- Insomnia. Caused in large part no doubt by the caffeine (15mg/pill) that does not get separated by the filtration process. I only take codeine in the afternoon so both the opiate and caffeine have completely worn off by bedtime.</p><p>- If I have responsibilities (e.g. baby) when on codeine, I sometimes feel very irritable when my relaxed state is interrupted. It's a strange feeling to be euphoric and yet annoyed at the same time. I don't bother unless I know I will not be interrupted during the trip.</p><p>- This is not a side effect, but because the relaxing and euphoriant effects are subtle, I don't do anything strenuous (physically or mentally) while on the codeine. The effects can easily be overwhelmed.</p><p>That's it. As you can see, the side effects mean there are only so many times and places where codeine is worth the trouble. I see this is a benefit because it means I will not be tempted to impulsively take the drug, say, on weeknights. In nine months, I have never been seriously tempted to ramp up my use.</p><p>I'm interested in drugs that genuinely add to one's life, on the long term. It appears that I may have found just such a drug in codeine.</p>",
