 "report": "<p>Today I was prescribed wellbutrin.  After reading some reports I decided to give it a try.  I ignored the posts about how much it burns.  After all, everybody told me that ketamine and mdma would burn a lot and it wasn't that big a deal.  I was dead WRONG!  Snorting this stuff was the most unpleasant drug experience I've ever had.  It burns a lot in both my nose and my throat.  The drip tastes nasty as hell, and everything tastes weird now.  My nose wont stop producing mucus, and I feel like I need to sneeze. I don't feel high in any way (although I realize 100mg isnt much).  I will never attempt to use this drug recreationally again.  It simply isn't worth it.  The person who reported getting 'used to it' must have iron nostrils.  I strongly recommend against snorting this foul chemical no matter how curious one may be about it.  Do yourself a favor and just take as prescribed.</p>",
