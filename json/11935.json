  "<p>After not smoking for 2 months due to having to pass a pre employment test for a new job I decided to test myself to see what detection times would be in my system. Smoked Friday night, one bowl in a medium sized blown glass pipe. Tested with a home Marijuana testing kit on Sunday afternoon approximately 40 hours after I smoked and I was clean. I have been able to repeat this test several times. Most recently I smoked 3 days in a row (one bowl each day) and tested clean after 5 days. I now know it is possible for me to smoke on a Friday night and be clean by work Monday in case of a random test. It depends on metabolism though so test yourself too.</p>"
