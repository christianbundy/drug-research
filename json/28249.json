 "report": "<p>So after a long long thursday of doing work I decided I needed to take a vicodin (hydrocodone) to chill out a little after midnight.  As soon as it kicked it I went and joined my friends who were partying down the street.  They were all quite drunk and I realized that I needed to chill myself out a little more as I was on edge after about 12 straight hours of reading and writing papers and going to class.  So, I crushed up 2 10mg valiums and blew half of the powder, sharing the rest with my friend.  As soon as I walked out of her bedroom my other friend offered me some coke.  I hesitated at first but hearing the crazyness going on in the living room I decided it would be a good idea.  I went into the bathroom when he left it and found a large (for me, I don't do a lot of coke) line, said what the hell, and blew it.</p><p>By the way, the reason I was doing pharmies instead of drinking in the first place was to prevent getting a hangover so that I could finish a midterm in the morning.  After doing the coke, I felt that I NEEDED a drink.  Initially, the cocktail of uppers and downers made it a little hard to interact, but after about three glasses of wine (I say about because I drank them out of the plastic bag of a franzia box) I saw this really cute girl I have a huge crush on and after feeling sketchy at first, settled into the conversation and had a really good time flirting and talking with her, though we eventually parted ways b/c I have a girlfriend.</p><p>But, after this we left the apartment and I started to feel GREAT!  The combination of drugs spread a warm euphoria throughout my body and I felt like I could say whatever I wanted, even if I knew it might not make the most sense.  My 3 friends and I stumbled upon a dance on campus that was pretty much empty and was playing absolutely horrible music.  We went in and danced our asses off in the most ridiculous of ways, throwing our bodies around, and having a incredible time of just being stupid and communicating with each other and the music by making fun of it with our bodies.  The feeling inside my mind and body was really unbelievable, a state of being absolutely in the moment and not caring about anything but making the present fun and having a good time.  I finally made it to sleep around 5am, after way more partying and getting fucked up than I had planned.</p><p>Remarkably, I awoke at 9:30 the next morning feeling perfectly clear minded and lucid with no hangover whatsoever.  The combination of substances was perfect, I would do it every night if it wasn't for the obvious fact that mixing such highly addictive drugs probably isn't a good habit to get into.</p>",
