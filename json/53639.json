 "report": "<p>I noticed an unexpected interaction between the wellbutrin I was taking and MDMA.</p><p>I had been taking 150mg wellbutrin 2x/day and when I took 120mg mdma, the effects took an extra 1/2 hour to kick in. </p><p>I tried it a few times and the results were the same, everyone else got off before i did!   The intensity and type of effects from the MDMA were the same as they were when I wasn't on wellbutrin, not any stronger or weaker.</p>",
