  "Have a decent amount of experience with Morning Glory Seeds. Heavenly Blue work the best. 300 or so seeds is decent, 500 full on. I weigh 180lbs.",
  "My best method:",
  "Wash the seeds THOROUGHLY. Put the seeds in a deep bowl with a little water and a drop of dishwashing liquid. Work it around in a lather. You will notice it turns a little brownish purple. Rinse in a strainer and repeat the washing process until the suds have no color. The coloration in the suds is from a powder that the plant produces that causes stomach irritation. After washing, spread out on a paper towel and dry thoroughly.",
  "Crush the seeds. It is best to use a mortar/pestle bowl - used to crush herbs and stuff. Put the mashed up seeds into a container of yogurt and eat. I experience a very clean high with no ill effects. I start my journey early in the morning before sunrise if possible. Because the flowers are closed at night and open with the sunrise, the experience is heightened using this timing. MG seeds are actually relaxing - I hit a little drowsey state which is quite pleasent. I usually make sure to be around some trees or plants at some point, music is nicely enhanced. I reccommed this experience to anyone."
