 "report": [
  "I managed to obtain 100 mg of this material, and sampled on 3 separate occasions. I tried 20 mg, but required 30 mg to get full effects. On an empty stomach, took half an hour for 4-HO-DiPT to take effect. I felt some euphoria, was in a better mood, conversation flowed in a positive and meaningful way. Visuals were somewhat similar to what I experienced on 5-MeO-DiPT. Experience lasted 3-4 hours, but I experienced aftereffects for sometimes a full 24 hours after dosing, which partially may have been due to lack of sleep. Can't say anything too negative about this one per se, but am not particularly excited about it either. My husband, who took 20 mg once, did not enjoy this compound."
