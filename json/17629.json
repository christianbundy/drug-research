 "report": [
  "I read about the sexual enhancing capabilities of Damiana and wanted to see if it was true. So I brewed myself some tea and sweetened it with honey. It is a very aromatic and pleasing smelling herb. I drank a cup of the tea. I did not notice any changes or feelings or any effects at all, until I went to sleep. While sleeping I experienced full color, intense dreams that incorporated events, sex, conversations, movie characters and friends from the my last 3 days that I was awake. I say dreams, but it was only one long dream with different stories pieced together. I woke up amazed. I drank some tea again 3 days later and the same thing happened. There were no other chemicals, herbs or alcohol involved in this experience. It was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend others try to see if they have the same experience."
