  "<p>I decided to to try smoking some damiana leaves to attain a buzz( I have not been able to smoke ganja in over a year due to random urine analysis.) So I purchased some from a local store and excitedly went home to try it out.",
  "I immediatly packed a bowl and smoked it right down, nothing! I waited ten min and smoked some more, nothing! At this point I figured I would eat( a couple grams, maybe three) some as this had worked for others, nothing! Until the next morning when I had quite an experience in the bathroom.</p>"
