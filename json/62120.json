 "report": [
  "<p>This is my experience of Zopiclone (Imovane). When it was first prescribed to me, I was ordered to take 1 pill of Imovane to induce sleep.",
  "9:00: I take the pill. No sudden changes.",
  "9:10: A mild, bitter taste arises in my mouth.",
  "9:30: The bitter taste is potent but no physical or mental changes.",
  "I guess it is because of my weight that I did not feel any sleepiness or weakness.",
  "The next night I took 2 pills of Imovane.",
  "9:00: take pill.",
  "9:10: same bitter taste in mouth and light headedness.",
  "9:30: potent bitter taste and weightlessness.",
  "9:45: I felt as if I weight 20lbs, I felt like I was floating through my house. I couldnt even feel the floor with my feet. I felt euphoria in a mild degree. The experience was like being drunk, but better.",
  "9:50: I start feeling tired but all experiences peak. The euphoria is there. I felt as if I was flying at this time.",
  "10:00: I crash. My body feels weak and I just collapse onto my bed.",
  "The next day I can still taste the bitter in my mouth. It goes away just before lunch. My experience with Imovane was a nice, safe, carefree experience.</p>"
