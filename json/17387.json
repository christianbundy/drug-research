 "report": [
  "I got bored one night and was out of whipped cream, so I decided to smoke some clove. I put it in some rolling paper and rolled a clove ciggie, lit it, and took a mouthful. My mouth went numb, my eyes teared slightly, and my nose burned. I took 3 more mouthfuls, maintaining the mouth numbness but the burning in my eyes and mouth subsided. I felt sort of tired about 1 minute after the 4th toke. Not the most fun substance, but good if I have a mouth sore or oral pain."
