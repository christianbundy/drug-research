  "I have been suffering from migraine and cluster headache for about ten years now. I could also be categorized as person with a chronic headache. I have regular seizures at least twice a month. Usually it can be stopped whit ordinary anti-inflamantories in the early state of pain. So it is usually the case that if I get even the slightest feeling of headache it will manifest itself to migraine seizure in a period of time if not treated somehow. As a result of the hell-like experiences I have developed quite accurate and sensitive sense which I can use to determinate that the seizure is coming.",
  "I have few experiences with morning glory seeds (dosage of 100-290 ipomea tricolor seeds), 2c-t-7 (5-10 mg up the nose) and psilocybe cubenis (Mexican) of dosages of 1-3 dried average? size mushrooms orally or shared a joint of half a average size mushroom shared with someone. All these substances have the same charestiristic concerning headache. I really feel that there is no possibility for a headache or migraine under the influence of these substances. It is something that I feel. Even the smallest dosages of these substances have this effect.",
  "Usually migraines are also mood related and stress (Low serotonine levels) causes to trigger migraine seizures."
