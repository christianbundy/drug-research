 "report": [
  "I took twelve mg of DHEA per day for five days. The first two to three days were  great!  I felt a lot of energy and wanted to tell the world about this great supplement. Then, I got really, really sick. I felt just terrible for days until I stopped... then I gradually returned to normal.",
  "I did some reading and found that lots of people have problems with the dosages that are commonly sold over the counter. (fifty, twenty five or even a hundred mgs are sold here in Minnesota). I did try again with five mgs and the same thing happened except I didn't get AS sick as before. For me, I think this is a supplement that I can take only occasionally for energy but not on consecutive days."
