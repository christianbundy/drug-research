 "report": "<p>I took twelve mg of DHEA per day for five days. The first two to three days were  great!  I felt a lot of energy and wanted to tell the world about this great supplement. Then, I got really, really sick. I felt just terrible for days until I stopped... then I gradually returned to normal.</p><p>I did some reading and found that lots of people have problems with the dosages that are commonly sold over the counter. (fifty, twenty five or even a hundred mgs are sold here in Minnesota). I did try again with five mgs and the same thing happened except I didn't get AS sick as before. For me, I think this is a supplement that I can take only occasionally for energy but not on consecutive days.</p>",
