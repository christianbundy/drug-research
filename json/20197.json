  "While attending a local rave I noticed a booth set up offering flavored oxygen.  I was currently on 2 tablets of MDMA and had finished my initial rush or 'peak' from the MDMA and decided to give it a try.  I was charged 5 dollars (US) for about 8 minutes of oxygen filtered through a series of 4 different 'flavor liquids.'  A clear pastic tube was hooked to the flavor device that was patched into an oxygen generator.  The tube was the standard nose tube used in hospitals to give patients oxygen.  I opted to use all 4 flavor filters at the same time to get the ultimate amount of oxygen and proceeded to breath deeply.  After the first couple of breaths a second peak from the MDMA seemed to be occuring.  This second peak was more intense than the original yet felt more soothing and not as overpowering.  My eyes began to shake for a moment and I decided to shut them for the remainder of the oxygen dose.  After I finished with the oxygen, I felt very energized and proceeded to have the best 'roll' I had ever had.  I thanked the guy at the booth and bounded off to the dance floor.  I highly recommend oxygen during an MDMA experience and have used oxygen along with MDMA ever since."
