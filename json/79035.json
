 "report": "<p>I've recently started attending raves almost every weekend, and consequently, I have greatly increased my MDMA usage. Although sober raving is possible and still pretty fun, raves are definitely geared towards people in altered mindsets. Regardless, my constant MDMA usage was hard on my mental and physical health, so I contemplated my options. Psychedelics were definitely out. Although I strongly recommend careful and informed psychedelic usage, the experiences I get with them are much more private and introspective, therefore not good for a rave. Alcohol was also most definitely out, as I am not much of a drinker, and I usually have to drive myself and other friends to and from the events (I'll drive after a peak from MDMA is over, but I will NEVER drive drunk). [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>Straight up weed was also out, as it, again, is not a very active or super-social drug for me. I began to do my research. Ketamine and research chemicals seemed somewhat promising, but the increased dangers associated with these were enough to drive me away, at least for the time being. It was then that a friend suggested that I try an adderall/ cannabis mixture. The energy of an amphetamine combined with the head and body high of the marijuana would be enough to alter my mindset and keep me dancing all night. So I decided to experiment.</p><p>I started off by taking the adderall. I've taken it recreationally plenty of times before so I knew that 30 mg would be just enough to have me feeling the effects quite strongly. After the definite onset of the adderall, I ate a fairly strong brownie (sorry, I don't know the exact dosage), and began to drive a friend home a few towns over. After driving for about 15-20 min, I began to feel VERY strange. Now, right off the bat, I was surprised. Usually edibles take a good hour to 2 hours or more to hit me, but I was feeling this one quickly. I continued driving. By the time I reached my friend's exit a good 5-10 minutes later, I was feeling even weirder. My body temperature was fluctuating wildly, and my mind started wandering.</p><p>I pulled over and let my friend continue the drive, as I didn't really feel okay to drive. I turned the car light on and looked in the mirror to find that my pupils were fully dilated. As we drove on, my hands wandered obsessively over the car's fabric upholstery and my mind rocketed into a foggy euphoria. I put on some hardstyle techno, and itched to be at a rave, dancing. Mentally and physically, the trip was feeling incredibly similar to rolling, with a slightly more psychedelic edge (I was experiencing slight perceptional disturbances such as blurring of figures, objects drifting in and out of focus, and colors appearing much more vivid).</p><p>About 1 hour to 2 hours later, my peak was through and I could drive again, and about 3 hours to 4 hours later I felt normal. I slept soundly and didn't experience a hangover or burnout the following day. The similarities between this combination and MDMA were odd, surprising, and pleasant. Many friends of mine guessed it was due to the placebo effect, but I discounted this as I originally experimented with this combination to find an alternative to E, not a replacement for it. I have tried repeating this combination at raves with somewhat consistent levels of success. Although it falls short of ecstasy by a longshot, it has overall decreased my usage to a much more healthy level, and has been the safest and best alternative.</p>",
