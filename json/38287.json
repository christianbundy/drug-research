 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: The author of this report refers to AMT but it is quite possible that it is 5-MeO-AMT being erroneously referred to as 'AMT'. The doses at which AMT is active are unlikely to fit on blotter.]</p><p>Over the summer of 2004, I bought and sold 3 sheets (100 hits a sheet) of 'LSD.' I had never taken LSD before so this experience was my first, tripping on it a total of about 10 times.</p><p>My supplier ended up getting busted by the police and went to jail. One week later he came out of prison with a shocking story. He had been arrested in possession of what the cops had listed as 2 sheets of LSD. However, after they tested it at the federal lab he was soon released because what we had been taking and selling as acid actually turned out to be AMT. It was a good thing for my friend being that all he got was a week in jail and a fine instead of manslaughter charges. From what I had read about acid, my experiences on the drug seemed very similiar to what I had read. The trip lasted until about 12 hours after I ingested the substance, which had apparently been disolved in some liquid and dropped onto 1sq. cm pieces of perforated blotter paper. I had sold this stuff, and taken it myself believing it was acid. It caused intense time distortion, open and closed eye visuals, intense ability to focus geometrically and mathematically, etc. All the things that people say they experience off of acid.</p><p>AMT is a 'research chemical' and its effects are unknown, i still suffer from chronic 'tracers' and random 'mind fucks' also known as 'flashbacks.' Be careful you psychonaughts when taking acid, it could very well be AMT.</p>",
