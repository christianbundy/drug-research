 "report": [
  "I'm starting to become immune to DxM, because of the supposed 50 dose rule, I guess. So, I took double the minimal dose in order to get a mild high. Since I was experimenting with the recreational/etcetera effects of valerian, I popped one pill of said Valerian. What was unexpected, however, was my trip which felt as heavy as when I took 240 mg doses with 0-tolerance and 0-immunity.",
  "Further testing is needed, but I just wanted to share this with others."
