 "report": [
  "Last night I unwittingly combined DMAE with weed brownies to discover the second most intense trip of my entire life.  I take DMAE as a mild stimulant on dark wintery days.  My friend made some brownies that I ate merely because they were right there in front of me.  At no time had I thought the DMAE would inject THC warp speed into my body.",
  "This is a trip of deadly intensity.  I felt completely out of time and mostly out of my body.  I knew where I was and who I was, but at the same time was completely out of reality in a most uncomfortable fashion.  I have nearly a decade of drug abuse under my belt, but this experience was too much too swallow.  I found out that the 'better place' really isn't that swell. ",
  "I wound up begging my friends to take me to the ER for the deliverance of the valium injection.  They declined so I resorted to a homemade concoction of various downers I found within my medicine cabinet.  I was asleep within 2 hours of the experience starting, yet these were two of the longest hours I can remember.",
  "This report exists as a warning any potential experimenters out there.  This combination is too potent for mere mortals.  There was nothing pleasant about it."
