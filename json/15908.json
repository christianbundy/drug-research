 "report": [
  "The other night i decided to try to smoke nutmeg after a failed attempt at eating it. I didn't have any cig papers and couldn't get any, so I tried to use tea bags. I rolled a huge blunt with two tea bags and it held together well enough. So I went to llight it up. The shit is harder than hell to burn. The paper lit up and burned and all the nutmeg fell out. I got pissed. I went back inside made a pipe out of foil and a screen and filled it up. I lit it up this time and it took a while, but it worked. I inhaled the thick smoke. It was very thick. The taste was like weed and turpentine. It smelled really strong like weed, wood, and cigerettes. I smoked for about fourty minutes (half the bowl) and decided it wasn't working.",
  "I went inside to watch tv and about ten minutes later my hearing got weird. Kinda like it was muffled but super clear at the same time and I was hearing faint crackling sounds. I got a slight buzz, like a body high from M.J., but there was no change in perception. I was just really mellow with some hearing changes. The buzz lasted for about 40 minutes and then disappeared. The next morning I had a pretty bad headache. All in all, the nasty taste of the smoke and the headache wasn't worth the cheap buzz. I might, but proably won't do it again."
