 "report": "<p>I got back from work the other day extremely tired. I work at a coffee shop so we carry a variety of loose-leaf teas. I happened to have a bag of chamomile, sunflower and peppermint loose leaf tea and was curious what the effects of smoking it would be. So, I proceeded to mix a few grams of it with shisha (Hypnosis Blueberry Haze) and packed it into my hookah bowl.</p><p>Taste:</p><p>The smoke tasted AMAZING. The blueberry complimented the chamomile and peppermint for a very refreshing smoke. The clouds were extremely thick and voluminous. They were smooth and not harsh at all!</p><p>Effects:</p><p>Heavy physical sedation. It felt as if I took 6mg of Melatonin; my eyes were heavy and I was very relaxed. Smoking it over the next hour was extremely relaxing and stress-reducing. It is interesting to note the chamomile also had an anxiety-lowering effect as well.</p>",
