 "report": "<p>I have taken Bufo a few times, but only once with any strength.  The experience was like coming to a place in time that is complete bliss.  Like your soul has been waiting to return to this place in eternity.  You understand almost anything you question, yet you don't know anything at all.  You are connected to your intuition, and you are in the flow of synchronicity.  It is a place of honesty and love, and yet it is very intense.  Some people will be scared because its so intense.  Truth and understanding are intense things, but you get what you ask for, so don't be afraid.  Fear can help, but it usually is your consciousness trying to control the situation, like when you try to sober up and drive.  Let this fear go....Let the sacred toad talk to you... keep your mouth shut and your mind open.  Think about what you are trying to get out of the experience before and while you do it. I've heard It's best to be near a river or pond because DMT is a water spirit.</p><p>This Spring and Summer I will be doing sweat lodges with 5-MeO as the death agent, and the lodge as the rebirth.  I pray that it all goes well!!!!</p>",
