 "report": "<p>Recently I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and as a result was given a perscription of 60mg prednisone daily. I don't know what the deal with the other reports on this drug are but all it did to me was make me EXTREMELY hungry all the time, gave me terrible fatigue and made me manic and irritable. It worked wonders for my condition but aside from that this drug as no other uses.</p>",
