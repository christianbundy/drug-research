 "report": [
  "I typically enjoy the occasional pharmaceutical buzz. I tried one of my girlfriend's oxycodone the other night with a few drinks and it was great. A little lightheaded, silly and sleepy. It was pretty good. The next afternoon we each took one more. This time we had just consumed some coffee and a little lunch. No booze at all.  About 25 minutes later we were both super dizzy and nauseated. The kind of dizzy where you can't even move your head without wanting to vomit. Cold and sweaty. Just crappy all around. It lasted for about 6-7 hours. I guess the night before we went to sleep before the full effect of nausea hit us. Really disappointing."
