 "report": "<p>I dont normally go out of my way to write trip reports but, considering the relative lack of information on these chemicals, I feel compelled to in this case. I also tried to include information that I wanted to see more of in other reports. While this trip was relatively mundane, anything I can do to add to the knowledge base here could be valuable. I strongly encourage everyone to write up reports. The information we gather could save lives.</p><p>Background:</p><p>This was my first experience with any NBOMe, but my psychedelic experience includes LSD twice, DMT 20+ times, and mushrooms 30+ times. Im generally very tolerant of psychedelics, mentally and physically.</p><p>Report:</p><p>A friend and I each placed one complexed 600 ug 25C-NBOMe blotter buccally above our front teeth. I was told not swallow my saliva, and I did my best.</p><p>I started feeling some stimulant-like effects after about 30 minutes. At about 45 minutes, some mild visual started to become apparent. At this point, I removed the blotter from my mouth and threw it away.</p><p>The body high came on quickly and lasted until the end of the peak. Comparable to a low dose of MDMA, it was very pleasant. Early on, I noticed some slight vasoconstriction, which I probably only noticed because I was expecting it as a known side effect. It was mild, never worrying, and passed quickly. I experienced no nausea.</p><p>It was mid morning and I live in a fairly quiet suburban area. We decided to go for a walk during the come up at about 1h10m. The visuals outdoors werent very intense at this point, but the sensory overload was. No one was really outside, but we both felt conspicuous. Smoked a cigarette and walked back to the house fairly quickly. By the time we got back, the peak/plateau was starting.</p><p>I would describe the visuals as mild to moderate (Im very resistant to visuals) and they included strobing of shadows, patterning, slight breathing, and the like. One thing I noticed that was new to me was that any shadow or color with a gradient would stand out dramatically, especially if it also had a texture. This gradient effect was most noticeable in a shadow being cast across my living room ceiling. The shadow highlighted the texture of the ceiling and the texture would become exceptionally detailed, then blur, then become detailed again. It would go through this cycle at roughly my respiratory rate. Staring at my ceiling, patterns would form in the texture. Various patterns would group together and kind of dance around each other.</p><p>CEVs werent especially detailed, but were very enjoyable. I would describe them as dreamy and vaguely landscape-like. Some trip-hop music was on (DJ Krush  Code 4109), and the CEVs would kind of ebb and flow with the mood of the music. This was a great album for the trip. We skipped most of the vocal-heavy tracks.</p><p>The headspace was definitely psychedelic, although, decidedly not as introspective or enlightening as mushrooms or LSD. As I expected from the trip reports, the headspace on this chem was manageable and malleable. I had recently broken up with my girlfriend, so that was on my mind. While I didnt come to any epiphanies, I was able to put some thought into the situation and mull over other things going on in my life from a slightly different perspective.</p><p>The comedown started at about the 6-7 hour mark and, to be honest, it was a little rough. I blame this partially on the fact that I had over-exerted myself working out the day before. My shoulders were tense and I had a fairly bad headache. My friend and I were getting hungry at this point so we got some In-n-Out. After we ate, I didnt feel like doing much more than lying in bed and watching shows on my computer. Sleep came easily after a little weed and some melatonin. Keep in mind, we dosed around 9AM and I passed out around 10 or 11PM. The comedown continued into the next day. While not terrible, I didnt really feel like doing much.</p><p>My friend reported a very similar experience, the only major difference being slightly stronger visuals and a more tolerable comedown. So not anything mindblowing at this dose, but it was a lot of fun and I plan on doing more research on these, while gradually upping the dose (within reason).</p><p>One last thing:</p><p>While there is a certain degree of danger inherent in what we do, I just want to say: be safe, guys. If you decide to do your own research, please start low and space out your trips (at least two weeks between, preferably more). Very little is known about the LD50 and long-term effects of the NBOMe family.</p>",
