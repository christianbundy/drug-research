 "substance": "GVL",
 "bodyweight": "145 lb",
 "report": "<p>It's been a long day, I've had sinus problems all day, and been somewhat zonked from a combination of not not feeling good and taking sinus medicine.  Around 11:00 I had taken a Tavist-D which was making me feel pretty drained.</p><p>2:00 Mix 5 ml of GVL solution into a shot glass of water.  I have never tried GHB or GVL.  Because my insomnia has been getting steadily worse over the past year, I'm hoping that this will be an effective and legal sleep aid.</p><p>2:05 Make first attempt to drink the foul stuff.  Take half the shot then chase with coke.  Tastes like moonshine that has been allowed to dissolve a plastic container.  The aftertaste is worse.  The sweet coke smothers the taste for a minute, only for it to emerge more prevalent than before.</p><p>2:10 Finally managed to force myself to drink the rest.  Throat tried to close up to prevent me from swallowing this.</p><p>2:20 Rash/flushing that spreads out over my body.  Feels and appears very similar to a Vitamin B6 overdose.</p><p>2:25 Flushing gone</p><p>2:30 Convinced I 'feel something.' Light-headed, moderate relaxation.  A friend who has tried GVL before tells me it is probably placebo.</p><p>2:45 Not really feeling anything at this point, that can't easily be attributed to prior medication, etc. </p><p>Conclusion: A waste of time.  Tasted absolutely horrible, no discernible effect.  Diphenhydramine is definitely a superior sleep aid, as at this point (3:30) I'm more awake than when I dosed.  Glad that I got a trial dose before purchasing.</p>",
