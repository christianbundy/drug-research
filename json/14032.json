 "report": [
  "I have some experience with things such as vicodin and tramadol, but recently I discovered a bottle of codeine in my house so I decided to try it out. I have experience with marijuana for about four years and I've been trying different things to see if anything can match the awesome high of marijuana.",
  "10:20 pm: I mixed about 5 teaspoons of codeine with some sundrop and chugged the mixture.",
  "10:45 pm: I began to feel a bit of the effects of the codeine which included a warm, heavy feeling throughout my body while a lied in bed.",
  "11:00 pm: I decided to have a cigarette to try and boost the effects of the codeine. After the cigarette I felt rather wobbly and had a bit of trouble standing up. I lied down in bed again to relax and did a bit of reading and listened to some Black Dahlia Murder. I became very focused on the reading and the intensity of the music synchronized well with the mild high.",
  "12:30 am: I began to come down from the high and decided to vape about 1/3 gram of weed. I decided to listen to some more music and the high was causing me to have closed eye visuals that went along with the music.",
  "1:30 am: I my high was still pretty strong and I decided to do a bit more reading. I realized I was rather tired so I fell asleep within a few minutes.",
  "5:25 am: I was woken up by my mother for school and still felt a bit buzzed and spacey. I had an insatiable urge to eat Chinese food, so that was my breakfast (it was quite delicious at the time).",
  "6:10 am: After dozing off I went off to get a shower. Before the shower a parachuted 600 mg of gabapentin. Near the end of my shower, the water felt rather pleasant on my skin and I began to feel quite happy.",
  "6:45 am: As I walk to the bus stop walking feels way more awesome than it should and I seemed to have general pleasant mood. While sitting on the bus I listen to some more Black Dahlia Murder and really get into the music. As my bus driver speeds down the road I have a slight flying feeling.",
  "7:10 am: I begin talking to my good friend and I felt incredibly talkative and happy. A few minutes later I take another 300 mg of gabapentin to boost the effects.",
  "7:40 am: As I leave my art class I begin talking to my art teacher about a concert I went to and I was very talkative (I'm usually pretty shy to teachers). As I make my way to my sociology class I feel floaty, almost as if I could just glide to my class. In my soc. class I had a general sense of well being and I began to have conversations with people I usually don't talk to.",
  "8:25 am: Before going to my next class I got a hug from my friend, and after she hugged me I felt that was the best, most caring hug ever. I am then in my computer programming class and I can't help but spin around in my chair due to my wobbly, euphoric feeling. The effects of the third pill begin to kick in more. I feel pretty confused and unfocused (almost like an average weed high, but more sociable).",
  "10:30 am: After enjoying a couple periods of this lovely feeling I pop another 300 mg gabapentin and halfway through my next class it hits me. All the colors seemed very vivid and I enjoy talking to everyone very much. I ended up talking and laughing nonstop for the whole class which is very uncharacteristic of me.",
  "11:20 am: I'm going to lunch and I realize I'm pretty messed up. I notice everything around me including inanimate object have a happy feeling almost like an old cartoon or a Mario game. Every girl I see seems more attractive than usual and I can't help but smile at them similar to what I've been told ecstasy feels like.",
  "12:00 pm: At lunch I make funny conversations with them and we all seem to be laughing a lot. I was laughing the most. My food tastes amazing and I can't help but dance slightly and spin around as I throw my garbage away in this happy, colorful world.",
  "12:40 pm: As I leave the cafeteria my friend told me he had some oxycodone and he handed me a pill and I popped it in my mouth right then. Part way through my English class I was playing an N64 emulator and it felt like the funnest game ever as the oxycodone began to kick in. We were working on a project in which we were creating a utopia, and I was suggesting completely ridiculous, nonsensical ideas to my partner. I took the hall pass to go take a pee, and as I walked to the bathroom it felt like an incredibly long journey and the hallway seemed to keep getting longer. When I peed it felt like it took 5 minutes and when I walked back to my class everything seemed to keep shifting before my eyes.",
  "1:20 pm: I am in my art history class and I can't focus on my work at all and I nearly fall asleep.",
  "3:40 pm: I an eventually home and the world around me still feels happy. I have a couple cigs and a sip of Jagermeister to try and lengthen the high I still have left. I played some Black Ops to enjoy my buzz. I was way better at the game than I usually am. Soon after I finally come down.",
  "Of all the the drugs I've tried, nothing else but what I did this day came anywhere close to a marijuana high. I'm not too big on popping pills, but the gabapentin and oxycodone combo is definitely something I'd like to try again."
