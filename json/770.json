  "The setting: I am alone in a redwood forest at 2 pm, temperature is 80 degrees, little wind. Vey peaceful and quiet. Put on CD of Standing Stones of Callanish, track 4.",
  "DMT input: I smoke the DMT from a glass crack pipe, with a 1 inch chamber. I hold the first hit for about 20 seconds, then do the second hit.",
  "The Experience: I lay on my back and look at the trees against the sky. They come alive, become crystal jewels, very more real looking with great depth perception. I sense the place of each branch in space. The trees sway in a slow breeze. The breeze stops, but a few branches keep gyrating. I feel the unity of the forest. Nothing is out of place, nothing needs to be done. The forest is an ocean of joy and love. I feel the life force of the trees. They are like playful children, touching the air and sun and each other's branches.",
  "They have awareness. They exist in an ancient, timeless, bliss."
