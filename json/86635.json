 "report": "<p>I made 1 gram into tea with some other herbal tea for taste and the taste was really bitter more bitter than anything I have had before in my life. I drank 12 ounces of this stuff and the first few minutes nothing weird happened then 10 minutes into drinking the tea probably about 6 ounces drank I felt lightheaded and calm very relaxed and happy and then I began smoking a small pipe full of it and it only made the feeling burst into stars into my vision. I saw blurry for a few minutes then my mind slowed way down and I felt very very very calm.</p><p>The taste seemed to get more enjoyable the more I drank then I finished my tea in my room, lay down and just sat to see what the effects were. I felt very deeply relaxed and mildly drowsy and the effect lasted for about 2 to 3 hours in full from the first 10 minutes in all to the end. Very nice smoke and really bitter taste. The smoke tasted alright though. I still use this herb and it is great!</p>",
