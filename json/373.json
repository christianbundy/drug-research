  "My friend and I went to the local supermarket and purchased 4 boxes of Sucrets cough drops.  In 2 boxes there is roughly 300 mg of DXM.  I ate 2 boxes and my friend ate the other 2. ",
  "Now to the point of the report.  Let me make it clear that I have never used an opiate. The next day I received a drug test.  The test came up as positive for opiates.  I took the test in less then 24 hours of ingesting the DXM.  I was told that the opiates that showed up were only in trace amounts, but it showed up none the less, so be careful.  The DXM may show up as an opiate for you also."
