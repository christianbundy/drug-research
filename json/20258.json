  "I have used Mucuna Pruriens extract, sold in bulk powder form as '1-carboxy,' on and off for sleep aid and bodybuilding purposes.  I typically use 0.75-3grams before bed.  I always experience deeper, more refreshing sleep and find that it actually does exhibit some of the effects of dosing exogenous HGH (human growth hormone), namely increased leanness.  REM sleep seems to increase greatly and dreams are incredibly vivid and animated.  It could be useful for someone who is interested in Lucid Dreaming, but I think it is also great for use as a true sleep aid.  It does not necessarily induce drowsiness, but does improve sleep quality."
