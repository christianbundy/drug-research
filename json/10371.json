 "report": "<p>Well what actually happened was about everything I had never expected. I had been trying benedryl on and off. I started with 6 pills and then 10 and perhaps 15. I use to do dxm and up the dose by 10 pills every week just to see the difference. I decided to do it with benedryl too. So I ended up having to go to some party that I hated and I knew benedryl was the best solution sense it hadn't done me any harm before, but after I took it and it took effect at the party, I was so out of it.</p><p>Most of the time I sat staring into the distance, trying to get away from people in case I couldn't talk correctly. I felt tired and not terribly high, but just out of it mostly, I kept forgetting things. Once, I was having a conversation with someone and then suddenly forgot what I was talking about. Eventually we left the party and went home and I decided to watch a movie, which I barely remember now, just parts.</p><p>By the time I wanted to go to sleep, I had this anxious 'heavy' feeling as most people call it and in my opinion, it's no big deal, I overall enjoyed it and I've done bigger doses.</p>"
