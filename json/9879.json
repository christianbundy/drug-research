  "<p>I'm not really quite sure why I attempted this, but it definitely was fun. I was at my friend's house with two other people and we were getting high and it was all fine and fun. And then the one guy pulled out a box of whippets and said that we should do that, too. I had never done nitrous before and I really didn't want to do it for the first time with cannabis, but I did it anyway. I inhaled four canisters of nitrous. The first one made my entire body feel as if it was flying and I felt so happy and giggly. The second one did basically the same thing as the first one, but it was a bit stronger. The third one was definitely the most intense. I felt like I was traveling through this narrow tunnel with neon lights all around it at like... 700 miles and hour. I couldn't stop screaming and laughing, and my entire body was tingling. The fourth one, was about 25 minutes later, and it did basically what the first and second ones did.",
  "I do have to say that my experience with weed and nitrous was awesome, but I have never done nitrous by itself before, but i'm a big fan of the combination. It was awesome!</p>"
