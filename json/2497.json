 "report": "<p>\nI had read in one of the Amanita Muscaria texts that you could smoke the mushroom to achieve a marijuana type high (how many times have I read that phrase about some plant and been dissapointed?) Well, I had just received 30 gr. of powdered Amanita (which I plan to chuck into my next San Pedro + O.J. smoothie!), so I decided to give it whirl. By golly it seems to work! I just smoked a very small bowl full and with the first toke I noticed effects. The buzz seems to be centralized in my head and face. Music sounds good too. I'm a bit relaxed too. I'll be puffin the shrooms for the rest of the night to see how the buzz progresses.</p><p>After an hour the buzz wears off, but I'll surely be using Amanita when the ganj is el scarce-o!</p>",
