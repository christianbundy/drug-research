  "This was my first attempt at shrooms. I smoked approximately .25g of marijuana to help curb the nausea and anxiety I was anticipating from the shrooms. Then, over a course of about 20 minutes (between 11:00pm-11:30pm) I ate the entire eigth. I was surprised at how they smelled like a cow's ass, yet reminded me of eating a shitty raisin. The stems were chewy, but the caps were crunchy, in fact, when I bit down on the caps they basically exploded into a cloud of dust. I think the cottonmouth [from the marijuana] helped in blocking the true taste.",
  "I sat on my bed and watched TV for about an hour, waiting for the shrooms to really kick in...no such luck. I had an EXTREMELY mild trip for eating an entire eigth. The only difference I noticed from the usual marijuana high was:",
  "1. When I stared at something, my peripheral vision would distort slightly.",
  "2. The lights on my ceiling fan seemed to pulse when I glanced at them, but no halos.",
  "3. I also noticed an elevation in mood.",
  "Over the course of the night I smoked two or three more times as well. I stayed up until 5:30am waiting. I was so damn sure that if I had fallen asleep the shrooms would kick in and I would waste my trip, but as you can see, that was irrelevent.",
  "Best believe I called my friend [who got me the shrooms] and informed him of my experience, or lack thereof. He informed me that the other people who bought some of the batch, and had taken a lower dose than I, had good trips. He said it was more of a body trip (i.e. few if any visuals), however I did not. He and his girlfriend said they didn't really trip too hard their first time but...I mean...I ATE AN EIGTH!",
  "I suppose I can only chock this up to 'shit happens' and or possibly my meds.</p>"
