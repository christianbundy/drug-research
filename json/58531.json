 "report": "<p>Age:19</p><p>Sex:Male</p><p>Weight:150</p><p>Alright so I have social anxiety, which is a lot different from just being shy. I am a major 'stoner' and have been one since junior year in high school. I went to the doctor and was prescribed the lowest dose of paxil. I read a lot of stories about it and was afraid to take it. Well to say the least I'm glad I did. Its been quite a few week since I started taking it but I will explain my first experience. I think it was like a day or two after I first started taking it. I smoke a couple bowls and I couldn't stop laughing watching the Max-X-List on spike TV. I was so high and just couldn't stop laughing, it was crazy. I had barely smoked any so I couldn't believe how high I was. My anxiety was way down and I found it very easy to talk to people, I actually became very talkative.</p><p>Moral of the story is that paxil greatly increases my pot high, oh ya and I still felt high like 2 hours after smoking-its crazy. There a lot of stories about horrible side effects but I think its because they were all taking way higher dosage. In fact I have sold a couple to friends who have taken one early in the day and smoked at night and have felt the intensified effects.</p>",
