 "report": [
  "I made my own KAVA extract the fallowing way.",
  "1/2 cup Kava was placed in the blender and was choped on hi speed for about 5 mins.",
  "Powder was plased into a canning jar with enough acetone to cover all the powder and a spoon was used to mix the stuff around for about 5 mins.",
  "The liquid was then strained through a coffie filter and the root matter was placed back in the jar and the process was repeted.",
  "The acetone was evaporated off and I was left with a resin that when I scraped into a ball looked and felt like carmel 'the square candy kind' '-=CAUTION=- MAKE SURE ALL THE ACETONE IS EVAPORATED'",
  "I then took a small chunck and smoked it in my favorite pipe. It tasted very much like I would think burnt rubber would taste and the smoke was a little harsh but surprising easy to hold in.",
  "I felt the effects pretty quick first my mouth to my lungs got a numb feeling but not realy numb. Then my brain felt it 'its hard to describe its is a buzz I have never felt' I can think fine and altho I can seem to move fine as well I think I would feel fine just sitting and not moving at all 'I am still feeling the effects and I smoked it about 45 mins ago '.",
  "I have no clue how long this feeling will last but I can say one thing for sure this is NOT A PLACEBO effect. It is very strong feeling and my mouth is still numb. if this dose is an indication it seems to have made 1/2 cup of root powder 'enough for 2 people in most cases' into enough for me and about 20 friends to enjoy. Now thats what I call getting my moneys worth."
