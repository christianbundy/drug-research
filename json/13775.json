  "So I smoke pot all the time every time. And I get that light headed feeling while trying to hold in a big hit every once and again, but this time was different.",
  "I Tried to channel the feeling and see where it would take me and the next thing I knew the song on the radio 'Another one bites the dust' started morphing and it was whole different sounds. After I noticed the sounds I noticed I couldn't see. This has happened before but not this bad. I could 'see' in my head everything but my vision was totally white. Then it felt like my head was moving as if I were looking around and my body started shaking.",
  "I felt like I was in this place, I have been there before, but it's not here. And then it felt like a bad acid trip I started feeling all panicky and trapped then I gasped for air and everything was normal. I looked down and I had dropped the bong while I was 'gone'."
