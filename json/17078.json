  "Ive recently had a diagnostic assessment done by a psychologist because I think I may have Depression. Ive been diagnosed with Major Clinical Depression and Social Phobia. Besides smoking Marijuana the only other drug I use regularly is Tramadol and I am very psychologically dependant on it. I told my Psychologist that I have tried many prescription painkillers recreationally and that I always want tramadol over other pain killers. I cant figure out why I get more pleasure from a weak opioid like Tramadol than I do with a stronger opioid like Oxycodone or an opiate like Morphine.",
  "The psychologist told me that it is common for people suffering from Depression to abuse Tramadol. She told me that not only does it work like other opioids by binding to opioid receptors but it also has an antidepressant effect by slowing the reuptake of Norepinephrine and Serotonin. For me, suffering from depression, both of these actions on the brain result in a highly euphoric experience and loss of anxiety.",
  "I have friends who I have given Tramadol to try and most say they get little to no effects at all even from a large dose. I can take 3 or 4 50mg pills and I go into an all out euphoric state, and all my anxiety subsides. I may be prescribed Wellbutrin for my depression and I will not be able to take Tramadol anymore because it interacts with antidepressants."
