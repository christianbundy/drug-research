 "substance": "Tramadol & Caffeine",

 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: 1.2 grams of caffeine is considered a high dose, see Caffeine Dose Chart]</p><p>This drug isn't commonly used were I live, but I managed to get a hold of some. My tolerance is up just a bit, before this I had a unknown amount...about 650mg. So my tolerance is up just a bit. But to go on, heres my experience.</p><p>12:00am- Took the 13 (I'm pretty sure) 50mg pills. About 20 minutes before hand I popped 6 200mg Nodoz (caffiene pills) to see if they would counteract the nausea given by Tramadol.</p><p>12:35am- Feeling happier. My eyes are slightly heavy. But I'm feeling jittery and awake as well (effects brought on by caffeine). I've had the feeling before, while one Adderall and weed at the same time.</p><p>12:38am- Feeling the need to post times. It's a weird feeling. Kind of obsessive compulsive or whatever that disorder is. I just have a feeling that I have to keep typing.</p><p>12:42am- Stupid feeling setting in. Also a warm rush type feeling. Dizzy as well...it feels like my head weighs a ton. But I'm not sleepy at all, hopefully I won't get that way.</p><p>12:50am- Slight trouble breathing. I felt similar effects on my last experience with this. Pain is numbed slightly.</p><p>12:52am- Time passes slowly, too slowly. Which, I believe, is why I post so many times. Because everything is stretched out. Dizziness is still present as well as a tired feeling. I feel almost like I'm tripping, except that I still have the capacity to think logically and still care about my body.</p><p>12:57am- To do things correctly I must focus on that one thing and only that one thing. It's as if I've lost the ability to do multiple things at once. Time is still passing slowly and the dizziness feeling is increasing bit by bit.</p><p>1:05am- Put in some music and it's surprisingly interesting...more then normal at least. Going to go play a game now. Or just something to occupy me so I don't post so many times.</p><p>1:30am- Feeling very dizzy. I tried to stand up and I almost toppled over. Surprisingly I have no symptoms of oding. I'm pondering my last experience a day earlier prepared me a bit for this.</p><p>1:40am- Feeling unmotivated to continue with this. I'll end it right now.</p>",
