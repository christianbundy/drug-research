 "report": [
  "As an underground pharmacist who rarely faces life unaided by some sort of chemical or another I was eager to try Rohypnol after years of hearing about it.",
  "The first thing I noticed was funny. Since this is the 'date rape' drug when I broke the army-green caplet in half I saw that they have dyed the inside dark blue with some sort of vegetable dye.  I didn't notice this the first time and chewed one up only to walk downstairs to spend time with my wife, kids, my parents and their guests.  'Have you been chewing on a pen?'  Of course, my mouth was dyed blue.",
  "I've taken them off and on and honestly must say that I find them disappointed.  I have felt very little with them and believe that 10mg of diazepam or .5mg of Xanax beats them by a mile.  I did, however, avert a minor panic attack once by quickly chewing and dissolving one of these blue devils under my tongue.  Effective and pleasant that time.",
  "In the end they feel like a waste to me.  I'd rather buy Valiums and Xanax."
