 "report": [
  "T+0:00 Baseline, I first buy the quarter roll it up into three separate blunts to be ingested by me and three buddies. We each ingest 5mg of percocet generic brand, (endo 602) scored. We decide to drink to speed up effects.",
  "T+0:30 Each ingested two beers, slight effects started to be noted, world is slightly wobbly and primary colors distorted. First blunt smoked affects instantaneous.",
  "T+1:00 Feeling quite good, most oxy's make beer taste like water, this is none different, we take out beer bong, each bong 4 beers.",
  "T+1:30 Other two blunts are smoked, and another 5mg of percocet ingested. Real effects are starting to come, body no longer feels there, swaying is inevitable.",
  "T+2:00 World is out of perception, unable to keep eyes open, feeling of sea sickness and waves crashing upon body.",
  "T+3:00 Vomiting is induced, and night is finished, very bad idea for me to combine such drugs, should've stayed with just two. Amazing experience."
