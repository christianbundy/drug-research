 "report": [
  "I ordered some calamus root from an online herbal shop. Worst idea ever. I remember reading that if you chew 2in of the root, you will experience stimulation. I tried it, and felt a little more upbeat. Then a few weeks later, (yesterday) I wanted to 'trip-out' from it. I have done weed, alc, dxm, methadone, demerol, soma, salvia, and nitrous.",
  "4:00pm I chewed and swallowed about 7 inches of the dried root, which tasted spicy and bitter. I also took some tums with it to ease any heartburn that might follow. I went to the mall and two hours later I still wasn't feeling anything.",
  "6:00pm I said screw this and got some panda express. 10 min later it started my whole stomach turned upside-down. I ran to the bathroom where i puked up a crap load of food, and calamus root. Soon after every 10-15 min i puked again. I puked in the parking lot, then got a ride home. As soon as I got home, I ran to the bathroom, where i stayed for a while.",
  "7:00pm NOthing more is coming out, just lots of dry heaves every 15 min.",
  "8:00pm  I leave my bathroom finally and go lie down.",
  "9:00pm  Thinking I am going to die, now a very bitter foam like substance is coming out..",
  "10:00pm  I have a suppository from when I had the flu really bad, the puking stops finally.",
  "11:30pm I fall asleep still feeling like shit.",
  "4:00am  I wake up and feel completely normal again.",
  "I reallly dont recomend this shit to anyone, its not worth it. I didnt even get high, and i missed out on a crazy party because of this shit. I say we all stick to weed and alc."
