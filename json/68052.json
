 "report": "<p>My experience log, with Madagascar Periwinkle (leaves, avg. 2in in length or smaller, fresh-dried, with Cannabis, amount will update as I go along).</p><p>Copyright Allen S.</p><p>12:34AM- Migraine, so I decided to smoke some pot to ease it. Recently read through online books and read on two instances where M.Periwinkle (Catheranthus Roseus spp.) was used as an extreme hallucinations, and thought I would try them out in a combination to observe the effects =^.^=</p><p>12:35AM- One periwinkle leaf ground mixed with a 1cmx1cm bud of pot in a glass bowl.</p><p>12:38AM- Wondering what the effects will be like, I hesitantly take the first hit. Smoke is kinda harsh, flavored oddly, but not unpleasently, mixes well with pot. Still harsh initially. Held for about 15 seconds. Immediately feel headrush, probably from migraine or holding my breath so long =\\.</p><p>12:39 AM- Putting on some music for now, no effects yet besides odd pleasing tingling in my head.</p><p>12:40AM- Take another hit. Whatever chemical is in C. Roseus seems to be an expectorant, besides the inole alkaloid (The hallicinogens). No effects yet, not even from pot.</p><p>12:42 AM- Sounds from music sound more impressive, defined and pleasent. Chest feeling pulsating, and there's a very light haze everywhere I look that is very pleasent.</p><p>12:44 AM- Sound is very pleasent, slight euphoria, took third hit. Motion is pleasing, an causes not-unpleasent feelings indeed =D</p><p>12:46AM- Soda[DR PEPPER DIET CAFFEINE FREE] is ingested orally. Delicious. Simply delicious.</p><p>12:47- Rap doesn't go good on this. Everything BUT.O_O</p><p>12:50- Wow, its really been ten minutes? HOLY SHIT. Temperal sense is greatly distorted, other senses greatly intensefied to a fabulous level. Pulsanting sensation all across body. Visual trails of light and from objects moving in front of Ion emitting devices (ergo. TVs and flourecent things and glowsticks) its awesome. Moving and typing and mental coordination is greatly increased. I haven't made a typo yet high, and normally when I tpye all that would show is OIAFHOPWFHPInso[tj230- if I was high and I'd be trying to say like quack or some shit.</p><p>12:53 AM- Just finished typing previos sentence ^_^ Music is amazing. Any sensation or movement triggers ecsstacy like bliss, but not feeling any of the stupor  of pot or downers or heavy drugs, This is amazing and nice. Decreased pain threshold  ^_^ Niiiiiice. Music is feeling.</p><p>12:54, yeah I type pretty fast right now. Speed is increased to the point that time feels distorted, very good vocational skills. =D</p><p>12:55AM- Took four more hits, 8 hits total.</p><p>12:56- Packing a second leaf and a bit of sprinkled but to reload the bowl! ^_^ Increased muscle refelx. Barely any pot buz so far so I think this is all from the Periwkinle thus far or increased effectiveness because of it.</p><p>12:57- Music causes some very intense and vivid mental images right now, but I feel as if I'm actually there. but I'm still aware of my surroundings. This is pretty cooool. TAKIN NOTHER HIT HAO KTHX@!@</p><p>12:58AM- Took another fresh hit, was very tasty but harsh very harsh.Felt another great rush, confirmed that it's the Periwinkle. Images getting stronger, feel pleasntly warm waves down back.</p><p>12:59- I felt as if it were 1999. Honestly felt like it was even though it wasn't. Like I believed it.</p><p>12:60AM LULZ 1:00AM- Music is very nice =D MSN MESSAGE BRB KTHX</p><p>1:07AM- Very very vivid aural hallucinations that I know are deff not part of the song, like mental images of bleeding corpses to britney spears' toxic O.O And the screaming and rifles anre prevalent.</p><p>107.5AM-CLAMS.</p><p>1:09-I feel giddy, extreemly euphotric, excstacy like sensory, mild visuals and aural hallucinations (sounds) Muscle twtitches in legs but mmmmthey feel good. It feels nice to move and do things....and music is fantastic,all kinds, cept rap, it makes me violent on this apparently.>.>;</p><p>1:10AM- I'm bisexual.
