  "<p>Mixture of 100 ml pure 1,4 Butanediol or Butylene Glycol with 25 ml of water is then used to provide a dose of 1.2 ml per 140 lb or 1.6 ml for my 180 lb.",
  "The dosage is taken at cocktail hour on an empty stomach for general relaxation and stimulation of growth hormone.  Also take a dose before sex and somtimes about 3/4 dose before exercise. Usually take one dose for ease in sleeping.",
  "When taken about 15 minutes before sex play then wonderful loving encounters typically 1 or 2 hours follow.  Easy to control ejaculation and run multiple orgasms without ejaculating and partner enjoys the relaxed and passionate love making.  Sex play typically 4 to 5 times per week.",
  "Before exercise gives increased endurance.",
  "In general best results when no more than 3 dosages in any one day.  I use exercise to keep body fit instead of taking more BD to relax for best results.",
  "I do not take more then amount unless I want to go to sleep and then I make sure not to take more than a few drops more.  For example not more than 0.25 ml per 140 lb.",
  "I have used BD for one year and skin much younger looking and general strength and endurance is much better.  About a 50% increase in endurance, as measured by running or weight lifting etc.</p>"
