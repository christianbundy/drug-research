  "I'm writing about the pill called 'Cherries', they are found on the 'Herbal High' website. I took one at about noon one day. I thought nothing of it, I thought they were HERBAL, so it wouldn't fuck me up too bad. Boy was I wrong. I fried for about 6 hrs. It want like a shroom or a cid high. It was more like cheap coke mixed with cheap meth mixed with horrible white blotter acid. I did not hallucinate, nor did I body fry. I just plain old felt like hell. I still have one left. I'm gonna give it to my buddy, so he has to go through the hell I went through."
