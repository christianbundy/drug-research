 "report": [
  "A small amount of kanna powder was placed on my finger tip and insufflated. There were no effects at first but after about 10 minutes the effects started to become noticable. I was having great feelings of empathy. It produces a very gentle stimulation. It flows much easier than amphetamines do. I felt a very strong mental clarity that beckoned me to introduce more into my blood stream. About the same amount was ingested the same way and the effects became more pronounced. This wonderful stimulation lasted around 2 hours and was followed by a nice sedated feeling. This plant could possibly be potential for anyone trying to overcome addiction to cocaine or amphetamine. I consider the effects to be very similiar."
