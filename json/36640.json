 "report": "<p>This one will be short.  I recently went to my doctor for severe back pain, he gave me 20 pills of Skelaxin, said they were like somas, so I gave them a shot...</p><p>1) I took them for pain, one right after the other in thirty minute increments five pills total..they were 800's.  There was no relief until right after that fifth pill went down and I thought, 'Oh you're in for it now.'</p><p>2)I was trying my hardest to relax, I can't stand muscle relaxers if I'm not relaxed cause they make me all weird.  So I sat down and watched, 'O' Brother Where Art Thou,' one of my favorite movies.</p><p>After that fifth pill went down I began to slip into a euphoric dreamy state, not what I had wanted.  I wanted pain relief and it came on STRONG.  I was nothing, like a nod from an opiate I tuned out and enjoyed myself, it was bliss.</p><p>I don't have much else to say about it, I loved it won't repeat it again, but I enjoyed it.  Maybe I should have waited on that fifth pill though.</p>",
