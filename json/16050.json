 "report": "<p>Okay, so I've got this Mipt in my freezer, right? And I haven't eaten for the last 12 hours or so.</p><p>11:40am. I weigh out 38 mg, (I've experiemented with this substance before at much lower dosages.) mix it with a little poweraid and down the hatch!!</p><p>12:10 Am definately feeling something. Light seems a little brighter, everything seems a little 'Swimmy'. No problem with handwriting. I jump into the shower.</p><p>12:30 Am out of the shower. I'm at a Plus One. My tummy doesn't feel too bad, and I'm starving, so I eat lunch.</p><p>Finsh lunch at about 12:45 pm. Read my fortune cookie. 'You are a practical person with your feet on the ground.'</p><p>Damn!! That's not what I wanted to hear!</p><p>At 1:30 pm, I am pretty much out of it. Never got more than about a plus one. I have to say that it WAS a plus one tho'. I'm pretty familiar with placebo, and I think I can say there certainly was some activity. </p><p>Mipt seems to be a pretty fast acting and short lived experience. No visuals. There did seems to be a little mood elevation and a touch of paranoia. It's a hard space to figure out. It does seem to be a little thoughtful.</p>",
