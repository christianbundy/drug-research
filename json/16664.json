  "<p>I've recently done some first hand research in this area.  Delirium may just be a result of taking too much.",
  "Effective dosage differs from person to person. ODing on 5-htp can lead to serotonin overload which may result in paranoia, panic, anxiety and mania according to various sources.",
  "It also potentiates alcohol, resulting in a mean drunk and a super depressinghangover(this was my first hand experiment that prompted the research).",
  "I tried taking 100mg on an empty stomach last night for shits and giggles. I was pretty out of it for 3-4 hours and had an unusual loss of apetite.  Sort of felt somewhere between a kind bud buzz and a low level robo buzz.",
  "5-htp is also a precursor for melatonin.</p>"
