 "report": "<p>After being months without tryptamines (besides the tryptamines that I get from food and the ones that my body produces) I was once again ready to see the world thru tryptamine looking glass. This time, I was going to have some AMT.</p><p>I bought some AMT, paying 30 marks ($5) per 30 mg. In the most of the reports that I have written here, I had been to a party (rave/techno/psy) of some sort. But the fact is, that most of my psychedelic experiences have been experienced alone and always at home. Even my first experience with psychoactive substances, which was with LSD when I was 15 and still living with one of my relatives.</p><p>Anyways, I had prepared for the experiment of mine with chocolate and vitamins. I took the vitamins before taking AMT. I decided to smoke 10 mg and to take the rest (20 mg) orally. The smoke from AMT smelt like polluted algae, not very nice that is. After smoking the 10 mg, I swallowed rest of the AMT (it did also taste quite bad).</p><p>I didn't feel nothing for five hours. I was really suprised, because I was prepared for a rapid lift-off. The visuals were very mild, but the stimulating effect of the substance was one like I had felt before with other psychoactive tryptamines. To be precise, it felt like cold water dripping from the back of my head and coming down my spine and back.</p><p>The effect lasted only for couple of hours and left me feeling a bit lightheaded. I didn't go thru a real psychedelic experience, but it was OK. Let's see how the next AMT session of mine will go, I took 30 mg of AMT about 20 minutes ago :)</p>",
