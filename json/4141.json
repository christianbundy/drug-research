  "It was June 2002, the day before my Mom's birthday. Basically, I drank 8 oz. of Robitussin Max Strength, and took 16 Contacs at 15mg DXM each. It basically didn't kick in until just before my Mom came home, and she freaked and called my Aunt, then we went to hospital. I drank charcoal and got a catheter. They tested my urine for drugs, and found THC (that's not false...) and Opiates. When he said Opiates, I was stunned. I hadn't had anything like that in well over a month, and even then it was only like 1 or 2 Vicodin."
