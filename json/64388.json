 "report": "<p>I snorted 30 mg over a period of 3 hours. Moments after snorting it I started to feel it. It reminded me of Oxycontin feeling wise, very relaxed, very nice, not too overpowering but there. It seemed to have something to it that made me really open up with my girlfriend. I guess you could say it had an empathetic affect on me, I was talking all night.</p><p>After about 6 hours I still felt messed up. Then I started to get hot, cold chills, and I headed outside. Two steps out the door and a river of puke shot from my mouth. I puked for a little while then went back inside to lay down. I lied down for a while fell asleep and was woken up by a HORRIBLE headache followed by Puke, well I should say stomach acid as I had nothing left to throw up.</p><p>If I use it again its definitely going to be in a lower dose.</p>",
