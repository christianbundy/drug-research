  "Me being an avid user of marijuana I have struggled with failing grades in school. This was mostly caused by tests, I could not remember anything that I needed to. I had no trouble with anything else although I had a bit of trouble remembering names. Ginko Biloba was my solution. It has affected me is subtle way yet has changed my life completely.",
  "I have been taking Ginko Biloba for about 2 months now. I have notice a LARGE increase of general energy, and my memory has increased 10x. I have gotten 90+ percent on all the tests I have taken after 2 weeks of taking ginko biloba 3 pills daily. I could not believe the change."
