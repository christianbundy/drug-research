 "report": "<p>I had very successful results in treating depression using Deprenyl (Selegiline, Jumex) three mornings a week, at a 5 mg dose.  Added to this 200 mg of DLPA once a day, around lunch.</p><p>Basically, spent quite awhile in a clinically depressed state, that treatment with SSRI's didn't help at all.  This MAO-B inhibitor/amino acid combination was available over the counter (outside USA), so figured I'd give it a try.</p><p>Had excellent results, and enabled massive change in my life.</p><p>The smallest change was that while on the substance, I got to a point where it was trivial to quit smoking.  The most major change is that I now work a 50 hour/week job without fatigue, depression, or side effects.  Took the Deprenyl/DLPA combo for three months, and stopped treatment two months ago with little difficulty.</p>",
