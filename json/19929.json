 "report": [
  "Traveled up to the city for a show, while staying at a friend's frat house, I found a bottle with 4 pills, labeled oxycodone, 5mg. I had heard how wonderful the high from this pill was, and decided I had to try it. I took one, then had a sinking feeling, and wondered if it was a good idea. I forgot about it a few minutes later, went outside and had a smoke, and came back in. About half an hour later, I started feeling queasy, and soon, I was weak and my heart was racing.",
  "Within another half hour, I was puking my brains out, I couldn't eat, and every smell made me sick. I was cold, but my entire body was overheating and cold water was the only thing that felt good, though it made me uncomfortable to drink it. I urinated frequently and felt constipated. My friend offered me a variety of food, all of which made me even sicker to think about eating. Eventually I tried eating a cheese sandwhich, which stayed down. Finally, 7 or 8 hours later, I began to feel better, and by the next morning, I was fine, just a little tired.",
  "Between vomiting, I had called a friend, and he explained to me what happened. I had been 'speedballing', because I had taken 10 mg of adderall that morning. I was worried I could die, I felt so horrible, but he reassured me that it would pass in about 6-8 hours as the drugs worked through my system. I have since never touched oxycodone, and I'll never take adderall with any depressant."
