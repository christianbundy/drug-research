  "Once I found some Promethazine at a friends house. I took like 100mg and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like a zombie, no thoughts in my head, no nothing up there. I remember driving into like freakin Tucson for some coupon for beer-battered cod. Just stared out the window for 2 hours thinking NOTHING. It was horrible."
