  "<p>I did some research on L-theanine and discovered that it's a gaba antagonist so the opposite of alcohol and it also affects dopamine and ndma receptors so I thought that I would try a ridiculous amount of tea to see the effects.",
  "I drank 30g in loose leaf green tea so the equipment of 15 to 20 cups. The amount of L-theanine in there I found to be around 750mg and the caffeine about 450 milligrams.",
  "The effects took about an hour to start but they were very intense I had mind racing and jitters that were way more than when I drink the same amount of caffeine with coffee so it must have been the l theanine.",
  "After about 5 hours of this it started to slow down and it died out around 3 am when I went to bed.</p>"
