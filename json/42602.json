 "report": "<p>The night began with me and 3 other friends each taking about 3grams of psilocybin containing mushrooms, followed by a single 15mg dose of Adderall about 15 minutes after mushroom injestion. </p><p>We came up after about 30 minutes, and it took about another 45 to peak, but during those 45 minutes I was the most confused as I have ever been in my life, the walls started to swim, and I had the most visual mushroom trip of my life, but once we peaked I soon realized what was going on...  The Adderall threw me right through the doors of perception, and for the next 3 hours my friends and I were completely and utterly feeling what I would label as absolute bliss, for the first time while on mushrooms I didn't cry, and for the first time on mushrooms nothing could bring me down.  I was not only on cloud 9... I was cloud 9.  I sang and danced, and laughed...  I felt like a child of illusion, all that mattered was the right here right now of my experience...</p>",
