 "report": [
  "Recently I've been trying out rare, herbal and legal highs as an alternative to cannabis. As a chronic user of cannabis I've been looking for new experiences to relieve the boredom.",
  "I've recently had the chance to try Blue Lotus. I got hold of 30g of dried flowers. I had read only very sketchy reports of this, one of an MDMA like high and another of an opiate high. So I had no preconceptions about what I would feel.",
  "This was taken after weeks of domestic stress brought on by painting and decorating of the family home. The weekend I tried the lotus was the first chance I had had to really relax for many weeks.",
  "After smoking a small amount of cannabis and grass we tried the following:",
  "I had read that 3-5g dried flowers was a single dose, so I eyeballed a total of 10g into a cafetierre and poured on boiling water and allowed it to steep for 10 minutes before pouring. My partner and I shared the brew which was very bitter - but not impossible to drink with added sugar.",
  "After 30 minutes, I felt a very slight stone. It didn't seem to increase at all as we waited so we tried smoking a joint made up with some of the Lotus. Strange taste, but not nasty. It didn't seem to have any effect. After about 45 mins, we both agreed that it would have been less trouble to take a couple of OTC codeine for the effect we were getting.",
  "I decided to more than double the dose by making a tea out of almost all the remaining Lotus. This took the dose up to about 12-14g per person. We drank this at about t+1hr. And smoked another joint made from Lotus.",
  "We went out to eat in a restaurant feeling giggly but placid and serene, like we'd had a large dose of codeine and some joints. The most interesting thing happened once we started drinking wine. The effect seemed to be strongly synergistic with alcohol and I can only describe the experience as 'dreamy.' Food tasted good and we felt that the setting was tranquil and romantic and entirely non-threatening, even though we were obviously very stoned in a public place.",
  "After that, memory is hazy. Once back home, we cuddled and kissed a lot, in a romantic, non-sexual way and I guess we went to bed at some point and slept solidly for 12hrs or more. The whole of the next day (Sunday) we were *totally blissed out*. It was a fantastic feeling of serenity and tranquility. Again, memory is hazy but one thing that struck me was that I smoked only one cannabis joint. Average for a Sunday is at least three. I just didn't need it. We both felt really chilled out and dreamy.",
  "We sat and listened to music as we often do. There was nothing particularly noticeable about the effect on sound/music and vision. Nor any tactile sensory effects but cuddling and contact was beautiful and that's how we spent most of the day. We drank another bottle of wine that evening and the effect increased very noticeably again and returned the very giggly feelings.",
  "Fortunately both of us had holiday on Monday as we got up late again and there were still remnants of an opiate like effect, down to the level of OTC codeine now.",
  "I would summarise this as an extremely pleasant and favourable experience. The tea is bitter, but bearable and far from nausea inducing. The high was like a medium-strong opiate drug, with some of the effects of cannabis. There was a cuddly, warm and romantic feeling that you could associate with either opiates or MDMA. It was good to do this with my partner but it might have been OK with friends too. There was a very strong synergy with a moderate amount of alcohol.",
  "I will definitely try this again, but I will steep the Lotus in a bottle of wine over night (as is reported to be an alternative). I am sure that this would result in a much lower dose needed to get the effects. It may also change the curve of the experience.",
  " It was a good alternative to cannabis, but I see no reason not to combine them for a deeper stone.",
  "Drawbacks are - it took a long time to come on about 2-3 hrs and some wine before we really knew we were onto something exciting.",
  "It has a long lasting effect which could be a drawback if you haven't planned for it.",
  "The biggest drawback is just how little memory of the experience I accumulated. I know I had a beautiful time, but I don't remember very much of it. My memory of it has not returned over time. Just a dreamy haze. Great for escapism but no good for those seeking meaningful experiences - though by all accounts, we had a very big dose."
