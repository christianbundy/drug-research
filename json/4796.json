  "I suffer chronic neck pain and have had two surgeries with only minimal success.  I've been looking for alternatives to prescription drugs and think I may have hit on something.  I've just finished two cups of tea made with a total of 3 tablespoons of dried plant.  I feel very relaxed and the pain is very managable. ",
  "I am thinking of combining this tea with a cold infusion of kava.  Next time."
