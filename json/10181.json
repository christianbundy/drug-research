  "<p>I bought a bottle from a company in New Jersey.  The first thing I did upon receiving the bottle in the mail was to open a capsule and snort it.  There are a lot of fillers in the mix, so it was a lot to put up there.  There was no rush, no local numbness, nothing. ",
  "The next day, I took three (they contain 100mg each) and, after two hours or so, felt a nice very mellow stimulant feeling.  The mood lift and expansiveness of cocaine or methamphetamine, but without the push.  It lasted a few hours and faded away.  This effect is consistent but inconvenient, given the very long delay in onset.",
  "Later, I tried plugging it (ie in solution into the rectum) since that's as effective as snorting but can handle a lot more volume.  I loaded 300mg into the (needleless!) syringe in 5ccs of water.  But alas, nothing, not even the aforementioned warmth.",
  "I threw out the rest of the bottle.</p>"
