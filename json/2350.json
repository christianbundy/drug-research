  "I was feeling rather depressed one day and I decided I wanted to be happy. So I called my friend and told him my problem, I called because he has many different medications he is on and I wanted some anti-depressant. So the next day he brought me 5 Prozac pills.",
  "About 30 minutes later I began to feel a little light headed then it came on, an intense feeling of warmth and it just felt good but after about 20 minutes of that I got major cotton mouth and couldn't stop talking. Suddenly I felt depressed and paranoid I worried about getting caught and if anyone still liked me. I started felling cold and sticky, after riding the bus home I went to my room to try to sleep, I didn't fall asleep instead I just kept relapsing and thinking crazily, I couldn't think about one thing for more than a minute. Then my mom came home and I don't usually talk to her for more than 5 to 10 minutes but with the Prozac I just kept blabbing on about whatever.",
  "I think she eventually caught on because she kept looking into my eyes and asking me what seemed to be difficult questions. Hours later after talking to my mom, my sister, and even my dad it was time for dinner. We had the best looking steak and potatoes but I took a few bites and just couldn't finish, the food was just disgusting to me. After getting even more paranoid about getting caught I went to bed I slipped into the weird thinking pattern again for about 15 min then I had to go to the bathroom because of drinking mass water do to cotton mouth, I repeated this for about 3 hours until I forced myself to stop drinking water.",
  "Now I laid back down and slowly fell into a movie like thought pattern, this was probably the only good thing about the Prozac, I could imagine my own movies, this lasted for about an hour. I had to go to the bathroom again so I got up and went, then I checked the clock it was about 3:35. I went back to bed and laid there for another couple hours in the messed up thought pattern until I fell asleep finally. My mom woke me up at 6:45 for school and that day was one of the worst days of school other than the day I took Prozac."
