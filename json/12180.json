  "I have a problem with pain in the bladder or urethra and am seeing a Urologist, who recently gave me a course of URELLE, which contains a substance like asprin, an antiseptic, and Hyoscyomine Sulphate dilate passages. I worked out that Datura in low dosage should have a simular effect, as it contains Hyoscyomine, and Scopolamine for pain killing. I took one seed and found it worked but even that was too strong and I plan to take equiv or half a seed next time. Much cheaper than Urelle or Flomax!"
