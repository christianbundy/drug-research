 "report": [
  "Around 4AM I crushed 2x10mg pill. After imagining ways to administer an anal suppository, I decided on just sticking my finger in. Had been drinking whisky and smoked a joint before I tried it. After a short burn sensation in my ass, my body is numb and everything elevated. I kept going back to the washroom to add small amounts for about 2 hrs, having a shot every now and then. Mostly enjoyed it because I was high, watched porn and fucked my ass easy. I think my girlfriend might be convinced that this is the way to try anal."
