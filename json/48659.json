 "report": "<p>September in boston many years ago, on the back porch of their apartment looking over an alley we ate dinner (they supplied the food) and finished the meal with a steaming mug of shroom tea for each (we supplied the mushrooms)</p><p>We sat around and waited, chatting nervously</p><p>We came up and i was unable to speak, unable to move, stuck in my chair, following the vision in my mind-</p><p>A male voice was narrating these visuals of a life cycle, ending not in the grave, but out out out in space (there is more to life than just this one, he said) and i struggled to stay in the moment and remember (i must remind myself of this)</p><p>I was released from my chair and we all talked and giggled and snuggled on the couch. I had never bonded so quickly or closely with another woman before because of our womanhood, our sisterhood. It was a privledge to do so, and i relish those moments</p><p>We left the apartment hours later to go walk along the charles- fortunely we knew better than to go swimming in it (although the impulse arose.) ---- wanted to go off and make out, but being sexual in any way was the last thing i wanted</p><p>Dawn rose upon our coming down</p><p>And i look back and feel so lucky that my first time taking mushrooms was in such a caring, safe setting, and that we shared such a wonderful experience</p><p>And yet i am now at the point where even looking at mushrooms make me nauseous- and i am reconnecting with mushrooms, reconnecting with the higher state they can access- but i cannot do so without looking at where i have come from and where i have been.</p>",
