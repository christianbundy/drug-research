 "report": "<p>My experience with trazodone is very positive.</p><p>It helps with my alcohol addiction in that I can consume much less alcohol per day. Before the trazodone, I would need to consume at least 3 liters of, say Chardonnay, at 13% potency, per day to fall asleep. With 150mg trazodone, I need less than 1.5 liters</p><p>to fall asleep. I know that is still a lot of wine, but it helps me not to need so much wine.</p>",
