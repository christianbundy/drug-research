  "Around two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the 'green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc... I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a 'thujone' high.",
  "(first time)",
  "I did the 'thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.",
  "- didn't really feel anything.",
  "(second time)",
  "I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.",
  "- no effect whatsoever",
  "(third time)",
  "This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.",
  "I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.",
  "T+0:00",
  "I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable",
  "T+0:05",
  "stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.",
  "T+0:07",
  "I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.",
  "T+0:15",
  "I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.",
  "T+0:25",
  "I feel normal again.",
  "My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled."
