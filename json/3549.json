  "<p>Well, I did this when I was very young. I was simply interested.",
  "This is beyond dangerous, aparently this is bordering on the fatal dose of nicotine! It was certainly very unpleasant.",
  "Anyway, three 'regal' cigarettes were put in a tea-pot with some boilling water and left to brew for about 3 minutes.",
  "The resulting tea was then drunk, it tasted very nice.",
  "Then, for about 3 hours I experinced a form of agony. I had a powerfull aversion to light, I had to cover my eyes in a darkened room, there was also a horrible full body buzzing sensation and a mild headache.",
  "Finally it all went away, and I have smoked ever since.",
  "Regal makes me feel sick however.</p>"
