 "report": "<p>\nIt was my first time and I was trying it with my parents who obviously are very understanding and know I am responsible enough to handle the drug.  We took it at about 7pm and I started to roll within 30 minutes.  The feeling took affect and we were listening to NIN, my body felt extremely relaxed and in tune with the music. </p><p>This was the night that changed my relationship with my parents forever, we bonded and let all secrets go.  I told them about my addiction to crystal meth along with all my other secrets.  They understood and comforted me which is opposite of what I expected.  They let me know that the trip we were having was all on them.  They felt that I earned it.  I had come a long way.  Ever since then they have trusted me and believed in me every step of the way.  We are even closer than before and they are my best friends.</p>",
