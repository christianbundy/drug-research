  "Plant the seeds, don't consume them. Others have reported fascinating experiences, but mine (seeds consumed as a brew) resulted in a day of sopor, dropping off to resless sleep unexpectedly, and seeing people looking as if their heads were disconnected from their necks. Very unpleasant physical effects, and not worth it.",
  "It's a beautiful vining flower, and there are other plants that will give you more pleasure when used for internal experiences. It's best to look at, not consume."
