  "After living in Taiwan for a month and trying the betel nut on several occasions without significant effect, I started reading websites to see what the big deal about betel nut is. I read that in order to be psychoactive, betel must be taken with lime.  I had bought the lime and leaf bound nut several times from street vendors in Taipei, but had always discarded it, thinking it just a preservative sheath. ",
  "In a net cafe, with a small pack in my pocket and an empty juice bottle to spit in, I started chewing a nut, leaf, lime, and all.  The effect was boisterous and immediate.  Tasting lightly of roasted peppers, it gave me a feeling similar to that of laughing gas and ephedrine.  A lovely buzz, and it comes on strong, tapering gently off over a period of some half hour.  Now that I know how to use the betel nut."
