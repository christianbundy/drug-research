 "report": [
  "<p>I got into Poppy tea a while back, and ended up getting hooked a few times. Quitting cold turkey was brutal - and even tapering off was an excruciating experience. I had read about Kratom so I tapered down to what looked like a good Kratom match and started doing it instead of the tea. I felt one or two neutral effects and never had the pain and suffering of opiate withdrawal. It was like transitioning off.",
  "Fast forward to today - after having tapered off Kratom - which really isn't that bad, I take it now and then and it gives me the same warm and fuzzy feeling that opiates did, except fully lucid. It's like all of the good effects of opiates, with none of the bad.</p>"
