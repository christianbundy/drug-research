 "report": "<p>I just started taking Vinpocetine (10MG twice daily with food) and I have noticed a substantial increase in heart rate. I am also currently on Adderall IR. My heart rate was also increased on this medication, but not as much as with vinpocetine.</p><p>The strange thing is that when I take vinpocetine after my adderall dose (as long as 4 hours after) my heart rate is high, but not as high as it is when the adderall wears off. Without Vinpocetine my heart rate is around 70-80 beats per minute. With vinpocetine for a duration of about 20 minutes my heart rate was 110 beats per minute, however it does start to return to normal 30 minutes after ingestion. So, if I am taking Vinpocetine I have to be careful and monitor my heart rate and blood pressure. I have heard it can lower blood pressure also.</p>",
