  "When I was at school, there was a craze for amyl nitrite, partly because of the Suede song. You could buy it in little bottles from headshops. The instructions said 'Leave open, then breathe. Do not inhale directly from bottle'. That was what I did the first time (I was alone), and nothing happened. My boyfriend showed me that you had to practically shove the bottle up your nose. I could actually feel it travelling in my blood before it hit the brain. Then...KABOOM! The amyl buzz is a swirling rush, and I always felt very detached from everything. Sounds in particular seemed distant. My face would go very hot and red, and my heart would pound, as would my head. The buzz is over after about 1 minute, but the red face and headache take longer to go away. I eventually stopped doing amyl for two reasons. The first is that after a while I built up a tolerance, so I'd get a 10 second buzz for a 2 minute headache. Not really worthwhile. Also, I was growing up and amyl seemed rather naff and childish, like an upgraded version of sniffing glue (which I've never done). One thing that's good about amyl, is that if you have a very small amount of MDMA, you can use the amyl to bring you up."
