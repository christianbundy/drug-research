 "report": "<p>Like so many others who stop taking an antidepressant, I am also experiencing brain zaps and nystagmus, at least every 30 seconds.  It's relentless.  When I do an internet search, I find literally thousands of people coming off various antidepressants and experiencing these symptoms.</p><p>The cymbalta worked well for depression, but I gained 20 pounds in a year and was like a sloth.  A happy sloth, yes, but still a sloth.  I then started on Wellbutrin in the beginning of December to quit smoking and not only did it work, but I also felt great, energetic and interested in the world again, but uncomfortable about being on two meds.</p><p>So I decided to quit the cymbalta.  I did this without any medical supervision, and I did it cold-turkey, which I wouldn't recommend.  My mood is fine, but the only thing is the brain zapping, that electrical buzz feeling accompanied by a big 'whoosh' sound, and I wonder how long it will last.  Also there is some tingling in my lips accompanying the zaps.  I haven't bothered to see the doctor, because what can they do?</p>",
