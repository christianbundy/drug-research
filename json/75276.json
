 "report": "<p>I found myself reading online the other night with my boyfriend, we were reading about many different drugs and how they affected people. Once he stopped browsing I decided out of curiosity that I myself would start reading the stories of personal experiences with Oxycodone, and Oxycontin 10mg.</p><p>Let me start with a little brief background history about myself. I was diagnosed at a young age with an auto immune disease. I was the type of child growing up, where if I'd ever had a headache I'd take a nap rather than take any even as lightly as advil.</p><p>I remember getting my wisdom teeth removed, and the doctor prescribing me Tylenol #3's but I'd never take them. They would just sit there in the bathroom.</p><p>I remember one day having a terrible headache, and I couldn't sleep it off so I sat on the couch to watch tv. My mom had handed me half a pill and said here take this, it's a Percocet it should help. 10 minutes later my chin dropped to my chest, I was drooling on myself and had one hell of a time getting up the stairs to bed.</p><p>I woke the next morning, and didn't feel bad from it, just remembered that it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach and said I'd never take that again.</p><p>I turned 16, and my disease started flaring up so my doctor started writing me prescriptions for Percocet.</p><p>Let me say that here in Canada Percocet is referred to as Oxycodone. At least that is what my bottles say.</p><p>Anyways, My doctor began prescribing them, but I'd just fill the prescription and let them kick around in case one day I needed them. I'd make it look like I was taking them, and just continue letting the doctor fill them for me even though in fact I wasn't taking them at all. At this time I had a huge stock at home.</p><p>My parents would have back pain, or a migraine and would ask for one here or there, which I didn't mind giving them. Then I went in for a major surgery. 4 joint replacements, and the pain let me tell you was bad. I was on IV Morphine, and then after a few days they took me off and started handing me two pills every 4 hours. They said 'TEC' on them. The nurses said it was Percocet, and if I wanted the pain gone to take them.</p><p>It was all down hill from there. I then found myself relying on them every 4 hours because they did in fact help the pain. A lot. Due to the nerves being cut around the joints I had replaced my surgeon had sent a fax to my family doctor and advised him to continue to keep filling the pills for me as I would need them. My family doctor then decided that it was best to keep me on them for my auto immune disease, as it helped me cope with the pain.</p><p>I started off taking a few a day, not more than 6. He started prescribing me about 60 tablets every few weeks, and then the prescription grew into 90 tablets, than 100 tablets. After awhile the doctor said my body was causing me far too much pain so I had to increase the dose. 2 tablets every 4-6 hours. A total of 8 - 10 tablets per day. I was being prescribed well over 200 tablets a month.</p><p>I then noticed I began liking the feeling from them. I liked the way my body felt, I really enjoyed that my pain was completely gone. I also enjoyed the high from them.</p><p>I've been on these tablets for the last 3 years or so. Still taking over 200 a month. Sometimes taking so many that I can take a monthly script and have them gone in less then 3 weeks.</p><p>The withdrawal sucks badly. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started taking these pills. If I had known where I would be now, I'd have stopped taking them as soon as my surgery had healed.</p><p>Now I have sleep problems, and my doctor started prescribing me Oxycontin 10mg tables. 12 hour time released tablets, which I take at bedtime. I could care less for these.</p><p>Also I'd to point out that my doctor did in fact try to switch me to a Fentanyl Duragisic patch but I will still in a lot of pain so I was then switched back to Oxycodone, and Oxycontin.</p><p>I've noticed a hype in the media about these pills, and people using them for recreational use. Because of that it makes it harder for people who really need the medication to get a hold of it.</p><p>I've seen people fake back pain and go to the ER and walk out with a prescription, run to the pharmacy and then be selling the tablets less than an hour later. It's really sad.</p><p>It's sad that this drug that really helps cope with pain is so addictive that if you suddenly run out, even so much as waiting to go to the doctor the next day sends you into a night of withdrawal.</p><p>With this being typed, I really don't know my next steps with this medication. I've noticed I'm building a tolerance, and when I try other drugs like Morphine, or Dilated it does nothing for me at all so I don't even waste my time with them.</p><p>If all my doctor is going to do is keep increasing the doses higher and higher, than what is next? Giving me vials of morphine to shoot myself up at home? Then I'd enter myself into a detoxing program I think.</p><p>I have seen this all happen to myself, and then I see a friend get a prescription of Tylenol #3s for pain, and she has become addicted to them. I can't help but think, now it's Tylenol #3's, next year will it still be that or will she begin to get curious? It worries me.</p>",
