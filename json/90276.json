 "report": "<p>I was offered imported Absinthe by a friend with a flask. I had roughly one shot. I went on to have a bit of bourbon and then went to bed for the night.</p><p>I woke up the next morning completely blind, and it took me almost 12hrs to regain my full eyesight.</p><p>Turns out Wormwood is in the same family as Menthol, which is something I'm mildly allergic to -- Wormwood I'm more severely allergic to. I literally could not see behind the length of my arm all day.</p>",
