  "I really don't understand how this was possible. I have used DXM as a recreational drug a fair amount of times. I usually will dose somewhere between 300-400 mg staying in the 1st and 2nd plateu range. Yesterday I decided that I would up the ante and take 600 mg.",
  "10:30 PM: Take 300 Mg in 15 mg capsules making a total of 20 capsules",
  "10:50 PM: Eat a bag of popcorn and some bread",
  "11:00 PM: Finish my dose with 300 more mg in 15mg capsules bringing my grand total to 40 pills (that's alot of fucking pills!).",
  "Usually for me it takes somewhere between 1 hour to 2 hours to begin to come up on my trip. At around 12:30 I was expecting to be hit by a very strong trip but nothing happened, so I waited some more time. By 2 AM I was completely dissapointed. Nothing happened, I mean nothing at all. I have dosed many times on 300mg of the same exact robittusin 15 mg capsules and have gotten stoned out of my mind but this time I was completely confused. How can I take double the dose I usually take and nothing happen. I stayed awake watching a movie until 3:30 AM until I just went to sleep. The next morning I woke up with no hangover nothing.",
  "I would understand maybe if it was my first time doing DXM and maybe my body had some special enzyme that blocked the effects of DXM but I have tripped on DXM well over 30 times. Each time I have done it I feel the effects and have fun. This time though I am just astonished how 600mg can have no effect at all."
