 "report": "<p>I had had some Soma pills kicking around for years, and never took them, since recreational muscle relaxers are just not my cup o' tea.  This time though, I was feeling a real twinge in my shoulder from my non-ergonomic computer setup, so I decided I would take one of the Somas.  I took one 350mg pill, which I had in combination with plenty of coffee, 1 beer, and some weed. </p><p>Well, about 2 hours after I took it, I started feeling very itchy, especially in the armpits and groin.  This morning I am still itchy, and I feel weak as if the effects are lingering.  I am also noticably red, as if I have a mild sunburn all over my body.  My verdict is that Soma is a very effective drug, but if are going to try it recreationaly, try a small dose first just to see if you are going to trigger an allergic reaction doing it - I shudder to think what might have occurred if I just popped 5 of them and chugged a beer for fun.</p>"
