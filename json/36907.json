Feel asleep a bit later)</p><p>the next day i wokeup to my mom knocking at the door asking for something, i gave her somthing no-way related, and then what she asked for.. 4 friends of mine where behind of her, as she ternd i greeted them (shook hands etc), and she dident notice..they sat down, i turned to lock the door and back and they were gone!, i layed back down on the bed, my t-shirt that was on the bed turned into this mini MAD COW with spirall red-orange squares as eye's and horns of a deamon, it ran strait to me, and i freaked and jumped back..then it became the shirt again.</p><p>day2 + 05:00 - found myself ending a chat with a tree, the grass started growing really high so i went back in...after that i remember sitting in the livinroom and looking at picture's get thire own life :)</p><p>spent most of the day talking to ppl, animals that were not there (and my cat..), my mj plant, that skull on the speaker, and smoked unreal ciggaret's..while i had 2 packs, one real and one not!, i remember twice, i smoked, the cig was gone, so i take out a real one, but from the wrong pocket..takeing another fake cigg' that would dissappeare after 2 mins..(lol).</p><p>smoke sometimes came out of real objects, and some shadows where moveing with no connection to there objects! i took this whole trip as a once in a lifetime, and last, trip to a very very deep place in my mind.</p><p>the after effects where long lasting and really scarry (as in a thought, 'shit i fucked myself up', even when i was aware to the after effects.), but (thank god) this was all gone.</p><p>3-4 days of really messed-up eye's, splits, fogged/bluer vision, etc.</p><p>for about a week i was feeling really wierd and unconnected to the world, smokeing weed sometimes made things fly in the corners of my eyes and stuff...
