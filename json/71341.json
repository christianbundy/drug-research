 "report": "<p>So one day I was really bored and had just seen a report on Ginger. I decided to try it. I dumped 2 and 1/2 tablespoons into a glass of dr pepper, it tasted like shit and I almost threw up everywhere. About 5 minutes later I felt a slight buzz. I was somewhat happy and everything felt like a dream. I didn't have any visual distortions or any feelings of extreme euphoria like when I use ecstasy though. After about 10 minutes for some reason I packed a suitcase full of clothes. After about 20 minutes the effects fully wore off. I find ginger kind of pointless, it tastes like shit and does basically nothing good for me. I won't do it again unless I'm bored out of my mind.</p>",
