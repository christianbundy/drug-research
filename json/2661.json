  "And they are wrong.",
  "You still think, Im the exception to that rule",
  "Superstition and suggestive thoughts.",
  "Anything but denial,",
  "But then, that is denial.",
  "Im really not falling into the stereotype",
  "But by swearing Im not,",

  "I have to be open to that idea.",
  "Even though I think ill get better on my own.",
  "And right now, maybe I did dream it all",
  "I even doubt my own mind.",

  "What I saw",
  "Where Ive been",
  "I just have no way to prove it;",

  "And walk under the city lights",
  "Letting the shadows devour me.",
  "And the last voice I hear",
  "Will not be my own.",
  "Even if I knew for sure, its gravol",
  "I wouldnt stop",
  "Im scared, yes",
  "Butwhat if its not a hallucinogen",
  "And im getting closer to the TRUTH.",
  "What if this is a real voice",
  "Belonging to something or someone",
  "And im only in a state of mind to hear it",
  "When im on gravol?",
  "Its not like im imagining",
  "And its not like im crazy",
  "I just cant tell the difference",
  "Until I turn, and no ones there",
  "But the voice remains clear in my mind",
  "I know I heard it",
  "Mostly on the left, but I hear it.",

  "And they were also not true.",
  "I just dont know what to believe,",
  "Or what is true.",
  "Because I KNOW I heard a voice",
  "But there was no one to be seen.",
  "That doesnt necessarily mean the voice was a fabrication.",
  "Does it???",
  "I dont know if its so much I want to be rid of the voice",
  "I only heard it about 5 times in almost 5 months.",
  "Its more like..i want to understand it.",
  "Or be with it.",
  "Im not sure which though,",
  "If either.",
  "Im not alone, obviously.",
  "I mean, why would I hear if its non existent?",
  "Im not imagining it, this is on the outside of my head.",
  "And its not of the voices I have always heard.",
  "Its in English, says my name",
  "But wont answer.",
  "I guess I should feel lucky.",
  "The doctor says to go to another doctor..",
  "But I think i've all ready said too much.",
  "If I wasnt so worried and convinced (?),",
  "I never would have said anything at all.",
  "I even told mom,",
  "So I know. This is serious.",
  "Isnt it???",

  "Probably.",
  "But I dont know",
  "I dont know anything anymore,",
  "Theres no difference between what was yesterday",
  "And what wasnt.",
  "i have always heard voices,",
  "but now..these are in english",
  "and to the left, and OUTSIDE my head.",
  "and its just my name, or something i cannot make out,",
  "but its loud, so loud. and they dont respond when i ask who is there. my feet dont touch the ground i reach out for someting, but my hands are nowhere near the object. things move in the house, shadows walk around, when people arent even in the room. this has only happened since ive taken gravol. i started a few months ago, and my asthma is gone, i feel more confident, happy..relaxed. its just once in awhile i wonder...what is real anymore.</p>"
