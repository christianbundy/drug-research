 "report": [
  "Back in 2003, I was having some problems with paranoia and anxiety, and was prescribed Seroquel. This stuff worked ok, until my health insurance ran out, and I could no longer afford it. My psychiatrist prescribed 300mg of Thorazine daily as a substitute, since Thorazine is an older medicine with a generic (chlorpromazine), and I could easily afford it.",
  "When taking this stuff, it made me tired all the time. I had no energy whatsoever. Anyway, after a week of taking it I was outside with a friend tinting the windows on my car (a little project we were working on). The last thing I remember was walking to the trash can to throw something away. I woke up on the balcony of my apartment some time later, with the sounds of ambulance sirens in the distance. Everything was in black in white for a few seconds, eventually, I got to my feet and ran inside. The paramedics arrived, but against my wife & friend's advice, I told the paramedics to 'Get the fuck out of my house!'. They left. I had just gotten back from a week in the hospital, and had no desire to go back. My wife later told me that I had a full blown seizure. I went to see my psychiatrist, who attributed it to the thorazine. He promptly took me off the stuff, and put me on depakote, to guard against future seizures.",
  "Thorazine sucks!"
