 "report": [
  "Pill:  at first tastes a bit sour, then more like a walnut.  Not a super strong taste.  No noticeable change in color of tongue or urine.",
  "Ok it's been a few minutes now and it hasn't fully dissolved yet.  I'm taking this opportunity to look up miracle fruit on Wikipedia.",
  "Ok its been like 10 minutes.  I hope the patience pays off.",
  "Ok done",
  "Orange:  I'm picking this first because it's the least strong in terms of sourness and I don't want to mess up my taste buds for later.  Kinda like how you start wine tasting with a white.  Although it would be cool to jump straight to hot sauce and see how great it is, but I don't want to climax prematurely here.",
  "Ok the orange tastes more or less the same, but just really really good.  Like almost artificially good like an orange fruit snack.  If I didn't have more to taste I'd eat this whole orange (and I just had dinner so I'm not hungry).   The aftertaste is just of orange.  That was yummy.  Time to move on.",
  "Lime:  Ok I'm laughing hysterically now.  I am a believer.  Before I tasted it the juice got into a little crack in my lip and burnt and I thought, uh oh this is gonna be bad.  Its burning bad so I know this is a normal lime.  It tastes amazing though.  Again, like a fruit snack.  I'm giggling. ",
  "Lemon:  I just ate the whole thing.  My stomach burns haha.  Wikipedia said it doesn't change the chemistry of the food, so the acid is still there.  I'm also burping and I never burp.",
  "Onion:  Ok time for the big guns.  Wow my stomach burnssssss.  Ok it smells like onion, but it has no taste.  It's like unflavored yogurt.  So definitely a remarkable change, but it's not sweet like the other things have been.  I would suggest this for when you are going to eat somewhere and you know it's going to be bad.",
  "Sugar Cube:  Not much flavor.  Could have been overpowered by the onion.  Should have eaten that first but I forgot.  I'm licking the lemon juice off my lips and its yummy.",
  "Jose Cuervo Especial:  I don't really like tequila.  It tastes different.  I still don't like it.  It tastes more earthy, wooden, or maybe fried chicken.",
  "70 something % dark chocolate:  tastes the same.  Maybe it's wearing off.  Nope it's not I just went back to the lime and it still tastes like getting a paycheck.",
  "Peri-peri African pepper sauce: not much change.  Maybe a little less spicy. ",
  "E&J Very Special Old Pale Superior Reserve (Sounds fancy but it was $8 and came with a flask!): I don't drink enough brandy to know what this is supposed to taste like normally.  I can say for sure that this is better than the tequila was.",
  "Water: no change",
  "Honey: no change",
  "What little lemon is left still tastes about 75% as good as before, so that's a good way to make sure it hasn't worn off. ",
  "Uggggghhh stomach ache.",
  "When it comes to super acidic things, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  Stop after  of a lemon or something."
