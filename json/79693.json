 "report": "<p>Today I embarked on a shamanic experiment with a combination of household herbs which included sage, garlic, chives, marjoram, thyme, oregano, dill weed, and a touch of cinnamon;</p><p>The effects were surprisingly pleasant; sage has been known for its cleansing effects on the spirit and mind throughout shamanic cultures of the world; this explains one aspect of my experience.  I can only describe the effects as clean, pure, and adverse reaction of peacefulness and serenity.  I only smoked 1 bowl, holding each hit in for at least 15 seconds.  </p><p>The feeling inst exactly an intense high, but more of a spiritual cleanser. I distinctively remember a higher sensitivity to all of the flavors ingested around my vicinity; IE perceiving what others where tasting, a somewhat out of body surreality and awareness.</p>",
