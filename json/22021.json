 "report": "<p>I was looking for a non-habit forming sleep aid to cure my horrific nightly insomia attacks, when I stumbled across it.  The bottle said take 2-3pills so I took 5-6pills around 9:00.  About an hour later I retired to my tokin room to kill a few bowls.  After the first bowl, I was really stoned, and this was weird cause it usually takes me at least 2-3 bowls just to get high!  I thought,'hey, another bowl couldn't hurt!'  After taking several hits from the second bowl, I started seeing all of these crazy patterns, and colors were flowing and changing rapidly.  It could be compared to a very mild shroom trip.  The effects lasted until I passed out an hour later.  The dreams I had that night were incredably lucid and revealing about my inner self. </p><p>A warning though: I found any combination of melotonin with opium (or related drugs) can cause severe lucid nightmares, I've tried it many times with the same horrifiyng results consistant.</p>",
