 "report": [
  "I in no way recommend or commend using Dimenhydrinate in a manner inconsistent with its labelling. The same with Methylphenidate.",
  "I experimented with ritalin for a long time and my curiosity lead to addiction or habituation. Starting with doses of 20mg snorted and building up to a daily 80mg of insufflated bliss. I did not realise I was addicted until long after it had happened.",
  "At this point I seeked a substance to calm my cravings. I tried low doses of DXM (15mg - 60mg), other stimulants like Caffeine and Ephedrine, Codeine, Chlorpheniramine Maleate, Cannabis and other substances. Eventually I found dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine.",
  "a dose of 50mg dimenhydrinate equalled about 30mg Diphenhydramine. Dimenhydrinate quelled the urge for ritalin substantially and also surpressed my smoking and need to smoke. Along with this I get the best night's sleep for over a year.",
  "I relapse now and again but Dimenhydrinate seems to stop ritalin from giving me a high, cutting out the pleasure connected with abusing ritalin definately helps the situation."
