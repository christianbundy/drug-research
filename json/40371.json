 "report": "<p>I used to take Clonidine as a supressor for Tourette Syndrome.  I took 2 pills each night before going to bed for a few years straight. Basically, what it did to me was it would slow my heart rate and make me more tired and lazy, this had a positive impact on my Tourette ticks, but I was almost always tired. My doctor suggested I try a smaller dosage during the day, this made me exausted, I was failing in gym class, and falling asleep in all my other classes (I was still in elementary school at the time).  I stopped using it after the drowsiness became too much.</p><p>In High School, I tried it again, but I was also a fairly big marijuana user at the time and needless to say, combining the 2 just made me a lot more tired.  When I smoked marijuana while on the pill, I did notice a greater feeling of euphoria than I was getting from the weed alone. The feeling was simmilar to taking sleeping pills and not trying to go to sleep, I just get a good feeling, but I passed out sooner, although I don't recall ever feeling sick or anything before or after sleeping.</p><p>At one point a few years ago, my ticks were getting more intense, then one night I tried taking 3 pills, this was after not using it since high school. I felt incredibly drowsy for the next day and fell asleep twice at work, considering that I was operating a backhoe that day, left work early saying that I was sick, havent taken the drug since.</p>",
