 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: 'Bath salts' and similar products generally do not list ingredients or dosage on their packaging. Analysis has revealed that ingredients in a single product of this type may vary over time.] </p><p>I met my buddy yesterday at the bar at around 2pm for a beer.  He said that he had a present for me.  He gave me a package of white rush bath salt.  But he said that it was like cocaine.  I enjoy altering my mind and said what the heck, I'll gave it a try.  The guy I got it from was one of my best friends.  I crushed it in the package and my friend said to not dump it out because it messes it up.  So I stuck a bill in the package and proceeded to insuffilate it.  About 30 min later I could not believe how peppy and energetic I was.  Then I did a little more at about 4pm (2hrs later).  It is now 8am the following morning and I have not slept a wink.  It has been over 12 hour and I am still feeling it.  This stuff is pretty knarley.</p>",
