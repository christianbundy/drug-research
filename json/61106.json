 "report": "<p>I started taking a lot of tramadol about a week ago when I ordered 90 50mg pills of it on the internet.  I love it.  They put me in such a good mood and relax me.  Unlike opiates, they don't cause me to itch much at all.</p><p>I read on the internet earlier today about a biotechnology company that is attempting to create a method to vaporize pain killers in an inhaler-type device to almost instantly relieve pain rather than the user having to wait for 30 minutes to see the effect.  I had just bought a vaporizer for smoking tobacco the other day, so this gave me an idea.  Maybe I should put my tramadol in the vaporizer and give it a shot.</p><p>I tried this around 4:00pm today.  I didn't know if it was going to work at all so instead of taking my usual dose (300mg = 6 pills) I used only 2.  I crushed them up a bit and put them in.</p><p>About 7 minutes later the vaporizer was filled with vapor so I took a hit.  I started to cough up a lung because the vapor burned my throat badly and it tasted horrible.  Never the less, I kept on puffing and I slowly got somewhat used to it.  A few minutes later, when I was almost done inhaling all of the vapor, I started to feel relaxed.</p><p>This lasted for about an hour or so.  I'm sure if I had used 6 or 8 pills rather than two I would have felt great for a much longer period, but I decided I didn't want to subject myself to that horrible taste again.</p><p>All in all it was a good experience learning I could vaporize a pill.  I liked getting the effect in 5 minutes rather than the normal hour it takes for tramadol to kick in with me.</p>",
