 "report": [
  "At first I took 5 hits of Albuterol Sulfate, which I am prescribed because of sports induced asthma. I was lying down when I took them. I felt a slight buzz, comparable to nicotine, for about 30 seconds. I waited 30 minutes and then I had 12 to 15 hits. This time I was sitting up. I felt a much stronger buzz for a minute. 10 minutes later I noticed some chest pains. My lungs felt very tight. This feeling was off and on for the rest of the night. Now it is the next day, and I feel fine. No permanent damage was done, but huffing Albuterol was an awful idea."
