 "report": "<p>After my earlier negative experiences with some other research chemicals,</p><p>2C-C and 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy Methoxy), whose heavy body load and insufficient</p><p>psychedelic yield got me disappointed, I have approached this chemical</p><p>with a degree of apprehension and skepticism. I needn't have to worry;</p><p>this is a very gentle drug of rare beauty.</p><p>Xavier (my partner) and I decided to tag on an experiment with this</p><p>drug to the end of our MDMA-enhanced love-making session, having just</p><p>celebrated our anniversary. We were both already quite tired, but still</p><p>felt we'd like to extend this wonderful night for a bit longer.</p><p>I decided to apply this drug by IM injection, in order to bypass the</p><p>deleterious effects of the digestive tract, and to speed up the action.</p><p>The drug acted quite fast, perhaps within 10 minutes, and my threshold</p><p>dose was about 5mg. I was then comfortable enough to gradually increase</p><p>our dose to a total of 40mg, for each of us. The dose-to-response curve</p><p>was remarkably linear, gently tapering off. There was very little body</p><p>load. The effects started to subside in approx one or two hours, and I</p><p>have extended the duration of the trip by topping up.</p><p>The first thing I noticed were gentle rushes in my face, followed by</p><p>altered perception of colours. It's a bit like if I turned my</p><p>internal 'colour contrast' adjustment control to the max, and then some.</p><p>Colours become incredibly deep and vibrant. Xavier (my partner) and I</p><p>were watching a porn movie; this was turned into a piece of art, a</p><p>feast to our eyes.</p><p>Watching Xavier's face, I saw it transformed before my eyes. He has a</p><p>handsome face, with some strong features, and I saw him transformed</p><p>into a Star Trek alien, then yet another type of alien, and then some</p><p>strange animals, one after the other. He looked a bit scary, but I</p><p>realized that I would still love him even if he remained like that.</p><p>Closing my eyes produced a never-ending tapestry of intricate artistic</p><p>imagery which, if one was able to remember it all, would keep alive a</p><p>generation of fantastic artists.</p><p>Interestingly though, this drug was not at all trippy in the Ketamine</p><p>sense. It did not affect my mind; there were no 'conversations with</p><p>gods', no funny mental loops, no time dilation. It never got scary. I didn't</p><p>actually get deeply involved in the 'action'. Rather, I was in a</p><p>position of an amused, almost detached, observer. That was quite enough</p><p>for me, but Xavier was somewhat disappointed, being used to a deeper</p><p>involvement on Ketamine and complaining that the visuals were too</p><p>weak even while he was at the peak of his experience.</p><p>Having said that, I did in fact notice some subtle mental cues of deeper</p><p>psychedelic deja-vu of my earlier Ketamine sessions. The drug does seem</p><p>able to get me close to some of the doors of higher perception, but leaves</p><p>them safely shut.</p><p>In terms of the stimulant/depressant scale, this drug was mildly</p><p>stimulant, in a peaceful, gentle way. I would imagine (as I heard) that</p><p>it would make a great combo with MDMA (in our case the MDMA effect was</p><p>already over). But it was not a rave club drug; I wouldn't be able to dance on it.</p><p>In fact I tended to develop a slight nausea just by going to the</p><p>bathroom and back, which however, quickly subsided when I got back in</p><p>bed again. It was not a sensual drug; I probably couldn't have sex on it,</p><p>it does not seem to enhance any erotic feelings. But if I wanted to just</p><p>lie down and relax, and perhaps watch some movie, I could be sure it</p><p>will become a work of art, a colourful, yet not kitchy, eye candy, while</p><p>still leaving my mind intact enough to be able to follow the plot.</p><p>This is a successful research chemical which could in fact make it to</p><p>the mainstream. It should have a street name; I'd simply call it 'Colour'.</p>",
