  "A recent study of the mescal bean and its ritualistic use sparked the desire for a human bio-assay. A first attempt with 100 mg of mescal bean powder was orally ingested with no noticable effects.",
  "A second attempt with approximately 250mg of powdered mescal bean was insnufflated. One hour later, a very heavy feeling began to occur in the body. At two hours one felt a strong intoxication not too different from the feelings of alcohol. Warm sensations occured throughout the body as a narcotic feeling manifested in the head. All effects ended after four hours."
