 "substance": "Sophora secundiflora",
 "bodyweight": "150 lb",
 "report": "<p>There was both physical disorientation as well as rather bizarre hallucinations. The hallucinations weren't like I get from LSD or mescaline--they looked like real things.  I thought at one point that my father appeared before me--the image turned into pink fog and was gone.  It was winter at the time and I also managed to lean back on the grill of a heater.  I didn't notice I was being burned until I heard the sizzling sound. I didn't have a shirt on.  There was also considerable gastric pain associated with the experience.</p><p>[reported dose: 'Two of the inner seeds']</p>",
