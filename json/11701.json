 "report": [
  "I've tripped three times previously on mushrooms with typical and wonderful experiences. I was put on prozac for depression and eventually petered out to worthlessness and was put on abilify. I am not bipolar, just anxious or something. My psychiatrist didn't say what he thought and I didn't ask.",
  "Earlier in the week I introduced two friends to mushrooms. One had a major trip on just 1/8th, much much stronger than anything I have ever heard of. The other was on prozac and had a very delayed reaction, about 1.5 hours until their trip started and it wasn't very strong. Mostly visuals with some epiphanies.",
  "I had a slight mood uplift akin with a low dose of percocet. So yes people, this drug will ruin your mushroom tripping. I don't know why but it does."
