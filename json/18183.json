 "report": "<p>Having been diagnosed with ADD, and unable to use Ritalin properly without becoming hopelessly addicted, I decided to try alternative methods of medicating myself.</p><p>I went to my local health food store, asking for DMAE, and after being questioned as to whether I was a cop (the stuff is illegal to sell in Canada), the guy reached under the counter and pulled out a bottle.</p><p>I got home and took a single pill as directed.</p><p>Basically, the effects i felt were:</p><p>- an unpleasant physical stimulation, like drinking way too much coffee</p><p>- slight nausea, chills, and sweating (I presume these are cholinergic side effects, as DMAE is supposed to raise levels of acetylcholine within the brain)</p><p>- a general feeling of 'sketchiness' similar to the comedown from MDMA or one of the amphetamines.</p><p>It's been three hours since I took the stuff, and the symptoms aren't getting any better.</p><p>Thousands of web sites sell this stuff, touting it as a 'smart drug'. I call it a complete waste of money, and will not be repeating this experience.</p>",
