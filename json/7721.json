 "report": [
  "One night i was talking to a friend who rolled often and he told me that one way to potentiate a roll was to pre-load on 5HTP.  Well, since I really don't roll, I basically wanted to see what a large dose of 5HTP would do to me, without any mdma involved.  So I took 300mg of 5HTP orally at once.  About 30 mins later i felt lightheaded, but not in a dizzy kind of way.  I also felt very spacey, and also was pretty giddy.  Nothing could really bother me, and I enjoyed getting yelled at by my parents (although i faked the anger so they wouldnt think I was on a substance).  It also helped me fall asleep quite well, and it was a deep sleep, that didn't have a drug induced feel the next morning.",
  "5HTP isn't something I think I would do everyday, because it really wasn't overly enjoyable.  Though possibly if I needed to be happy in a situation I didn't wanna be in, a megadose of 5HTP might do the trick."
