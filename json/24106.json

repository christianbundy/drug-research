 "report": "<p>2 grams of off-white colored powder labeled as DPT was devided up into equal looking, eyeballed piles.  A few weeks later, I insufflated (approximating from the devided piles) about 92 mg.  This was my second DPT trip.\r[Erowid Note: Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts. See related article]</p><p>3:54 pm  I just snorted about 25 mg of DPT a few minutes ago.  My tounge is numb, I'm sweating and I'm deff. starting to feel it.  [I then snorted the rest of the approx. 92 mg]</p><p>4:37  Everything is vibrating... jusus... it's hard to do anything.  Breathing is interesting. hahahaha  Everything sounds crazy.  Everything looks crazy.  I'm fucking shaking.</p><p>4:47  Peak coming soon</p><p>4:57  Holy shit.... crazy shit... I just tried walking to the park... hahaha fuck that.. there might be people over there so I turned back.. I does feel nice outside.</p><p>5:15-5:30  Peak</p><p>6:33  That was pretty much a crappy trip.  Not cuz I was alone, or it played tricks on my mind or anything, it just wasn't enough.  The peak was cool, but not as cool as last time... maybe I WILL do more 100 mg.</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>In retrospect, it was an OK trip.  I just expected too much because my first DPT trip (while at about the same dosage) was overly intense and lasted longer.</p><p>The initial burn from snorting it wasn't bad at all this time (as apposed to my first time, which made my eye water).  My pupils were dialated.</p><p>My hearing was like this:  Think of a ping pong ball is allowed to drop and bounce on a cement floor.  Think of the sound that would emit.  Anything I heard would echo like it was a ball bouncing.  The sound would decay just that way.</p><p>Also, the patterns I saw were very much like that Myan calendar thing.  Patterns like that on the wall and everything else.  The patterns moved.  The patterns were the colors that would be produced from a prism when light shines on one (specifially - white, green and red).  These 3 colors were so pronounced that they drowned out any other colors that may have been envolved in the patterning.  I saw a big rabbit (much like the energizer bunny but facing me and no sun glasses) that was made out of that patterning.  I saw tracers as well, but not as many as with AMT.  Going outside made a lot of the visuals go away. </p><p>I remember coming to the revelation 'I will never reach god through drugs' right about at the peak.</p><p>It was easy to function on this drug.</p>",
