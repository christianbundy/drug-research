  "Ritalin- the drug that changed me, relationships, friends, interests.",
  "As I first started abusing, I started at popping 10mg pills, reaching a tolerance to 100mg. It changed my life, in a bad way, from cravings, relationships, interests, etc..for some odd reason, no matter how long I go without ritalin or stimulants, the tolerance wont ever go down, and it has made me permanently suffer with anxiety, angerness, depression, and it stays with me everyday, no matter how long I stopped using. It has made me a very pissed off person most of the time.",
