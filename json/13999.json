  "Tonight I fell before the good graces of Lady Salvia, and I feel truly blessed to have received her gracious hospitality.  I encountered her one night before, though in a very inappropriate setting, and I felt that I missed much of her insights.",
  "Tonight however, was much different, as I was working with the very potent 10x extract.  I was with a special friend who would also partake; we were both sitting comfortably in his darkened room.  I loaded my glass bowl (using it for the first time as it was reserved for her) with a very small amount of material, possibly at most a tenth of a gram.  I placed the blue flame of my torch light to the alluring dark-green salvia which immediately turned flame red, and then inhaled deeply.  Holding this for about 30 seconds I realized there was more left in the bowl, so I took another hit.  As I inhaled the cool, agreeable smoke, I was immediately pulled to the floor by a strange indiscernible force.  I felt as if I had been sucked out of my body for a few seconds, into a space of complete nothingness.  This absolute dissociation soon passed and I gained awareness of my body again.",
  "With my eyes closed, an almost infinite 2-dimensional plane of kaleidoscoping dream visions danced at a dizzying pace.  Some of the images were downright funny, though I cant remember why.  Perhaps the lady was in especially good spirits, as this state of awareness felt very comfortable, even when I was completely dissociated from my body and could feel her pull.  The visions were similar to the those induced by a strong psilocybin experience, only they were playing out on a more subconscious level, lacking the intense emotional connections of the mushroom peak.  They were organic and familiar images and memories, materializing out of a swirl of geometric iridescence.  This was the dreamtime.  Hovering in the spatial infinity of my own consciousness, connected to the entire universe.",
  "As my bodily awareness became more apparent, I felt this space moving against my skin, causing a rain of tingling pins and needles.  I could see a tunnel moving out before me, and then some thought triggered what seemed like a drop of water hitting the surface of a puddle, and the ripples undulated throughout my body.  This would occur again later in the experience.  I remember getting the feeling that the lady was trying to show me something specific, which I obviously must have missed. I could almost hear her voice: Why dont you see where Im leading you. I remember, almost laughingly replying, Its all so beautiful, so amusing, but its too fast.",
  "Thats when I saw her hands, like two blooming rose buds, grab each frame and slow the ongoing collage of consciousness down to a more observable rate.  By then however it was too late, and the physical realm called me slowly back.  I remember sharing these events with my friend, who had embarked as well, and he described having an equally positive and intriguing experience.",
  "I can only say that the lady is an exotic and powerful plant spirit.  The space we (and so many others!) accessed shows real promise of serious exploratory potential.  I think it may be equally important as the DMTs.  Unlike the tryptamines, however, her Sageness prefers the route of dreams, not just sensory experience.  I guess that is the best I can explain it.  But dont think she isnt direct; the weirdness alone will astound most people.  Somehow I perceived the chaotic array of (normally) subconscious imagery as humorous and insightful, though I can see where with the wrong set and setting someone could really become frightened.  Especially by the strange gravitational tactile sensations she evokes.  I remember having a very brief pornographic moment as well, and somehow I think, even in my disembodied state, I blushed.  Now hows that for weird?",
