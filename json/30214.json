I've been looking for alternatives to prescription drugs and think I may have hit on something.  I've just finished two cups of tea made with a total of 3 tablespoons of dried plant.  I feel very relaxed and the pain is very managable. </p><p>I am thinking of combining this tea with a cold infusion of kava.  Next time.</p>",
