  "I am italian, and in italy Ritalin is not very popular as in USA. But I tried to make my doctor prescribe me some Ritalin pills for my tiredness. I described him all the symptoms of tiredness (I am very very tired) and care of attenction, but the old bastard gave me guaran pills O_o.",
  "Well, he told me to take 3 pills a day, but I soon doubled the dosage because I didn't feel anything. I felt nothing with 6, so one day I had to do a lot of gymnastics and took 15 of them (or more, don't remember). It only made me nervous, not any stimulant effect, and the next day I had an horrible pain in my belly. My doctor is a sick motherfucker."
