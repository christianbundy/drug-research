  "In my search for a adequete legal stimulant, I stumbled across something that piqued my interest. Purportedly, I could get high off the active ingredient, propylhexedrine, in the over the counter nasal decongestant Benedrex. I decided to give it a try.",
  "I bought a Benzedrex vapor inhaler from the pharmacy for around 6 dollars. It's really easy to snap off the top to get to the stick of cotton inside. I would not recommend just eating the cotton. The menthol and camphor are quite disgusting to ingest. I broke it up and put it into empty gel caps to avoid most of the nastly odor and taste.",
  "It kicked in about a half hour. I would compare it to adderall with less of an edge. I got all the classic effects; extreme focus, increased energy, very talkative. I think it lasted for about 2 hours at peak, then there was easy comedown in which I could still feel the med in me. Overall, it was very pleasurable and I'd do it again. I'd like to find a different source for it than benzedrex because 1) it gets expensive 2) I'd rather not have menthol flavored breath. 3) I'd like to try it in other ways like snorting it."
