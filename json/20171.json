  "Hi,",
  "Since I have bipolar type 2 disorder, I am given medication.  I have had klonopin, Ativan, Valium and Xanax for anxiety.  But none are as subtle and gentle than Librium.  Plus Librium has a very long duration (12 hours) compared to other benzos.  Its a very nice, mellow tranquilizer.  10mg usually does the trick for me but I need 20mg to feel really comfortable.  Its a substance that someone can easily get dependent on and abuse.  In my case I only have 30 10mg pills per month to prevent potential abuse.  Anyway, I love my Librium and wouldn't want any other benzo.",
