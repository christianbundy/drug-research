 "report": "<p>This was crazy. Absolutely insane. And I will never, ever, ever, ever touch this stuff again.</p><p>I was home from winter break from college when my friend invited me and all of my friends to a kick back at his house. There wasn't going to be any alcohol or drugs or anything like that. Just movies and rekindling with old friends. The guy I was seeing at the time, Connor, had a step brother named Toby, who was really into drugs.</p><p>Toby asked me if I wanted to take a hit of this JWH-018 (aka hell drug). I agreed because well why not? We went outside and lit up for me and I took a massive hit for my small 5'5' 120 lb frame. Almost too much to handle. I felt fine for a little until about 10 minutes later when all hell broke loose.</p><p>I started to feel my heart beat very fast and out of control. I got really scared because I've never tried anything like this before. Not even smoked pot. Anyway things were coming and going out of reality and I felt like it was just me looking at these two dimensional objects that were floating in space. Nothing felt real. I was trapped in this horrible dream.</p><p>This is the point where I completely black out and start to panic, according to my friends. I kept telling them that I was going to die and that I had to call 911 or I was going to kill myself because I couldn't live like this forever. They kept telling me I was fine and to just relax and to enjoy it. I felt like I was a beam of light stuck in black empty vessel which was my body.</p><p>I started to watch TV and be normal again but I just had the constant urge to move around so I got up and grabbed a handful of peppermints (not sure why) and began walking around telling myself that I needed to dance everything off and it would be okay.</p><p>Eventually I settled down and relaxed and fell asleep on the couch but it was something I would never do again and definitely an experience I'll never forget.</p>",
