 "report": [
  "On taking E and enjoying it a lot a few weeks ago I didn't hesitate in trying it again at another rave. They were also selling nitrous which didn't make me laugh, just gave me a head rush.",
  "Ecstasy takes the longest of all the drugs I've taken to sink in, so I thought I would buy some shrooms to help get me started. A big mistake. People were snorting pure MDMA and coke off the tables, and every other person was smoking a joint, with still more on E. It had a mad atmosphere but it didn't matter. My thoughts were racing, and as I result I became depressed. I also experienced another thing - paranoia. I've thought of myself as quite a level headed guy. I've never been paranoid like that. I knew there was nothing to be afraid of, but my brain would turn my head to look at anyone that moved or turned their head slightly.",
  "I sat down and thought stuff over, feeling guilty that I was dragging down my friends night. When my friends came back from dancing to sit down two pricks who I think were high on coke started being aggressive. I was itching for a fight, very unusual for me, but we moved tables. A strange effect I had never experienced was green auras/light around peoples faces, especially peoples eyes, noses and hairline. Lights were also very bright.",
  "I've learnt my lesson from that night and never plan to eat shrooms on a night out - for me, at least, they are not a social drug."
