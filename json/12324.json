 "report": [
  "150mg re-dose 60mg every hour. Initial effects lasted 2 hours with 150mg.After this effects began to wane. Re-dose was then administered after the first 2 hours, every hour.",
  "Comparatively an MDMA-like buzz with a slight feeling of anticipation and anxiety on onset, progressing to a feeling of elation and warmth, but not to the same extent of MDMA. Although this drug has been called MDMA-like, it is of-course not MDMA, so therefore its effects are different and a comparison cannot be adequately made. It is an empathogen for me, but without the forced loved up synthetic ecstasy buzz. Its definitely not the methylone talking.  Feelings of happiness and wellbeing. A lucid clearheaded intoxicated state.  My personal judgement is not affected such as the ability to act normally (baseline) in a situation as if sober. There is a defining dream-like affect that is distinct from the MDMA buzz. Music appreciation is enhanced. Slight nausea was experienced with a friend who took 175 milligrams in the initial phase but re-dosed on similar amounts (60mg), nausea diminished after 1 and a half hours (roughly). Through the process of experimentation my own personal optimum dosage 150mg and small top-up doses there-after. After effects included a feeling of slight emotional flatness. No intensive negative feelings experienced. Later in the day the flatness was replaced by a feeling of contentment."
