 "report": "<p>I typically take anywhere from 8-10 and sometimes 12 25mg tabs of a generic brand of this drug sold as an allergy medication at a large chain store. Comes in a box of 100 caps for under $5. A box of 100 will last me a little less than 10 days. I use this drug as a sleep aid.</p><p>200mg seems to be the magic dose for me anything higher than that and I risk being uncomfortable. In higher doses it does make me very uncomfortable, like I want to stretch. I feel very uncomfortable lying still. I've read that this drug is among the most euphoric of antihistamines in its class. The effects are indeed very euphoric. For me even after 5+ years of almost nightly use the euphoria has never gone away. It has dulled some after so many years but it is still quite pronounced. I've never used this med to experience any halluciations, etc. but just to relax and help me drift off to sleep.</p><p>I have experienced a few bothersome side-effects. This med is also used to treat nausea and motionsickness. On occassion when I have skipped an evening of my nightly dose I do experience mild nausea and just a general malaise. I wouldn't call it a withdrawl syndrome but my body does notice I have skipped my dose. Other than this I've not seen any bad side-effects.</p>",
