 "report": "<p>\nThis was my first time trying nutmeg, i heard about it on the web and thought, what the hell.  So i went to the supermarket and bought a nice sized box of whole nutmeg.</p><p>Hour 1:  Took entire tablespoon at 1 p.m., very hard stuff, hope it's worth it. Around 2 p.m. started feeling very stoned (but without the red eye and dry mouth!)</p><p>Hour 2-4: feeling VERY stoned.  sat and chilled out for a while.  very light, calm hallucinations beginning.</p><p>Hour 4-6:  pretty nice closed eye visuals going on, very focused daydreams when i try.</p><p>Hour 6-8:  stoned feeling starting to subside, oh well.  More closed eye visuals going on. At first i thought these may be acid flashbacks, but they are too unlike an LSD state of mind.</p><p>Basically, the effects of hour 6-8 carried on until i went to bed.  I woke up the next morning with a very pleasant buzz still going.  Plus, i don't think i've had a better night's sleep.  All in all the nutmeg was worth it.  Not something i would do on a regular basis, but maybe just a lazy summer day experiment to try again.  With proper music and state of mind, the nutmeg can be fun.</p>",
