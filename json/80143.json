 "report": "<p>Remeron (Mirtazapine) is a mixed blessing. The drug helps with sleep and anxiety issues, but is almost impossible to come off of w/o serious complications. I have tried several times to w/d from this medication without success. Every time I tried to lower the dose from 30 mgs, terrible side effects resulted. Anxiety, aggitation, tremor, insomnia, emotionality----you name it, resulted from reducing my daily dose. I wish that I had never gotten on this drug.</p>",
