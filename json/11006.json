  "One of the greatest drugs known to man.  They should give it away at the convenience store.  Possibly one of the greatest to snort, too: Valium slides down like a sugary pixie stick with little or no pain to the nostril.",
  "10mg, blue (snorted)",
  "Euphoric, purple hues, no pain, lots of love, desire to sleep standing up, funny grin, bugs bunny cartoons playing in reverse slowly in my head.",
  "5mg, yellow (ingested)",
  "A tease.  Mild visuals, desire to sleep or lie down to increase its potency.",
  "Next day: possibly a slight hangover.  Far less so than many other 'modern' painkillers.  This is probably the reason why Valium was so popular: aside from brain damage, there was only a little bit of catalepsy or the shakes.  Truly a classic drug and hard to find."
