 "report": "<p>This is an initial report on an 'attack dose' of pharmaceutical grade Piracetam. Two weeks previous I had started back on a DMAE regimen (4 250mg bitartrate daily). I also maintain a restricted carbohydrate diet with no sugar intake, and as Piracetam supposedly potentiates glucose levels, this was a curious situation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>6:00pm(ish): Ingested 12 800mg capsules, on a semi-empty stomach.</p><p>7:30pm: Slight bodyload. Pressure and warmpth felt.</p><p>8:00pm: Vision and color acuity slightly sharpened.</p><p>10:00pm: Nootropic effects present, mood overstability, undistracted, heightened attention span.</p><p>12:00pm: I lay down. Oddly, though, despite being very mentally awake, I feel very physically willing to rest.</p><p>Comments</p><p>Piracetam's inital effects seem to have three basic characteristics:</p><p>- Mood nulling. The 'Mr.Spock' effect. This is actually a very curiously amusing effect, it is also one of the most noticeable. Informal emotional involvement, including music and sex, seems ancillary, distracting, and uninteresting.</p><p>- Logical and associative thinking. Organizational, procedural, and logical tasks seem as blocks to be readily fit into respective places.</p><p>- Logos. This is a clear nootropic effect. The symmetry of objects take on an 'interesting' appearence, however without any emotional or abstractual gravity.</p>",
