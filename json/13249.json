 "report": [
  "Background: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually.",
  "Set: Home with 1 friend.",
  "Setting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.",
  "8:00PM",
  "Dose taken with water",
  "8:20PM",
  "Stomach feels a bit like ingestion, heart beat up a little.",
  "More awake, possibly just music and relaxing. Clammy hands.",
  "8:25PM",
  "Notice subtle headspace change. Fluffy, floaty.",
  "8:30PM",
  "Not that jaw is clenching yet, but chewy sounds good.",
  "Feels nice to move and stretch.",
  "8:40PM",
  "Chose chewy that tastes putrid, 'rotten berry flavour' . Spat it out.",
  "'Need to poop feeling' but I know I don't need to.",
  "Body temp must be up, sweaty 'pits'.",
  "Pupil Dilation",
  "Feeling mood lift and nice body high coming in waves.",
  "9PM",
  "Definetley feeling nice. Desire to move about.",
  "Getting harder to write, concentration not as good.",
  "Enhanced colours, music is enveloping me.",
  "Still want to poo.",
  "9:30PM",
  "Keep thinking about getting comfortable on couch but keep getting distracted.",
  "Hot and cold waves. Sweating with jumpers on but want a heater. (I get this on MDMA and 2ci also)",
  "9:50PM",
  "Put a heater on, bit more comfortable. Making sure to drink water.",
  "Music is hard to chose, no particular genre' sounds good, just particular songs.",
  "I STILL WANT TO POO! I think my bowels must be relaxed.",
  "10:10PM",
  "Had a water pipe hit of THC, got chills and prickly fingers. Very nice.",
  "Conversation is deep, but not serious. Laughter feels good.",
  "10:20",
  "Some slight jaw tension. Want chewy but don't want the disgusting berry one.",
  "10:45",
  "Starting to mellow just a little.",
  "Debating a little more.",
  "50mg oral?.'woops I did'.",
  "11:20",
  "Feeling the 50mg. It doesn't bring me up in any way just sustains the buzz.",
  "2:30",
  "Finished watching watchmen. Still feeling awake",
  "Talk to friend.",
  "4PM",
  "Fell asleep",
  "Conclusion:",
  "I used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.",
  "Unlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends.",
  "Mentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.",
  "Although it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything.",
