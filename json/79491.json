  "<p>I never smoked anything before, and even cigarette smoke makes me cough.  So, naturally, looking for another way to get mildly buzzed, I picked a few leaves of catnip from the garden (around 7), and a few leaves of fresh spearmint.  I smashed it into a cup, and added honey and poked at it with a grapefruit spoon.  After my water came to a boil, I clamped on the lid and waited for the stuff to cool down.  The resultant tea was colored like very weak jasmine tea, and tasted very minty.",
  "10 minutes:  I got dizzy and quite warm.  I feel a bit giddy, and it is quite pleasurable.",
  "15 minutes:  General feeling of well being, and it's harder to concentrate - but it's still good.",
  "30 minutes:  The feeling of coming down.  I feel a lot more relaxed now.</p>"
