 "report": "<p>I had an amazing night on LSD and 6-apb (benzo fury). The setting was at a psytrance party held in the bushland outside the city I live in.</p><p>I travelled up and set camp with three friends. We were all very excited as we are all new to the scene.</p><p>7pm: After smoking a joint we dropped 2 microdots of LSD before heading to the dance floor. After an hour or so I was feeling very good dancing and looking at all the trippy visuals. The stars and the lighting were a sight to behold. Unfortunately as what often happens when using LSD I lost all ability of communication and got somewhat disorientated but this waned as the trip progressed.</p><p>11pm: 3 of us decided that we would have a 100mg capsule of 6-apb each. Id had 6-apb once before in a club and had a great old time. Given its psychedelic visual effects I was eager to try it in combination with LSD. After 15 minutes or so I felt quite nauseas. After 20 minutes I noticed a marked new willingness to fully express myself on the dance floor. Over the next 3 and a half hours I proceeded to dance, talk to strangers about a range of things from their ethnic backgrounds to their ability at playing with a poh ball, dance like a maniac spraying bubbles everywhere and tell my mate how good it was to have such a shared experience. The combination with the LSD was fantastic with vivid digital-type hallucination. It was the best parts of LSD with the ability to communicate and really feel a connection with everyone else at the party. I also consumed some nangs (nitrous oxide) but was not hugely into the head rush it gives so I only did a couple.</p><p>2.30am: As we were having such a great time we decided to take another 100mg capsule of 6-apb. This one really put me and my 2 mates into outerspace. We were getting freaky on the dance floor/ My friend was talking shit and described it like having no internal filter to what he was saying. But we were having a great old time and continued to do so until the sun came up.</p><p>6.30am: It was getting light and me and my good mate decided to smoke a joint together. As I have previously experienced with 6-apb and MDMA+LSD the joint kicked hallucinations in intensely. The difference was that these hallucinations were not inherent on other objects like LSD hallucinations but seemed to exist in empty space in front of me. I could put my finger out and touch the hallucinations which were purple and green geometries sometimes spinning to form a vortex. I also experienced what is best described as the cracking of my vision.  It was as if everything in front of me was behind a force field about 50cm from my face and it would crack and warp, thus warping everything behind it. It is truly amazing to experience.</p><p>As the sun came up my energy to remain up and dancing persisted but the dance floor suddenly became seedy to me. There were lots of edgy looking zombies doing the same dance moves they had done 10 hours earlier. Some of these people had sunken cheeks or were unhealthily thin. It was a sobering reminder of what I wanted to avoid and I suddenly felt myself losing interest in continuing the party. Instead I returned to our tent and sat on the deck chair for some 3-4 hours just enjoying the hallucinations and talking with my friend.</p><p>12pm: As I was still tripping my friend who had take ecstasy and not the benzofuries said that he was sober and could take over as designated driver from myself. We immediately packed up the tent and left. It was a good thing I didnt have to drive because my hallucination didnt stop until 5pm and long before this point I got hit with fatigue that put me to sleep while sitting in the car.</p><p>All in all the come down wasnt so bad, just inordinate physical fatigue, an inability to stomach food, a mild headache and dizzy feeling and an incredibly sore jaw from chewing my gum so hard all night. I had one of the best nights of my life with the highlights being the psychedelic hallucinations and the feeling of shared experience with my friends and fellow party goers but I recognise that indulging in such a wide array of chemicals at such high doses is not something that can be done often without impacting on everyday life.</p>",
