 "report": [
  "I had had several ounces of Calea Zacatechich in my possession for quite a while, but never really used it.  One night, I was feeling a little adventurous and not wanting to use any Salvia Divinorum, I filled 3 500mg gel caps full of the powdered plant material.  I took the pills with a glass of water and soon after drifted off to sleep.",
  "Im not sure if I can really explain what happened that night, but I can try..  My dreams were intricate weaves of gold, shimmering and letting me fall endlessly down a tunnel of fantasy.  The dreams were detailed, the feelings intense, and the experience just indescribable.  Although I never became lucid (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) it was still an amazing experience.  But ive found that a large glass of milk before bed can induce a similar experience!!  So the question really is, is it a placebo effect?"
