 "report": "<p>A Friday evening in an English suburb. I sat at home eating tea, while I waited for my friend R to return from town with an ounce of marajuana for our consumption that night. I looked forward to it with relative anticipation as I had not smoked for about a week, and not in that quantity for some time longer. The evening was to be relaxed as we planned to venture to nearby lakes to consume the cannabis.</p><p>As I waited the doorbell rang, and it was my other friend J who told me he was the only person at home guarding a rather extensive selection of his mum's liquor. I decided that a drink would be the ideal start to the evening and texted R to tell him I was making the short journey to J's house, also in our suburb. On the way up to J's house it became clear he was already rather tipsy, and he told me he had had two drinks.</p><p>This seems an appropriate moment to point out that I am recounting this tale with hindsight, the event occured when I, J and R were all 14, we are now 17. Henceforth we were unaware of the dangers of excessive consumption of alcohol - and especially the dangers of mixing ANY types of alcohol, let alone large quantities of spirits.</p><p>After a short walk we reached J's house. He took me into his back room and proceeded to pour me a drink he had invented that night, taking a standard sized scotch glass he poured in around 2 shots worth of Gordon's Gin, approx. one shot's worth of a 65% mexican liquor (the name of which escapes me) and proceeded to 'dilute' this with some 15% vino. After one sip I knew it was horrible, and threw it down my neck as fast as possible. I then made my own drink, slightly varying the ingredients...I had more gin than before, added some whiskey and topped this up with ouzo (a greek aniseed flavoured drink). After drinking like this for 10 minutes we quickly became very inebriated (as one would expect). It was then that J made a decision that could potentially have saved our lives...he rang his girlfriend S to see if she could come over. After another round of drinks, which were now starting to taste wonderful, J entered with paracetamol - in our 'wisdom' we decided it would be fun to flaunt the 'not with alcohol' restrictions on the packet and took 4 each.</p><p>This is where the night took a turn for the worse. For 5minutes after the paracetamol it bacame clear we were VERY DRUNK. I can remember falling over and laughing, me and J sang at the top of our voices to the CD which was now playing at ludicrous volume and another couple of quick rounds of drinks ensued. I remember feeling extemely giddy and happy, it was a pleasurable feeling - comparable almost to the love buzz of taking MDMA, although obviously not QUITE as intense as that. I was unable to stop laughing and so was J. However after that as the full extent of the alcohol diffused into my blood, I remember about 10 minutes TOTAL memory, in little flashes, from here (around 7PM) to next morning around 6AM. Hence the following is an acount pieced together from the reports of S and my family.</p><p>S arrived and I then said we should make a trip to the local Mc Donalds to get some food. We left the house and headed down the street, apparantly J and I were being very loud and staggering all over the place. Then we had to walk up a 12-set of steps. Although I remember none of this it appears that I was leading the way, and behind me J fell, forwards, up the stairs. As I turned and tried to pull him up I only succeeded in pulling myself down, and I fell to the bottom. It became clear that J needed to go home as the alcohol had hit both of us hard, especially him as he was unable to get up. We carried him home, where his family were in and he received a subsequent berating, although I cannot remember any of it! As I was inexperienced with alcohol (certainly in this quantity) I decided it would be a good idea to go to McDonalds to get some food and hopefully sober up, so as not to arouse the suspicion of my parents. Apparantly on the walk we were asked by an old lady if S and I could help with her shopping. Being a conscientious and caring person I was shocked when S told me two days after the ordeal I had abruptly declined by telling her to 'fuck off and do it herself'.</p><p>We reached McDonalds where S realised that I would probably say something to the staff there and wisely told me to wait outside. I remember absolutely nothing from this part, although I was told I proceeded to swing, gorillla style on the bar of the drive thru (that prevents tall vehicles entering) Amazingly no-one rang the police, I think anyway...</p><p>I do then remember starting to experience something I had never felt before with alcohol or anytime, my whole body felt as though it was FULL of sick. I was extremely nauseous and was hardly able to stand. I truly believed I may be about to die. It was then that we decided to make the short walk away from civilisation, to the lakes, so I would not get us arrested. My last memory of the night is walking down the path forcing myself to eat chips...I woke up in my room, which stank of sick - despite the open window.</p><p>It transpired that S had practically carried me home, although I had manged to get into bed myself. I lay there vomiting, and as I was laid on my back this was potentially fatal. Thankfully my sister entered the room to ask if she could borrow a CD of mine. She got my mum, who apparantly stayed up with me all night as I threw my guts up. I was obviously hungover all day next day. My head felt like it weighed a tonne and I couldn't stop being sick. Gutfulls of green bile coming up....</p><p>However I believe the aftereffects far out-lasted the immediate hangover. Both J and I were almost sick at the smell of alcohol for literally a month afterwards. Even when we could bring ourselves to drink, we found our tolerance to alcohol had fallen to less than half of what it was previously - getting drunk off a few cans of lager etc. With hindsight I view this as a valuable experience in my development as a human being, as that night, I truly hit rock bottom and now thoroughly enjoy going out and getting pissed - with a stronger tolerance to alcohol than most of my friends.</p>",
