  "<p>I smoked some of this stuff combined/rolled in tobacco, moistening it in my hands to make it sticky (like hash oil or oily hash or very similar) and felt something. Head rush, spaced out... all for a very short time. Nothing 'psychedelic' in my opinion.",
  "Also very hard on the stomach, yes stomach (nausea) when smoked. Although it wasn't terrible, the nausea lasted about as long as the other effects I felt from the mucuna.",
  "is this worth it? probably, just not to smoke.</p>"
