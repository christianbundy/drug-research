  "For myself and friends who are very very very very big users of ketamine the only things that can help stopping those stomach pain and urinary problems are:",
  "- Drinking a lot of water to prevent dehydration and help urinary problems",
  "- Hot baths for stomach pain can help",
  "- Drinking hot water with sugar or with a little bit of baking soda",
  "- Dycholium 300mg pills (Pills sold in drugstore) they really help me when this horrible stomach pain is coming. I'll take 1 or 2 and then 10-15 minutes after the pain is gone. Not working for everybody.",
  "I wish this can help somebody somewhere because this kind of pain is really not fun and I know what I'm talking about....",
  "[Reported Dose:\tDaily abusive usage for about 2-3 years]"
