 "report": "<p>It's deeply frustrating that genuine LSD is kind of rare in this day and age, at least where I'm from.  I had been asking my friends about it for a few months, and it wasn't until pretty recently that I stumbled upon 2CI-NBOMe, or 'N-Bomb,' as we call it around here now. </p><p>The first time I took N-Bomb, it was dropped on a goldfish cracker and the girl sold it to me as acid.  She said, 'Now the way you take these is you hold it between your gum and lower lip like dip.'  I thought she was crazy because I knew LSD could just be swallowed normally.  But, being the good listener that I was I placed the goldfish in my mouth the way she told me to for about five minutes and then got bored, chewing it up and swallowing it.  I knew something must've been on that goldfish because it tasted bitter and for the rest of the day I felt weird (aside from the weed I'd been smoking), as if something was creeping into my brain but never got the chance to take hold. </p><p>The next time I ran into 2CI-NBOMe was some months later at one of my friend Tyler's parties.  Tyler's friend Justin texted him beforehand and asked him if he wanted to buy 'acid.'  Tyler didn't feel like it but I sure as hell did so I told him to get Justin to sell it to me once he arrived at the party.  Long story short, I became suspicious of the chemical that was actually on this mysterious little blotter Justin handed me and I got him to admit that it wasn't acid but N-Bomb instead. It's funny because I would've been totally fine with this but the fact that he lied really bugged me.  That's dealers for you I guess.  Anyways I took the blotter sublingually like you're supposed to with N-Bomb because it isn't orally active and I tripped out a little bit.  Colors got enhanced so the night sky was a deep royal blue instead of black, Tyler's white countertops turned greenish with faint patterns all over them, and people's faces looked weirder than a night of smoking weed and drinking beer would normally make them look.  All in all, it was a great night. </p><p>My final and only real experience with 2CI-NBOMe came a few days after the party I just mentioned.  With the help of my friend Dan I found the original source of the N-Bomb that had started to go around.  My friend Alex and I each got two tabs from the guy, which were on larger pieces of blotter paper and as we'd soon find out, double-dipped.  Not even my two previous DMT trips could've prepared me for the brain rapage I was about to receive.  Alex and I jammed our two blotters under our tongues as soon as we got back to his house, which was at about 1:40 in the morning.  Around 2:00 I started feeling really uneasy and nauseous so thinking I was going to puke all over his room, Alex kicked me and our friend Nathan (who was with us this whole time and stayed sober) out of his house and told us to walk home...in the dark.  I puked a little ways down the gravel road from his house, and this is where my brain turned into a bowl of noodles.  The gravel road we were walking down felt extremely unstable, as if I was stepping on an asteroid belt hovering in space.  I was holding Nathan's arm the whole way home with my eyes squeezed shut, so visually I missed the first fourty minutes of the trip.  I was so blasted that without Nathan to guide the way back I probably would've collapsed in the middle of the road and broke down in tears. </p><p>When we finally reached my house I had Nathan stay with me in my basement for a little while to make sure I got settled in for the night.  The basement looked so weird.  Everything was glittering with little sparkles and rainbows and the walls, floor, and ceiling were breathing.  Nathan's body was distorted to the point where he didn't even appear human anymore.  I was tripping so hard that even after he left I continued talking to him as if he was right there next to me on the couch.  Eventually I gathered the courage to get up and walk to my bedroom because I thought I should try to get some sleep.  That did not work.  I stayed up all night long sitting in my bed staring at the rest of my room as it morphed around like a lava lamp.  Alex called me a couple times throughout the night whispering that he was tripping balls and thought his black cat was a bear. As I talked to him in jibberish my phone would feel like it was sinking slowly into the side of my head.  At one point my phone died and I had a lot of trouble getting it plugged in to charge because the cord was writhing around in my hands like a snake and I couldn't get it to hold still.  Sometimes I'd stand up on my bed and walk in circles for no apparent reason, then sit back down and burrow into my covers. </p><p>I puked a couple more times that night into my bathtub because I had forgotten how to lift the lid of my toilet.  After what seemed like an endless night the sun started to come up and I looked out the window into my backyard for a little while.  It was pretty cool because the grass looked like it had been drawn with pastel.  I went back to my room shortly after this and finally got some sleep.  I woke up around 10:00, barely tripping anymore but feeling like my brain had been completely scrambled.  It wasn't until noon that I felt completely normal again.  That pretty much wraps up my craziest experience with N-Bomb.  I know Alex and I will be doing it again sometime soon.  What I've learned from this is that you absolutely cannot underestimate this type of drug.  If you do it'll kick your ass.  Also make sure you're in a good setting and won't have to walk home during the middle of the night.  Oh, and I almost forgot, if someone sells you blotters that are supposed to have acid on them, stick them under your tongue, because you never know what you're getting these days and dosing sublingually is the only way you can know for sure that you'll trip.</p>",
