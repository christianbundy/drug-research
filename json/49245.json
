 "report": "<p>At one point in my life I was taking 6-8mg of Xanax daily for nearly a month.  This was partly a psychological addiction on my part, but what I want to focus on is the physical withdrawal symptoms.  Withdrawal for me involved, no sleep, nightmares, constant nausea, pain, mental agony, major sinus problems.  In other words, a living hell.</p><p>Would I do this drug again?  Yes, but I will never get physically addicted again.  Even though I had the mental strength to stop, it is so incredibly painful and dangerous I would not repeat it ever.</p><p>Experience at 6mg:</p><p>T+0:00</p><p>Pop 3 2mg pills. </p><p>T+0:30</p><p>Feel very 'out-of-it', drunken euphoria, little nausea, all cares and worries go away.</p><p>T+1:00</p><p>Get hungry, my sinuses are cleared up, I like just hanging out watching TV.</p><p>T+1:30</p><p>My ability to store memories is practically gone.  I have no inhabitations.  I fall off a bike and cut myself, but am completely numb to pain.</p><p>T+2:00</p><p>It's a fairly sedate and restful feeling also.  The feeling is not euphoria per say, but a permeating numbness.</p>",
