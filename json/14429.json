 "report": [
  "I was having a pretty good day.  I was with my kids that day and my gradmother.  We went for a long walk.  I had taken my 0.5 mg of xanax all day long.  I was supposed to only take 1 tablet 4 times a day.  I ended up getting the prescription filled on the 24th of March and by the time that the 30th of March came around I had already taken 66 pills.  I was prescribed this medicine by my Psychiatrist who knew that I was a recovering addict and also an alcoholic.  But I was immediatley given the medicine and at a strange dose.  I was also having trouble sleeping so I would generally take them at night to sleep.  Sometimes I would combo with Soma.",
  "Well the night of March 31, 2003 it was only about 9:30 or 10pm.  (I really can't remember)  My mom and I were talking on the phone and she said that I sounded like I was completely drunk.  I was slurring my words.  In that amount of time that I was on the phone even a half an hour before that I had already taken 5 mg of xanax (who knows I lost count after 5) and then I took about 8 350mg Soma.  I was so out of it.",
  "So I was mad at my mom for saying that to me.  To me I was high and ok.  But not to her.  She said that she was coming up.  I hung up on her.  I don't really remember much after that except that my daughter was sleeping in her bed and my son was on the floor sleeping mext to me...(that is what I was told)..I couldn't believe the things that I was told that I said and did.  My mom and my sister (12) showed up and luckily I did not lock my door that night.  They took a cab up and came in to see if I was ok.  I was not.  I was on the living room floor almost barely breathing.  I did not respond even after my mom screaming at the top of her lungs and pounding me on the back to wake me up.  I didn't hear or see or remember much.  I remember flashes of lights from the ambulance.  I couldn't hear any voices.  I couldn't really see any people either.  The ER was an experience.  I had to drink that damn charcol too.  YUK!!!  But it helped me.  I kept passing out. ",
  "I got to the ER they said about 11pm and I didn't get released until 5:30am.  I would never want to ever go through that experience.  If it wern't for my mom coming there I would be dead.  I couldn't urinate at the hospital because my muscles were so spazzed out from the Soma and my kidneys were so painful.  They put a catheter so to force me to pee.  It was so awful.  And not so much as I wish that I had never done that to myself.  I wish that my kids were not seeing me like that and I wish that I had the F*****g sense enough to not do that to them.  Never do that to your kids.  They are what you should be living for.  They look to you for guidance and reassurance.  And for me that was the most terrible thing to do to them.  Their mom almost died on the floor in front of them.  You don't do that to a 3 1/2 year old or a 2 1/2 year old.  I am getting better.  I take it one day at a time.  I am a recovering addict and I will tell you all from experience that don't mess with any pills.  No matter what. ",
  "I work as a Pharmacy Technician and I have been one for 3+years.  I knew all about these meds, what they did to the body ....and I never thought that it could happen to me."
