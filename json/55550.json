  "<p>Lavender, there is much to say about it. It's use has been recorded and used throughout history as far back as biblical days. It has a relaxing feel to it. No matter if I sniff the oil as aromatherapy, or smoke the herb itself, which is what I have been doing lately.",
  "Ok so I smoke the english lavender like smoking weed and amazingly it is relaxing. It gives a clear high, similar to weed. The more I smoke, the higher I get, just like with weed. I'm not saying that it is a substitute for weed, but it does feel great, at least to me anyway. I have just smoked the leaves, not the flowers. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The effects last about 20-50 mins. depending on how much I smoke.</p>"
