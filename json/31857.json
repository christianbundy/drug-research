 "report": "<p>A few months ago, I was put on Paxil CR for general anxiety disorder. For the first few months, it had no effect on me. About 3 months after taking it, I started to notice a change. I don't feel anxious like I used to, I used to be very shy, afraid of being in public, now I almost feel outgoing. It's been a great change for me.</p><p>However, this doesnt come without a cost. I notice wavy lines in my vision now, especially an hour or two after I take it. It's no big deal, but it's noticeable, and now getting annoying. Paxil also gives me headaches, so I have to take ibuprofen a couple times a day, which I dont like to do. Paxil also has taken away much of my sex drive, and my ability to orgasm. Even though the side effects are getting to me now, I dont want to go off, I feel irritable if I dont have my daily dose. I also like the change it has done for me.</p><p>Despite the ill side effects, it has done me a lot of good.</p>",
