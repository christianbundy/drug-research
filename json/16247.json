 "report": [
  "Well I ordered this product from an online vendor.  At first I was skeptical because I didnt understand how any substance could make me dream more...",
  "At first I tried tea.  I cannot describe how disgusting it is! Not recommended.  I bought 500 gelcaps from an online site.  (less than 10 dollars not a bad investment) Anyway the first night I took 4 capsules of the herb stuffed into the capsule. ",
  "I had very clear and vivid dreams.  One of my dreams I remembered for the rest of the day!  It was pretty awesome.  It was like tidal waves of dreams washing over me for the whole night, one after another.  The dreams were neutral to pleasant, no bad dreams.  It was almost as if I was living while I was asleep.   No groggines or hangover felt in the morning.",
  "I tried this once again with only 2 capsules.  The results were the same but less intense.  Still notable.  I would say this substance is definately noteworthy.  It didn't give me any euphoria or much of an altered state but It is fun to experiment with."
