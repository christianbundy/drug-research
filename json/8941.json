 "report": [
  "I recently decided to try Morning Glories, hoping to achieve a psychedelic experience similar to those reported by LSD, mushroom, and mescaline users.  I went to the local Wal-Mart, purchased four packs of Morning Glory seeds which contained 1.5 g each, went home, pounded the seeds with a hammer to break the shells, poured the crushed seeds into a glass of milk, and drank, at approximately 1:30 pm.  I then returned to normal activities about the house, and waited for the seeds to take effect.",
  "At around 3:00 pm, I began to feel tired and vaguely happy, for no discernable reason.  These feeling remained throughout the day.  I was slightly disappointed that I experienced no psychedelic effects, especially since the dose I took was deemed to be between medium and strong, and these psychedelic effects were supposed to be fairly pronounced.  Nonetheless, I was very pleased with my experience, and will most likely pursue it again, as I was able to achieve mild euphoria without any noticeable impairment in my capabilities to perform normal tasks, and noticed no decrease in mental capabilities.",
  "Here is a list of effects that I felt:",
  "\tMild euphoria for a prolonged period of time (from about 3:00 pm to 12:00 am.). This was accompanied by increased appreciation of humor, and increased interest in matters that I normally find banal.",
  "\tRelaxation and tiredness.",
  "\tSlight increase in abnormal thinking.",
  "\tSlight increase in talkativeness.",
  "\tMild nausea at the beginning (cured by one sip of Pepto Bismal), mild headache (cured by two Aspirin pills)."
