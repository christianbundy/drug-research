  "Last week four friends and I were in a local store when one buddy brought up the fact that he had read that catnip could get you high.  Whatever, we thought, it was worth a try for a price of $2.39 per half ounce (don't we all wish weed costed this much?).  So we bought the bag and walked to a nearby park where the four of us sat in a circle and my friend W proceeded to pack a fat bowl of the stuff.  We passed the bowl around and were surprised that the burning catnip smelled almost reminiscent to pot.  The smoke had a more 'sharp' feeling to it than marijuana and also had a bit of an unsettling flavour.  After smoking 5 bowls we stood up and began to walk home.  Upon standing I could definately notice a marijuana-like sedated buzz, but it was almost too weak to identify.  The motions of my eyes seemed to be a bit behind the motions of my head, my limbs felt slightly heavy and all-in-all I felt quite relaxed.  Upon returning home I noticed that I felt even more docile, like all I wanted to do was relax.",
  " The catnip high was far from strong, but it was definately worth trying and costed almost nothing."
