 "report": [
  "I had first tried mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) a couple of times (taken with several weeks downtime between doses) in oral amounts of 200 mg taken in a capsule. While it was enjoyable, it seemed somewhat like MDMA-lite. I had heard of people who said they were compelled to re-dose on it, but such people were usually snorting the material (which is said to be fairly painful).",
  "Then a friend and I each had an oral dose of 225-250 mg (I forget for sure, I just recall that we upped the dose), and we were both surprised to find it substantially more euphoric, with waves of good feeling. An oral supplement dose taken a few hours later of around the same amount also produced strong waves of euphoria, although perhaps a bit less than the first time.",
  "Since then we each had one more 'double dose' experience that wasn't much to write home about, at a lowered dose (maybe 200-225 each dose); it was fun, but without the waves of euphoria. Like when the magic leaves from MDMA after one has done it too many times.",
  "Then we tried snorting 100 mg, which is a lot of material, and it burns and feels a bit peppery too. I got high, but wasn't blown away. My partner, Meatbag, got very strong rapidly commencing euphoric effects, but they wore down to run-of-the-mill joy pretty quickly. We redosed with a 200 mg oral, and that never brought back strong euphoria, but a lingering good feeling hung around longer. We weren't really compelled to redose; we just wanted to evaluate this approach since so many people report it as having value.",
  "Now with methedrone (4-methoxymethcathinone), for me, the situation is different. Both times I have taken 200 mg orally in a capsule without having eaten anything previously, and remembering to drink adequate liquids. The effects come on noticeably but light. It is sort of like a low dose of MDMA. However, I actually don't feel like talking to other people, so for me it doesn't seem that much of a social drug. It inspired me to get some work done in my garden which required a trip to a Home Depot. I had no trouble riding my motorcycle for the 40-minute round trip, but I felt somewhat standoffish when having to deal with the store clerks. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Back at home, I enjoyed the day of planting, but there was a bit of angst forming around the edges. Increasingly, I felt the fast approach of a strong come-down that I could tell was going to leave me substantially lower than the base state I started out the day at. I did not intend to redose, so I got to experience that crappy low, which felt as though it was worse than the mild high I had gotten in exchange.",
  "I tried methedrone once more in a similar use pattern (without redosing), and I very much got the sense that this is a drug that is pretty much BEGGING to be redosed. Because of how uncomfortable the low is from one dose, I am hesitant to want to redose this compound. The high does not seem interesting enough for the low. I doubt that I will revisit this drug anytime in the near future. I don't think that methedrone is a very good replacement for mephedrone; at least not for me."
