 "report": "<p>I have spent around a week without much sleep.  I have been going to sleep about midnight and waking up at anytime between 2am and 4am.  This went on for a week.  I had no dreams, and do not normally.  I finally decided to do something about it and started researching sleep-aids.  I noticed most sleep aids had the same stuff in them, but one I checked out had Valerian Root.  I researched Valerian Root noticed a connection between it and melatonin.  Repeating an experience of another user, I bought a bottle of Valerian root, Melatonin, and Vitamin B-6. </p><p>Night 1: 450mg Valerian; 3mg Melatonin; 100mg B-6.  Easier to go to sleep.  I had dreams for the first time in a long time.  I woke up at about 4am, looked at the clock and fell back asleep! I woke up at about 5am, looked at the clock and fell asleep again!  I continued to dream throughout my sleep.  At 6am my alarm went off and I awoke well rested.  I noticed a significant improvement in my energy levels and my mood had improved greatly.  I did not get tired midway through the day, and was able to work many hours before feeling the slightest fatigue!  at about 5pm, I started feeling *normal*.</p><p>Night 2: 450mg Valerian; 6mg Melatonin; 100mg B-6.  I washed these down with a mountain dew.  (VALERIAN TASTES BAD!!!!).  in spite of the caffeine, I was dead asleep in 10 minutes.  At 7am I woke up, looked at the clock and fell asleep again. I slept until noon (it's saturday).  I feel fully refreshed and the only downside is a minor headache (if I'm busy I dont even notice it though).  I didnt take anything, but I'm sure an excedrin would have made it go away.  it is 7pm and I feel awesome!</p>",
