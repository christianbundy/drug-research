 "report": "<p>I had to begin taking (olanzapine) zyprexa in order to help me withdraw from my fantasies with imaginary friends and wake dreams.  At first I resisted taking it and if i swallowed it I would throw it up later.  But soon I quit this and began taking it.  I noticed a changed preception of life for quite some time as I had been taking the pill for about 4 to 5 months.  I experienced a dreamless life, and a strange sort of, increase and simultaneous decrease in concentration during the daytime.  I kept thinking about my imaginary friends but rather than them disappearing I just suddenly lost fascination and interest in them.  And my emotional dependence on them faded away and for a while I felt empty. </p><p>I started eating uncontrollably.  Before I was diagnosed I was 13 and weighed about 115-120 lbs.  During the next month and a half I gained alot of weight...and lost alot of energy and personality.  By the time my 14 birthday showed up after being on the prescription for about 3 or 4 months I weighed no less than 166 lbs. </p><p>I was taking about 40 mg per day because whenever I failed to take the pill I became extremely sick with flu-like symptoms and eventually I forced myself to quit which was a rocky road of mood swings and distance from my habitual life to where I am now...an overweight, stuttering, nervous change from my original self.</p>",
