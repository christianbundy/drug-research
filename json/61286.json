 "report": "<p>I am relatively experienced with all drugs(save hallucinogens). I have been able to control my use of all the drugs I have used except opiates. I have been addicted to opiates for 7 years now. Because of my addictions I decided to try Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone) to help me with my addiction. It has been a lifesaver! I no longer have the overwhelming desire to use opiates on daily basis.</p><p>However, I have tried to take painkillers like oxycodone and kratom with very little results while on suboxone. I have found a substance that does seem to work while taking suboxone and that is tramadol. For some reason the suboxone does not block the tramadol from working. The high I get from the combination of the two drugs is quite euphoric! I take 8mgs of suboxone in the morning at about 9:00 followed by 200mgs of tramadol 30 minutes later. One hour later I am in heaven!</p><p>The two drugs seem to work so well together. I am taking high doses of each of these drugs so I have a very high tolerance. The high doesn't seem to diminish very much day after day either! The high will last until about 2:00 in the afternoon. At that time I feel a little tired. I usually redose at about 5:00pm with slightly weaker results.</p>",
