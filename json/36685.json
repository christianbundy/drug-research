 "report": "<p>Setting: Quiet night in</p><p>These capsules claim to produce an effect similar to that of magic mushrooms.</p><p>10.00pm</p><p>Took one capsule on an empty stomach. Very heavily under the influence of cannabis.</p><p>10.30pm</p><p>Took two more capsules.</p><p>11.00pm</p><p>Nothing had yet happened. Cannabis consumption continued.</p><p>12.00am</p><p>Still no effects.</p><p>12.30am</p><p>Still no effects. Ceased smoking cannabis.</p><p>01.15am</p><p>Ever so slight trailing(*) of lights.</p><p>01.30am</p><p>Sleepiness set in. Think this was due to the cannabis rather than the capsules</p><p>(*)Trailing, as I mean it, is in the same sense as if someone waves a glowstick past your face when you're on MDMA. Only this was nowhere near as pronounced as it is on MDMA.</p><p>Since that night I tried again with a full dose. I had not been smoking cannabis. They had no effect whatsoever. I do not have sufficient knowledge to propose whether or not there was an interaction between the capsules and the cannabis the first time, or whether cannabis consumption increases/decreases the effects.</p><p>I wouldn't bother buying them again, I can get a fresh portion of shrooms for the same price anyway!</p>",
