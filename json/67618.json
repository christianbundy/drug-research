 "report": "<p>I consumed 12g of Amanita Muscaria which I purchased from the internet in three different ways.</p><p>I ate 4 grams on a bagel with Peanut Butter (it didn't taste that bad but knowing what I was eating reminded me of regular shrooms which made me gag, this made consuming a little easier)</p><p>4 grams in soggy tea with honey</p><p>4 grams capsulated</p><p>I did all of this within minutes of each other.  Very long coming up.  About 2 hours for effects to kick in.</p><p>2 hours after consumption I noticed vision blurry.  Half hour latter I began to sweat and salivate.  Then began hot flashes.  Cold and sweating, then hot and sweating. Then back and forth.  This lasted 3 hours and then the effects started to tapper off.</p><p>No visuals. No disassociated thinking.  No insight.  Not mind expanding.  All this ended up doing was giving me some wicked bad gas hours after consumption and then the whole next day.</p><p>Basically this mushroom is lame, and a waste of time.</p>",
