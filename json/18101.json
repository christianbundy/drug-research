 "report": [
  "I have been using MDPV the past 2-3 weeks, more or less daily, with a dose range of 10 to 30mgs per day. The peevee was the white one which is said to at least contain peevee, but it definitely contains some impurities.",
  "I bought the home drug screen tests for amphetamine and MDMA in order to check the rumor that MDPV causes false positives on these tests.",
  "I drug-tested this morning some two hours after getting out of bed, last MDPV dose was about 16-18 hours ago. The drug test stripes were manufactured by a company called 'gabControl' and i got one 'AMP' test (representing amphetamines [the lady at the drug store thought that 'AMP' is supposed to mean 'ampules' when searching in the online catalogue, hehe]) and one 'MDMA' test (representing MDMA ).",
  "So i went and tested myself and BOTH tests showed TWO clear, red lines meaning the test is NEGATIVE.",
  "Summary:",
  "With the above-mentioned habit of use, testing methods and so on, MDPV does NOT show up in urine. It's giving neither a false-positive for amphetamines nor does it for MDMA.",
  "Assuredness, finally. Great. =)"
