Continuing hints of nervousness and discomfort in the stomach.</p><p>3 days in a row, for a couple hours after taking the prednisone.  On the third day I  waited to take it for several hours after I got up and waited til I'd had a full bowl of soup and it still had the same effect. </p><p>Partner who had taken prednisone recently found herself with mood swings after taking a single 10mg dose of prednisone.</p>",
