 "report": "<p>I had been drinking slowly but surely for a couple hours. My friend showed up with the 'powder' off the internet. I had drank bottles of cough syrup many upon many times, so I asked for a line, I snorted about .7 gm. don't ever try it cuz it burned badly. I ate the rest and I ended up really feeling it about 20 minutes after consumption. I went to meet with my girlfriend at a friends and when I showed up, I collapsed. I don't remember even driving myself or my friend with the dex there. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>I heard a series of beeps before I opened my eyes. I awoke to find out I had stopped breathing long before I reached the hospital. My mom was told 'if he comes out of his coma, he'll most likely have severe brain-damage.' Luckily I was only in a coma 3 days and fine after full recovery. I haven't done 'ROBO' since!</p>",
