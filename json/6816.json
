 "report": "<p>\nAmbien in itself is an extremely interesting drug and it usually takes 15-30 minutes to feel the effects. I had used Ambien on several previous occasions before deciding to combine it with cannabis.</p><p>9:00 pm: I take 10 mg Ambien</p><p>9:15 : Feeling slightly confused and euphoric</p><p>9:30 : The effects of the ambien have fully manifested and it is hard to concentrate. I feel moderately drunk, my motor skills are inhibited and I lose my balance several times on my way to the bong. I proceed to smoke two bowls of marijuana.</p><p>9:45 : I am completely zonked and I snap in and out of vivid dream- like states. I feel that I am not alone and that there are people talking to me. Ambien usually trips me out like that but the cannabis makes the hallucinations all the more real.</p><p>10:15 : The Ambien effects are not as strong now but still definitely have a prescence.</p><p>10:00 : At this time I am quite drowsy and lethargic. I think of going to bed but I forget to do so.</p><p>10:45 : I can no longer stay awake and doze off.</p><p>11:15 : I wake up dazed and confused feeling very drowsy but high.</p><p>I decide to return to bed.</p><p>In retrospect I found the trip very odd and interesting. The feeling of the presence of people was so real that i actually beleived that there were people around me, talking to me. Ambien, an extremely weird drug anyways, was intensified by the ganja.</p><p>I enjoyed the experience and would do it again. For those who want to experience this combination i would recommend experimenting with ambien by itself first. Ambien, although odd as hell, is definitely worth a try.</p>",
