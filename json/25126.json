 "report": "<p>It all started on a school night, ya a school night. i was in grade 10 at the time and was in a big drug experiment phase. i had done shrooms a few days before and was doing them like every week so i thought i would be fine...i was wrong.</p><p>I had only got drunk on a school night, never shroomed so i decided to. hey...i had the resources. at around 10 my brother and I prepared the room for maximum trippage, always get a full outcome from what you buy.  we set up his tv with a PS1, then grabbed my strobe light and my black light.</p><p>At around 10:15 we ate them.</p><p>I started to feel if at like 11:30 while playing some Sega Tennis cause the ball started to streak and i couldnt focus.  about 10 mins after that my brother turned it off and we put in our trip CD with some Bone Thugs N Harmony and techo and trip songs into the PS1 and sat back and enjoyed the show for a bit.</p><p>after a bit of staring mindlessly at the screen we turned the strobe light on and that somehow brought all of what was on the screen onto the walls, i danced around in colours that i cant explain. during this we had a very deep conversaion about life n stuff like that, senses, gravity everything that is wierd. i turned on the black light (about 2 hours 15 mins after eating) and this made the conversation deeper n deeper, i remeber only seeing my brothers white shirt n white socks and nothin in the middle...it was wierd.</p><p>about 2:30 into the experience we were having fun so my brother cranked out a half gram of coke that we split...IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE.  and when i say downhill...i mean i was on a hill that peaked in heaven (where i was at the time) and bottomed in hell (where i was after the yayo).  i bucked my 1/4 gram rail and so did my brother and we went and sat down on the bed and strobed it up with the light.</p><p>After about 30 mins after the coke i started to feel sick. i remember turning around and staring out a huge window onto the ocean and then breathing fresh air and i felt the coldness from outside tho no window was open. I kept saying i fell sick...i feel sick...but my brother was fine. The coke made the shrooms like taking 2x as much in dosage..it was like i did 10 grams of shrooms to me...i could not focus on anything and everything echoed and had a stream behind it...i remember the song at the time..it was Devon the Dude : Doobie Ashtray...to this day i can't listen to it.</p><p>i left to go to my room and then was suddenly lying in my bed.  this is where it gets foggy and hard to remember but ill try.  My brother was calling 'are you ok' through the wall and i kept yelling ya ya..but i dont think he could here me..i dont think i said anything...my heart was beating a million times a minute and i thought i was going to die cause i had no clue what shroom and coke where like while mixed. </p><p>the walls where bending inward to me. i got up to go pee ( i had to pee a lot that night ) and fell on the floor.  when i looked up people were pointing and laughing at me...tall people in retro colors. then i closed my eyes but when i did this it only opened them to a new room full of pools and waterfalls...i opened them and the people where gone.</p><p>I heard a scratchin at the door so i crawled over to it and opened it and my cat ran in.  this scared me and i fell back to a sitting position against the wall and look at the cat.  then the cat said something to me ill never forget 'YOU GOING TO DIE'.  this scared me sooo much cause i saw it in the movie 'GO' a week later.</p><p>i somehow got in my bed and was lying there sooo sick.  my heart was going soo fast so i mentally thought of time and how to slow it and everything actually slowed down my heart slowed..i no this casue i could hear it...i threw a pillow in the air and it was seriously in slow motion.  even the music that i dont remember putting on was slowing down. then everything sped up again and was fast..i kept slowing it down casue it helped my heart beat...all this time there was a strange noise..like a steal factory poundin in my head that wouldnt stop.</p><p>i eventually passed out (it all lasted about 5 hours i think...but i dont know) and woke up in the morning.  i told my dad i was sick with the flu and missed school.  at about 1 i got a call from my friend Jonah who got sent home because he did shrooms and coke that day at school and passed out in A block and had a seizure.</p><p>DONT MIX THOSE 2 DRUGS...BAD COMBINATION</p>",
