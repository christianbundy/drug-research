 "substance": "alpha-PVP (alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone) ",
 "bodyweight": "170 lb",
 "report": "<p>a-PVP came from Poland as off-white (almost brownish) powder. An small amount on my tongue proved the chemical to be an intense numbing agent with a sharp sour taste. Neither was pleasant.</p><p>A 2mg line was insufflated. Within 10 minutes my heart was beating a little faster and I had more energy.</p><p>Within 15 minutes I wondered where the euphoria I know and love is but remembered this wasn't MDPV. 20 minutes in the euphoria was somewhat there but definitely not balancing the anxiety and tachycardia (high heart rate) the drug was causing.</p><p>I redosed at the 30 minute mark. Another 2-5mg insufflated. A little more euphoria and slight sexual urges but nowhere near MDPV, and the rapid heart rate was so bad I couldn't enjoy the little positive effects this drug has.</p><p>Insufflated, the drug smelled very much like sperm. I highly doubt one would be able to discern whether they are insufflating sperm or a solution of starch and a-PVP.</p><p>Like MDPV, a-PVP can be branded as Tachycardia XR or Anxiety XR. Not worth my time when wonder drugs like 4-Fluoroamphetamine exist.</p>",
