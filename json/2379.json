 "report": "<p>Pill Description</p><p>----------------</p><p>8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.</p><p>Above score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I</p><p>guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that</p><p>non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]</p><p>1:50AM</p><p>------</p><p>I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT</p><p>earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real</p><p>snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked</p><p>a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or</p><p>less at baseline.</p><p>2:20AM</p><p>------</p><p>I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had</p><p>any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main</p><p>distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and</p><p>intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as</p><p>comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely</p><p>not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar</p><p>to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being</p><p>the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about</p><p>an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe</p><p>it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is</p><p>more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The</p><p>physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a</p><p>feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like</p><p>tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam</p><p>experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its</p><p>just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.</p><p>2:50AM</p><p>------</p><p>Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho</p><p>from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.</p><p>And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak</p><p>effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good</p><p>deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original</p><p>assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some</p><p>ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation</p><p>is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally</p><p>relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge</p><p>to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.</p><p>As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the</p><p>euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual</p><p>effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more</p><p>subdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much</p><p>more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie</p><p>down and just relax and absorb the music.</p><p>3:10AM</p><p>------</p><p>I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be</p><p>more of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just</p><p>listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot</p><p>less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.</p><p>This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be</p><p>easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out</p><p>that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically</p><p>increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel</p><p>very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to</p><p>GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk</p><p>around, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger</p><p>doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather</p><p>due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a</p><p>little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal</p><p>earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None</p><p>of my muscles seem to have any tension.</p><p>3:25AM</p><p>------</p><p>Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not</p><p>really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or</p><p>T+1:45.</p><p>3:35AM</p><p>------</p><p>I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this</p><p>snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy</p><p>cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.</p><p>Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...</p><p>though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering</p><p>the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last</p><p>opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another</p><p>hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good</p><p>luck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,</p><p>then describe it.</p><p>3:50AM</p><p>------</p><p>T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now</p><p>strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed</p><p>earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from</p><p>alcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But</p><p>this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far</p><p>fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no</p><p>feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,</p><p>just a drastic slowing of pace.</p><p>4:20AM</p><p>------</p><p>I take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this</p><p>report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and</p><p>how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be</p><p>as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot</p><p>less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than</p><p>anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much</p><p>less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd</p><p>like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party</p><p>drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find</p><p>them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to</p><p>seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm</p><p>sure I will sleep well tonight!</p>",
