 "report": [
  "<p>I was lucky enough to be gifted a couple of grams of synthetic Vinpocetine, very pure 99%+ fine white powder, tastes quite bitter, doesn't dissolve in water.",
  "Tried it a few times at varying doses, it didn't dissolve in water so I mainly snorted it as it was fine powder already. No stimulant effects or anything but it definitely makes me feel more alert and focused, very easy to work on.",
  "Need a dose of maybe 20mg to feel anything, then 50mg is quite a good dose, but 100mg I can sometimes start to get a headache and the effects don't really get any stronger.",
  "I would rate this as one of the better nootropics I've tried, the effects were subtle as with all nootropics but definitely noticeable. Probably wouldn't pay the ridiculous prices I've seen it sold for, but for free it was great.</p>"
