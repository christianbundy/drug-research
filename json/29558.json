 "report": "<p>After reading about DMAE I was excited to try this substance. I had read about its capacity to improve mood, decrease desire to sleep and increase concentration and focus. I have been taking 100mg per day for nearly 1 month now and am yet to notice any effects. My sleep pattern has not changed, nor has my ability to focus and concentrate.</p><p>All I can report is that when I have taken 2 tablets I have at some point in the day noticed 'tremor-like' pain coming from my heart (!) which I find disturbing. I have read that it takes several weeks to build up in the system so I will continue to take 1 tablet a day for a few more weeks - but do not expect anything to occur.</p>",
