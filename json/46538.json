 "report": "<p>I was at my house on a Saturday night and watched people trip hard on mushrooms. My buddies have bought a quarter bag of Shrooms and divided up into 3 piles, which was about 2.0-2.5 grams for the three of them. As I watch this person tripped, shadows and various objects begin to appear in his face as he told me. Within an hour into it, he looks okay and very conscious but when he peaked it was a whole other story. As he walked out my bedroom door, he collapsed and started shaking uncontrollably. His ody looked like a ghost and it seemed he didn't have a soul. (The other two that were tripping freaked out and started crying but believe it or not, its a scary thing to watch.) So when he black-outed... we dragged him into the shower and sprayed ice cold water on to him</p><p>so if you ever see someone black on Shrooms.</p><p>DRAG THERE ASS IN THE SHOWER!</p><p>Or back out the mirror...</p><p>Peace</p><p>Peace</p>",
