 "report": "<p>Hello all,</p><p>Just wanted to express my disappointment when I heard that this substance was starting to be banned across the globe.</p><p>I have used Methoxetamine in a controlled environment and would like to confirm, that with the right dosage, it can do wonders for my mental illness.</p><p>I am Manic-Depressive ('Bi-Polar Disorder'), and with this illness I became anxious around people, couldn't concentrate in school, depressed and couldn't get out of bed... The list goes on.</p><p>I was on Cymbalta, but still, things were hard. When Methoxeatamine, or MXE, came into my life - I began to soar!</p><p>My brain felt clear, I could read, write, draw, play, the way I used to as a child.</p><p>Honestly, this chemical needs to be brought into research. It's been a blessing on my life, and got me right where I've always wanted to be, happy, strong, confident, attentive, calm, and productive.</p><p>This chemical needs the right attention.</p><p>It needs the right respect as well.</p><p>I think it's becoming illegal because of the individuals that misused it, not because it's a dangerous thing, and I believe Methoxetamine has the power to change the medical world, and it could be used for very good purposes. I hope, so deeply, that the Government doesn't just 'shut it out'.</p>",
