 "report": "<p>This is my first experience with Codeine and it will be my only. In the past I have taken Morphine, Hydrocodone, and Acetaminophen with no ill effect. </p><p>I took a cap-full of Codeine/Acetaminophen syrup on an empty stomach. I had not eaten for several hours. Around 20 minutes later, while laying in my bed, my stomach began making ferocious gargling noises. Fearing soiling my bed and clothes, I ran to the bathroom where I was in a state of continuous watery defecation for 10 minutes. After this experience, my entire body was sore and weak. I also drank a gallon of water to ensure I did not dehydrate, and ate some bread. I felt a little buzz after eating and drinking, but not even the codeine could not cover how sore my body was.</p><p>This couldn't be normal as opiates are supposed to cause constipation: they have for me in the past. It could have possibly been an allergic reaction, but I am not sure if it was to the codeine or something in the syrup. What ever it was, I'll never touch it again.</p>"
