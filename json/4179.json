 "report": [
  "I will try and keep this as cut and dry as possible so you can see how fast you can hooked on a substance, even a diet pill. I am already a skinny guy so maybe that influenced my reaction.",
  "The following took place over 6 weeks.",
  "A friend of mine started taking Ephedrine to lose weight. Having read about Ephedrine being an Amphetamine-like substance, I tried a few of the pills just to see how it would make me feel.",
  "It gave me a nice mellow euphoria and lots of energy, so I picked up a bottle of 60 pills and started taking it before I would hit the clubs. It would give me more energy and it gives a much stronger euphoria when mixed with alcohol.",
  "I am an above full time college student so I usually do a LOT of homework on the weekends. I popped an Ephedrine one morning before writing a paper and I found it much easier to think and I completed the work much more quickly than normal.",
  "I then started popping Ephedrine in the morning right before I headed to classes. I would then take another in the mid day and another later at night if I had a lot of homework.",
  "So at this point I was on Ephedrine 24/7. I started taking in the mornings even when I didn't have class. When I drank I went from popping one Ephedrine to popping four. It killed my appetite so I had to force myself to eat twice a day.",
  "I ran out of the first bottle of 60 pills the day I had to study for a test and I freaked out, racing to the store to buy more. I was terrified of even trying to study without it.",
  "Then a few weeks ago I got the flu that has been going around. I didn't take an Ephedrine for 4 days while my body healed. Finally when I was feeling well I popped one, immediately I felt a sense of well being and that I was truly ready to start the day. At this point I was thinking I should probably stop, I put that off for about a week though.",
  "Today I decided to go today without taking any, but trying to pay attention in class without it I felt something was missing, I really felt off. So I popped one. Something was different this time though; I felt a profound sense of dread, like any minute I was going to die. I also got slightly paranoid in class and was sharp with everyone, on the verge of being very rude.",
  "I was so out of it I felt any minute I might have a heart attack, or just snap and go nuts. I have my fair share of experience with bad trips on hard drugs and this felt like the beginning anxiety of a bad trip.",
  "Finally class was over and I went to the bathroom and threw the rest of the bottle in the trash.",
  "In moderation Ephedrine might help you study, or party, but please keep it to a weekend thing. I don't think I will ever take this stuff again, it's not worth it and I think half of the feeling of being able to study better is psychological anyway. I will stick to plain old coffee for late night study sessions now."
