 "report": "<p>I have been taking a regimen of:</p><p>1600 mg/day Piracetam</p><p>4.5 mg/day Hydergine</p><p>250 mg/day Lucidril</p><p>for approx 3 months time now.</p><p>For lack of better control mechanisms, I have been using several software packages, including a database of several old GMAT CAT examinations(THE GMAT Verbal section is gerenally regarded as a measure of intellectual ability), and a memory recall speed and efficiency package.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of the percentage change in scores I have experienced</p><p>Day 0 - 0% Baseline established</p><p>Day 7 - 3% decrease from baseline in GMAT verbal, 2% increase in memory recall speed, 5% increase in memory efficiency</p><p>Day 30 - 5% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 4% increase in memory recall speed, 10% increase in memory efficiency/accuracy</p><p>Day 60 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 1% decrease in memory recall speed, 8% increase in memory recall efficiency</p><p>Day 90 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 19% increase in memory recall speed, 14% increase in memory recall efficiency.</p><p>Granted this is not a very good indication of what effects the drugs actually have, as I am just one person, and I have emotional, occupational, and other factors effecting my life, and hence, my test performance, but I thought that the data I collected may assist others considering a regimen of smart drugs. I will update things in a few more months.</p>",
