  "<p>I consider myself a fairly heavy pot user, but ever since I started using I never got the same happy effects others talked about. I always had a nervous edge to my high. I would always sit there and think fucked up thoughts that made so much sense and were so depressing that they would scare me. 4 weeks ago I finnaly got on paxil. I have had mild-moderate depression most of my life, but I never thought it was enough to need to be treated with an ssri. My mom figured we might as well give it a try and my doctor decided paxil was the one I should take since it has a seditive effect and I have trouble sleeping at night.",
  "I noticed the next day after I took it when I smoked a bowl at lunch at school that the high was just better. I got a very pleasent body buzz and everythign just seemed right. I was so relaxed and happy. THIS is what weed is supposed to be like I thought to my self. And from then on, smoking is always such a positive experiance. It makes me extremely social like only alcohol and E used to do before, and I think no bad thoughts and feel no nervousness. Its great. I finnaly know what its all about after 3 years of smoking and being somewhat dissapointed.</p>"
