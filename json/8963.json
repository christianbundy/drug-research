 "report": [
  "I went to the doctors office a few months ago and stole some lunesta samples out of boredom to try them..when I got home, I took one pill and 5 minutes later I wasnt feeling anything so I took another. The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with an IV in my arm praying that it was a dream. Come to find out, I had taken all of the pills I had which was about 25 mg worth. Not a good experience at all."
