  "[Erowid Note: 72 mgs of Tiagabine is considered a high dose ]",
  "Well it started off there was a hurricane approaching my town, and as always, a hurricane party was initiated. Since we didn't have any substances and the dope man was currently out of commission because of the storm, we turned to a bottle of Gabitril which my friend is prescribed for bi-polar disorder.",
  "All I can say is WOW.",
  "The pills were 12mg each and I immediately popped 4",
  "About an hour later, I was twitching in the backseat of my friends car talking complete gibberish. I thought I was having a seizure.",
  "As we were driving I was completely oblivious to everything that was going on around me. My brain knew what I wanted to say, but whenever I opened my mouth all I could say 'Oh, Fuck Yeah!'. My brain felt like silly putty and I was completely annihilated in ways I can't even explain.",
  "When we got back to the house, my stupid ass decided to eat 2 more Gabitrils. Everybody else I was with was taking more too. Next thing I know, it's 12 hours later, the house is completely trashed, Im waking up and still twitching. My friend shit himself, and a couple of the girls urinated in random parts of the house. I was told I had gotten up and ejaculated all over the refrigerator..",
  "All in all, it was fucking insane and kind of awesome at the same time.  The day after the incident, I had an awesome afterglow feeling which made me very content and carefree.  I have vowed to never take Gabitril again, as it is a very evil drug indeed."
