  "My buddy received his shipment in the mail last week from a reputable company. It came in a small vile. My friend broke it up.",
  "Took the stuff at about 12:30am by itself w/water felt it at about 1:10am.at first I felt a bit dizzy. Somewhat uncomfortable (I've used many substances before I didn't really care for this stuff) everything was at a kind of a slant. Objects seemed well defined and the ceiling of my apartment hung unusually low, felt a bit off for a couple of hours. I started writing this stuff down on paper and the words seemed to be patterning. my handwriting looked really weird. The paper was breathing between the words.  honestly this sounds kinda cool but Ive experienced ten times this kind of trip with morning glories and even more w/ acid, the overall feeling I had was kind of drunk with a persisting headache (which I did not have before I took this stuff). Went to sleep at about 4:15 am and just woke up at 1:00pm I still have a headache.",
  "In my opinion, this was not worth it."
