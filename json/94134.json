 "report": "<p>Before getting into this Article Id like to tell you about my history with psychoactive substances.</p><p>I smoke cannabis on an almost daily basis for about 10 years now. Before that I regularly abused butane gas at very low age. I guess I was about  11 years old when this happened. This were my first trips and although I never had any bad experience in about 50 times of doing it, I must strictly advise everyone not to do this because of security reasons, it might so easily kill you. So after smoking weed for some years I tried speed, mushrooms, Salvia Divinorum (watch out), MDMA, LSD, Methamphetamine, Methylone, Ethylone, 2C-C , Ethcathinone and finally 5-MEO-Mipt, which this experience is about.</p><p>So my friends and I met at my brothers place because it was very close to the party we wanted to visit. Its kind of a tradition for us to never carry any substances with us but to return to his place several  times in one night and redose, which is always a lot of fun. So we smoked a bit of weed, listened to music and talked. My friend T. only did Methylone and Weed before, but he has quite a strong psyche, so I didnt bather sharing moxy with him, boy was I wrong. My other friend B. tried LSD once and kept vomiting for several hours, not really being able to enjoy her trip. She ate a lot of festival food before this, so we blamed it on her stomach just overreacting. So she gave it another try with hallucinogens. While youre reading this, you might already guess that this night would turn into quite a challenging one.</p><p>I had a bag of 100mg Moxy with me, which I divided in two lines and made a solution from one half and 5 ml water. According to my calculations one drop of the solution contained half a milligram Moxy, so we could dose very accurately. We started with dripping 16 drops (8 mg) on a paper, which was a bad idea. It was soaked entirely with the first drops and I quickly had to add another paper in order not to lose any of the substance. I put the paper in my mouth and kept it there. It tasted bitter and reminded of Methylone. My friends A, B and T took a bit less for their initial dose. After an hour none of us did feel that much.  There was something crawling up, a very light buzz, almost unnoticeable.</p><p>So after 1  hours we thought this method wouldnt work out at all. To be sure I redosed 5 mg on a chewing gum and waited half an hour for effects, still nothing. So for the next try we put some drops in a glass of water. I had 8 drops and T. a little less, about 4 to 6 drops. Within 10 minutes we were in a very good mood, almost speedy.  B. didnt drink the solution, she felt awkward, describing it as her body fighting the substance and an uncomfortable bodyload. I remembered this from my low-dose test of ~1 mg, where I felt the same. My advice to her was to drink 2 mg, just to get over that annoying feeling where you are right below the threshold. She did it and I was like What can two mg possibly do.. boy was I wrong...</p><p>If you read some articles about moxy, common sense is that there are two phases of the trip, one phase of very funny, euphoric speediness and one rather trippy phase.  It should be mentioned that the trippy phase is WAY longer than the euphoric phase. So our drinks were kicking in really well, I felt funny and very distracted, like the best you can get of alcohol without all the negative side effects. I had precise control of my body when dancing around a bit. It felt like my brain now had some extra space available which I could play with, my heart opened up and I felt closeness to my companions but not artificial closeness like on Methylone, it felt more true and honest, no overdriven urge to hug and kiss everyone, just happiness about them being here and having a good time, which they both seemed to have to this point. We tasted some of the food my brother prepared and it felt like heaven. I think that it was Moxy does in the first way. It amplifies everything. Kind of like cannabis does, but so much more.</p><p>So it was time to go, we had to drive 2 stations with the subway, pick up a friend and then walk some more minutes, no big deal! It was a mistake to think everyone can go out and party on a trippy substance just because I can. We went down the stairs from the 3rd floor where my brother lives. Right before the house my friend T crouched down laughing really hard. This was the beginning of his first trip and he got completely overwhelmed. Without a word he went straight back upstairs. I followed him and he sat in my brothers living room with no lights on, looking really confused. I talked to him and offered him to stay here and watch for him, since I am responsible for everything happening to him. Before we took the substance I told him the most important thing about tripping: When it overwhelms you, dont ever fight but let yourself go</p><p>I remembered him of what I said before and he was like Oh THAT is what you meant  I had to smile. After calming him down more, telling him nothing can happen, he is safe and Id be there for him, he was finally able to come with us to the party. Yay! GOA here we come!</p><p>For some minutes everything went fine, but when we got out of the subway and the doors were almost closing I saw him sitting back there, paralyzed and with pale skin, just staring forwards. In my thoughts I already saw him drive all the way to the final station. We managed to get him out of there without too much trouble. While I kept on talking to him in order not to let him get too confused by his own thoughts, I entirely forgot B.</p><p>I turned around and she was sitting on the floor, barely able to look straight. I managed to convince her it would only get worse if she talked herself into this and she managed to get up. It was such a reliefSome of you might know how long it can take for someone to get up again when tripping balls. It could have turned into a disaster if we were controlled by the cops in this situation. Although I carried no substances with me, neither T. or B. were able to form normal sentences and the presence of a cop would have freaked them out as hell.  I put my arm around her and we kept walking. Her body felt so weak I thought she might collapse any time and the only thing I could do was calming her down and pray. I felt really helpless.</p><p>Once every minute I looked over to T. and he looked like the death himself, telling me things like hes going home now. Very good idea I replied, youre going to have fun alone in the streets at night while in your current state. He turned back to us and followed quietly. So we made it to the club and it was crowded to overflowing. The problem was, both of my trip wrecks had to sit down and there was only one space to sit each on the opposite sides of the club. So I basically spend the next hours hopping between my friends and providing them water and talking to them till they felt better.</p><p>Needless to say I wasnt able to enjoy my bit the slightest, but that was more than ok. Moxy was really nice to me and let me function just the way I had to. But when my friends were regaining their normal states of mind it was time to go back to the apartment. On the way they already laughed again. They felt euphoric and were just happy it was over now, not aware of the fact that they were still tripping, just past the peak. I noticed how beautiful everything looked: My vision was so rich of contrast, each little light looked so intense and soft at the same time. If I had to describe 5-MEO-MIPT with one word it would be aesthetic. It must have been about 3:00 am when we arrived and i redosed with approximately 10mg ( the syringe made a little squirt instead of a drop) being on a total of about 25 mg. I checked my heart rate and it was on constant 120 BPM, but I felt well with it.</p><p>We went right back to the club when the fun for me started to happen. My field of view turned to more than 180, I could see people standing left and right behind me, which was rather interesting. I closed my eyes and suddenly the whole mixture of sound I heard was separated completely. I think it is called selective hearing and for me it was the most interesting thing about the trip. Usually when you try to focus on a sound while you hear other things, your brain tries to turn down the volume of what youre not trying to focus on. Well, what I experienced was totally different. I was able to follow and understand everything at the same time and on top even determining the exact place where each sounds origins, wow!  Focusing on the beautiful psy-art for a while made me dissociated from my body for a few minutes. It was enjoyable and when being back in my body I danced myself into trance like a berserk, ending up soaked in sweat. Two or three hours have passed when we went back to my brothers place again. He was still there, I woke him up from sleeping under the influence of 400 mg ethcathinone. Only God knows how he did that.</p><p>I was still in a good mood but it was starting to get straining. The lights were dazzling and I barely could watch white surfaces because they were just too shiny. I asked A. to darken his room and it felt way better. I smoked two hits of weed with my brothers bong and came down a bit. At about 7 or 8 AM B. and I went to her apartment, drank loads of chai tea and talked for hours. I slept for 2 or 3 hours and went home afterwards, sleeping for additional 15 hours after ordering a fabulous fish-curry. I woke up feeling great.</p><p>NOTE: Research Chemicals are not safe, always do an allergy test and never use a substance alone. If youre experiencing problems dont be afraid to call an ambulance, it might safe your life. A dose of 25 mg 5-MEO-MIPT is too much. Do not exceed the dosages on erowid unless you are familiar with the substance and know exactly what youre doing. Also: Tripping in public, especially clubs, can be an overstraining experience. Take good care of set and setting.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p>F.</p>",
