  "About 2 years ago, I purchased 1/4 oz. of Cubensis.  I was taking 10 mg (I believe) of Paxil a day.  In previous years, I had taken Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Tegretol, Rittilan, Lithium, Dexadrin (sp?) and a couple of others that I can't recall the name of.  I ate approx. 1/8 oz. of the Cubensis on a nearly empty stomach and toked a bowl of marijuana.  I noticed the usual giggly high that I was getting from the marijuana, but after 2 hours, I decided that I was not feeling any effects, and proceeded to eat the other 1/8 oz.  I stayed up for another 4 hours after that, and felt nothing more than how I would feel if I had been smoking marijuana only.  Also, I would like to note that I purchased the mushrooms from a reliable source, and he tripped pretty heavy off of the same stash.",
  "This last weekend, I went to the Country Fair in Oregon, hoping to give mushrooms another try, since I have been off of any medication for over 1 1/2 years.  I ate 1/8th on a partially full stomache, and experienced the same exact effects as before - none.  I was feeling a little queasy 3 hours after the dose, but I drank some water and felt better.  After staying up for 5 hours waiting to see the light, I passed out from being too tired."
