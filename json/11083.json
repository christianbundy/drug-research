 "report": [
  "I am bipolar and have taken a few different mood stabilizers to deal with it. I feel like they have dumbed me down and now I just feel stupid. My friend suggested I try Piracetam, she claims it works well for her.  Please note that I quit Lithium and Risperdal (cold turkey) two days before the experience.",
  "Day 1: I took 3/4 teaspoon of Piracetam powder in my orange juice along with my other meds, and soy lecithin (for Choline). I went off to work, a little grumpy, and did nothing interesting. No colors were brighter, no sounds louder, nothing.",
  "Day 2: Took a whole teaspoon (2800mg) and really hoped it would work. Unfortunately, I was feeling even crummier than before and had a slight headache.",
  "So I did some more research, found out that Lamictal and Piracetam work on the same brain chemicals. I guess in my case the counteracted each other. ",
  "What a waste of $14."
