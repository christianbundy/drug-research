 "report": "<p>\nI have done a lot of drugs. But, coke is the only one that would make me lie and cheat the people I care about. Back in December, coke started flying around my neighborhood. My best friend and I would round up $50 bucks a day, to go and get a half gram. We didn't have jobs or anything, we would steal from our parents and do basically anything to get it. Over the next weeks while I was using heavilly, I lost weight, my skin was dead white and my eyes were always bloodshot; I looked and felt so sick. I stopped using it, because it is not worth it. Sure, it makes you feel great after a line, but 20 minutes later if you don't have another line, your screwed. Don't do Coke, its not worth it, unless your a millionaire. Ive seen people spend lots of money and throw away their lives for it. Its just not worth it.</p>",
