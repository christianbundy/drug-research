 "report": "<p>Set: My house, after a mildly boring but enjoyable day.</p><p>Mindset: Slightly over-anxious</p><p>I have been experimenting with Kratom leaf for a few days now and find it a wonderful, inexpensive replacement for pharmaceudical opioids (also has much less negative effects). I find a comfortable relaxing evening can be achieved with between 6 and 10 grams of regular strength Kratom leaf (bali variety). I also aquired a supply of high-quality cannabis pollen (kif). The interesting thing about this night was after using the Kratom during the day my ability to absorb the drug had unknowingly slowed, giving the end of the night had an unexpected kick.</p><p>2:45PM - Ingest roughly 10 grams Kratom after mixing it into a glass of chocolate soy milk followed by a few hits from my vaporizer. It takes about 20 minutes to start noticing subtle opioid warmth.</p><p>4:30 Recording music is fun, I have increased focus and become very interested/pleased with playing my guitar.</p><p>7:30PM - Roughly 8 grams Kratom ingested followed by more vapors.</p><p>11:00PM - Swallow 1mg xanax.</p><p>11:30PM - Ingest 10 more grams Kratom.</p><p>12:00PM - After feeling no effects, eat other 1mg xanax.</p><p>12:15PM - Slight buzz from xanax, conversation is easy and motor coordination is very very slightly off.</p><p>1:00 - Disappointed because the xanax is mildly working and not much evidence of Kratom effects</p><p>2:00 - Decide to vaporize some more pollen. Strangely, as the high came on I started to feel the kratom and xanax hit simultaneously. I went from subtle buzz to full-on loss of coordination and time dilation (due to xanax).</p><p>2:30 - I am amazed that the chemicals are really working well now, but after 3 hours!</p><p>My assumption is that the Kratom slowed my digestion, leaving me with an unexpected high 3-3.5 hours after oral administration.</p>",
