  "I have had rather bad insomnia all of my life, I rely didn't take anything for it until I was a teen. I think the first dose I took was 25 Mgs it put me to sleep but I soon built a resistance. I now am prescribed 300Mgs of Seroquel to be taken once every night right before bed. I don't rely use them any more, except on nights when I don't have any weed to help me sleep. The effects aren't bad if I go to sleep after I take it. I sometimes I will have auditory hallucinations but they are barley noticeable. If I stay up the effects will increase, I will have visual hallucinations mixed with paranoia, but honestly it is very hard to stay awake. I rely dont think that any one could use it for recreation. It is a nice drug if I use it responsibly.",
  "It is just rely deep sleeping for hours its kind of nice."
