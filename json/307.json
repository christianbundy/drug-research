 "report": "<p>Success!</p><p>After smoking plain dried leaves 4 different times with effects similar to a marijuana buzz, I had success with some 5x extract in my darkened bedroom.  The first success, while listening to some foresty music, I became aware of small entities, possibly children, playing in the woods.  Very frolicky and happy. </p><p>The second time, which just concluded a couple minutes ago, was much different.  After about 3 bong loads of the extract, I just sat staring at the bong until it and the carpet and walls all became a similar, rectangular pattern.  Then I heard a voice (I interpreted it as the plant itself), literally heard a real voice from my right side whisper 'Hey you.' I responded (in my head) 'Yes?' This next part blew my mind.  It said 'Mine', and a hand came out from underneath me and grabbed towards some leaves that had fallen around the base of the bong.  It then slowly pulled away. </p><p>At that point, I really didn't know what to say or ask her (it), so I just said 'I love you.' for some reason. A few seconds later,  she eplied 'Hate you.'(!)  Well, that sucks! :)  I asked her why she felt that way, or what I needed to do to change myself to make myself better, so her essence might like, hopefully even love me. She said 'Try.' (I have a big problem where I know in my head what's right and good and what I should do, but have problems doing it in everyday life. Trying is exactly what I need to do right now). </p><p>Anyway, after those couple minutes, the feeling tapered off, and trying to remember everything in it reminded me of remembering dreams; very fresh in your mind at first, then trouble with it later.  I didn't feel suprised or threatened at all, again, kind of dreamlike.  So, just wanted to contribute.  I have a feeling I'll be visiting Salvia more when I start putting more effort into things I need to do in real life, to make myself be and feel better.  Peace -</p>",
