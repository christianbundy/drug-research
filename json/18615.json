  "My friend was using coke recreationally over Christmas and became ill with a low to nill white blood cell count. After almost 2 weeks in the hospital she was released and the testing concluded that he system was saturated with levamisole, a drug that is used primarily in chemotheraphy. She works at the hospital so further inquiry found other people sick with similar symptoms."
