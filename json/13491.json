  "I was offered imported Absinthe by a friend with a flask. I had roughly one shot. I went on to have a bit of bourbon and then went to bed for the night.",
  "I woke up the next morning completely blind, and it took me almost 12hrs to regain my full eyesight.",
  "Turns out Wormwood is in the same family as Menthol, which is something I'm mildly allergic to -- Wormwood I'm more severely allergic to. I literally could not see behind the length of my arm all day."
