 "report": "<p>My experiences with the herb have always been linked to sharing and caring. I first heard about it while working at a coffee shop. I knew tea, green tea especially, can be more of a uplifting stimulant than coffee's beatdown high. I first tried the tea in a bag. About half an hour latter I started to feel really giddy and happy. I was sold on it and continued to use it daily in bag steepings.</p><p>After a while I decided to experiment with cold water infusions. I steeped a quarter pound for 3 days. The resulting brew was like a concentrate! It started to give me heart burn, so I would cut it with a little water. I then went back to making it hot, but this time in the traditional gourd and straw manner. Filling a gourd half way with herb and half steaming water delivers an all day session sure to keep me in a good mood. Occasionally, I bring the gourd to a party and share with friends. The stimulating effects can enhance some other buzzes quite nicely (especially weed). Those times every one stays up all night and no one ever realizes!</p>",
