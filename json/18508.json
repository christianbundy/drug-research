 "report": [
  "My roommate and I brewed green tea and once the green tea was done, we placed 1/2 ounce of wormwood in a coffee filter in a coffee pot. We filled the coffee pot with the green tea and ran it through multiple times. We searched all over the internet to find some dosing parameters regarding wormwood, but were unsuccessful. Basically, we were guessing on how much to brew (keep in mind that our coffee pot is smaller than most) and this is why we chose 1/2 ounce.",
  "We brewed a little under a Liter of absinthe/green tea. I took one sip without sweetener (would never do again) and then one small sip with sweetener. In literally 3 or 4 minutes I had some euphoria and some mild psychoactive activity. Defiantly entheogenic this plant. This lasted for about an hour or two. Remember, this was TWO SIPS, probably about 6 or 7 milliliters. Unbelievable!"
