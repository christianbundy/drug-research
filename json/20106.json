 "report": [
  "It's been about two months on Mirtazapine. I've gained ten pounds, but I was a bit underweight to begin with (been taking a stimulant drug for ADD [vyvanse]), so that is all right, but I don't want to gain any more. My mood has improved overall. I haven't sat around all day wanting to cry after about the first two weeks. I do get better sleep. I'm looking forward to my life on Mirtazapine. Dreams have been fucking crazy!"
