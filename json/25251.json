 "report": "<p>I had been planning on taking 5-MeO-AMT the night before the trip so I got lots of rest and ate absolutley nothing during the next morning. I took 10mg at about 4pm and noticed effects after about 20 minutes. I suddenly felt very very sick and ran to the bathroom to vomit.</p><p>I had hoped that I didn't vomit up all the drugs and as it turned out, I did not. I ended up watching to spanish channel for 2 hours occasionally running to the bathroom to vomit but mostly just lying down and drinking water. During these 2 hours I began to feel very high, as if I had just smoked weed, however it lasted much much longer.</p><p>I continued vomiting until around 8 or 9pm when I went to go take a shower. The only visuals I saw were very mild. The walls would breathe a bit but mostly everything was just out of focus and hilarious. I felt sick all night long until I went to sleep at about 5 am.</p><p>Overall, I think that this drug could be quite dangerous in large doses and I don't find it very entertaining, although my friend did manage to experience massive visuals with 13mg. I would not try it again, and would not recommend it to anyone.</p>",
