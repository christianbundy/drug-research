  "I 2 pills twice daily for 9 days, usually with breakfast. On day 10 I was late for work so I took them with my Zoloft (Same Dr gave me the script) and a cup of coffee.",
  "Two hours later I was at work enjoying my buzz at work and the next thing I knew I was being held down and told paramedics were coming.",
  "I had a tonic-clonic seizure at work. If you're not sure what that is picture: eyes rolling back, legs kicking, arms jerking, spitting, pissing pants etc.",
  "3 days later I am still having blurred vision, muscle tremors, anxiety & an overall shitty feeling.",
  "I went to raves for a period of about 2 years, 5 years ago, during which I did mostly ecstasy and amphetamines -but I've tried almost everything I could get my hands on at the time. Never had a reaction like this before, no family history of seizures either."
