 "report": "<p>I used to sell this stuff. Granted, The trip it sends me on is very fun. I'm very focused, very happy, full of energy. I feel as if the world cant touch me.</p><p>Me and my friends fucked with this stuff for a while. I personally had a real bad night with it where I almost overdosed. I took about  25 600 mg tabs. At that point all i did was swallow them.... My body shut down and that night. I only got a broken finger from when I fell. Prior to the fall, my thoughts were incoherant. Could not maintain a steady train of thought.  I tried leaving the movie theater but passed out in the car for about 15 minutes or so,[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] Then drove home and almost wrecked.</p><p>5 600 mg pills on an empty stomache sent my friend into a ver bad siezure where she was brought to the hospital.... she almost died that night. She also had the same violent reaction when she took 22 800 mg pills and drank a 40oz of steele reserve ontop of them.... That was a truly bad night that almost ended in her demise as well....</p>",
