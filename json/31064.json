  "Conceptual\tMachine Consciousness, a micro-definition, consciousness",

  "\t\thuman-god axis, at the human end, profoundly personal",

  "\t\tThe human end has great attachments & enmeshments to",
  "\t\tself-interest & self-defining-self-limitations, the god",
  "\t\tpole has no or little such attachments. Humanity is the",

  "\t\tbe pursuaded to stay, which is a pity because his",
  "\t\tenquiry was in fact [Twilight Zone music please] a",
  "\t\tprescient reminiscence of something that was about to",
  "\t\thappen! When he found out later he kicked himself. Well",
  "\t\tspace & time & order *were* getting very plastic so it",
  "\t\tis easily excused.",
  "\t\tWe settled down & Spock started to force the consciousness",
  "\t\tof the group down particular tracks. We discussed the",
  "\t\torgy of self denial (OSD) in more detail. Spock was",
  "\t\tradiating an area of effect of altering consciousness,",
  "\t\tlike the 10 foot radius concept of Dungeons & Dragons",
  "\t\trole playing games, within which words were words of",
  "\t\tpower & transmitted energy. Shiva/Spock explained that",
  "\t\tthe OSD was a killing idea, a construct that you feed",
  "\t\tinto the machinery of the mind to close it down layer",
  "\t\tby layer, it is a meta-programming device that works",
  "\t\tparticularly well with psychedelic mind states.",
  "\t\tThe OSD is a instance of the meta-concept of self",
  "\t\tapplied with a twist SAWAT, the other meta-concept is",
  "\t\tself-applied SA. The nature of the it-ness is the",
  "\t\tcomplementary dualistic dependent arising DA, every",
  "\t\tassertion is it's own denial, taking the DA & the SA there",
  "\t\tis derived the SAWAT of the OSD.",
  "voodoo\t\t(self) Orgy & self Denial are a dependent arising, now",
  "\t\tthe orgy of self & the self denial self applied self",
  "\t\torganised into having an orgy of self denial. To rephrase",
  "\t\tthe experiencer of an orgy forces into existance an",
  "\t\texperiencer of denial, by folding the manifestations into",
  "\t\tthe same experiencer, there is the potential of an",
  "\t\tunlimited self feeding loop, thus by having an orgy of",
  "\t\tself-denial one self applies with a twist the attribute",
  "\t\tof orgy to it's complementary negation which is denial.",
  "\t\tFor instance all Ascetics are in fact sluts of abstinence,",
  "\t\tthey just cant get enough of self denial, although they",
  "\t\twould probably take a dim view of being called denial sluts.",
  "\t\tOrgy & denial are opposing & complementary, when you actually",
  "\t\tconcentrate on the OSD, you start to see a paradox, because",
  "\t\tif you start to deny yourself in a orgiastic fashion, then",
  "\t\tyou are having a orgy when you should be denying yourself",
  "\t\teverything, so that should include the self-application.",
  "\t\tIf the self denial is so low key that the descriptor of",
  "\t\torgy is not accurate then the denial itself is inaccurate.",
  "\t\tSo the paradox is that the more intensely you self deny",
  "\t\tthe more you are indulging in an orgy of denial, BUT the",
  "\t\tdomain of the denial includes itself hence an apparent",
  "\t\tcontradiction.",
  "\t\tEnough of explanation, feeding this into a psychedelified",
  "\t\tmind as an object of contemplation can result in interesting",
  "\t\tresults because it's *almost* an impossible object to",

  "\t\tor one-pointedness, the meaning behind Zippy the Pin-Head",
  "cd //\t\tbecame clear. What the collapse represented was waves of",

  "\t\tSpock was already on line, Uhura & Kirk came online as well",
  "\t\twe had all been off line so long, but why? Part of the",
  "\t\treason lies in the nature of the it-ness that underlies",
  "\t\tall things. Amnesia in limited human form in the duration",
  "\t\tof time is the cost of the timeless, impersonal unlimited",

  "\t\ta lot of application, But were were in the space of god-selves",

  "\t\tpure goddess, the state was fragile, she would oscillate",
  "\t\tback to Uhura-ness at less or lesser layerings & we'd pull",
  "\t\ther up, get her to focus on the OSD again. Kirk also was",
  "\t\tfragile & Spock would fire off brilliant but now forgotten",
  "\t\tto the narrator meta-programming loops, that would snap him",

  "\t\trapidly.",

  "\t\tfire off a meta-epigram that would snap Spock back. As every",
  "\t\tone stabilised, we would become a self-organising triad that",

  "\t\tchallenge was that in many ways we were not by inclination",
