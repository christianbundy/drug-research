 "report": "<p>The setup:    I'm on 20 mg per day of Paxil (an SSRI).  I'm an experienced MDMA user, but with no use of any sort of (recreational) drug for nearly a year.</p><p>On the spur of the moment, I obtained two 100 mg. MDMA gelcaps.  Both were taken with milk, 20 minutes apart.  This dose (about 2 mg/kg) would normally have been a put-me-on-my-ass roll, but this time (the first time I've tried MDMA since being put on Paxil) was wholly unremarkeable.  I would rate the effects as being on par with somewhat less then half of what I had actually taken...relaxed and a little energetic, but little else.  As usual after MDMA I slept lightly, but there was little 'hangover' the next day.</p><p>If I were to repeat the experiment, I might pre-load with 5-HTP, take more MDMA (it was all I had), and/or go off the Paxil for a day or two (with the warning that I'm perfectly prepared to deal with potential unpleasentness like withdrawal.)</p><p>Speaking from experience, SSRIs seem to be quite effective at supressing the desire to use MDMA.  It was mainly boredom that brought me to try it again.</p>",
