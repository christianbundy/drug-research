  "last night i had a very enlightening experience with morning glories. i've experimented with them before with somewhat satisfactory results, but last night was an ecstatic spiritual experience. i prepared my usual simple water extract of 12 grams of untreated heavenly blue morning glories (this shit was so cheap - i got 6 grams for 99 cents), except i used 84 proof rum instead of water ('cause i heard it extracts less of the nauseating stuff), and drank it over a period of about 40 minutes, sometime in the late evening (9pm).",
  "during the onset i felt as though i should just puke to get it over with, but instead i spent time talking to my brother to find relief from the occasional stomach discomfort (that, by the way, was gone within the hour). very relaxed, laid back without a care for inhibited worlds of past or future. all that mattered was the immediate now and it was complete in every way. we talked about dreams and then art and art history.",
  "a bit later, i went to my room feeling absolutely great (approx. two hours after i dosed) and turned on some music at a very low volume. i took two hits out of my bowl, and had a mind blowing experience. i realized, this is it. my being in all its eternal purity. i joyously laughed as i played with the external worlds that my senses would absorb. i gave up the 'i' part of myself and joined the unity of all existence, realizing again as i have so many times before the phoniness of the ego and all the entanglements and distractions that come along with it. i felt an immense compassion for all forms of life. a bit later i silently practiced meditation, and healing on myself and certain individuals that carry heavy karma.",
  "afterward, i spent the remainder of the experience reading a book called ' equations of eternity' by david darling, a really amazing book about the universe and the universe conscious of itself, since we are indeed made up of the universe. i definitely recommend this for anyone who is interested in this sort of thing. i laid in my room completely naked going through ecstatic revelations as i read this book. when i woke up this morning i felt a euphoric joy that i was a part of this world, and was alive. i felt happy that, though life is a struggle and hurts sometimes, i am eternal, that everybody is in essence perfect, that i have a family and loved ones, that i can experience, that i can be. that i am....",
  "this also proved to me again that the drug of choice doesn't mean the experience. i've had other morning glory experiences that weren't anything but recreational, due to unfavorable set and settings. but i was at home, with no one in the house but my older brother (who is a very dope person), in an excellent mindset for conscious expansion. i hope reading this has been enlightening for you, as it was for me to write and share it.",
