 "report": [
  "I've used quite a bit of GHB, mostly when it was prescribed by my doctor and I got 250mg capsules from a mail-order pharmacy.  My father also used GHB for a while to help him go to sleep at night but stopped after he had an experience which he described as 'feeling like an illegal drug'.",
  "I had been trying out GHB, starting with 250mg the first night, and increasing it by 250mg each night until I reached 2.25 grams.  I noticed no perceptible changes in emotional experience, and gave up, thinking that it was not worthy of its street name of 'Liquid E'.  A few weeks later, I tried 3 grams.  Still nothing.  Then I put on some music, and noticed that it sounded significantly different.  So I put on some dance music, and particularly appreciated the bass drum beats.  I started focusing on how I felt and found that I felt quite 'opened up' emotionally.  Not like E, but closer than I expected.",
  "After I had found my dose, I wanted to try it at a rave.  I took 3 grams when I arrived.  As it came on, 15 minutes later, I could feel the bass beats quite strongly in his chest.  This went on intensely for about an hour, and then I took another 500mg.  This extended the peak some, but I described it as less intense than the peak.  When I got home, I slept about 5 hours and woke up completely refreshed, which I attributed to the GHB.  I said he hasn't found this (needing *less* sleep after staying up all night long) on any other substance right afterwards."
