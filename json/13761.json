 "report": [
  "I have previously smoked quite a lot of marijuana and have battled a zolpidem addiction. I know what real effects are like vs. placebo effects.",
  "My sister one day bought home a lemon balm plant, I had heard of it's calming effects and wanted to try it.",
  "I first made a tea with about 5 grams of leaves: to my own disappointment it had no effects at all. Because I liked the tea, I continued drinking a cup every now and again.",
  "One day after drinking about 5 or 6 cups I suddenly felt an extreme relaxation, even better than Xanax or Valium, because I could function 100% normal while feeling amazing. This never happened again, but that one time was enough to get me interested.",
  "I ordered a bag of 60grams at a local health food store and started making tea. I drank cups of the stuff, but felt nothing, until one day when I decided to snort a line of finely crushed lemon balm. WOW!!! it was like the first time all over again.",
  "For weeks I wanted to feel it again, trying snorting line after line to no avail. But then one day it struck me again! I couldn't believe this!",
  "Why doesn't anyone know about this, and why doesn't it work every time?? Believe me this is no placebo, it is the best feeling on earth!",
  "I truly love lemon balm!"
