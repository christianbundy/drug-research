 "report": [
  "First off I snorted about 5mg of 2C-D as an allergy test to make sure it would be safe to take a full dose. I actually felt a head change; sort of like I was more focused. It kind of felt like a dose of adderal.",
  "An hour later I weighed out about 25+/- 5mg and swallowed it",
  "20min in I felt something, maybe a little more bit excited or giggly and a bit stimulated",
  "40min. I felt like I was coming up on MDMA, music sounded great. I was a little bit euphoric, rubbing my face felt good because my skin felt soft and warm. I had stimulation that made me want to jump up and dance to the electro music. I also had closed eye visuals of stuff that I would look at right before closing my eyes which would then morph into other things/patterns",
  "40-120min. (I would say this was the peak) I continued to be euphoric for about 20 more minutes and then the stimulation pretty much subsided. We had electro/dubstep blasting with the visualizer on the T.V. This was very entertaining to watch and just overall looked crazy with all the patterns. I felt really 'into' the visualizer. There was a slight movement of objects in the room as if they were shifting positions, nothing crazy though.",
  "I remained giggly for this time as well. Conversation came easily and my mind was pretty clear when I would focus on 'sober' things/thoughts. Somewhere in this period I re-dosed with another 8mg or so. (I wish I had just taken a full dose at the beginning)",
  "After a while of watching the visualizer I seemed a mildly agitated/angry. Nothing really seem that interesting, it seems like I had grown bored of the trip.",
  "120-180min At this point of time I was still tripping a little bit but was coming down slowly. My friends and I watched some funny shows online and also went outside to go get some candy from the gas station across the street. I was still a bit giggly to some random things, especially talking to the cashier at the gas station.",
  "Soon after this time period, I was what felt like completely sober, the feeling of being high had left my body and my mental/visual processes were completely normal. Sleep was super easy! I went to bed at my normal time of 1:00am (about an hour after the trip had ended). I did have some closed eye visuals all the way until I fell asleep-very mild ones though",
  "The day after there was no hangover, I feel great! Although I do not feel more refreshed than normal.",
  "Keep in mind that the above timeline is very rough as I did not take notes during the experience.",
  "I can say this for sure:",
  "-by 40 minutes in I felt great, almost at a peak",
  "-I tripped for about 2 hours and the whole experience from beginning to end was about 4 and a half hours",
  "-The trip didn't have a defining feature, it's like it didn't have much of a personality although at the early part of the trip it did feel close to a trippy version of MDMA",
  "-I have great closed eye visuals (it reminded me of the MDA pills I took in the past)",
  "-My friends (who also researched this chemical with me) and I decided we wouldn't use this at a club but we would use it again in a chill setting at home to hang out and smoke weed on; it was very laid back/relaxing after the early stimulation went away",
  "-When I was completely peaking, I went in the bathroom and the colors just seemed distorted, it was kind of weird to be honest. When I left the bathroom into the dark I saw a bunch of colorful waving lines flowing sideways in front of me but it wasn't right in front of my face",
  "-There weren't any moments where I was like 'OH FUCK IM TRIPPING BALLS' haha",
  "-There was little or no pupil dilation",
  "-I have had a hard time writing the trip report because the trip wasn't anything that sparked my interest/it wasn't 'amazing'/ it was a tad boring",
  "-I would do it again!  But I would take 40 or 45mg at once instead of staggering the dose",
  "-I took a hit of weed which did seem to increase visuals for a short amount of time",
  "-My friends who smoked weed the whole time on 2C-D said it had great synergy and seemed to increase the visuals",
  "Conclusion: This a very chill substance thats great to hang out on. At low dosages I could see its value as a smart drug. I would recommend it for other people to try out but I plan to research 2C-C before I return back to 2C-D. 2C-D is a very interesting chemical in it's own sense :)."
