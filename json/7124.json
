 "report": "<p>\nTrip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, ~10mg</p><p>insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots</p><p>of psychedelic experience.</p><p>Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always</p><p>trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.</p><p>Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in</p><p>a great trip, but the route which I took was quite</p><p>reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals</p><p>unless you have a scale that can measure the usually</p><p>very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a</p><p>very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT</p><p>and I decided it was a must-try!</p><p>At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty</p><p>milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of</p><p>powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this</p><p>opportunity again to warn that these small amounts</p><p>really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,</p><p>I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into</p><p>what I 'thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small</p><p>lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would</p><p>not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this</p><p>was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The</p><p>powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount</p><p>of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.</p><p>I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour</p><p>after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for</p><p>one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset</p><p>to this.  There was little nausea, just barely</p><p>perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.</p><p>I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated</p><p>the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if</p><p>you redose on this chemical, the literature says you</p><p>have to take more, but I think that up the nose results</p><p>in a faster onset and better bioavailibility. </p><p>At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of</p><p>low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright,</p><p>colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what</p><p>one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,</p><p>morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The</p><p>colors were really something, it was a continually</p><p> shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site</p><p>cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could</p><p>not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of</p><p>the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,</p><p>but overall I was very much in control at all times.</p><p>I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso</p><p>with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have</p><p>something to do with the amount of control I maintained.</p><p>The visual distortions were really something else, fully</p><p>3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects</p><p>swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared</p><p>intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it</p><p>turn into flowing sand dunes! </p><p>At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the</p><p>effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started</p><p>to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the</p><p>body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,</p><p>like near my belly button for some reason.  That was</p><p>the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all</p><p>over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen.</p><p>At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong</p><p>had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the</p><p>kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips</p><p>along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and</p><p>devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and</p><p>got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of</p><p>fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this</p><p>healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten,</p><p>although maybe the majority of fruit contributed</p><p>something to my cramp, who knows. </p><p>At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting</p><p>mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was</p><p>sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't</p><p>need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,</p><p>and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only</p><p>night lumination coming through my shaded windows were</p><p>very cool, with my shadows 'freezing' in my line of</p><p>sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to</p><p>appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I</p><p>fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of</p><p>my alarm clock.</p><p>It's now almost two the day after,</p><p>and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy.</p><p>Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this</p><p>substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally</p><p>bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,</p><p>a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to</p><p>say how much I took, although in my research I see</p><p>that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and</p><p>at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable</p><p>trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my</p><p>first real experience with a research chemical, and I</p><p>must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off</p><p>to our country's chemists, always preparing new and</p><p>exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration</p><p>of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and</p><p>say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see</p><p>more work done on this and other chemicals so that they</p><p>are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be</p><p>'reasearched.'</p>",
