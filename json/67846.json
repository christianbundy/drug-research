 "report": "<p>I've been a pretty worrisome person for as long as I can remember.  I get worked up easily over little things, and I find it very easy for me to panic in situations that aren't even that bad.  I had thought this was normal, though, to a point.  About the time I left for college, I started getting panic attacks on a regular basis.  When my parents found out about this, they told me to see help immediately.  From what they told me, both my mother and my father suffered from some combination of depression/anxiety/panic disorder, which come to think of it, didn't really surprise me.  I think it'd be perfectly logical that this sort of thing could have a hereditary predisposition.</p><p>I started seeking the aid of the psychiatrist at my university's health center.  After about a 1-hour session, he diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.  He wrote me a scrip for some .5mg clonazepam (generic Klonopin, taken twice daily) and 50mg sertraline (generic Zoloft).  I noticed its benefits almost immediately.  Within 1-2 days of starting this medication regimen, my anxiety that I felt was lifted almost completely.  My panic attacks went away.  My life seemed clearer, more carefree, and more enjoyable.</p>",
