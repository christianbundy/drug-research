 "report": "<p>I drink at least 5 days out of 7, usually 2-6 units, but I enjoy a binge about twice a week (between 7 and 20 units). I used to be very good at avoiding hangovers despite drinking lots. I always want to drink more than I usually allow myself, since I reckon I'm bordering on alcoholism. I suffer from anxiety and found alcohol an effective way of coping with it.</p><p>Since taking venlafaxine I feel drunk after about 4 units, and often don't feel I can drink any more after about 6. I have bad hangovers no matter how little I drink. It also doesn't work on the anxiety like it used to. After about 6-8 units my experiences are no different with or without venlafaxine, except the evil hangover the next day. These trends have remained consistent under a range of mental states and times of day.</p><p>I wanted to write this report because my experience is almost opposite to the other report of venlafaxine and alcohol I read on this site. Venlafaxine users rely on resources like this - The patient information sheet states 'avoid alcohol', but I couldn't find any studies of effects of venlafaxine and alcohol in humans, so I assumed it was precautionary advice simply because they did not know for sure. Rat studies show no adverse effects.</p>",
