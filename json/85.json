 "report": [
  "My experience with psychedelics is quite minimal, previous trips/experiences include MDMA, 2c-e, 2c-b, I also smoke cannabis daily.",
  "Setting: It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon,my friend 'Mr B' had recently took a journey down to SR and purchased some 25i-NBOMe, I received a phone call at around 2:30pm asking if I wanted in on taking some. Me being the 'why not' kind of guy, I agreed.",
  "(all time-stamps are approximated after 5pm.)",
  "14:50-Place 1mg blotter on upper lip, walk around with friends for about 10-20 minutes.",
  "15:15-We settle down at my house waiting for my friends mother to go out for work, (the plan was to chill at his house).No notable effects, apart from a slight 'warmth'.",
  "15:30-We arrive at friends house, sit down and put some music on, by now I am starting to notice my heartbeat speeding up,walls are starting to breath, and a noticeable confusion is starting to set in, I'm not sure why.",
  "16:00- Any amount of concentration is becoming increasingly difficult, watching the t.v was a task. My friend R passes me the t.v remote,to my surprise I don't actually understand what this bizarre object is. Visuals are starting to get a bit more intense, patterns stretching, walls bending.",
  "16:30-At this point the visuals almost resembled walking past a round mirror, my view of the world was now warped, as was my thought pattern, I suggest to my friend 'M' that we should take another as what was happening wasn't too intense.",
  "16:35-Place second blotter under my bottom lip, this is where things started to get scary. My heartbeat sped up to a pace that even for me, was abnormal. A friend had just sparked a joint, which for some reason I thought would calm me down. O boy was I wrong, after the first toke, I now know something is about to to horribly wrong, I can feel it.",
  "16:??- I suddenly become trapped. I'm not sure where, but all I know is I'm trapped, and I need to get out. I sit out side for a couple of minutes trying to slow my heart down, its too late. The world is now one object, everything I see is swirling, merging,twisting,conjoining into images I could not even comprehend.",
  "??-My friend comes out side to ask if I'm ok, to which I reply 'I think I'm going insane.' I feel the urge to get out of wherever I am, I ask if we can go somewhere, anywhere, just not here. Everyone agreed, we move towards the front door, walking was difficult to say the least. The floor was gloopy, it felt as if my feet were sticking to the floor with every step.",
  "??-OH NO THE FRONT DOOR IS LOCKED. I am now trapped inside my own body, looking out into a world I no longer could comprehend, at this stage, I am now having a full blown panic attack, my friend says if things are getting too bad, get home and take a Diazepam, I didn't know why, who or what a diazepam was, but the way he said it sounded reassuring.",
  "??- the front door is now unlocked and I am 'walking?' home. Luckily I live around 200 meters away from my friends house. I am petrified, my world is collapsing around me. The visuals at this point had completely engulfed my vision. It seemed like there was large + small patches of gravity everywhere, pulling the world (and everything in it) in opposite directions. (I am trying as best I can to describe what I saw, bear in mind I could not start to explain the intricate patterns that were emerging with any slight eye movement).",
  "??-This again. I am now stood at my front door, trying to get the key in the door, this was also incredibly difficult due to the intense swirling and conjoining of all colors/patterns.",
  "??-The stairs. How I made it up them is truly one of the most remarkable things I have ever done in my entire life. I knew I had to get up/around/across them to find my savior, and somehow I did. Also finding the diazepam, I quickly took 2 and proceeded on with what was going to be a very, very long day.",
  "??- A friend phones asking how I'm doing, I keep repeating the words ' I am going insane. ' I remember hearing what sounded like 100 echos of his voice repeating the words he said at a faster pace than what I could keep up with. I go lay down in a caravan that is in my garden, accepting that whatever is happening, is going to keep happening. I am alone.",
  "??- I lay back on the settee, still breathing heavily, heart still racing, if I focused on my heart beat it felt like I could feel the chambers of my heart fill up, and pump the blood around my body. My veins felt electric. I try to send a text to my friend 'mr b', my words were 'this is fucked' it felt like hours to type it, because of the words jumbling up and dancing off the screen, whilst the world around me was going absolutely haywire, when I woke up in the morning, my fiend had replied, I sent the message at 7:04, I can only describe the wait for the reply as hours, but to my amazement I received a message back at 7:04. Time dilation is in full effect.",
  "??- all I can see is what seems to be the innards of a coo-co clock, but everywhere, as if the worlds cogs were turning in-front of me, the grains in the wood made the most amazing patterns, so intricate, so alive.",
  "??-by now I assume the diazepam had hit me, because I am starting to see the world as I want to, as I had planned to, and to my amazement, still had the second 1mg blotter under my lip, the world took a turn for what seemed to be the best, I looked at the sky and all I could see was clouds warping in and out of each other with the more bizarre movement patterns I've ever witnessed.",
  "??-there's a fly, and its trailing... Everywhere. The sound is enticing, if I focused enough I could hear the flapping of the flys wings, or so it seemed.",
  "??-CEV- up until now I have not closed my eyes, the first time I did, it felt like I was able to see out of the middle of my forehead, I raised my hand with my eyes closed and saw only what I can describe as when neo out of the matrix gets blinded, and is fighting smith. With my eyes closed I could see a fiery, almost energetic hand print in my vision, my stomach was rippling and twisting with every beat that my heart made.",
  "??- how is this still happening? I am lay still looking at the mechanics of the universe, whilst there appears to be another world co-existing with the one I am currently sat in, as if whatever I done, whatever I had previously done, is still happening, as if time was a constant that had been recorded.- after this I lay for what seemed to be an eternity in a half conscious, half hallucination state where all of the above repeated.",
  "0:00- effects are starting to wear off, still mild patterns emerging from surfaces, still some weird swirling/merging of colors, but nothing as prolific as what I had just experienced.",
  "0:00-05:00am- difficulties sleeping due to the over active mindset I have been left with after such a life changing/petrifying experience.",
