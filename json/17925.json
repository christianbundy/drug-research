  "In 2005 when I was at a wilderness program for substance abuse, I went on a visit with my parents. After consuming large amounts of nutmeg (which doesnt show up on a drug test) in order to get high and taking my normal dose of effexor and buspar, I failed a drug test 2 weeks in a row for pcp. The second week the program knew I wasnt lieing because I was living in a tent in the mountains of colorado and it would have been imposible for me to get pcp, which I've never used. Ever.\r[Erowid Note: Venlafaxine (Effexor) can cause false positives for PCP on urinalysis tests.]"
