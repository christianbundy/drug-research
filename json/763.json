  "This is going to be a quick summary, because there wasn't really much depth to the experience, nor were any parts particularly notable.  In fact, this could barely be called an altered state at all.",
  "About one hour after consuming the 25mg capsule of DiPT, a slight change in skin feeling was noted.  The bodily effects were very similar to a very weakened version of 5-MeO-DiPT, with none of the mental changes normally associated with psychedelics.  Soon afterward, the auditory effects began.  These consisted of strange alterations of pitch, mostly deepening of voices and change of music tone so that everything sounded just one step away from reality.  Very slight visual effects were noted which mostly consisted of a sharpening of outlines and an increase in contrast of colors.  Mental function was unnoticed, and conversations could easily take place with sober people as normal, albeit with a more interesting 'soundtrack'.  The main sound alteration lasted around 3 hours, and sleep came easily at 5 hours. ",
  "Overall, this is something that might be worth doing again for the novelty factor, but just isn't impressive enough to be much more than that."
