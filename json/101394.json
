 "report": "</p>\nIn late 2012, after my third or fourth experimentation with what I understood to be blotter LSD, but may have very well been 25-I or 2CB without my knowledge, I began to experience visual disturbances which I later discovered matched those of HPPD sufferers. They started a couple days after the last hit of blotter I took.</p><p>I commonly experienced a visual skipping and resetting of things in motion. I would watch. Car drive 10 feet in one direction but I would watch it move forward 4 feet skip back one foot, move foward another 6 feet and them skip back a foot, and continue forward. This, as well as a heightened awareness of floaters and peripheral disturbances, plagued my vision for close to 3 weeks.</p><p>While attempting to sleep I would occasionally experience the feeling of having something very large very close to my face and then something very small very far away,  this feeling would oscillate but was never intense enough to keep me awake.</p><p>As I began to pay less and less attention to the disturbances they generally became less frequent and by the start of the fourth week they had completely disappeared.</p><p>Four to five months later, I tried psychedelics again. Since the visual disturbances stopped, I've experimented with various hallucinogens including LSD, 25i, 2CB, and MDMA, and no symptoms have returned or made any apparent reappearance during, before, or after a trip. I hope this info helps</p>",
