 "report": [
  "I was recently prescribed bupropion 100 mg to be taken twice a day for depression. Prior to this I have been using opiates, particularly black tar heroin and oxycodone, nearly everyday for the past 6 months. I experience major opiate withdrawal approx 24 hours after last administered dose.",
  "However, once I began taking bupropion (Wellbutrin) I noticed that I no longer got high when ingesting opiates. Interestingly, since I began taking bupropion I have had minimal opiate withdrawal. Also, I've noted that insufflated doses are more effective than ingested doses (particularly with oxycodone). I would say 60 mg ingested oxycodone had about a quarter of the effect it normally would, whereas insufflation would be 50-75% typical effect. In both cases bupropion inhibited the opiate's positive effect.",
  "I haven't seen any other reports about combining these two substances (and I researched rather intensively) so I hope this will shed some light on the issue. I now stopped taking opiates altogether due to a lessening of craving and a lessening of euphoria as a result of the bupropion."
