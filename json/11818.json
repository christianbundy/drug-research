 "report": "<p>I had read about kava kava smoked by some people so I decided to do some first hand investigating.</p><p>I went to an herb store in my city and bought about 2 ounces of fresh Kava Kava (none of the emptying the pills, drinking tea shit) for 6 bucks.  Pretty cheap!</p><p>T+ 00:00</p><p>I packed the first bowl and smoked it in a few minutes, it burns almost as good as tobacco.</p><p>T+ 00:05</p><p>Mild effects, but not much.  Packed the second bowl and smoked it.</p><p>T+ 00:09</p><p>Effects settling in very nicely.  It's surprisingly stronger than I expected from the reports, but nice.</p><p>T+ 00:15</p><p>I've reached full effects, it's similar to being stoned, but relatively aware.  Everything is moving a little bit slower, and I'm really, really relaxed.  Definately something to use after a hard day.</p><p>It's T+ 00:35 now and I still feel all the effects, I now love Kava Kava.  And the best part is... it's LEGAL.  Don't listen to thoughs who say there is no effects.</p><p>It is an awesome, tranquil euphoria.  If you go in to it expecting very little, you will come out with an awesome experience.</p>",
