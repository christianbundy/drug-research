 "report": "<p>I heard about lotus from a good friend who said that smoking lotus made him happy</p><p>I then orderd 1/2 ounze of N. caerulea - Blue Lily Flower and 1 ounze of White Lotus (Nymphaea alba)</p><p>I first smoked a bowl and a 1/2 of the blue lilly with no effects ( maybe a little relaxation) the smoke was harsh.</p><p>I then tried the tea. I placed a large Tble spoon of blue lilly and one dried flower of White lotus in a tea holder. Boiled some water and put the stuff in and let it rest for about 15 minutes. My first sip was horrible so I then added some honey and a handfull of brown sugar to the tea because of its taste, took 15-30 minutes to drink. About 15 minutes after I finished I started to feel zoned out. I felt relaxed and warm. But these effects were not strong and nothing from a buzz came to me. I felt tired so laid in bed for 15 minutes and called my friend. Then feeling really mellow I played some video games and blasted Bob Dylan. This was great I spent about a hour singing to Dylan and just enjoying music. I still felt relaxed and mellow but then went to the beach nontheless ...</p><p>my 'Buzz' (I wouldnt call it that) wore off in the car and the rest of the day I felt tired and zoned out and quiet. I later played some golf. I have a bad temper and usually will scream swing and club in anger and curse but none of this happend at all during my round. I was just too chilled and relaxed. In the end Lotus is a somewhat nice herb but I'm debating if its worth the price and taste... In my opinion its kinda like damiana but I drink damiana cause of its nice taste. I will be expiramenting with it more and will probaly use it with some alchohal to increase the effects.</p><p>peace and love</p>",
