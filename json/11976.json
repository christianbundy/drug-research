 "report": "<p>SET: I am coming into he last 2 months of my audio engineering course. As a result I am required to shift more stress and anxiety; other than this I am in good running order.</p><p>SETTING: Early evening at my flat. Last food approximately 4.5 hours prior (fruit salad). Last drug  cannabis previous evening. Other than this nothing inside of a week.</p><p>10mg of 4-AcO-DET freebase was loaded into a glass DMT pipe. Freebase was a dark grey powder.</p><p>+:00 I take 5 large lung-fulls of before I am satisfied that no chemical remains. Smoke is actually easy to smoke and not harsh on throat or lungs (I am surprised).</p><p>After the 3rd toke the first effects are felt. Very similar to the first .5 seconds of 5-MeO-DMT.</p><p>Sweaty hands</p><p>Colours are more vibrant.</p><p>+:10  No mental gymnastics at this point but I can see the veins through my hands. Body is feeling fine  no complaints. Lungs feel expanded.</p><p>+:15  No progression of visual or mental effects. Upon standing I have a sense of feeling taller.</p><p>I do not feel restless.</p><p>OEVs are expanded, no morphing or dripping. Colours are vibrant.</p><p>CEVs are no more lucid or intricate than when I am sober.</p><p>+:30  Notice clenched jaw + tightness in stomach.</p><p>Still no mental gymnastics, although I am starting to peak.</p><p>+:45  Increase in sexual awareness  I now know what Ill be doing next time with this chemical.</p><p>+1:00  Definitely passed my peak. Decide to go for a walk. Phone rings, talking no problem.</p><p>+1:10  Go for a walk.</p><p>+1:25  Back from the walk. Too cold and navigating London traffic (even as a pedestrian) is too scary.</p><p>Effects have diminished considerably.</p><p>+1:45  Just got off the phone talking to a mate about the trip. Post trip synopsis  nearly baseline now.</p><p>REFLECTION:</p><p>This is a strange experience. I was expecting an increase in associations, to generate new perspectives. I think this is a dosage reliant effect.</p><p>Visuals were not the typical bending/morphing variety. No form constants like lattice, filigree, tunnel, spiral, etc.</p><p>My visual field seemed expanded or as if I were viewing the world through a fish eye lens. This is a commonly noted effect of 4-AcO-DET.</p>",
