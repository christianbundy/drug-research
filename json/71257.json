 "report": "<p>The interesting thing with rhodiola is that I have taken it on a daily basis without noticing any hugely noticable effects, but when I first tried it it gave me an intense rush of euphoria and hugely increased my general motivation.</p><p>I remember I once took it at work, at a health food shop, where I was feeling very bored, tired and lazy. After about 30 minutes from ingesting two of the viridian capsules I started to feel very happy and content at doing my job! I was moving some very heavy boxes of food up and down the stairs, but it was no trouble at all! I was even chatty with my boss, whom I usually tried to avoid as she was a bit aggressive at times.</p><p>A few times when I took it it had a similar effect. It is hard to find out much information about rhodiola, so I don't know if it requires some kind of amino acid or works better with carbohydrates for example and this is why it sometimes works and sometimes does not.</p><p>However, it is still very uesful even if the effects are not strong. I think it works in a similar fashion to St John's wort or SSRI anti-depressents. So it can be a quite a gentle way of keeping an up-lifted mood.</p>",
