  "Here is an experience I had with 3g of 15X standardized extract.",

  "1:15pm Drank black/oolong/green tea w/ 3g extract partially dissolved, iced.",
  "T+15 no major noticeable effects",
  "T+30 slightly lightheaded, perceived pressure in nasal area, dizzy",
  "T+45 still slightly lightheaded, no more pressure, dizzy",
  "T+60 more relaxed, no nausea as usually reported as of yet, a little relaxed.",
  "T+75 definitely relaxed, still lightheaded. sleepy.",
  "T+90-150 same",
  "T+150 slight hunger, relaxed, sleepy, no euphoric feeling throughout experience.",
  "Overall, nice. The company I purchased the extract from accidentally gave me an additional 8g, unknowingly, thus making my experience repeatable and quite low-cost. Normally, this would cost nearly $10 but instead cost $3.25, a definite bargain. The herb is a great way to wind down after work as long as I get to sleep before the nausea sets in. The sleepiness could have been a result of my early waking (3:30am). Will try again on weekend w/ higher dosage (6g) to see if it makes difference. Kanna seems to have a much more pleasant, albeit subtler, effect."
