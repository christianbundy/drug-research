 "report": "<p>I'm 16, I weigh 50 kilograms and i don't exercise much. My dad grows wild lettuce in our back garden and I'm pretty sure he is unaware of its effects. I read about wild lettuce and from there decided to try it at my own free will.</p><p>Method: 1. I picked 2 full sized leaves off the top of the plant</p><p>2. Dried them in front of a wood fire overnight.</p><p>3. Wrapped in a joint and smoked.</p><p>After smoking the wild lettuce I felt my heart race increasing and was aware of fog everywhere (similar to smoking weed). My reactions were a little slower and my vision continuously faded away, as if I was closing my eyes, also my eyes were a little bloodshot. I was really freaking out at this point and was going to ring an ambulance. I was home alone and I live in quite an isolated area of California. I started to calm down and found the trip quite enjoyable, I would sum it up as, the same as smoking weed but without the munchies.</p>",
