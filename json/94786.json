 "substance": "Anadenanthera colubrina",
 "bodyweight": "84 kg",
 "report": [
  "<p>I was feeling anxious. I was anticipating an experience. Just not sure which type.",
  "I heated the three seeds in a pan until they 'popped' and then de-husked them. I ground up three seeds and loaded just over half of it into a water pipe with a little bit of cannabis.",
  "Immediately I felt a headache feeling...and then a pressure that led to nausea. Then the a very familiar body feeling not unlike DMT.",
  "No closed eye visuals. Just nausea and that familiar body feeling.",
  "In summary, for 84kgs body weight, 2 seeds was probably not enough. Will try 3 in future and report here. Will also try combining with Syrian rue seeds, and also via snuff.</p>"
