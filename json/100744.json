 "report": "<p>I had acquired 25c from someone a few days before this experience. Prior to this I had experimented with one other research chemical, 2C-B. I went into this experience thinking the effects would be similar to 2C-B, but found something completely different and unique and much more psychedelic.</p><p>At around 5pm on this day I started by taking half of a 1mg tab. I had it in my mouth for about a half an hour, then I started eating and realized I had swallowed the tab.</p><p>After dinner, I went to a house party with a friend. It had been about 2 hours since I first put the tab in my mouth and I was feeling minimal effects, just a little bit of euphoria. When we got the the party I put a whole 1mg tab into my mouth. I walked around the party for a while and noticed it was a lot easier to talk to people, just like on MDMA. I was feeling very euphoric and happy.</p><p>This went on for about two or three hours, but I wasn't having any visual hallucinations. About 10pm I went to the bathroom and flushed the used tab then put one more 1mg tab in my mouth.</p><p>About a half an hour after I put this tab in I was seeing things start to warp around me, it was very similar to the visuals on 2C-B. Things were floating and moving slowly, it was nice but nothing really intense.</p><p>At about 11pm I went outside to smoke some weed with my friends. We had rolled a really large blunt, I didn't pay attention to exactly how much was in it but I suspect it was about 3 grams. I hadn't smoked for about a month prior to this so my tolerance was very low. I was taking very big hits off of it and I started to get very high. My friend turned on some really slow music and it made me start to feel really floaty and trip out. This is when things started getting intense.</p><p>We were outside for about a half an hour and then I really started tripping and told my friends I needed to go inside and lay down. I felt really disconnected from the world. Every time I turned my head it was like I was seeing a brand new landscape all together, each direction of sight was its own world. I started to get really scared, so we went inside and I laid down on a couch in a room that nobody was in, I told my friends I just wanted to be alone so they left.</p><p>I started to see very vivid shapes everywhere, it was like I was looking at everything through a colorful grid of circles and triangles. My body started to get really tingly in certain places and I started to twitch a little bit like I did my first time smoking weed. If I stared at one thing for a long time it started to become the only thing in existence and I started to see it in tunnel vision.</p><p>After I was in the room for a couple minutes I started to get really scared and started thinking I took too much of the 25C. I sat up because I needed to get my head straight. Everywhere I looked was just so vivid with shapes. I stood up and walked in the bathroom that was connected to the room and went pee.</p><p>I looked at myself in the mirror of the bathroom for a long time just talking to myself trying to come to terms with just how hard I was tripping and what was going on. Eventually I came to the idea that there was a good chance I was going to die that night. I felt very strongly that what I was feeling was what people feel before they die. I kept looking at myself thinking, 'I'm going to die...I'm going to die.' It was extremely scary.</p><p>I went and laid back down on the couch, just staring at the ceiling, which was moving around, warping, and covered in shapes and colors.</p><p>It was when I closed my eyes that things got very intense. When I would close my eyes it was like my entire body was covered in an abyss of darkness. It felt like I was not in a room in a friends house, it felt like I was just in the middle of this black abyss. I felt like I was sinking into the blackness and felt like I was sinking down into the earth, then when I opened my eyes I returned to the couch and kept tripping more.</p><p>I started getting really afraid again thinking I was probably dying. Then I started getting really paranoid about the people outside the room, thinking everyone in the house knew what I was doing and was worried about me. I started thinking people were calling 911. Every time I heard someones voice I thought they were talking about me. Every time I heard the front door open I thought it was the paramedics coming upstairs to get me. I kept having these thoughts for a good hour. It was a completely terrifying experience.</p><p>Eventually I just needed to relax. When I closed my eyes this time I went inward and looked at myself very introspectively. I felt like I was looking at myself as though I was standing inside my body looking at me from the inside. I started becoming aware of who I truly was and what I was capable of. I started asking myself questions but not really needing to know the answers.</p><p>After that I really needed to get comfortable and relax because it felt like my heart was beating very fast and I didn't think I was breathing good enough.</p><p>At this point time was completely nonexistent, I had no concept of time so my breathing was very hard to keep control of because I couldn't tell how many seconds were between each breath.</p><p>Eventually, I turned on a guided meditation on my phone and closed my eyes. This was the most peaceful thing ever. Between hearing this meditation and also having on the forefront of my mind the thought that I was going to die soon, it was the most amazing loss of ego I have ever felt. Shortly after this, I went to sleep.</p><p>The next day I woke up feeling changed. I felt like my life had changed so much that night. I felt really good. The trip felt like it had stripped me naked away from the world and ravaged me, only to allow me to see the world as what it should truly be seen as.</p><p>I would not recommend this substance to people only because it is so new and there is not a whole lot known about the effects it has on the body. However, I do feel like it was completely worth it and I have no regrets about taking this substance. Although the majority of the trip was terrifying, it was eye opening.</p>",
