 "report": [
  "I decided that I would try more melatonin that I normally use just to fall asleep (3mg works well just to fall asleep).",
  "I took it, and then about 15 minutes later went to sleep (about 4am). I fell asleep very easily and slept pretty well. I did not wake up extremely refreshed (the feeling I get when they've slept too much). This is probably due to my not getting very much sleep during the previous week, rather than the melatonin.",
  "I had extremely involving dreams, very vivid with lots of energy. In fact, when I woke up at about 1pm and went back to sleep, I could easily get the same dream back, which I had until about 3:30pm when I finally woke up.",
  "It was very interesting and was so vivid that I had a slight feeling of exhaustion (not really sure why).",
  "I don't think it affected the nature of my dream (what kind it was, and whether I would enjoy it or not), however."
