 "report": [
  "Well, a couple of days ago I posted a message to alt.drugs.ghb asking about Tranquilli-G.  It arrived today; I took about 2.5mL after working from 5:30a.m til' 2:00p.m. Before I took it I was feeling agitated achy, and tired.  It took about 20 min. and I felt something, not excatly sure, but it felt good, I drifted off to sleep and slept for about an hour or so and woke up feeling fairly good. (usually after an afternoon nap I wake up feeling terrible.) So it had some effect on me other than sleepiness. It took some of my aches and pains away before falling asleep also. ",
  "I continued to use the Tranquilli-G and found it to be fairly weak.  Although it did definately do something, made ne feel mildly relaxed and helped me sleep."
