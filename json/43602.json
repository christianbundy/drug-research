 "report": "<p>I took 20mg and an hour or so later started to get really drowsy, like I hadn't slept in a week. A friend and I left school early and I started falling asleep in the car. Finally I got home and fell asleep on the couch and then upstairs in bed. I went to bed in my room and didn't get up until the next day, and then I was all drowsy and sluggish. It sucks because I was supposed to go to a movie with my friends but I couldn't stay awake to save my life.</p><p>The time that I was awake I felt like I was a robot and just did as I should. In the class before I left we had to work on our poster, and so I spent the whole time cutting animal shapes out of construction paper. I felt a mindless drone, there was no emotion, no excitement, everything just was. It kind of seemed like purgatory or the life of someone in the book, Brave New World. All it did was make me drowsy and mindless.</p>",
