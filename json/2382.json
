 "report": "<p>11:45PM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I weigh out 50mg of Ketamine HCl which was obtained pure (not as</p><p>an injectible solution) from a chemical supplier. It is a crystalline</p><p>powder with some rather large chunks that look like crystals of table</p><p>salt. I crush this to a fine powder, then further powder it with a razor</p><p>blade, and divide it into two even lines. This is about my 8th experience</p><p>with ketamine, though I've never written a report about it before. Looking</p><p>at this 50mg, it appears to be alot more than what I've done before.</p><p>Erowid's ketamine dosage page states 'One method for nasal use is to</p><p>insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until</p><p>you reach your desired dosage.' I do not anticipate that there will be any</p><p>need to repeat. Looking at this, I visually estimate that most of my prior</p><p>experiences have been with around 30-40mg.</p><p>12:00AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I insufflate the first 25mg. There is a mild burn, but not too</p><p>bad. The file mentions doing 50mg at once. I've decided to space it</p><p>out somewhat and see how things work out.</p><p>12:03AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I feel very noticable effects. My body begins to feel strange. My</p><p>head has a sort of 'balloon-like' feel to it, its somewhat like nitrous</p><p>oxide without the sound in the head. Speaking of sounds... I put on</p><p>Orbital's live mix of 'Halcyon On & On'. Normally this song is very</p><p>pretty... but now, even with headphones, it sounds muffled or distant.</p><p>Ketamine certainly doesn't seem to enhance music - quite the opposite.</p><p>12:11AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I am getting strange visual disturbances. Hard to explain really.</p><p>I have the impression that things are moving, but nothing looks as though</p><p>its moving. Corner-of-the-eye type stuff... but much more so. There is</p><p>a flittiness to the visual effects that is vaguely reminiscent (I was</p><p>completely unable to spell this word myself and had to ask for help on the</p><p>Internet) of the visual effects produced by ecstasy. My visual field is</p><p>swimming... thats the best word for it, somehow. As if looking at</p><p>everything through some kind of moving liquid.</p><p>12:18AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    There is a noticable drop in intensity of the effects. Visual</p><p>effects are still present. I still have a feeling of 'dumbness' (not being</p><p>able to remember words, etc). In fact I am nowhere near baseline. But the</p><p>initial rush is over. My body feels 'weird.' There are no closed eye</p><p>visuals.</p><p>12:30AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I still feel a little unusual, and my visual field is still</p><p>swimming a little, but the effects are more or less over. 25mg remains</p><p>sitting on my plate. I'm not sure I want to do it... I feel as if I wasted</p><p>the first 25mg by sitting in front of a computer and trying to describe it</p><p>in realtime - as if the very act of attempting to describe the effects</p><p>prevents the more interesting effects form appearing.</p><p>12:40AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    I divided the remaining 25mg into 2 more lines, and put some Orb</p><p>on through headphones. I insufflate one of the 2 lines, then go to lay</p><p>down and close my eyes and listen to music.</p><p>12:45AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    No significant increase in effects from that  mg, so I insufflate</p><p>the other. I go back to laying down, after skipping to a different Orb</p><p>tune (Little Fluffy Clouds, Dance Mix MK2).</p><p>12:56AM</p><p>-------</p><p>    The song ends. I get up to start writing. My body feels somewhat</p><p>'detatched' - I can't quite explain it. Its not numbness per se, but</p><p>shares some qualities. Laying on my bed was very odd. The bed felt hard,</p><p>and the pillows felt hard, as if laying my head back on a cloth-covered</p><p>rock. The overhead light in my bedroom appears somewhat like the light</p><p>over an operating table. Not much in the way of closed eye visuals. Open</p><p>eyed, my room looks somewhat stark and my perspective seems odd. Is my</p><p>heart beating OK, am I breathing normal? I think. Don't really care. I</p><p>find myself thinking of mundane, every day issues, trying to find answers</p><p>to things which have been on my mind - no answers come to me that haven't</p><p>already come to me sober. I seem to be able to think about things in a</p><p>detatched, analytical way, but there is no enlightenment coming that I can</p><p>see. Most drug 'spirits' I've dealt with have seemed to be male or female</p><p>- not so ketamine. The ketamine 'spirit' seems robotic or mechanical in</p><p>nature. This molecule taps into some very different energies than the</p><p>traditional psychedelics. I would not consider this a psychedelic at all.</p><p>Its something else entirely.</p><p>1:08AM</p><p>------</p><p>    I feel I'm in approximately the same place as I was at the 12:18AM</p><p>entry above. Visual field is swimming. Feel physically weird...a slight</p><p>sensation of motion, perhaps. Somewhat dulled sensation. Music sounds</p><p>mostly normal. But the mental effects have noticably dropped off. I feel</p><p>more 'coherent' and though quite a ways above baseline, I'm definately</p><p>aware that I'm headed there.</p><p>1:20AM</p><p>------</p><p>    Visual effects are still quite noticable, though dramatically</p><p>less than what they were. Other effects are decreasing rapidly. I decide</p><p>to smoke some cannabis and conclude this experiment.</p><p>1:34AM</p><p>------</p><p>    I am on IRC... I just had a very intense deja vu experience. I</p><p>recieved 2 variations on the same chain email from 2 friends who are</p><p>totall unconnected (except through me). Then all of the sudden I realized</p><p>that the conversation I was having on IRC was something I had before. I</p><p>had the strange feeling that I existed in that time segment twice. Just</p><p>thought it was worth mentioning... Strange!</p>",
