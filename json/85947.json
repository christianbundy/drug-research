 "report": "<p>My experiments to date with MDPV have left me feeling rather unimpressed.  Its adequate for use as a stimulant and while I enjoy the primary effects of the substance, the harsh come-down usually renders the entire experience not worth the ultimate punishment.  Today, I intended to continue my study into whether the negative comedown effects from this stimulant can be reduced by using a diminishing, repeated dosing regimen. </p><p>I decided on a total dose of 35 mg, which I weighed on an accurate scale, razor-cut thoroughly, and then eyeballed into 5 lines of diminishing size: approximate doses as follows.</p><p>Dose 1: 10 mg</p><p>Dose 2: 10 mg</p><p>Dose 3: 7 mg</p><p>Dose 4: 4 mg</p><p>Dose 5: 4 mg</p><p>T=0:00 (12:00 PM)  I insufflated 10 mg.  MDPV does not burn very much at all.</p><p>T=0:15  I sit down to lunch, and have no trouble eating.  Food tastes good.  Im becoming very talkative, speaking passionately about a friend who recently overcame cancer, and then find myself revisiting some self-reflections that I arrived at over the past weekend from an LSD and Methylone/2C-T-2 trip.  I feel very empathic, euphoric, loving and emotional.</p><p>T=0:30  I finish lunch and continue rapidly talking.  My partner is getting ready to leave for work.  At T+0:35 I feel the faint rumblings of roll-off and impending come-down.  But I dont really want to re-dose prior to 1:30.  I return to work.</p><p>T=1:00  The experience is definitely rolling off but I am still well in it.  I feel a mix of the euphoria and a developing come-down feeling, hollowness in the gut etc.  I feel motivated and focused on my work. Im developing muscle tension in my back from typing and Im beginning to grind and clench my teeth. The roof of my mouth is tight and Im trembling slightly.</p><p>T+1:15  Definitely feeling more come down than euphoria and beginning to want to take my next dose early, so I do. I insufflate the next 10 mg. 5 minutes after snorting, my heart rate is slightly elevated but not overly so (86 BPM resting/typing).  Pupils are dilated but not huge. Im beginning to feel better within 10 minutes of the 2nd dose but not as good as I felt at the peak of the first dose.</p><p>T+2:00  Definitely I am restored to a more comfortable position, although again, not quite up to the pleasant, empathic euphoria I felt at the peak of the first dose. Im working furiously and getting much done, but I do feel that Im jumping from task to task, and becoming distracted by emails that could be deferred, were I more focused and disciplined.  Although MDPV leaves me in a distracted state, it is clearly a great work aid.  I think to myself that its better to get much done in a haphazard fashion, than not much done in an organized fashion.</p><p>T+2:30  Im not feeling as though I am coming down yet, which indicates the second dose pushed things out a bit i.e. a longer duration was achieved after the 2nd dose than was achieved by the 1st  dose.  All other effects are the same as previously mentioned.  I really enjoy writing on this substance. I feel more articulate and expressive than usual.  My typing skills are not adversely effected, rather, I feel like my accuracy is improved.</p><p>T+3:00  I started feeling sketchy about five minutes ago (jitters, hollow feeling in the gut, lack of euphoria).  Its time to insufflate the 3rd dose (7 mg). A reduction in the sketchy feelings begins to occur within 10 minutes, however, muscle tension continues increasing in my middle back and the dose has no reducing effect in this regard (i.e. it is not an effective analgesic as say, MDMA or Methylone can be).  This is not unusual as my pain level often does increase as the work-day progresses, but generally not to this degree.  I continue to enjoy my work more than usual, and go at it zealously, taking a great deal more pride in the quality of the outputs than I usually do.</p><p>T+4:00  The third dose reduced the sketchy come-down feelings somewhat, but not entirely.  Not a lot has changed over the past hour. Im still very motivated and working effectively and efficiently, drawing graphs and crunching spreadsheet data and doing some very creative and professional report writing, but Im not feeling as comfortable overall.  I feel jittery and tense, and have a similar unease that I would feel from being under-nourished.  Id like to take some hydrocodone for the muscle tension, but I dont want to alter my perception of this experiment, so Im grinding through it, and trying to stay relaxed. </p><p>My heart rate is now about 76 BPM, a bit closer to normal for me, and pupils are unchanged: moderately dilated, but I could probably face a cop or M.D. without raising suspicions.  I decide to take the 4th dose (4 mg insufflated) at exactly T+4:00.  Not a lot of difference was noted 10 minutes after snorting that dose as with others.  I just snorted some oxymetazoline nasal spray to see if I might wash some accumulated stray particles of the substance from my nasal hairs on to some receptor areas. </p><p>T+5:00  This last hour slipped by without much thought of physical discomfort, and Ive been steadily (and perhaps with a rather obsessive attention to detail with respect to my reports wording and style) churning out my work with a strong sense of accomplishment.  I suspect the nasal spray might have increased the effect of the last dose somewhat, bringing home some of the substance that hadnt yet been metabolized by my nasal lining.  This is not to say I have returned to the initial euphoria, I have just not been as focused on discomfort.</p><p>T+5:30  With some discomfort returning over the past little while, I decide to snuffle up the last 4 mg. After about ten minutes I am feeling more of the jittery effects and less of the euphoria returning. I am beginning to suppose that the MDPV has run out its useful course for the day.  Time to consider unwinding with a glass of wine and some hydrocodone to ease my tension and discomfort, re-asserting that this discomfort is not severe and is quite manageable. Not unlike the way I feel after coming down from MDMA but more tense.  The remainder of the evening is spent in this state, watching a movie. </p><p>T+10:00 - Bed time was rather hellish. Despite taking a battery of sedatives which I wouldnt advocate for others (cyclobenzaprine (10 mg), alprazolam (0.25 mg), diphenhydramine (25 mg), dimenhydrinate (50 mg), melatonin (3 mg) and a glass of wine) I was rendered thoroughly unable to sleep.  However, some interesting yet annoying effects were occurring. I found myself typing out my inner dialogue in my minds eye.  I could picture the words that I was thinking being typed out on my keyboard as they occurred to me, in perfect visual accordance with the QWERTY keyboard layout.  Behind closed eyelids, my eyes shot from key to key in rapid movements, typing every letter of every word, as I thought them.  In addition, random words and phrases would pop into my head spontaneously at times, such as pipe organ or theology or walking stick ... and as fast as these words would pop in to my mind, I would visualize typing them on the keyboard. Yes ... this was interesting, but utterly maddening.</p><p>After a half hour of this nonsense, I rose to have an additional 0.5 mg of Xanax washed down with a slug of white wine, and I returned to bed. Perhaps another half hour of mind-typing, and I finally fell into a deep sleep, rising the next morning feeling deeply groggy.</p><p>T+24:00 (next day)  Im at the office and still quite wired. My jaw is clenching and I feel amped, although I am able to get work done so the performance aspects of the substance are still at play.</p><p>T+48:00 (second day)  Stimulating effects are still present.  I feel tension in my jaw and it is beginning to be quite annoying.  Im still able to work effectively.</p><p>T+57:00 (9:00 PM  yes, more than two days later!)  Im out with friends at a club, and complaining to them about my tense jaw. I think all other effects are gone at this point, but my jaw still feels tired, and I find myself with an un-necessary amount of tension in my face.</p><p>T+66:00 (6:00 AM on third day)  I wake up on the third day, and I finally feel back to normal. </p><p>Summary:</p><p>I think a diminishing dosing regimen is an effective way to reduce, but not eliminate negative come-down effects.  The big mistake I made here was the size of the total dose.  It was just too much, plain and simple, and the residual stimulation was horrendous. I found myself regretting the plan overall.</p><p>As a follow up experiment a couple of weeks later, I tried taking a total of 16 mg, orally this time, in 4 - 4 mg doses separated by 1.5 hour intervals.  This proved to be a more reasonable total dose, but I was still left with uncomfortable come-down effects.  All in all, it was an effective dose for getting things done, but I find little to no recreational value in this drug. As a performance enhancer it is useful, however, certainly not ideal, and inferior to Ritalin, which has similar effects with fewer side-effects.</p><p>I think the dose could be lowered still.  Next experiment, will be to do 10 mg in 4 small doses.</p><p>Thank you for reading. I hope this was informative.</p>",
