  "Before I start the story about the experience I want to first explain my background a little with chemicals and plants. Over the last three years of my life I made it my mission to experience the world in as many ways possible and to see the world for what it really is. This desire lead me to trying a wide variety of substances. Many of the substances have been consumed many times at varying dosages. These include, LSD, 2C-B, 2C-E,2C-I, 4-AcO-DMT, Mescaline, Mushrooms, DMT (smoked and eaten with Syrian Rue), MDA, MDMA, DOC, MXE, 25I-NBome, and Nitrous.",
  "The Setting",
  "My girlfriend and I were told by a friend that he had a Vial of the best LSD he'd ever taken. Naturally my girlfriend and I thought we better get over to check it out before it was all gone. We arrived at my friend's house and were greeted by him and his girlfriend. We proceeded to sit down around a table to catch up and smoke a little hash. Then my friend's gf went to their bedroom and brought out a small plastic dropper with a clear liquid substance filling the dropper. She claimed it was the 'best lsd' that she got from family. Naturally I was skeptical as I rarely find real LSD in my area.",
  "Time of Dose - approx 10p.m.",
  "I would place time markers for this experience but Time is a joke during this; I was totally outside of Time/Reality as you will soon read.",
  "The Experience",
  "My friend placed two drops of liquid underneath my tongue and told me to let it absorb underneath my tongue, not to swallow. He also placed two drops underneath my gf's tongue with the same instruction. We sat back down at the table and continued to talk about the past week and also to do a few nitrous balloons. Approximately 15 minutes after the drops were placed under the tongue the effects of the liquid could be clearly felt and seen.\r[Erowid Note: This report is written as a 25I-NBOMe report but the timeline information below suggests that the majority of the described effects are more accurately attributable to nitrous oxide. Most reports of 25I-NBOMe suggest a much longer course of action.]",
  "The come-up was fast and hard. Electrifying, vibrating, intense, but clean. No negative effects were felt during the come-up. Everything was breaking up waves of energy that could be clearly seen. It became clear that everything in the room was being created by 100's of little spiral boxes of energy waves. It was not fluid, not like a sign wave. It was all lines, like a stock market graph. As these little TV screens of spiral energy waves became my reality it became difficult to remember which waves were people and which were walls and it honestly didn't really matter. I focused my attention towards one of the spiral boxes of energy and it separated from the group slowly engulfing all of my visual perception until I passed through the spiral energy wave. BLIP! As I reached the spiral energy wave I was instantly teleported back to my gf and friends sitting in the room we were in, doing what we were just doing but something was different. I watched my friend get up and walk around the table to place a cd into the cd player, the girls were talking. As he reached the cd player he opened it and placed into it a cd, closed the tray, and began the journey back to his chair. This is when it gets weird, and I must emphasize weird!",
  "He touches his chair and just as he touches his chair I can see time slowing down, the two girls voices beegiiinnnn toooo beeee streeeechhhhedd outttt reaaalllly slowwwwlllllyyyy. I look at my buddy and he slowly is moving in reverse, step by step just as he had done a moment before. I watched him in reverse walk back to the cd player open the cd player, remove the disk he just placed in, set it back on the pile close the cd player walk backwards to his chair. Things begin to slow down again. For a moment, Time freezes, all of my friends are on pause. I'm not trying to say that in my head I saw the world, my friends, everything on pause. I mean literally through my own eyes in this Universe I paused the world. I was scared, I was clearly delusional. 3-D my safe world totally delusional. I broke the world, I broke Time. As the world sat on pause I decided to move, I stood up from my chair and began walking around all my friends on pause. I touched them, I touched the walls, it was all real yet so unbelievable.",
  "Suddenly the frozen universe around me breaks apart into little cubes the size of my hand. 3-D cubes like 3-D pixels, they span outward into all directions, up, down, front, back, left, right. I do not break into cubes though, I maintain my body. I am able to walk/float through the gaps in between the cubes. Almost as soon as I learn to navigate this broken cube reality two black orbs that appear as miniature black wholes appear around me, distorting the reality I am perceiving. I begin to feel like I am out of place, I begin to feel that I am breaking reality. I move back to my chair and sit just as I sat before. As I sit, the cubes return to their original place to rebuild the 3-D world that I call home. I see my friends and my gf sitting still frozen in time. I want it to come back, I want them to move but they do not. I begin to try and make them move by thinking. I close my eyes, reopen them. Things are moving, but not like I expected. I see my friend and both girls made totally out of balloons. Even I am made out of balloons. I don't mean that we looked kinda like balloons, I mean I smelled like balloons, I touched myself and felt like balloons, and I could feel the air flowing through me. I looked to the floor and saw a little tube attached to my feet seeming to put air into my body. That's when I notice that my head is expanding, all our heads are expanding. My gf's head pops, my buddy's gf's head pops. I remember thinking, 'oh no, who's heads next', I notice little heads coming out of their balloon bodies though, it's going to be ok. Just as fast as I was here I suddenly find myself back in normal reality but frozen. It slowly starts moving! I am so happy! I can hear their voices slowly speeding back to normal. I watch my buddy walk around the table and put in the cd that I had watched him put into the player what seemed like 20 minutes before.He walks back and sits down. I look at them all and say, 'WOW, Did you guys just see that?'. Of course they didn't, I began to try and ramble it out. It's all nonsense. They don't understand.",
  "This was the end of being totally delusional but it was hardly the end of the experience. Throughout the night I continued to have conversations with my friends and gf but they do not recall these conversations. I would be talking to one of them for two minutes and then I'd say something they would look at me and say, 'what?' I would look back and be like, you don't remember any of what we just talked about? They said that we never had been talking. I would just chuckle and continue with the night, happy to be back in a world I was familiar with.",
  "There was one more very interesting part of this experience. During a majority of the comedown I was able to control my friends and my gf with my mind. I don't mean in a sinister way, I mean that if I began to think dirty thoughts my friend and his gf would begin to get dirty, right in front of me. If I thought them saying something they would say it, through their own mouth in their voice. I could literally make them do anything. Having said that, I didn't make them do anything in fact I spent most of my time attempting to meditate as to not interrupt free-will. It seemed very important to me that I did not interfere with free-will while I had the ability to do this.",
  "Time off dose - approx 4a.m. I was able to drive around 6a.m. Still felt groggy though.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
  "Final Thoughts - I don't see the world the same anymore, it is impossible. While I've found how to see the beauty in my new found knowledge I don't recommend it to others. I've seen through my own eyes what reality is, how we perceive it and how it's created. I've stepped outside of Time. I've stepped out of place. I've been my own friends and had full length conversations with myself through their bodies. Ever since this experience I've had little desire to trip. I have a few times, but it's mostly taken away the desire. It is also important to remember the basic rules to tripping. SET, SETTING, DRUG, DOSE - I was in an kind of familiar place but didn't feel completely comfortable, I didn't know my buddies gf that well and she was the one who acquired the vial, she did not realize that what she had was actually 25I-NBOMe not LSD, I wish I knew how much of this I did, but two drops is hardly a reliable calculator seeing as none of them had remotely close this type of experience, they noticed barley anything except some decent visuals."
