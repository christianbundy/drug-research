 "report": "<p>I bought 25g blue/25g scullcap off a local website. I am not a smoker so I decided boil tea out of it instead. I started off with the recommended dosage which according to the bag was 5g, I had it stir for about 40 minutes in a big cup. I then drank the substance quite fast and on an empty stomache. After 60 minutes I felt absolutely nothing so I decided to wait another hour, and still nothing.</p><p>The next day I decided to try a higher dosage - about 10-12g. It had the same result.. NOTHING. At this time I was becoming slightly dissapointed and decided to email the website about it. The reply was: 'you are probably very unsensitive to blue lotus. We have an extract which I will send to you for free. In the meanwhile, try putting what you have left of the lotus in a winebottle overnight, then filter the wine and drink it'. So I did. Which only resulted in a very bad tasting wine and STILL NO EFFECT.</p><p>During a couple days I tried mixing scullcap with lotus, 5-10 times the recommended dosage and nothing ever happened. So when the extract finally came in the mail I thought, well finally I might get my moneys worth. Hell no. Nothing. Absolutely bloody no effect.</p><p>So, from now on Ill save my money and buy alcohol instead, it does have effect and it's cheaper.</p>",
