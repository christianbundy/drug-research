  "I bought this peyote powder for $20 for '2 doses'. I wasnt really educated but I figured it was a one-time deal, so I bought it. Waiting for a good time to do it is hard when youre young, so when we had a weekday off of school I knew it was the right time. I gave the friend that held the peyote half for helping me out.",
  "So this stuff was fine grain powder, a greenish color with red, brown and orange speckles. I mixed it in with a milkshake and was off. First drink, horrible, made me want to throw it out and just stay sober. But I fought through and in 10 minutes, the green milkshake was gone. So now it was time to wait the time was about 7:15. After my friend finished his, we headed up to his brothers room to chill.",
  "At 7:45 I vomited my guts out. But then I felt better. This is when the trip began. My friends brother had this mushroom poster and it was tripping me to death. Peyote doesnt really make me out of control or dumber, but more or less simply different. I was looking a everything different. Well then I took a few hits off a bong and went into a dream world. It was really fun, listening to the doors and chilling, looking at colors and patterns were the funnest.",
  "Peyote was a great experience but it wasnt what I predicted, I thought I was going to be in a dream world, with floating colors and magic, but I was just seeing very little and felt like it was impossible to move. My body tingled the whole time."
