 "report": "<p>I have been taking psychoactives for a little over 2 1/2 years now.  When i saw how little info there was on gabapentin, i decided to share my story just for some extra information.</p><p>The first time that i tried it i snorted two of the little capsules with 300 mg each.  All i remember is going out into the living room to watch tv, and then waking up the next day on the couch. This intrigued me because i dont even remember feeling tired.</p><p>Knowing that insufflation is a quicker method of administration, thus not giving me time to observe 'coming up', i then took two tabs orally the next day.  30 minutes later i snorted a half of one and my friend took the other half in a couple of lines.</p><p>We then smoked a bowl of chronic.</p><p>About an hour after we smoked i started noticing some threshold effects.  I felt kind of lathargic and it took me a little extra time to react to external stimuli.  Not euphoric, but not unpleasant. </p><p>Feeling the initial effects and wanting to explore into this chemical a little bit more i then decided to snort one more pill. An oh boy am i glad i did!</p><p>The sedation intensified and i entered a world similar to valium but with more coke-like thought processes.  Kind of hard to explain.  The body high was similar to alcohol and barbs but not exactly.</p><p>The real interesting thing about this drug is the classification for recreational use. The crazy thing was that i got some mild visual hallucinations at a fairly low dosage.</p><p>There was a girl sitting in front of me in class.  It looked like smoke was rising out of her hair, very strange.  If you have ever tripped diphenhydramine/ dimenhydrinate the visuals are pretty spot on like that.  But without the shitty cottonmouth.</p><p>All in all Gabapentin takes a long time to come up and when I'm high, I just want to go to sleep.  But some good feelings and mild visuals were attained.</p>",
