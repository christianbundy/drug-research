 "report": "<p>I was given Ambien in 1997 in order to alleviate my insomnia. My insomnia is closely connected to my Bipolar Disorder. When I began seeing commercials for the temporary use of Ambien, I began to question why I was still on it. I tried to stop on my own, but became very anxious and upset each time I went to bed. It's 12 years later and I've been taking 10mg every single night since first being prescribed.</p>",
