  "<p>One day, I happened to be rummaging around my pantry for some food, and I found a bunch of pills.",
  "I looked up what they were, and low and behold found out that they were opiates. So, for about three weeks I held on to them, taking 1 or 2 at school about 4 times. Although I liked the feeling that the 1 or 2 pills gave me, I wanted to try a larger dose. So, I decided to take 5 pills one night to see what would happen.",
  "I am not an experienced drug user by any means. Weed maybe a couple times a month, Alchohol maybe once a week or more, DXM twice, and MDMA once.",
  "T+ 00:00",
  "5 pills of 7.5 Hydrocodone each, taken orally, on an empty stomach.",
  "T+ 00:15",
  "Warm fuzzy feeling that accompanies opiates. Sense of well being and mild euphoria.",
  "T+ 00:30",
  "Feeling very tired, beginning to nod off. Warm fuzzy feeling still there.",
  "T+ 01:00 hrs",
  "Completely knocked out. I am slipping in and out, almost a semi-sleeping state. I can still hear and understand people talking, but I am very incapacitated. Unable to speak lucidly or move beyond a slugish crawl.",
  "T+ 03:00 through T+ 04:00",
  "I can move and talk again, although not very well. Feel completely zoned out, with a nice euphoria similar to alcohol, very mild nausea.",
  "T+ 05:00 through T+ 06:00",
  "Effects reduced to a nice buzz, I seem more sociable and happy to my friends.",
  "In conclusion, the experience was not too bad. I liked the euphoric effects and zonked out feeling I got. The 2 hours or so that I was completely dead weren't especially interesting. They slipped by rather quickly actually, and I found myself laughing internally and thinking 'wowwwww...' alot. All in all, a nice experience, but not quite as wonderful as I expected. Perhaps next time I will reduce dosage to 3 or 4 pills at a time and just space them out over a couple of hours in order to produce the nice euphoria and reduced the cracked-out feeling that I got.</p>"
