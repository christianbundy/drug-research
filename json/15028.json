 "report": [
  "Ate about 125 milligrams in gel caps on rather full stomach. Was probably still a bit stoned from previously smoked pot. Definite alert in about half an hour, some mild psychedelia and definitely the same warm glow as from ecstasy developed. No visuals, but a deeper focus on things and a somewhat widened consciousness.",
  "No problem functioning or interacting with people. I guess most of my friends didn't notice a thing, my eyes seemed pretty normal and I was fully in control of my behavior. Cannabis felt truly wonderful (like with ecstasy, and other phenethylamines...).",
  "Had a good time walking in the midsummer night with a couple of friends who were also doing some chemical research. Couldn't stay inside with other guys & girls who would just stare the tv and drink beer and/or smoke pot. We went to a park to smoke the rest of our weed and had fun just being curious.",
  "After a few hours there was still a strong stimulant effect as i rode home by bike. Felt probably a little like being on an SSRI as somebody suggested; I tried citalopram for a couple of days a while ago but didn't like it one bit. This was definitely a better state of mind :)",
  "This gradually subsided and I got to sleep about 8 hours after ingestion with the help of 2mg melatonin and a lot more pot.",
  "The next morning there was a little stretched-out feeling, but felt generally ok. Would probably try a 150-200 mg dose the next time... if a next time ever comes. Interesting stuff anyway, I'm glad I tried it."
