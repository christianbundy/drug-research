 "report": [
  "At 5:00 pm I began drinking cheap beer in preparation for an outdoor concert.  Around 7:30 pm I ingested 1 hit of blotter LSD of unknown potency. I felt the LSD kicking in around 8 pm when we arrived at the concert.  It seemed weak, so I ingested 50-60 mg MXE.  By 9:00 pm I had an intense body high as well as some visuals.  Nothing seemed unexpected, until after the show around 11:00 pm.  I experienced the usual difficulty with walking expected from the dissociative, however when I arrived at home the hallucinations became much more intense and I began to lose consciousness. From 11:30 pm to 1:30 am my memory is hazy. I remember feeling like being on a space ship and telling my friends I was flying to planet awesome, with mostly visual hallucinations.  By 2:00 am I was asleep. After 10 hours of sleep I felt sober, however I regret not researching the combinatorial effects of hallucinogens and dissociatives."
