  "<p>After getting done with another geat Salvia trip I am beginning to see a definite pattern in what I experience.  Everytime without fail I get into this 'other' life.  The same one every time and I feel ashamed of myself when it starts to go away. ",
  "I always feel like I am neglecting this other life when I start to come down.  There are the same strange beings that are always there and the same type of occurences.  It always take place in front of this garage and I think I'm working on this car... fixing the bumper.  It's always seem like another normal life that I can only feel when I'm on Salvia.  I never think I am on the drug when I am feeling this but I always do have this feeling of fleeting.  I know it doesn't last long and always wish I could stay (when I'm on it).  I just think it's kind of funny that it can be the same every time unlike any other hallucinogen I have ever tried where every time is always a different experience.</p>"
