 "report": "<p>I started taking ginkgo because my bud smoking was doing mean things to my short term memory (actually Im stoned now). 2 capsules  a day. a month later Im able to recall childhood memories in way more detail(Im 20), concentration has definitely improved and I feel Im using a broader vocabulary in normal daily conversations (acid was the one who made me read the dictionary in the first place). Short term memory is still fucked, especially when I forget to take ginkgo for a day or maybe my keys just like playing hide and seek.</p>"
