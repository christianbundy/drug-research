 "report": "<p>Got a call night before last that a special young lady was visiting some friends and that she'd brought some 2c-e and 2c-I with her. My pal told me to bring some of my cannacaramels over and to pack for a long night. I arrived to find a couple of people just starting to come on to their doses so I bellied up to the bar for my dose. The young lady handed me a gelcap with a little white powder at the bottom. I asked her if the whole thing was too much to snort and she said yes but I snorted about 2/3 and swallowed the rest. It burned like hell and turned my face into a mess of tears and snot. After this cleared up I started to get a bit of nausea menwhile profound visual disturbances started to kick in. I felt like i'd taken a mild dose of MDMA and some weird LSD.</p><p>My nausea built till I was talking in technicolor all over the back yard. The nausea cleared and I found myself tripping balls. We smoke a few joits and the bong was going non stop but we never got it together enough to make any music that night. We did fuck around a little but we were all way too out there to even dance without knocking shit over.</p><p>I ended up taking a taxi home about 7 hours post dosing and i was still having minor visual disturbances. I got home and took care of my grow room and then hit the sack after popping 2mg klonopin. Woke up on my couch 24 hours later feeling none the worse!</p><p>Probably done with this whole class of drugs (except MDMA) bur I'm glad I tried it.</p>",
