 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: This person took up to 18 grams of acetaminophen (paracetamol) which can be dangerous to the liver if taken in very high doses; over 10 grams at a time can be fatal. The maximum daily dosage (adult) is 4 grams (this estimate is from emedicine.com, more on acetaminophen can be found through your favorite search engine). People with liver disease or who are regular users of alcohol are more at risk of liver failure from high doses of acetaminophen, even doses lower than 4 grams.]</p><p>Wednesday 20th august 2003.</p><p>Woke up at 6:10, not really feeling great. I suffer from depression and anxiety. But ready to go to work anyway. The day was going fine until around lunch time. I got my usual once a day panic attack and went of to have lunch. I felt really stressed and thought I'd give my dealer a call in hope to chill with some pot after work. No luck, he was dry and I was fucked.</p><p>This was one of the worst moods I had gotten myself into in a long time and was struggling to finish the day. I went to the chemist on the way home to acquire a pack of 50 panadiene(8mgs codiene 450 paracetamol). I got home and immediately started crushing 20 pills. I did the cold water extraction, But as my mood was extremely low and I wasn't really thinking. I did it all in about 10 mins, obviously I didn't extract much Paracetamol at all.</p><p>At around 8:30 I drank the mixture, just thinking of the taste now makes me sick. I then got into a warm bath, and thought a bourbon and coke would go down well, bad mistake#2. I got out of the bath at about 9 and jumped into bed. I love codiene and laying in a dark room, it's somewhat theraputic. I dozed off to sleep within 15 mins so I guess I didn't really get to feal all of the codiene.</p><p>Then, shock and awe, I woke up at quarter to 11 with huge huge stomach pains (I realise now it was my liver not stomach) I ran into my mums room and told her what I had done, she was tempted to leave me sit it out and suffer for my stupidity. But I couldn't handle it, I was screeming my head off at her to get me to the fucking hospital. We got into the car and she ran every red light on the way to the hospital, I was grateful for this and the fact that the hospital was only 5 mins away, if that.</p><p>I got to the car park in huge pain and threw myself on the grass and stuck my fingers down my throat, trying to induce vomiting oping it would help. I couldn't do it, I just couldn't hurl. Within a min a nurse came out with a wheel chair and carted me into the e.r.</p><p>I pass out. I woke up around 12 hours later hooked up to heartbeat monitors and a drip. They pumped some sort of glucose mixture into me via drip. At around 4 in the afternoon the morning I woke up, a doctor came in and told me that I didn't do so well on the liver function test and that they were going to keep me there and keep pumping me full of glucose until the problem was resolved. Friday at around 3 in the afternoon I was finally discharged. My liver (luckily) was not subject to permanent damage and the doctors informed me that next time I won't be so lucky.</p><p>I didn't attempt suicide, all I wanted was a cone, but instead got myself checked into an e.r. Paracetamol overdoses are about as fun as a 3 day hangover. Only my close family knows what really happened and I'm glad it did. It has given me a new lease on life.</p>",
