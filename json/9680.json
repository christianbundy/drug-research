 "report": "<p>I was first turned on to crank in the late 80's when i was a teenager.  I remember thinking, 'I want to feel this way for the rest of my life!'.  I started out just doing a line or two on weekends, then after I was married my husband got hooked up with a dealer and we soon started selling.  Well with all that crank in the house the world was my oyster!  I stayed up for days at a time, went gambling all the time and spent way too much money.  I soon lost my job and the desire to do anything but tweak out in my house.  I was doing a gram a day at this point, my weight had plummeted and my hair was falling out.  I was not a healthy sight.  I picked at my skin constantly and smoked like a fiend.  Paranoia was constant.  I remember locking myself in the bathroom upstairs on time and putting duct tape over the windows because I thought people could see me.</p><p>After about 5 years of this crap going on we finally started getting away from dealing and I decided to get a job.  I used off and on for the next 5 years or so and now have been clean for about 6 months.  I cannot describe fully how my life has been altered by this drug.  There is just no way to describe it properly.  I was a walking shell of a human being for over 10 years of my life, and I don't know if I will ever get over it.</p>",
