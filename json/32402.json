 "report": "<p>I bought some ginkgo foliage and started making tea from it. This is a great way to start the morning! My mind feels clearer and I feel that I can think faster and have more energy. There may even be some slight visual enhancement, but I'm not sure. Noticeable effects seem to last a couple hours, but the positive effects last for most of the day.</p><p>My usual dose is about 1g in 1 cup of water. Combine these in a pot, heat it up on the stove on high until boiling, then let it lightly boil on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Pour into a cup, filtering out the residue, which should leave a bit less than a cup of water. The taste is not too bad, though the taste gets stronger near the bottom of the cup.</p><p>As a side note, smoking the leaf (a hit or two from a water pipe) definitely has an effect, but I'm not sure what and it doesn't last long.</p>",
