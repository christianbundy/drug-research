 "report": "<p>I had always wanted a pond but never had the space. Well needless to say i found the space and began to look for a water lilly. having heard about the egyptian blue i proceded to look for one. i came to find out it's rather rare. but as i was at one aquatic store i came acrost a tropical hybrid that looked rather familiar. Dauben it was called. I had a hunch it was related just by the way it looked. to my suprise i was right. It's parents were Nymphea caerulea (egyptian blue) and micrantha. So i figured at the worst i'd have to double dosages being half the plant. I got about 3 flowers worth of petals and made a joint out of them.</p><p>Almost like weed but it dosn't make me as lethargic. Very light,  relaxing and indeed a good sleep aid. I'd highly recomend this to pot as there is no side effects i noticed as the week went by. the smoke is harsh so a bong would be a good idea. onset was about 15 min and lasts for a few hours. I'm going to experiment more as my plant makes more flowers.</p>",
