  "After a week of back pain I finally broke down and wanted to try some of my friends pills. This was the first time I have tried this drug and I wasn't sure what to expect. So I watched some TV and left the pills on the counter. I just wanted to look at the pros and cons of taking a pill I knew nothing about.",
  "+8:30 pm PST",
  "That's it!!! I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to numb this pain. I am a regular user of MDMA and just like everything else you should know your source and your body. So I split the pill and took half.",
  "+9:30 pm PST",
  "No adverse reaction no pain relief either. I take the other half and go down to the spa hoping that the pill might kick in. Damn there were some hot chicks in the spa......",
  "+10:00 pm PST",
  "Out of the spa and walking back to the house I felt a little out of the norm. Almost like a mild drunkness but not anything that was worth noting.",
  "10:30 pm PST",
  "These pills suck they don't do much. Or so I thought. So I took my second pill. As I was watching TV I suddenly realized that I was going into a dreamy phase. Things were still normal. I would say that they reacted very slow.",
  "11:00 pm PST",
  "Second pill is going pretty well. I am feeling no pain and I feel totally relaxed. I got to the point where TV was no more fun so I left for bed. I was out in a flash.",
  "The only other thing I can compare my experiance to is taking two shots of nyquil. I mean I felt more relaxed and less drowsy but overall it was the same affect. I would recomend that you take the prescribed amount and if you are getting some from a friend start off with one and split the second tab. Better to be safe than sorry.",
  "PEACE OUT.................."
