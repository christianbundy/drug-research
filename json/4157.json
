 "report": "<p>\nI got fresh ground nutmeg powder from the health food store and losely filled 8 empty gel caps (available in the supplement section of health food stores).  I ate these along with 8 caps of Kava Kava powder.  The Kava caps were strong, containing 30% Kavaloids (compared to 2.5% of some brands).  Effects were felt some half hour later as my muscles relaxed and my mind slowed.  The wave of relaxation came on strong and quickly and felt like a low dose of ecstasy.  I attribute the euphoric body feeling to the Kava.  As my body relaxed my mental state was subtly changing too.  This I felt was the nutmeg acting. </p><p>My thoughts were fluid and creative, less bound by patterns, and loving like a marijauna high.  Unlike marijauna, though, my thinking was focused and clear like in meditation.  The entire day I felt in touch with truth.  I had patience with people and in situations that usually annoy me and found it easy to concentrate.  There was dry mouth and a slight headache.  I repeated this for the next two days without any hang over or problems working.  I love these mellow plants.</p>",
