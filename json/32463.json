 "report": "<p>I had high hopes for methylone, as the few reports I'd seen seemed to be extremely positive, and a few individuals even stated that they found it superior to MDMA. Im personally not a fan of MDMA, and tend to describe it as making me feel ignorantly blissful. Other peoples experiences made me think that methylone was more honest in its effects.</p><p>It was a beautiful day, spring was in full force. It had been a wet winter for me at school, and the unexpected sunshine and warm breeze was a welcome respite. I was home for the weekend and decided that it would be the perfect time to test out this new substance. Muse was with me and we both decided that if everything went well she would try methylone for herself. She doesnt handle psychoactive substances too well, having bad experiences on cannabis (I have had some paranoia problems on it as well and no longer smoke it in any regularity), but I believed that methylone may be a good compound to open her eyes to the beauty that entheogens can bring.</p><p>I drank 150mg of methylone mixed with some Coke, the taste was noticeable but not too bad. Muse and I went outside for a bit to enjoy the sunshine. About fifteen minutes later I began feeling some of the first alerts that Ive noticed from the phenethylamines Ive been working with. We went back indoors, and as Muse was feeling a bit hungry I made her a sandwich.</p><p>About half an hour to 45 minutes after ingestion the methylone began coming on. I was sitting on my bed when a warmth began in my solar plexus and began to radiate outwards. It was very reminiscent of MDMA, but I didnt feel an increased stimulation that definitely accompanied my MDMA experience. The rush also was not as intense as MDMA, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. It seemed as with each breath the warmth would spread further throughout my being. It was impossible not to smile.</p><p>A calm and intense, euphoric focus seemed to take over. It was as if I had emerged from a deep meditative state. There was an extreme tactile enhancement, and it felt beautiful to just sit on my bed and breathe. Colors seemed brighter and everything became more focused, I could see finer details within my surroundings.</p><p>I remained in this extremely blissful state, feeling my heart being slowly opened, for about 45 minutes. During the rush it felt as though all I could do was sit and breathe. At one point I decided to meditate for a few minutes. It seemed extremely easy to enter a focused state that for me is difficult to achieve until after a good ten minutes in meditation.</p><p>After this I seemed to enter a new phase of the experience. I still felt the same euphoria, but now felt the incredible urge to talk to Muse. I wanted her to know me, I wanted to explain my world to her, and I did. Insights came extremely easily. I thought about my first experience with 5-MeO-DMT that had just occurred a couple days earlier and I was able to integrate much of the experience. I felt extremely fortunate to be able to do this, as my 5-MeO-DMT trip was an incredibly experience, but was very hard to put into words.</p><p>For quite a while now, Ive been coming up with my own spiritual beliefs. Many of my spiritual ideas have come to me while tripping, but seemed to be very subtle and hard to grasp. While under methylones influence these vague ideas became very tangible. I was able to speak very fluently to Muse about the Cosmic Consciousness that I firmly believe in; the Cosmic Consciousness of which all the Universe is a part of. I came to great conclusions to the purpose of human beings within this Universe. We are here to learn, and unlike the trees and the sky we have the incredibly important task of taking upon ourselves an identity. We must take this risk to be able to gain the knowledge that is otherwise unobtainable. These beliefs are still felt as strongly within me as while on methylone, and after I have the time to truly integrate and express these beliefs I will be sure to share them with the world.</p><p>I felt an incredible love for the world. I looked at Muse and saw the incredible beauty that she possesses. I looked at the trees and the vines that cover my house. I felt a deep love and caring for them, it reminded me of the first few mushroom experiences that Ive had.</p><p>After about 3 hours I knew the experience was coming to an end. I was sad that I was leaving this euphoric place, but I was extremely grateful for it, and unlike MDMA, I knew that my positive insights would stay with me for a long time. The come-down was accompanied by an extreme lethargy that was rather pleasurable, I longed to sleep, but Muse was intent on trying methylone and I was more than happy to share the experience with her.</p><p>The lethargic come-down ended after half an hour, although a tiredness did remain. I accompanied Muse on what I know was an incredible experience for her. It was great to know that she was in the same place that I was a couple hours before.</p><p>This was one of the best experiences Ive had the pleasure to have. While it wasnt exactly psychedelic, much like MDMA in these regards, it was filled with insight and meaning that is invaluable to me. I was a little worried about lingering depression, as MDMA leaves me with an awful depression for the following week, but the opposite seemed to happen. For both Muse and I the following week was very happy, the methylone seemed to have an antidepressant effect for both of us.</p><p>Methylone is a good one, and I know that it will hold a special place in my heart. My only concern is that the urge to take the compound is great, and Im sure that its magic will be lost with abuse. I plan on restricting my usage to once or twice a year, to look back and reflect on the new changes in my life.</p>",
