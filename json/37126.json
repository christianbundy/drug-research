 "report": "<p>Tuesday morning: I wake up at seven o'clock and REALLY dont want to go to school today, I take a shower and get dressed. Then a thought hits me, NUTMEG! I had had a jar of whole ones for ages, and had tried them before with no effects whatsoever. Anyway, after getting dressed, i ground up 5 nuts and mixed them with 3 pints of milk, and drank the concoction. This may sound nasty to anyone who has tried nutmeg before, but all i could taste was the milk. This was at about seven twenty. I then had breakfast, and at about eight o'clock, grated and drank two more in milk. I used a cheese grater, (a tip: if you grate it real slow then the resulting dust is much finer and easier to get down, thats what i found anyway.)</p><p>The effects started to kick in noticably at around 1:30 pm, at about two thirty i was feeling like id smoked around one and a half joints, by three it was more like 4 joints, by 6 i was so stoned i could hardly speak, (it came out all slurred and dumb, no matter how hard i tried). I went to bed at ten and fella sleep straight away. The next morning i felt quite dizzy when i woke up, but thats all. This dizziness persisted until about 11am. I had no side effects except moderate drymouth that went on for about 3 days.</p>",
