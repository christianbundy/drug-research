  "t+00:45 - nothing, slight headache forming.",
  "t+01:00 - don't know what went wrong. I thought 600mg would be enough. I feel really, really tired. Could be because I had to work all night.. hmm.",
  "t+01:30 - I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eyes, but nothing intense. Headache comes and goes. It's bearable.",
  "t+01:50 took another 150mg in fourths. Got one more, we'll see if I need it. This makes a total of 750mg. I am having trouble speaking, but I can still get everything out. Just going to lay around and avoid interaction with others. I hope I see something.",
  "t+02:15 not much has changed. It takes some time to comprehend things. My mouth is really dry. Still really tired. Finding it hard to swallow. Going to take the last 150mg I have for a grand total of 900mg. If this doesn't do it, then I'm going to bed.",
  "t+03:00 more things happening in the corner of my eye. Nothing different. I'm going to bed."
