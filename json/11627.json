  "<p>A friend (J) and I each took one tablet (75 mg) of amitriptyaline at 9:00pm Tuesday night.",
  "9:00pm: Dosed.",
  "9:45pm: Nothing.",
  "10:00pm: Decided to walk to the grocery, about 15 minutes walking distance away. By the time we got there, we both noticed slurred speech, tingling in the extremities; and I noticed walking difficulties and slowed movement.",
  "10:50pm: Back in the apartment; no true hallucinations or feelings of euphoria (speaking on behalf of J as well).",
  "11:00pm: I alone dosed 40 mg diphenhydramine and one tablet of 5-HTP; note that neither of these substances were ingested in correlation of the Amy - this was just to help me sleep.",
  "11:45pm: So tired I cannot move; J drifts in and out of sleep as well, reporting no interesting effects from the Amy aside from restless legs. I feel the same way.",
  "Midnight: Fell asleep in a weird state of mind; woke up 17 hours later.",
  "Not a very exciting drug, to say the least. I'll stick to sure-fire substances from now on.</p>"
