 "report": [
  "Ok first off all I want to say is that I've been on the web and read about Valerian. So I decided to do some self experiment. Over the whole night I insufflated 3 lines total. First I snorted 1 line waited 3 minutes then snorted another. I'm guessing these lines were roughly 50mg-60mg.",
  "After about 8 minutes I realized a relaxed state of mind. Not a state of mind you would expect on marijuana or alcohol, a new state of relaxation.",
  "At about 15 minutes there was a (very) mild body buzz. Almost as if your waking up from sleeping.",
  "Around 30 minutes a definite tiredness is noticed. Although I feel as if I have no worries. I wouldn't consider it a empathogen or mood raiser, the feeling was more apathy then happy relaxed state of mind.",
  "At 1 hour no effects noticed and I feel no more will come. The only thing noticed is the continued tiredness. I'm guessing this will stay for the rest of the night unless I eat something or drink and energy drink.",
  "Next time (if there is) I'll try a rough 200mg dose. And so up. Overall the drug was ok. A higher does is prefered but as an experiment it wasn't bad. There was no real after effects, except I slept exceptionally well that night and woke up rested."
