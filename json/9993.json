  "<p>To begin with, I had a therapist suggest Kava Kava as a method of relaxation.",
  "One night, smoking bud, I decided to lace a few bowls.  I took some capsules I had of pure ground Kava root and broke them up on an old magazine.  Then I rolled each bud in the powder and sprinkled some on top of the bowl just to make sure.  Four bowls of really dank bud and kava later, I was on the most calm, relaxing high of my life.",
  "I've repeated this process numerous times now and very much enjoy the effects. ",
  "The Kava seems to do three things:",
  "1) It eliminates any chance of a paranoid high.  A calm euphoria sweeps the mind leaving me stoned AND at peace with the world.",
  "2) It enhances creativity.  Kava/pot art is great.  Some how the high is more focused and expressive as opposed to being stoned stupid.",
  "3) It is maybe the best remedy for insomnia that I have ever found.  Sleeping on the two substances is relaxing on a different level.  Even my dreams tend to be better.",
  "The only real drawback is, if I have good weed, having to taste the kava, too.  however, it seems to improve the taste of brick-weed.  Kava, when smoked, is not bitter, but more peppery, unlike the gross taste of drinking kava.",
  "If I want to feel the effects more fully, I take some of the kava orally, too.  I take a few capsules before I smoke.  Hash is even more pleasent...I get a body high from hell when I combine all three...I intend to trip sometime with such a combination, hopefully.",
  "Goodluck and kava pleasent dreams...</p>"
