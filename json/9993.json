 "report": "<p>To begin with, I had a therapist suggest Kava Kava as a method of relaxation.</p><p>One night, smoking bud, I decided to lace a few bowls.  I took some capsules I had of pure ground Kava root and broke them up on an old magazine.  Then I rolled each bud in the powder and sprinkled some on top of the bowl just to make sure.  Four bowls of really dank bud and kava later, I was on the most calm, relaxing high of my life.</p><p>I've repeated this process numerous times now and very much enjoy the effects. </p><p>The Kava seems to do three things:</p><p>1) It eliminates any chance of a paranoid high.  A calm euphoria sweeps the mind leaving me stoned AND at peace with the world.</p><p>2) It enhances creativity.  Kava/pot art is great.  Some how the high is more focused and expressive as opposed to being stoned stupid.</p><p>3) It is maybe the best remedy for insomnia that I have ever found.  Sleeping on the two substances is relaxing on a different level.  Even my dreams tend to be better.</p><p>The only real drawback is, if I have good weed, having to taste the kava, too.  however, it seems to improve the taste of brick-weed.  Kava, when smoked, is not bitter, but more peppery, unlike the gross taste of drinking kava.</p><p>If I want to feel the effects more fully, I take some of the kava orally, too.  I take a few capsules before I smoke.  Hash is even more pleasent...I get a body high from hell when I combine all three...I intend to trip sometime with such a combination, hopefully.</p><p>Goodluck and kava pleasent dreams...</p>",
