  "<p>I heard about Ginko on a local radio station and decided to try it, got some from the local chemist (the strongest I could) and started taking it twice daily, as I remember they were 10 mg capsules.",
  "I didn't notice much in the way of memory, maybe improved short term.. and I dont remember being late for any appointments as I usually am (PERHAPS IT WAS GINKO!!!)",
  "Small things I remember, I could remember phone numbers without thinking about it and there is one occasion when somebody asked a maths question and the answer popped into my head instantly and I totally suck at mathematics.  (PERHAPS IT WAS GINKO!!!)",
  "I think its very good for its placebo like effect if anything.",
  "would like to see a test done, subtle effects that could probably be achieved with a healthy diet and actually using your brain once in a while.</p>"
