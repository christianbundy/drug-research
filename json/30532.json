 "substance": "Voacanga africana",
 "bodyweight": "280 lb",
 "report": "<p>I fasted for 5 hours.</p><p>I took 50 seeds and ground them up and put them in 00 caplets.  I washed them down with orange juice. I waited.  Twenty minutes go by and I notice I'm smiling and lying on the couch and I feel kind of tingly. I just want to sit on the couch and snuggle and feel of things. Things just feel good.</p><p>I usually have a very difficult time clearing my mind when I meditate, I notice that I am firmly planted in the here and now. It is as if my inner dialogue had been cut off. I am very calm.</p><p>At the 1 hour mark I notice a little nausea. Nothing I can't walk off though.</p><p>At the 2 hour mark I decide to go for a walk. It is dark. The lights of the cars are very nice. I need the light. I stare at neon signs, gas stations. Everything is very bright. If I look at a light I see the star pattern over it.</p><p>I am slow, I see things in a jerky, shaky movement kind of way. Like I am watching a movie and every other second is cut out of the film.</p><p>I get home and I don't lock the door. Not because I'm absent minded or forgot. I don't lock the door because I feel safe from the 'whatever' that we are afraid will come through our door. Which for me is odd. I'm usually very nervous.</p><p>All in all, it was a very interesting time. I took what I think for my size was a low dose.</p>",
