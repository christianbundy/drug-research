 "report": "<p>I recently bought 2 grams of 10x and 4 grams of 5x at a cheap price out of curiosity.  After having smoked this at 10 different times now and in different amounts, I'm confused and weirded out at the results.  Never once did the experience differ, only the strength changed depending on how much I smoked.</p><p>Each time I was stuck inside my body, connected over and over to my own body, as if my finger tip was the finger tip for 100 of my own fingers in different planes then my own body.  I could see all this.  And as the feeling comes down everything comes back into focus.  There is an unrelentless chattering, and a feeling that I am slipping away. </p><p>Each and every high is only ended when I fight my way back to reality.  It's like I'm dying, and need to pull myself back into my own body.  This is the most frightening thing I've ever experienced, and I've had bad trips on both heavy doses of mushrooms and LSD, neither of which are as unexplainable as the persistent and damaging high I get from salvia.  It almost seems like the ability for my brain to recognize sensory input is completely disconnected, therefore spacial positioning, sight, and sound are unintelligible, hence the confusion and feeling of dying and inability to move.</p>",
