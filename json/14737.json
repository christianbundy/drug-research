  "I was very excited about trying out the 3 Tramadols I procured for myself last night. I took them around 7:30 and was extremely dissapointed when I saw the clock had reached 8:30 and I felt nothing. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen and it never did. I was extremely dissapointed. I chalked it up to me having a pretty high tolerance for most drugs.",
  "However I woke up this morning and to my surprise I'm a little more talkative at work than usual and I have a very, very subtle euphoric feeling. Basically I just have a sense of well being and am in a very good mood. This could be a result of a delayed metabolizing of the drug or it could simply be that it allowed me to get some really good quality sleep last night which I haven't had in a while. Either way, it's a pretty good feeling but it was an overall dissapointment."
