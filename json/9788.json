  "<p>Yesterday I experimented with nutmeg for the first time after reading quite a few reports and articles on it.  What I did was put 2 tablespoons in a cup and add water, I then proceeded to choke down this vile drink (made me gag and make some WILD faces).  Within 20 minutes I began to feel light headed, dizzy, relaxed and in somewhat of a euphoric state, but it wore off much sooner than I had expected (from user experience reports I had assumed longer, more intense results) thinking I had taken too small a dose I proceeded to take another 2 tablespoon dose, again the same result, which intensified when i decided to go to sleep.",
  "Upon waking up I had no hangover and felt quiet open and creative, I was also very talkative and may have annoyed many people, oh well. Along with this wired, hyper, talkative sense of alert readiness I also experienced a sense of hightened intelligence which allowed me to hold an intelligent conversation bringing me somewhat closer to someone I can now consider a 'personal' friend and believe she thinks the same way too. All this without fear of being ridiculed or made to look like a nut, thanks to a wonderful spice called nutmeg.",
  "I do encourage at least one experience with nutmeg to everyone, but after reading all you can on it, and know the risks.  I am going to discontinue use in hopes that I can live like this without aid of any substances, with a new sense of maturity and trust.</p>"
