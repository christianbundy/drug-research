 "report": [
  "Last night I tried oxycontin for the first time with 2 friends of mine. I had never done it before, but was eager to try, after hearing about how relaxed the high was.",
  "I snorted 2 10 mg lines of it and almost immediately felt its effects. 3 minutes or so later I felt very warm, relaxed and elated. We talked about how sweet this feeling was and just sat around enjoying it. Then my friends said lets smoke some weed. I knew that when I smoked on vicodin it caused me to vomit all night but I was like 'eh, its a different drug'. I took one hit from my small plastic bong. This is when things went awry for me. I became very dizzy, and nauseous. I ended up throwing up violently for hours. I couldnt get up off the couch, except when I had to puke again and drifted in and out of consciousness. I woke up the next morning with an awful hangover.",
  "Needless to say it was a bad experience, but I think its only because I mixed the two drugs. Before I smoked I enjoyed the high very much."
