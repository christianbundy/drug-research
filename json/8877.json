 "report": [
  "I first heard about the Anadenanthera Colubrina seeds through an anthropology documentary. Watching Shamen using the snuff, I thought to myself this is something I have to try (already being a tobacco snuff user).",
  "I purchased a 25g bag of seeds from an online vendor, and anticipated their arrival greatly, when they came I followed the traditional method of making the yopo snuff, the seeds were dry fried until they popped like popcorn, they were then deshelled and pounded to a fine powder in my mortar and pestle, I mixed in at a three to one ratio some sodium bicarbonate. and mixed and pounded the matter again into an even finer snuff powder.",
  "I left this mixture in an small air tight container for around two weeks, until I felt ready to experience its effects.",
  "The time came when one evening I decided to work with this substance. I opened out two medium lines on a piece of A4 paper and snorted both lines into each nostril, and then woosh! O what a pain, only just bearable.",
  "I placed myself on my bed with my heart thumping very hard and a huge adrenaline rush running through my system. I was listening to some wonderful ambient music through headphones which really helped i think.",
  "I closed my eyes and opened them again, and my entire room seemed very linear and grey, and the walls were slowly and steadily breathing.",
  "Then I closed my eyes again and I felt as though I was being strangely spun around backwards and forwards.",
  "I then had a few various CEVs of a Python of some sort which seemed to jump out at me, and as it did i opened my eyes yet again, and was greeted by a still picture of the face of Che Guevara floating across my room.",
  "This was the high point of my visions, and i afterward came down to a very pleasent high.",
  "The entire journey lasted no longer than 30 to 40 minutes.And the next morning I felt wonderfully refreshed and very happy.",
  "This was an experience I was very pleased to have, and something that will stay with me for long time."
