  "I had horrible depression when I was about 16, thoughts like I wanted to kill my self and such. So I went to the doctor and they decided to put me on Effexor XR because that is what my mom was on at the time.",
  "I was only 16 when they gave it to me. After only a few days of taking it I still felt the same I mean it does take a few weeks to kick in. Then one morning I woke up to go to school after having horrible nightmares of my family being zombies and me killing them, also my entire family and friends were dead and decaying.",
  "Then when I got up and started to walk around I started to hallucinate and see dead people and body parts everywhere and I got really scared. So I got back in bed and called the doctor. All he said was that I guess thats not a good medicine for me to take. I never even knew about those kinds of side effects."
