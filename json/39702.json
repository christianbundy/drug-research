 "report": "<p>I`ve dreamed of experiencing smoked DMT for some time now. I have very little experience with hallucinogens, including one Mimosahuasca experience that was amazingly very succesful yet overly intense and absolutely terrifying. I`ve been</p><p>waiting to experience DMT again since.</p><p>After ordering 1 ounce of 'premium' Mimosa Hostilis from a reputable online vendor, I decided to try my hand at an acid/base extraction this time, but after checking around my area for PH papers, I soon realized this wasnt gonna happen.</p><p>Not that easily discouraged I decided I had little to loose and attempted an extraction with what I have readily available to me, vinegar, water, naptha, and a microwave oven. My first attempt went a little something like this.</p><p>Approximately 10 grams of Mimosa Hostilis was shredded as good as can be done by hand and scissors and put into a 3/4 pint polypropelyne jar. To this, I added some water (I didn't think to take exact mesurements, but it was enough to just cover</p><p>the MH). 3 tablespoons of white vinegar were then added to this, and the jar was allowed to sit for a few hours with some vigorous shaking every now and then. The lid was removed and the jar was put in the microwave on high for 1 minute, just until</p><p>it started boiling.</p><p>The jar was then shaken and the liquid decanted off into another jar while still scalding hot. To the resulting liquid I added naptha that appeared to be one tenth the over all volume of liquid, this was shaken for about 5 minutes and then the</p><p>emulsion was allowed to seperate.</p><p>After the emulsion had gone down, I attempted to seperate the two distinct layers, but found it near impossible with the equipment I had at my disposal (turkey baster). After several trys I became very frustrated and decided just to pour off the solvent layer, and ended up losing about 1/4 of my solution in the process.</p><p>I put what was left in a small tupperware container in the microwave on high for 5 minutes, this resulted in a very violent boiling until there was nothing left but a maroon film covering the bottom of the container. I`m sure I lost much of the Elf</p><p>Spice during this violent boiling but I was just trying to get this done fast to see if it had potenetial for a longer version in the future.</p><p>The resulting film (which actually turned out not to be a film at all, but a very gooey sticky resin) was then scraped off the container using the back end of a fork. This turned out to be a real pain in the ass, the goo wouldn't cooperate at all. After a little blowing and working it started to form into a harder resin which was much easier to handle.</p><p>Final product was a small ball of very dark burgundy (almost black) resin. I got very excited when I saw how small the ball was. I figured absolute best yields would maybe be 100mgs of DMT out of 10 grams of MH, and looking at this ball I realized it couldnt be more then 400mgs.  I figured worst case scenerio I could at least</p><p>smoke enough to get some kind of experience, as it turns out, I was right.</p><p>First attempt at smoking....</p><p>I took a small chunk, about the size of a BB of said resin and rolled it into a ball, this was then put on a pin and heated with a lighter. I missed much of the first hit but not the second, the smoke was suprisingly not harsh and tasted very pleasent.</p><p>I held this in for about 15 seconds and immediately went for a third.</p><p>There was little effect from this small amount but deffinately above the mark of placebo. I experienced a slight numbing of the thighs and slight pressure on the back of my head. Walking proved to be rather difficult, it felt almost as if I was walking</p><p>underwater, which reminded me alot of my expereinces with smoked Anadenanthera species ::shudders::.</p><p>Second attempt proved much more interesting.</p><p>The rest of the product was put into a dry waterpipe and smoked (against my better judgement) with a torch lighter. The once not harsh smoke nailed the back of my throat with a vengence, and what was once pleasent tasting now tasted like crap. This hit was held for a very short period of time and was followed by a second, smaller hit. As I was releasing the second hit I grabbed my pen and paper (I thought I might actually be able to write something of the experience...what a weak concept that was.)</p><p>and then went for a third. The Elf Spice coarsed through every fiber of my being at light speed as I felt my body vibrating in a not so pleasent way.</p><p>The majority of the experience was much like the two hours of beautiful terror I experienced 2 years back from the Mimosahuasca except it was very short lived and perhaps not as strong. Visuals were very intricate and flowed over every surface in my perhepial vision, but what was most interesting was something I didn't experience with the oral preperation, auditory hallucinations. I experienced alot of popping and echoing noises (no tryptamine carrier wave though :(.)</p><p>The whole experience lasted under 3 minutes and was somewhat uncomfortable, yet was succesful.</p><p>Somethings I will change next time I attempt this extraction</p><p>1. Extract from starting material three times.</p><p>2. Defating 4 or maybe even 5 times (perhaps using an eyedropper to remove the solvent layer). I belive the experience may have been so uncomfortable due to undesireable products left in the resin, perhaps even some naptha.</p><p>3. Slowly evaporate defatted solution.</p><p>I also believe much of the material was wasted during smoking due to two factors...</p><p>1. Much of the Spice probably pyrolized because it was not in freebase form</p><p>2. A torch light was used</p><p>All in all this satisfied my curiousity for a time and I encourage all out there to experiment (safley of course) with new extractions from Mimosa. One day QT`s extraction may be obsolete.</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p> Speak No Evil</p>",
