 "report": [
  "I have been using analgesics for over a year now and have mainly used Oxycodone/Hydrocodone for euphoric purposes (7.5 to 10 mgs 3x a day). I do not have any real pains except those that come with the stress of life.  I am a firm believer that anything that causes positive change in one's life is an 'anti-depressant' and these drugs do exactly that for me. ",
  "I have seen many people compare Hydrocodone to Tramadol but I have found that Tramadol is more similiar to Oxycodone.  I would compare 100mgs of Tramadol to about 5-6mgs of Oxycodone, with the euphoric, well-being feelings not as intense (This doesn't mean 200mgs of tramadol would equal 10mgs of Oxycodone...the drug doesnt work like that). ",
  "Tramadol takes much longer to kick in (up to 3 hours for first time users) but lasts much longer than my average pain killer (I have felt the effects up to 18 hours later).  I have found that taking 50mgs every 4 hours will keep me feeling great at all times."
