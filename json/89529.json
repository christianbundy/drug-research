 "report": "<p>I tend to consider myself someone who is fairly experienced in the realm of exotic RC's. On this occasion, I purchased some 4-HO-MET from a very reliable source. From what I gathered from all the readings, this is supposed to be somewhat close to shroom high.</p><p>After the 28mg dose, I waited about a good 45 minutes before feeling any effects. It started with a smile that crept on my face. I started to feel real loose and got in a good mood. We started to play rockband, and I was totally enthralled into what I was playing.</p><p>After about 1.5 hours, the visual movements began. There was plenty of eye play with this one. Sentences on the TV were waving up and down, the fabric on the couch was moving, everything seem to have a vibration to it.</p><p>This feeling lasted for about 4 hours, and with a good comedown. I could see this one going with some marijuana for a even nicer comedown.</p><p>All in all I had a great time, it wasn't anything overwhelming, and I will most likely find myself taking this one every once in awhile, its quite a novel RC.</p>",
