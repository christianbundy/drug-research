 "report": "<p>After a metal concert I noticed a steady ringing noise in my ears that wasnt supposed to go away, so the doc prescribed Infusions combined with ginko pills. The volume of those strange noise decreased to a less annoying level, cause of vasodilatation, I think. I felt slight enhancement in cerebral function, which is also combined with the effect of a subtle mood lift. </p><p>After taking ginko - pills for more than one year, TV and other screens caused nasty migraine-like headache. At first I thought this problem is linked to the noise the screens produce in interference with the noise in my head. I noticed furthermore that beer caused severe headache even in doses less than 0,5 l. Finally I noticed that I get</p><p>a headache if I don't take those ginko pills!!! Now I have to slowly reduce the dose to get rid of my headache problem. In addition I felt that I had to drink a very lot when taking ginko, which could also be linked to the headache.</p>",
