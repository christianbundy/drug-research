My left arm is very hot indeed. My body is comfortable other than a very slight tension in my head. There are some slight changes in how movement looks. Perhaps a little more jagged, or fragmented than usual. Other than these effects, Im noticing little else.</p><p>2:00- Feeling pretty relaxed with a slight headache. As I watch the words on the screen, I am noticing very slight movement as well.</p><p>3:00- Slight headache still. The experience was overall very unremarkable.</p>",
