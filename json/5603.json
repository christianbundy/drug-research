  "<p>I couldn't believe I had this opportunity.  I was about to attend an ayahuasca 'ritual' in the comfort of my own hometown, New Orleans.  I had wanted experience the 'vine of the soul' for some time, but never dreamed I would get the opportunity without trekking to Brazil or Peru.  As luck would have it, a friend informed me of a Peruvian shaman visiting the city and conducting an ayahuasca ritual.  I jumped at the chance.",
  "The mixture was pre-prepared by the shaman and was administered to about 10 of us in a circle, in the privacy of a huge, old New Orleans shotgun home.  It was poured into a glass, about a typical shot, maybe a little more. ",
  "After ingesting it I was very anxious for it to take effect.  After about an hour it finally did, but not what I had hoped for.  I basically just just experienced extreme nause for  about 5 to 6 hours and vomitted.  No real hallucinegenic effects.  That was the general consensus of the group.  I'm not sure why it didn't kick in but maybe thats the way it works.</p>"
