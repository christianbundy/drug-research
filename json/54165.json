 "report": "<p>I love weed and hip-hop music.  I also come from Houston, Texas (aka the City of Syrup) which means everything I listen to is slowed down (screwed).  I am a huge DJ Screw fan and I personally own over 100 DJ Screw tapes.  Knowing this, it probably wouldn't suprise you that I love Promethazine with Codeine cough syrup and I buy it whenever I can.  I usually pour a duece (2 ounces) into a two liter Sprite and sip it over a 24 hour period.  This is the only way for me to enjoy drank because sipping it faster will just make me really sleepy.  Sipping it slow makes me get really relaxed and makes me almost feel like I am in slow motion.  The best sodas to mix drank with are Sprite, Sprite Remix, Crush, Strawberry Crush, Mountain Dew, Slice, 7-Up, Welch's Grape, or anything else light and fruity.</p><p>Very rarely do I have enough lean (another term for the cough syrup because it makes you lean in your seat to one side) to pour up anymore than a duece, but occasionally I have enough to pour up a 4.  One time after getting perscribed some lean from the doctor I poured up a 4 in a one liter Mountain Dew.  I bought an additional 2 liter Mountain Dew to dilute my drank with.</p><p>I started sippin around 10 am and I rolled up a few blunts.  I started feeling a buzz half way through my first cup.  My eyes got tight, my boddy got warm and heavy, and I felt a great high (combination with the chronic herb Shorline).  I spent the whole day on the same couch, with the exception of going to the bathroom and eating and getting an erb sac.  The drank along with the chronic gives me an opioid high without the 'medicine head' that vicodin or codeine pills give me.  The flavor of the dark blueish mountain dew (result of the purple syrup mixing with the yellowish soda) is the best thing I have ever tasted.</p><p>I waited until after lunch to throw on a screw tape.  I had picked up a fresh ounce of weed and began to roll up.  I felt as if I was melting into the sofa after the first blunt.  After the second blunt my mind was gone somewhere else, lost in the slow voice of Warren G as DJ Screw was perfectly mixing in Ice Cube's 'We Be Clubbin'.  By the time I was half way through my 4 oz. of syrup I could barely keep my eyes open so I chugged a Coca-Cola and decided to go creep around and blow some endo behind limo tint.  The best day of my life was finished up by a dranked out trip around H-Town to swang my 20's, bang my slowed down 2Pac, and just floss Lexus and rep Texas.  Before I made it back home I had halucinated twice, both times confusing street signs for people flagging me down.  This day of sitting on my ass and trying to smoke an ounce while sippin on an entire bottle of cough syrup had worn me out and I passed out fully clothed on my couch.</p><p>I woke up still dranked out.  I had luckily saved myself a muddy ass cup of purple and I woke up 15 hours later, rolled two blunts and hit the road with a big ass Styrofoam cup of that Texas oil.  Talk about a bad ass trip to the doctor - I had now been fucked up for over 40 hours straight.  steady banging SCREW  RIP DJ SCREW, FAT PAT, HAWK, GATOR</p>",
