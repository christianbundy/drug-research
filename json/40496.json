 "report": "<p>I recently obtained a pretty large quantity of voacanga seeds. For my first dose it was a normal day. It was around 1 pm when I took 50 ground seeds encapsulated. No effects at all for about an hour except for mild nausea. After that hour I had some slight stimulating effects, and a light feeling in my body, but nothing I would describe as psychedelic, and definately no visions, not even closed eye.</p><p>I thought this dose may have been jeapordized due to the fact that I had encapsulated them. For my second experiment, about a week later, I chewed 70 seeds. This dose did just as little as the first. I don't know if I am just tolerant to them or what, but I didn't experiment at any higher doses.</p>",
