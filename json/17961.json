  "I recently ordered B. Caapi and Chacruna from a company in the Nederlands.  The box arrived with U.S. customs tape.  The box had been opened and the envelope within the box with the preparation instructions had been opened and (presumably) read.  There was no notice of seizure (and I don't expect to be getting one), but the box itself was empty."
