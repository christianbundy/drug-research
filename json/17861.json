 "report": [
  "As I write this, I am still slightly intoxicated. I have been experimenting with the creation of absinthe-like-beverages for quite some time now and I feel I have succeeded.",
  "The color: A beautiful clear yellow-green",
  "The louche: A surprisingly beautiful cream-white or bone-white with a slight yellow tinge.",
  "The taste: bitter but also quite sweet, the sugar at the bottom of the glass makes it nearly syrupy, strong Anise, hints of Juniper, mint, and the slightest aftertaste of something a bit like Cannabis.",
  "The feelings: even diluted, there is a slight burn as it hits my tongue and a warmth as it hits my stomach. The effect is nearly immediate, my thought processes are completely different, I don't feel particularly creative, as such, but I feel a sense of....'poetry' in my surroundings, almost as though I could spend years describing, in intimate detail, the precise nature of one thing without fear of boredom.",
  "I am quite calm but I am not tired at all, I think I shall go make myself a cup of tea and read a nice book.",
  "Cheers."
