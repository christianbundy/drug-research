 "report": "<p>I get really bad cluster headaches cycles.  They're seasonal and for a month or two I get terribly painful headaches at the same times every day only on my left temple.  My Doctor prescribed me a steroid pack to try to knock out the cycle, but they don't work very well.  After reading some reports that were encouraging, I decided to try to cure my headaches with psilocybin.  I started getting the headaches just as I had every other year, but this time I ate an eighth of mushrooms to see if it would work.  Not only did it knock out my headache that day, but for the whole season.  I mean, I would eat them anyway because I really dig them, but the added health benefit should be duly noted by those who want to try a new way to cure their headaches.</p>",
