 "report": "<p>After a friend of mine discovered what we call 'dope', we occasionally went on all-nighters, some for a few in a row. My friend eventually got into major trouble with the law because of it, and even worse, became almost completely dependant on it. That affects him to this day, I on the other hand have never been an avid user, just occasionally.</p><p>One day he came to me and said he needed my help. So we went to a 'private place', where he proceeded to show me how to smoke off the dope, the final process in manufacturing. He kept saying that his smoke was not reacting as rapidly as he had hoped. When he put the tube into the clear liquid of a 1 quart jar. Small flakes began to form in the liquid. He stopped after each jar had about 1/4 inch of white flakes in the bottom. He said 'There should be a lot more than that, and went into the house looking for more salt.</p><p>I grabbed the smoke bottle and put the tube into the jars again, he had let the tube just touch the surface of the liquid, but I put it in deep and then squeezed the bottle. It was a whirlwind of flakes, seemingly turning the liquid white until the flakes settled. I repeated this into two other jars. When I was done there was about 3/4 inch of white flakes in the bottom of the jar. When he saw what I had done, he almost shit. See, this was a batch previously made by a group of people, and we really were not supposed to be tapping into it. We filtered the dope off and set it under a lamp to dry.</p><p>When it had dried we smoked some on a foil. It was the sweetest tasting dope I had ever had, my friend too was impressed with it. Another thing I noticed is that it smoked down to nothing, when the foil was all smoked, I could not even tell that something had been on it, whereas every other time I had smoked it there would have been a small amount of burnt residue left.</p><p>We then both entered our own different worlds and began to partake in vigorous activity. Most often it was cleaning, building things, or trying to improve on something.</p><p>I always seem to feel more creative when I get spun, either drawing or playing music. Its weird because every time seems different than the last but just as well the same. My mind races, I sometimes feel scatter-brained. I could be doing extremely hard work and have the illusion that I will never tire. But usually I can feel my body getting weaker and beginning to ache, as I did one time after chopping about 300 pounds of logs into quarters, My mind encouraged my body to keep going but I could not take it anymore, and had to rest. I always feel in a good mood when I tweek. I get paranoid the longer I extend my adventure though. I have never tweeked more than 5 days and 4 nights, but know people who have done weeks.</p><p>I never seem to need to eat, I just have no appetite, and almost have to force myself to eat. I prefer to do lines but smoke it all the same, depends on the environment and the quality of dope. But it all burns when I snort, it burns like hell sometimes. The taste is extremely bitter. But for some reason when I smoke it (if I have good dope) it tastes kind of sweet.</p><p>It is by far the most powerful drug I have ever done, pound for pound. I am just one of the people that can go on a good tweek and come down without craving it again. Some people cannot let go though. After a while of that, they seem to self-destruct in their own different ways. I have always had the advantage of never having to pay for it, and at the same time have had it in plentiful amounts. Every time I tweek I save some for the end so that if I come down during the day, I can bump up and stay awake until night, usually going to bed early to make up for lost sleep.</p><p>When I get spun, I chains moke like hell, I will set cigarettes in an ashtray and forget it, going off and lighting another up, only to come back to a long ash, and a wasted cigarette.</p>",
