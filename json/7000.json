  "I received regular kratom leaves (not labeled 'super') from an online vendor. I am a former opiate addict, so I can make a comparison that 4-6 grams of leaf probably equals 100mg of codeine sulfate. If I eat more than 6 grams I get nausea.",
  "I don't make tea out of the leaves, I crush and eat them whole. I even have tolerance to kratom, as I've been doing it twice a day for about a month, and 7 grams would still make me sick, causing me to feel like I've had too much opiates (but I can handle 40mg oxycodone fine).",
  "I wanted to warn people that taking higher doses of potent kratom leaves could make someone very, very sick."
