  "'Be careful, and use it wisely, this drug can TAKE you'",
  "Sounds like an old wise man doesn't it? These were the words of a friend who gave me my first experience of cocaine.",
  "When I snorted for the first time, I understood exactly what he meant... 'GIVE ME MORE'. During that first weekend, I snorted two grams, stayed up all night and paid the penalty with the 'crash'. I knew then, that cocaine had to be treated with respect, and that it could eventually TAKE me.",
  "Now, I enjoy it as a treat. One gram every couple of months. I don't deny myself the drug because I do love it. Thing is though, I know how to put it away. Kind of like a close friend that I meet up with once in a while..."
