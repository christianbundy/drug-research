  "<p>On a road trip to Vegas I took some Provigil to stay frosty. This is a non amphetamine stimulant for shift workers and narcoleptics. After six hours, once I arrived at the hotel, I took 75 mics of acid.  [Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]  I usually take 100 but didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole. I guess I still had a little pro-v onboard because I noticed a lot of visuals, much more than I would have expected. I felt really nervous for about 2 hours before I settled into what would have been a normal trip.  Each time I've used these together I would say it increased the intensity of the trip by 50% and the duration by 30%.  I did not find it to be a pleasant experience and would not recommend it. These two drugs should probably not be taken in the same day; it is too hard to tell when the Provigil has worn off.</p>"
