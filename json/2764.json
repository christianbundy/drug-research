  "I purchased 4oz. galanga at a local chinese market. This was ground into a powder in a coffee grinder. This powder was boiled in water and strained three times. The product liquid was boiled down to a syrup concentrate. Dilute HCl was poured over this. The mixture was basified with NaOH. Petroleum ether was added and the mixtures were shaken and allowed to seperate. The ether layer was decanted and evaporated. The resulting black, 'asphalt-like' substance was put into a base pipe. The base pipe was hit 5 times. In about 10 minutes the effects were apparent. An LSD like trip was forming. Nearly 2 hours later the effect are still getting more intense, with fullness of breath and muscle relaxation. Visual distortion as well. The effects on the mind are a deeply contemplative thought process, very whispy yet solid. Probably next time I will smoke 20 hits. The 4oz which produced nearly 4 grams of product was 1.30$. This produced probably 10 strong doses at .13$ a dose. I'm definitely going to experiment with this LEGAL discovery. "
