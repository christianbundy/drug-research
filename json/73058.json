  "<p>It was a rainy day",
  "I had a headache",
  "This",
  "I have to say makes for an interesting tale of facets, of euphoria, of wellbeing and of love.",
  "I had commitments last night, I had promised a friend that I would go to his gallery opening I had also however just received a curiousity, the methylone.",

  "I get there and there at about 8pm",
  "I felt as free as a bird",
  "I flitted around talking to many people, those I knew, those I didnt.",
  "I felt as though I was full of positive confidence, the kind which is not full of ego.",
  "Everyone is drinking, I dont want to drink. I dont really like it anyway.",
  "I have nice conversations, very caring. Conversations flow easily with everybody, even those that I dont like. Again there is no paranoia which I might feel on E or mdma. My mind is clear. I am able for the rest of the night to deal with all kinds of social situations which I may have otherwise found challenging.",
  "I clocked my friend",
  "Lets call him MP",

  "It feels great",
  "Well it always feels great",
  "But the methylone in my brain and the previous situation of sexual tension makes this kiss explosive.",
  "We go to a bar",
  "I am totally loved up",
  "Again not like mdma really, you see I dont like mdma too much as it makes me feel a bit confused and paranoid, its like on mdma my feelings are not true. They are just chemical.",

  "needless to say we are both very much hedonists!",
  "The que isnt too bad, I decide to drop a very small about of acid.",
  "Small as I dont want to override the methylone first time round, small also because we are going to the circus, and really there isnt need to enhance the experience too much!",
  "The acid came on quickly. Although at this small dose gave me that slight headache and feeling in the top of the mouth sensation.",
  "The performance was great, twas Le Clique in fact",
  "I love that sort of thing anyway, I really enjoy this time of year here, as people like MP and I are always this way, and for this month many others come into town, other performers and new friends. I feel really happy in this new environment",

  "Woah",
  "I had no idea!",
  "These CEVs were where I saw the really synergy between the acid and the methylone",
