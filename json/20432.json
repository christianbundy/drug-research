 "report": [
  "<p>I have always been intigued by amanita mushrooms, and eventually gave in and bought 50 grams of grade A mushrooms. my first experience was with a 8 gram dose, boiled into tea, after work one night. i have to say, i was tired and the mushrooms made it worse...i basically stayed in twilight sleep for three hours than passed out. I later tried a 11 gram dose, this time well-rested, and the results were great, so I'll relate them.",
  "First off, I made a tea. Use as little water as possible when doing this, it doesn't taste great, and the amount doesn't matter, so why drink more? within 20-30 minutes of ingestion I start to feel pill-drunk, like I've taken some codeine and drank three beers. At this point some trippy stuff happens, but I have to say, amanitas aren't psychedelic in the LSD-Mescaline-Mushrooms way. The feeling I get is as if my inner-head, or mind's eye, is no longer fixed in place inside my head. I turn, and it arrives a moment late. The feeling is nice, though, like a well-oiled hinge (that phrase is from my experince notes directly- another is 'like a weed high, but more space-less filler').",
  "This is an equilibrium drug, effecting orientation and depth perception. Objects have a pleasant 'distance' that is not unlike being drunk, but much less stupifying and heavy. It is light; nothing seems attached or fixed. The effects aren't exactly constant. They vary; one moment a lapse of sleepiness will rise, and as I dip into it the nice smooth slipping feeling arouses my senses, and I'm back up. Also this drug doesn't seem to be devoid of aphrodisiac qualities. The effects last about 6 hours in all, and in general, I think the confused relationship between amanitas and psylocibe mushrooms result in a lot of confusion about amanitas' true effects.",
  "These are, in my opinion, the following:",
  ". slight disorientation, more than with weed, less than with alcohol.",
  ". warm body high.",
  ". slight visual disturbance, akin in intensity to marijuana, but more akin in quality to alcohol.",
  ". loopiness, or silliness. grinning and chuckling.",
  ". A feeling of not being attached to anything to solidly. everything seems to slide smoothly.",
  "Overall, amanitas are like drinking five beers slowly with a belly full of high quality goof-balls. Not psychedelic, but real fun.</p>"
