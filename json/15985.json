 "report": [
  "The first times I took this drug it affected me hardly at all. So one day I said 'screw this' and took 5 g. I got *loaded*.",
  "Since then, I take anywhere from 2.5 - 3 g at a shot. Sometimes I'll follow up with a 2 g dose to prolong the experience.",
  "I love the effects, but get a distinct and unpleasant hangover that lasts anywhere from 24 - 36 hours after it wears off. I'm jittery and irritable, and have trouble sleeping. There is also a persistent salty/metallic taste in my mouth.",
  " I think this stuff does a number on your brain chemistry. I never do it two days in a row. It does not surprise me at all that it's reported to be addictive.",
  "I'd be careful with this stuff, if I were you. It has quite a bit more abuse/harm potential than pot."
