 "report": [
  "The interesting thing with rhodiola is that I have taken it on a daily basis without noticing any hugely noticable effects, but when I first tried it it gave me an intense rush of euphoria and hugely increased my general motivation.",
  "I remember I once took it at work, at a health food shop, where I was feeling very bored, tired and lazy. After about 30 minutes from ingesting two of the viridian capsules I started to feel very happy and content at doing my job! I was moving some very heavy boxes of food up and down the stairs, but it was no trouble at all! I was even chatty with my boss, whom I usually tried to avoid as she was a bit aggressive at times.",
  "A few times when I took it it had a similar effect. It is hard to find out much information about rhodiola, so I don't know if it requires some kind of amino acid or works better with carbohydrates for example and this is why it sometimes works and sometimes does not.",
  "However, it is still very uesful even if the effects are not strong. I think it works in a similar fashion to St John's wort or SSRI anti-depressents. So it can be a quite a gentle way of keeping an up-lifted mood."
