 "report": [
  "I had been on a long binge with marijuana and hashish, and, slowly being bored of the experiences, decided to try another drug.  Rather than take the next step into hallucinogens or stimulants, I bought a sampler pack of herbal joints.  Among other things, the sampler contained a joint of Calea Zacatechichi.  I did some heavy research on the effects and side effects of the plant, and decided that I had nothing to fear from it (I'm tend to get easily freaked out and nauseous when on drugs and like to know what I'm in for).",
  "The day of taking it, I made sure to get plenty of physical activity in so that I would get a relaxing sleep.  Before I could take the Calea, a friend invited me to smoke some pot with him.  He had recently purchased a strain of weed that gave more of a body high and induced more lethargy than mental creativity.  Around 11:30 PM, I began to feel sleepy and decided that it would be a good time to try the Calea.",
  "The joint stayed lit easily and the smoke was smooth, but that didn't matter at all to me.  The flavor from the smoke was absolutely putrid.  Now I knew that the tea tasted bad and had to be adulterated, but the flavor from the Calea smoke was only comparable to a combination of fresh dirt, lighter fluid, and raw sewage.  Every puff had to be followed by a large swig of water and a few seconds of fresh air.  I stopped at one point and said to myself, 'This is the Leaf of God... The Chontal Indians have been smoking and drinking it for years and years.  I can put up with one bleeding joint.' The joint was larger than I had expected (it was one of those cone types) and I felt I had smoked enough by the time it was a little more than halfway down.  I went back inside, brushed, flossed, etc, and laid down to sleep. ",
  "It was summer and, not being in school, I was sleeping-in and going to sleep late.  I laid in bed, tossing and turning, focusing on things I wanted to dream about for hours and hours.  I had gone through countless sexual fantasies in my head, trying to push my dreams in that direction.  I think I finally got to sleep sometime around 3:00 AM. My dreams were more vivid than they had ever been before.  I could recall the entire sequence of events, complete with useless details.  I won't bore you with the dream itself, but it was something along the lines of me, in pink bellbottoms, at a party in Tijuana where Margaret Cho showed up to tell stories and ended up boring people away.",
  "Though I wouldn't dare try to interpret the meaning of such a dream, I am infinitely grateful to the Calea for allowing me to experience such a vivid dream."
