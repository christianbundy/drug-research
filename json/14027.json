  "Amounts were eyeballed. [Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See related article]",
  "T 0 - approximately 8mg nasal",
  "T 2 - approximately 10mg oral as I wanted to feel more.",
  "T 9 - fairly sober, asleep after one hour.",
  "I eyeballed the dosages.. so it could be less (was careful with it), but as intoxicated as I was, I feel like I was spot on.",
  "At home with a mate it started. Then went to a hardcore party (rave) .. First I hesitated just because the substance would be psychedelic, but because I've read in several reports it was quite 'party-worthy' I still did it.",
  "And I have no regrets :)",
  "Whole evening was great. It felt after a few hours as if I saw myself from outside. A bit like mushrooms but without mindfuck.",
  "The laser lights were extremely beautiful, fascinating. Very trippy. (it felt like a combo of mdma / mushies)",
  "It was visualy psychedelic. The warping of vision was like on an average dose of mushrooms. (but only when I really tried to focus on it)",
  "Empathy, I felt sorry for some people because the looked so insanely fuckedup (like unhealty). Too much mdma and too hot inside.",
  "I saw some people having a bade vibe. As if I could really see what was missing in one's thinking, I tried to fix it and succeeded multiple times.",
  "I should add that there have been drinking (one beer p / hour or so), more fresh drinks and smoked. Also smoked a litte cannabis beforehand.",
  "Hour or 7 pips go this morning, and now I feel hard not broke, except hunger, pain and a sprained ankle) (half the time I was partying my feet off! And failed doing some dance move :P )",
  "Well .. that was it. I hope it's a bit of a cohesive story."
