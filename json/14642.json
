 "report": "<p>\nThe reason I am writing this is because back in Febuary 2002 I</p><p>decided to experiement with Morning Glory seeds. I accidentally</p><p>came upon this website and actually researched the seeds before</p><p>trying them. You guys gave me so much good information that I</p><p>decided I should give back.</p><p>Here's how it all happened for me. On 1 afternoon I went up to</p><p>the local K-Mart to look for MG:HB seeds. While in there I found</p><p>Martha Stewart brand MG:HB seeds. I proceeded to buy 4 packs</p><p>(6grams, roughly 240 seeds). Then I came home and prepared the</p><p>seeds. I washed them with dish washer soap, then dryed them on a</p><p>paper towel, then ground them up in a coffee grinder.</p><p>At 9pm I poured the seeds into a cup of water. Then drank the</p><p>potion and ate the remaining chunks of seeds. It was pretty</p><p>nasty but definetly wasn't that bad. At about 20 minutes the</p><p>effects started to kick in. But these were mild effects. Also</p><p>though, my stomach started to hurt and my limbs became very</p><p>heavy. So i drank some pepto to help my stomach. At about 1 hour</p><p>the effects really started to kick. And once the trip began to</p><p>take over all stomach pain just left. At 1st I began to think of</p><p>it as just a mild acid trip, which I was happy with. It wasn't</p><p>untill about 2 or 3 hours into it that the MG trip REALLY began</p><p>to kick hard. Then it felt exactly like an acid trip. Walls were</p><p>rolling and breathing. When i walked around the house the floor</p><p>began to slant. It felt like the world was tilted. Once I turned</p><p>the kitchen light on I was very light senstive. It felt as if</p><p>everything was glowing around me. Best way to describe it is,</p><p>imagine walking out into the street in the middle of the night,</p><p>standing directly under a street light, you can feel the light</p><p>beaming down on you. Honestly, the peak lasted from about 11pm</p><p>to 5am. It was very intense and lasted for a very long time. and</p><p>i mean peaking, I'm not counting the 'afterglow', which as</p><p>everyone knows goes on for many hours after the peak is gone.</p><p>In conclusion, I highly recommend it, it was fantastic. I've</p><p>read many negative reports on here, and I've come to many</p><p>conclusions. Maybe they had to low a dosage, got bad seeds, or</p><p>weakened the seeds during the extraction process. My advice,</p><p>get at least 6grams, clean them, dry them, grind them, drink</p><p>them. And don't forget the pepto.</p>",
