  "<p>I had never taken any muscle relaxers until I tried these, as my homegirl had a bottle that she didnt want so I was figured I'd try em.",
  "I enjoy taking pills for the most part. I do not drink and do not smoke marijuana because it made me kinda paranoid. So when I can get some painkillers its great, those or xanax, anything that makes me just chill out. I have minor anxiety issues at times so they work best for me. When I took these I was in a decent mood, just chillin and had come back from playing ball.",
  "I figured these would be like painkillers, so I took 20 mgs at about 9:00 pm. After a margarita I took another one about an hour later. It should be noted however that the margarita was weak, so I'm not even going to count it. The only effect I noticed was the sleepiness. I was yawning like crazy and passed out at about 12:00 am while watching a movie. Hard to wake up in the morning for sure, I really had to push myself to get up.",
  "There was not any notable effects resembling a 'fun' trip. The next day in class however I was extremely relaxed, I dont know if it was still in my system or whatever, but I was pretty calm.</p>"
