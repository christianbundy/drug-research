  "I cannot smoke any substances, so decided to try to make a topical medical marijuana preparation. I stirred a handful of mixed bud into two thirds of a jar of Nivea Cream (using a fork and the opaque blue jar).",
  "A small dab rubbed into my sprained ankle gives a localized slightly numb sensation. The systemic effects are subtle and mild.",
  "I am very satisfied with this lightly analgesic and relaxing preparation. It's just enough to take the edge off.",
  "Warning: users may smell like a barnyard, with floral overtones."
