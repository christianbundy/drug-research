 "report": "<p>I grew up with Valerian in Germany. As a very active child I was given Valerian almost every day. I have a heart condition which gave me panic attacks and irregular heartbeat for 25 years. Cardialogists prescribed Inderal and tranquillizers, which made me feel like I was living on another planet. I have been going back to valerian and the results are overwelming. No more panick attacks and my heart beat is more regular, life is normal. I do not believe in prescription drugs, they have too many side effects. Natural products taken in normal doses are the best. Like with anything else, moderation is the key. </p>",
