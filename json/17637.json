 "report": [
  "Let me start off by saying that I'm now a 22yr old heathy male because of the wonder drug Tramadol. before I took tramadol I was addicted to oxys real bad (5 80's a day) from 01'-06'. I went thru the methadone program and got off of that bull shit, the withdrawal from dones make oxys look like happy meal treats.",
  "I was first prescribed Tramadol in 50mg tablets for an off label use: to treat the hunger for opiates I had after going through withdrawal and come back to reality which is really shitty. I took 150mg twice a day take with a small fatty snack and caffeine for quicker absorbtion. A little vitamin c helps in a pinch too.",
  "It doesnt have the bad properties pain pills have while giving me damn close to what I desire. ie positive outlook, overall happiness, and at night (nods) thats right nods. I've been on it for 3 months and havent craved oxy or marijuana in that time. Its not oxy but it blocks the pain I feel for 12-18 months after coming off oxys or hydros. It saved my life..."
