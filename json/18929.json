  "I have recently come across a few RC's I hadn't seen before and after some research on the internet and reports from a couple friends I decided I wanted to try almost all of them. It was suggested that I do the MDAI and 4-MEC together. I loved this combination. It's a very clean headed high, tons of empathy, stimulating, but not overly so, comedown has a minor headache but sleep comes easy. I have had a few amazing experiences with 2C-I. When I told my friends about my 4-MEC/MDAI night, it was suggested that I add a small dose of 2C-I and reduce the doses of the other two.",
  "I gave it a couple days to let my synapses recharge. Woke up that day around 11 well rested and set to work preparing for my day. I find that with powerful chemicals it helps to put myself in the proper mindset so starting a morning off the right way is important. I ate a small breakfast, drank plenty of water for the next few hours, and relaxed before heading to my friend's house.",
  "2:45: Upon arrival, I was greeted happily by close friends. I was in a good mood and I was ready to dose. I poured out a mixture of 45/45/5 mg MDAI/4-MEC/2C-I and snorted it. It burned horrendously. I swallowed the rest of my mix, another 190mg in the same ratio. I popped a Lifesaver mint to help with the taste of my drip, drank some water, and smoked a cigarette to get my mind of the fire in my nose. Ten minutes later I was over the worst of it and starting to feel pretty good. The 2C-I took longer to kick in and I felt like I was rolling. I played a round of Super Smash Bros for the N64, one of my all time favorites. I was dominating and I won the match; it took 15 minutes. I stood up and realized the glass of the fish tank was waving, the light in the room was different, and I somehow understood the dynamic of this group a lot better.",
  "We had plans to go feed ducks in the park, a pretty short walk with a nice trail. Instead of using the trail Jon set out to blaze one. We went through the thick of the woods that surrounds this park. It was wondrous to see nature, real nature. It was so beautiful that it honestly brought tears to my eyes. Even looking at the poison ivy and thorny vines made me feel apart of this ecosystem, I was a part of this world, we all are and we don't ever think about it the right way. I realized that the Earth doesn't belong to man, man belongs to the Earth, and if we push it too far, this planet might just destroy us. It took almost 20 minutes to get to to duck pond. The 2C-I I ingested was making me pretty nauseous. I ended throwing up a tiny bit of water that I had just drank and feeling much better. Tanner had brought a football and we played some catch. My reaction time was fantastic and my depth perception was way off. I decided to feed some ducks. After throwing a handful of Animal Crackers in the pond I got lost looking at the ripples and thinking about the metaphors of life. I then started seeing more colorful ripples which slowly turned into a complex fractal, still water and ripples, but incredibly complicated. I was pulled out of this by Jason riding by on his longboard. This came as huge surprise: he didn't know we were there and we didn't know he was coming. I wondered at this and all other coincidences in life. Another hour at the park full of so much beauty. Sometimes making conversation with my friends but I'm a little out of it and can't hold one very well. Mild OEVs, some more intense than others, non-extraordinary. We go to Braum's, I get a water cup and refill it a couple times. Being around people seems to have pulled me out of the trip for a while. I am able to talk to my friends while they eat. Very mild visuals, i.e. breathing walls.",
  "6:00: We head back to the house. Jason is driving now that we had met up with him. The car ride is fun. I really enjoyed the music. I had never heard it before but it was very psychedelic. Safe at home I sit in the front yard and smoke a cigarette. The clouds are full of geometric patterns. There was a definite color shift in my vision at this time. The sky was a sea green, the grass was a little yellow. What really struck me was that things I knew to be white were all a light shade of purple. I was really thinking about some philosophical things at this point, but couldn't convey what it was I was thinking to my friends quite yet. A couple hours pass by where I'm the tripping guy on the porch being really quiet. I spend most of that time deep in thought about life's great mysteries.",
  "8:45: Stan rolls a blunt and we hotbox the bathroom. I love to blow smoke rings and I was on it. They were thick and beautiful. I felt so connected with them, as if they were my children. I gave them life, created them. It made me sad to see them fade away. I thought about how everything has to die some time.",
  "9:10: I have to leave to bring my mom's van home. This is a somewhat frightening thought although I knew that I was most of the way done with any real hallucination and I knew that I had driven under worse circumstances. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] It still always worried me to drive on psychedelics and I had been hoping I wouldn't have to. The trip home took about 15 minutes. Nothing really happened: most of the minor visuals had left and I still felt like I was rolling. My fear and anxiety about driving turned to relief and joy when I realized that I love driving when I'm rolling. So the trip home was full of loud music and not much else. I get home, give the keys to my mom and call Cathy to come pick me up.",
  "11:30: I smoked some pot. Almost all the effects have worn off. I'm still very much awake. Cathy still hasn't left but she is about to. I'm excited to leave my house. After getting to the apartment I decide to do the last of my mix without the 2C-I. I share with Linda, Cathy's friend from out of town. We each snort 70mg of a 1:1 ratio. The apartment belongs to my best friend and his girlfriend. Everyone but Linda and I are getting drunk. It was a pretty low dose since we split it but it was enough to brink back some of my earlier feelings, just less intense and much shorter lived. Linda, who hadn't done much of anything before, felt amazing. I got really philosophical while I was there. Linda acted as a catalyst for my thoughts. We bounced ideas back and forth. Made huge realizations together and changed each others' perception of a few things. I was pleased to find how easy it was to form my thoughts into words. I had come prepared for this night. I had a brush, mints, and Vicks in my backpack. Along with some pajamas that I love to wear on these kinds of drugs. Around 1:30 Linda was hungry and made food for everyone. I decided not to eat. I was fearful that eating might bring back the nausea from the 2C-I. We smoked, listened to music, and talked until around 2:30when I had our DD take me home. I had a headache at this point, not bad, but enough to make me want to sleep. Ifell asleep within 10 minutes of hitting my bed.",
  "All in all this was a really wonderful experience. I believe the other chemicals took away from the 2C-I's psychedelics somewhat but made up for it by providing lots of empathy and euphoria. I reached a ++ and almost hit a +++ when I was lost in the pond. I also noticed myself actually being able to stay on a deep train of thought. I usually lose that with 2C-I and all of my thinking feels superficial. Not this time though. I really don't recall thinking so clearly before. It is the next day, I slept well, woke up refreshed. I don't feel hungover. I attribute that to staying hydrated the whole night.",
  "Do not ever use mind altering chemicals and operate a vehicle. It was stupid for me to do so. I do not suggest mixing chemicals in this way unless you are experienced and do proper research on how those chemical might react.</p>"
