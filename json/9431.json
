 "report": "</p>\nUnder the stunted oak I waited for her</p><p>the Green Lady</p><p>clothed in the black of the mystified, the lost,</p><p>but more truly, naked and unshriven, seeking a dying moment.</p><p>Under my tongue, the bitter mint</p><p>above my head, invisible leaves,</p><p>known only for the moonlight they intercept</p><p>below my back, the green grass that saw me through my youth.</p><p>She came to me in a spirograph body</p><p>wings twined with ivy in curliqued ringlets</p><p>her fingers the thorns of roses pointed with the blood of the unworthy</p><p>the edges of her smile reaching up to the stars, her teeth, barbed spikes</p><p>I had not expected fear, but terror came with her</p><p>and tho I sought a dying moment, she showed me a dying eternity</p><p>and tho I sought to bring wisdom into the real, she tore the real from me</p><p>and I was no more, and in unbeing, I lost my fear</p><p>She made me into a mist, expanding slowly until I was all</p><p>everywhere, blown by the wind of her breath</p><p>into eddies and whorls within myself</p><p>and it was I that her wings beat, to keep her aloft</p><p>She flew in me, acrobatically spinning and turning</p><p>casting off parts of myself in colors I have never seen</p><p>I flowed across her wings, she breathed me</p><p>and I flowed through her grasslike hair</p><p>Soon, oh, too soon,</p><p>boundries encircled me and I contracted, condensed</p><p>and rained myself on the stunted oak, and dripped from it in rivulets</p><p>and froze beneath it into this mortal body, clothed in black of the still</p><p>mystified, but no longer lost.</p><p> 2001 Lizard</p>",
