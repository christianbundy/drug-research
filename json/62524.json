 "report": "<p>T-0M 40 MG mCPP Taken</p><p>T-38m</p><p>Not feeling much yet, only a little 'wierdness' but I can't put my finger on what it is.</p><p>T-58m</p><p>Kind of dizzyness set in, also very tired since I did not sleep last night. That might be attributing to this. I also feel some very mild nausea with a mouthwatering effect at this point. I do not feel any significant euphoric effects yet.</p><p>T-1h.32m</p><p>Feeling mild euphoria, tiredness still here, mild jaw clenching going on. Nausea and 'Mouth Watering effect' is completely gone now. I can say i'm at a +1 right now. Nothing major or magical yet, wondering if I took too little.</p><p>T-2h:36m</p><p>I'm probably at a +2 now, ingested 60mg more of mCPP and 30mg Adderall XR. Euphoria is good, seems like more a mellow euphoric bliss.</p><p>-Summary:</p><p>This chemical seems not to go so good on its own. After I added the Adderall + 60MG mCPP the euphoria went up around x5 fold. Still alot of exploring to do left on this chem. I don't think this will become a restricted chemical, since its abuse potential is probably less than a tylenol PM =P. It definitely does not live up to the hype.</p>",
