  "<p>Well, I'd like to begin by saying that I never try anything without doing an enormous amount of research into it first, and I suggest the same to all others experimenting with research chemicals.  That being said, I had heard from friends about AMT, and 5-Meo-Amt so I ordered 1/2 gram.  I knew that this was an extremely powerful drug and I knew that I also did not have a mg scale.  So, I had read about the dissolving method in alcohol.  Because I wanted a nice easy measurement, I combined the 500mg with 500ml of 80 proof vodka making a nice easy measurement of 1mg/ml. ",
  "The first time I tried it I went for 5mL...and got nothing...so I gradually moved up.  By the time i felt anything remote close to a sensation it was at 15mL.  Then, nothing unusual happened as i kept upping dosage.  To make a long story really short (I went up about two mL every couple days), I wound up taking 25mL.  At this dosage, there was a very definite sensation coursing through my being.  The most noticeable thing was the pounding of my heart.  there was no way to tell if it was racing, or if it simply beat like that all the time and the only difference was I could hear it and feel it now. ",
  "There were no visual or auditory hallucinations.  The most vivid thing i remember was my mind racing trying to unravel the deepest mysteries of existence.  for the eight hours or so my mind could not and would not stop racing, and i didn't feel like I ever wanted it to stop.  At about 5:00 a.m. I went to sleep for a couple of hours. ",
  "I have tried this dosage a number of times since then and had mixed reactions.  I can't help thinking that the solution was simply too dilute for effectiveness (even though it still tastes gritty when I drink it, even when enjoying a 'special screwdriver' where I put less than a shot of vodka into it).  The experience, which is what it is all about in the end, was something I enjoyed, especially the self analysis. My mind can take the strain that comes with 8-10 hours of constant higher level thought processes, but it isn't easy.  When it starts to wear off, I am totally exhausted, but not physically.  It is a mental weariness I experienced, but that special kind of good tired that comes only every once in a special while (like after sex) and happy sleep is all that comes.</p>"
