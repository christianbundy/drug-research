  "<p>I have a spinal condition and I experiment with the help of Pain Mgt. quite a bit and this tip came directly from my PC (Dr.)",
  "Before I use my AZctiq Lozenge I do a mouthwash rinse and brush my mouth with Straight Baking Soda, Arm and Hammer works great. Afterward I rinse and then suck on Lozenge to moistewn it up. Then I apply the Loznege directly into a bag/box of backing soda and get a nice coating, then stick the thing in my mouth against my cheek. This somehow increases the bioavailabilty of the drug matrix into the blood stream by the chemical action/reaction of the baking soda. I can increase the effects and longevity of the Lozenge by almost 30-40%. This is great for those of us who are on strict regiments and contracts of limited meds.</p>"
