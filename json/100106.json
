 "report": "<p>\n[Erowid Note: This report is marked as an LSD report, but readers should be aware there are aspects of it that suggest the identification is speculative.]</p><p>Date: 4/26/2013</p><p>Time: 14-18 hours</p><p>Place: My house, all alone.</p><p>Male, 164 pounds</p><p>Dose: 1 small blotter that looks as if it came off of an intricate design, the blotter has an eye on it.</p><p>6:45: I'd been planning for this moment all week. I napped for an hour and meditated for 15 minutes or so. I was ready, I took the hit with good vibes, as this was my first time. I decided to keep it under my tongue for about 15 minutes before swallowing, this deemed a good choice as it contributed to the intense come up I experienced.</p><p>7:05 pm: I'd noticed a quite bitter taste from the blotter, and of course, resulting in anxiety for an individual like me. Thoughts piled in at the back of my head that this may be a different trip. However, my tongue did not get numb, and the bitter taste was not very distinct. I figured it may be the blotter. I swallowed it at this moment.</p><p>7:35 pm: My thoughts are racing, I am quite confused. My anxiety is out the roof right about now in what to expect. I felt very queasy. It felt as if my stomach did not settle right with the hit. I'd eaten a foot long sandwich around 12 pm. I'd planned for this trip, and even if it was artificial, I was ready to absorb all the information possible. Synthetic drugs and research chemicals do not present meaningless experiences. I began to think back at my past intense mushroom experiences, noticing the very present skin flushing.</p><p>7:50: I am at a +++ right about now and I can not describe or really recall everything that was happening at this time. I began to have an intense full body purge at about 7:45 and it consisted of all excretion of sweat and all else, quite a petrifying experience but I felt absolutely great afterwards. I am trying to level my head out, my pupils are dilated almost to the point of no color on my eye and my thoughts are racing. It felt like a very intense 2.5-3.5g mushroom come up. I threw up the blotter that I had absorbed about an hour or so after I kept it under my tongue and swallowed it.</p><p>8:30: The bodily purge is about over, thankfully. After I got off of the toilet I rushed back to my room, though it felt like forever. Every step was like ten steps, and I was quite lethargic yet stimulated at the same time. It was a strange feeling. It was like a very intense mushroom trip with a stimulating body high edge. I noticed my mushroom flashbacks and realized that I was in for a positive trip, and not to worry about a single thing.</p><p>8:45: Waves of euphoria equivalent to repetitive orgasms came over me. I was marveling at the existence of this powerful energy. Every time I'd close my eyes I'd see wonderful CEVs unlike any I've seen before. Even with some potent mushrooms, it takes a lot to me to get powerful visuals. This was throwing me right into hyperspace and I didn't even know it! I saw minor kaleidoscope visuals with slight color whenever I closed my eyes and light was shifting around my vision. What a wonderful come up.</p><p>9:30: My friend decided to stop by with his significant other, and we match a couple bowls of bud. We both had some very nicely grown herbs and it was pretty nice. I was trying to explain them what I had experienced but I was baffling. I couldn't explain my feelings so why bother? I just acted as if I was okay and they asked me to roll a joint for them since I had a roller and papers, and I thought in my head, why is this guy asking someone on acid to roll a joint? I didn't know, but I did it anyway. We smoked another bowl and he left. I was still quite very high, still peaking. My vision was very hazey still and the walls were wavey and very vivid. Everything was fluent, alive, and colorful. I was really enjoying this.</p><p>12:00: I had some small visions and maybe even came close to a breakthrough with that powerful purge, but the powerful effects were now being amplified by the home made hashish. It was quite potent I thought, and it burned evenly with my herb. The effects were indescribable, the pulsations of positive energy were still coming over me. It was so nice. I could hardly notice the stoney effect, rather mostly noticed the THC effecting my already psychedelic behavior. I loved bringing back the peak visuals, it was so entertaining.</p><p>2:40: Three girls showed up that my brother had brought over. I'd met a couple of them before and they lived in the area. Apparently they got the same Lucy from same guy that I trusted and it had only been an hour or so. Our guy was informed on RCs and was quite loud about this being the real thing. My brother never experienced psychedelics and it was wonderful seeing him on the same acid tripping balls, coming to introspection. He is normally so closed-minded. I noticed all the girls talked how I did when I was sober, so it made me laugh. One of the girls handed me a hit off of the same sheet I'd taken earlier, and I took it. She said 'Smoke me out?' so I did happily. I smoked the rest of my 4/20 hash and shake with them and they loved it, they were tripping very hard. It made me so happy to be in this time at this place experiencing this, and it was incredible I thought that this was happening.</p><p>3:45: I notice that all the bud has piled on with the lethargic come down of the acid, and it has me experiencing a very trippy slow-mo kind of visual buzz. It was quite euphoric but interesting at the same time. I was smoking like a chimney with these girls, because for some reason, I just felt so happy to see them. I smoked so much that night I just felt like I couldn't smoke too much. I smoked over 2 grams myself and more with the girls out of the waterpipe. The indica was really hitting me, and it had me on a codeine like trip and I loved it. I still felt the acid hyperspace for sure, and I knew this was the real thing because it still had me stimulated. What a wonderful drug, I thought. It's almost as if this was supposed to happen the first time I experienced this teacher.</p><p>6:00: I smoked the last bowl with the girls and said goodbye, gave hugs and they drove home. (DON'T DRIVE tripping, EVER. The designated driver had taken 2 hits 10 HOURS earlier and she was on antidepressants and hardly had effects! Do not ever take the selfish risk of drinking/tripping and driving!) I still felt the intense euphoria of the comedown and it was awesome. I took an etizolam (1 mg) an hour or so earlier, and honestly it did not do much to help my sleep. I was able to get about 6 hours of sleep or so before being awaken just by my parents talking downstairs.</p><p>It was such a majestic experience, and I was glad I was able to meet Lucy on such a night. I knew I could trust my friend, as he said this was a double dropped hit. He said it was anywhere from 80-150 'mics'. It really blew me out of this world, and I could only compare it to my 3.5-6g mushie trips. Most parts of my peak experience I am still trying to recall and gather back information on, because the flashbacks were so intense.</p><p>What a lovely psychedelic. While I must admit, mushrooms are still my favorite, this definitely comes second. Two hits or maybe even 1 1/2 would have been a breakthrough, and I don't know if I could have been able to comprehend it. I usually start on the lower end of the doses before moving up with psychedelics, just so I can remember and analyze past trips. When I woke up at 12 PM the next day, my pupils were still very dilated for a couple hours. I felt the afterglow for about a week and I still get small visual effects when I smoke my daily bowls. It's had a very positive impact on my life and I am so grateful I was able to come in contact with an entity as great as Lucy at such wonderful circumstances.</p><p>But please, be aware, when buying from any friend or dealer, you could be buying any sort of RC or drug. I am almost positively sure that this was the real thing because my friend said his guy always had it tested, and my experience seems to reflect what I've read. By Lucy I mean LSD/sunshine, of course, and I don't mean any confusion here.</p><p>Take precaution with this wonderful teacher, you will feel her awful hang over/comedown effects for a day or two afterwards! It was quite physical. The perpetual thought loop was also very powerful.</p>",
