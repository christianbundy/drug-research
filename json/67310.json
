 "report": "<p>10:35 downed 6 pills.</p><p>Total time recorded 3 hours</p><p>Pills taste like burying your face in the coat of a filthy wet dog who recently rolled in the rotting corpse of a homeless curry-chilidog street vendor who has one pair of pants.</p><p>11:26pm</p><p>No discernable effect.  Burps taste like monkey crotch.  Worse than that, but words elude me as to a worse taste.</p><p>12:00</p><p>Mild sedation.  Calm body depression, feels as though a very thin coating of lead has been painted all over my extremities.  Effects increasing during the writing of the midnight entry.  More to come.</p><p>12:50</p><p>Leveled off with a light relaxed body feel, strange emphasis in facial muscle relaxation, probably not normal.  Burps finally taste like satan has closed the portal to hell, which was in my stomach but partially blocked by the corpse of a dead rhino.</p><p>1:15</p><p>Steady and still relaxed feeling.  Probably sitting at the computer goofing around wasn't the best self-awareness program for recording the effects.  But, here it is.  :) </p><p>Overall:  mild sedation and complete retention of emotional state, aches and pains still present.  The slightest sense of detachment from my surroundings, similar to the first foothills of trip country, wherein things seem unreal or as if I am seeing them for the first time.</p>",
