  "Under the stunted oak I waited for her",
  "the Green Lady",
  "clothed in the black of the mystified, the lost,",
  "but more truly, naked and unshriven, seeking a dying moment.",
  "Under my tongue, the bitter mint",
  "above my head, invisible leaves,",
  "known only for the moonlight they intercept",
  "below my back, the green grass that saw me through my youth.",
  "She came to me in a spirograph body",
  "wings twined with ivy in curliqued ringlets",
  "her fingers the thorns of roses pointed with the blood of the unworthy",
  "the edges of her smile reaching up to the stars, her teeth, barbed spikes",
  "I had not expected fear, but terror came with her",
  "and tho I sought a dying moment, she showed me a dying eternity",
  "and tho I sought to bring wisdom into the real, she tore the real from me",
  "and I was no more, and in unbeing, I lost my fear",
  "She made me into a mist, expanding slowly until I was all",
  "everywhere, blown by the wind of her breath",
  "into eddies and whorls within myself",
  "and it was I that her wings beat, to keep her aloft",
  "She flew in me, acrobatically spinning and turning",
  "casting off parts of myself in colors I have never seen",
  "I flowed across her wings, she breathed me",
  "and I flowed through her grasslike hair",
  "Soon, oh, too soon,",
  "boundries encircled me and I contracted, condensed",
  "and rained myself on the stunted oak, and dripped from it in rivulets",
  "and froze beneath it into this mortal body, clothed in black of the still",
  "mystified, but no longer lost.",
