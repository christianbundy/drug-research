 "report": "<p>Surfing thru my medicine cabinet, I came across a bottle of Namenda, which was used by my grandmother who has Alzheimers.</p><p>I decided to find out what this stuff was, so after looking it up on Wikipedia, I learned much.</p><p>Apparently, it is not only an NMDA antagonist, but an uncompetitive antagonist at different nicotinic neuronal receptors, as well as a 5ht3 receptor antagonist.  Having had much experience with DXM, I was curious to see how similar it was to my favorite drug of choice, and since the doctors took my Gram Gram of these meds, what else could I do?</p><p>I started by taking one of the 10mg tablets, which did not seem to do much, nor did I expect it to.</p><p>The next time I tried it I took 30mg, and definitely noticed something there, a sort of speedy, euphoric feeling.</p><p>Then the pills sat in the cupboard for a few weeks, and I mostly forgot about them.</p><p>Today, however, after being bored for several hours, I remembered that I had them, so</p><p>I reread all of the old wiki information, and decided to try it again.</p><p>This time I took 40mg, which did not seem to do anything for about an hour, after which I started to gradually feel its effects coming on.</p><p>It has been several hours now, and I definitely would say that there is something here, in fact, it is great!</p><p>I would compare it to a cross between DXM and MDMA, without any jaw clenching, yuckiness.</p><p>I would also note, that after taking DXM for about a year straight, five days a week, in doses of about 150 to 200 milligrams, I became somewhat hypersensitive to it, whereas most sources say it is active around 150mg I was now getting my euphoric feelings off of just 75mg. This may mean I am also hypersensitive to this NMDA antagonist.</p><p>I was actually very addicted to DXM and continued taking it- every other day for weeks at a time, and quitting for several weeks, then back to it, and so on- for about two more years.</p><p>As of these experiments with memantine, I have not been using DXM for about six months, but I would still assume that my sensitivity is an issue, because after stopping DXM use for over a month, I would still be able to get high off of five robogels=75mg.</p><p>Anyhow, I am definitely very interested in this medication, and as there are 56 pills left, I will continue experimenting with larger doses.</p>",
