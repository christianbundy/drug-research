 "report": [
  "<p>Me and two of my buddies each took 5 grams of these mushrooms, which came from one of our good friends.  They were ordered from a retailer in Indiana, who was selling them as poisonous non-consumables.  We took them at about 6:00 PM, I crushed mine up and mixed them with applesauce, and my buddies preferred to just munch them down.  We waited with much anticipation for about an hour, while just chilling out. ",
  "After about an hour, my friend told me that my pupils looked a little big, but I felt normal.  We went back and took 3g more, in hopes that this would start the trip.  Nothing happened whatsoever.  There was a period of about 30 minutes, when we where outside smoking a cigarette, where we noted that we all felt 'cracked out,' as if we were on the downside of a trip.  There was never any body buzz, auditory or visual halucinations, or any sense of trippin.  The only noted side effect was stomach cramps, and rank gas.  What a waste of money in my opinion.  I have tried mushrooms,exstacy, cocaine, and marijuana before and had great times.  The experience produced no desireable results at all.  A fuckin waste of money and time.  I'll stick to my other drugs and the mushrooms that make me trip, none of this feeling sick or cracked out bullshit.</p>"
