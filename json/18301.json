  "[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.]",
  "Some of my friends can get legal speed in the form of dexedrine, I was visiting one of them and he gave me few tablets, I chose to crush 3,5 pills and prepare a solution for injection, I did not have proper cotton filter so I used cigarette filter. Upon injection I felt moderate amphetamine buzz, but also intense pain in my forehead. I left the place and could not function very well, I went twice in wrong traing and I was about to faint all the time.",
  "I figured that lots of fillers from the pills passed through my filter and I slammed them too. This is now 20 hours later and feel horrible pain in my head and I am very weak, my legs shake and I feel moderate nausea. I also feel that I seriously lost some intelligence! This is horrible thing to experience and I wrote this to warn others about injection of pills with plenty of fillers. I'm gonna go lie down now and hope to get some more sleeps and for better feelings."
