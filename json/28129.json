 "report": "<p>I'm on a daily dose of 300mg of Wellbutrin XL. I hadn't tripped since starting the medication, but I had tripped before hand and personally experienced higher than normal reaction to the drug. However since taking the medication I have tried to trip twice with no noticeable results at all. The first time I also smoked marijuana and was merely high and never felt anything else. I thought maybe it was a mild trip and I was too high to notice so the second time I was sober otherwise. I ate them at approximately 9pm one night and gave up and went to bed at 1am. No visual experience, no body buzz, not even diffuclty sleeping. Both times other friends ate some of the same batch and tripped quite nicely, but none for me.</p>",
