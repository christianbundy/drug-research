I was talking about making a fire with ether, and nick mentioned how he wanted to try huffing it. So I told him to look it up online, and we did, and after I read the first story, I had made my choice; I was going to huff ether tonight. I went downstairs and got some rags and the Vehicle igniter (ether) or what ever its called.  We went outside and sat down in my back yard and I soaked the two rags and handed one to nick. When I first huffed it, it felt like I pissed my pants because all of a sudden, the 30 degree weather felt like nothing, and I felt warmth spread from my head to my toes, inch by inch. I started getting a loud echo in my ears, and at this moment, about 45 seconds into my first rag, I felt EXACTLY like I had just taken a hit from a can of air duster.</p><p>I inhaled once more, and that changed right away. It got more intense, and I started laughing in a very high pitch laugh, and it echoed off of my house, and I felt like I was in a tunnel. I don't remember anything for about 10 minutes after that except for doing another rag. I got up and started marching around my back yard, not being able to feel anything other than my head. I sat back down and did another rag, and once again, my high stepped up. I was in a world of Deja-vu.</p><p>My life had become nothing but Deja-vu. I felt like everything I was doing had already been written into fate and I was watching my life from fate's perspective. Everything I did felt like a key fitting perfectly into place, and I get a strong feeling of being complete. After my 3rd rag, I started to understand it all, I finally understood life, why I was here, why everything was happening. I did 4 more rags but I don't really remember anything else, except that ether is by far the most intense drug I have ever done and at the moment I am in love with it, and also about to do up a few rags in a little bit.</p>",
