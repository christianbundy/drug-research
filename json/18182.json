  "I dropped 1 tab, basically had a very sketchy bad trip.  The next morning I woke up and everything was a little flashy and i thought it would go away but it didn't.",
  "I have had it for 8 months know and I often find myself trying to peer through the weirdness but i never can. I call it the 'CONFUSION' because it is very unpleasant especially at the age of 15. To tell the truth I really hate it and wish I could reverse to the day I took it and get pissed instead."
