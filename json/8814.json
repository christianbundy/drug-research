  "Recently I had acquired some Subutex from a friend, and I am prescribed Klonopin (CLONAZEPAM). I heard and have read warnings about mixing these to drugs together, especially intravenously, but I am and experienced opiate user it takes about 200 milligrams of oxycodone I.V. to put me into a nod so I thought I would give this a try...",
  "I crushed up the Subutex and the Klonopin then placed the powders into a spoon. I warmed them very gently with a candle and then drew up the solution about .35 CC's and hit my vein on the first shot...",
  "I really didn't feel anything after the first shot so I added more water to the spoon and heated what was left and hit my vein again. I repeated this process one more time (note I never added more subutex or klonopin to the spoon in between shots I just wanted to make sure I got it all.) By the time I had pulled the syringe out the third time a huge wave had come over me I felt like I had just done like 7 bags of heroin but yet I could control myself or so I thought...",
  "After about 20 min's from the first shot I decided to lie down and rest a little only because I was feeling so comfortable and it seemed like a good idea... Needless to say it probably wasn't, I blacked out and woke up 3 and a half hours later still high as shit, my guess was that the Clonazepam had just worn off not the Buprenorphine and that was why I had woken up. The opiate high I had first experienced had been relatively unchanged, the experience was nothing like that of heroin or oxycodone-it's onset was relatively slow comparably, but once it hit me it lasted all day long and it was very enjoyable."
