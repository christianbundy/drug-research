 "report": "<p>I take Zyprexa on a daily basis for depression and it helps I suppose. I was told it should help my anxiety also which it very well does not, but oh well. </p><p>I've been on zyprexa for just over two weeks this time around and it doesn't do anything other than make me a little tired and very very hungry. All I want to do now is eat or go make me something to eat. I think I'm going to tell my doctor that I want to discontinue taking the zyprexa due to the rapid weight gain I'm experiencing.</p>"
