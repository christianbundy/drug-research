  "I've been a user of DXM (cough syrup) for over a year now. The reason I used DXM over other drugs was because it supposably isn't detectable in drug tests. I was fine for the first few, but recently every time I've taken DXM it has showed up as PCP in my urine tests. I've found it will give a clear positive reading for up to two or three days after the use, and a slight positive for up to a week (meaning the line on the test strip is faintly there instead of clearly there). This is just a fair warning that DXM is detectable in urine tests now. Although, because it is a 'false positive' when it is sent to the lab the results should come back negative; But that is a pain and cost money to do."
