 "report": "<p>Well, i opened the bag containing the stuff then ,eyed ball it in a capsule that i ate at 13:00</p><p>At t+2 i noticed visuals on my comp</p><p>At t+4 i couldnt stay anywhere so i decided so go to bed, and what i can say is that stomach discumfurt is so bad that it becomes hell.</p><p>One intersting point about that stuff is when looking oneself face into a mirror, i was able to control the visual about my own face, focusing into my right eye.</p><p>This Worked instantly and i could look like what i was feeling, sometimes dark visuals (like becoming some kind of dark monster) sometimes a beautiful boy.</p><p>Well hard to explain, but it seemed my own spirit was sending orders through my right pupil, then receiving it and computing it into appropriate visuals ...</p><p>Kinda funny no ???</p><p>After that my brain was really tired but the effect did not go away and i really wanted it to go out of my body.</p><p>I felt like this substance was in every cells of my body, like some kind of intoxication (not very pleasant to me).</p><p>At t+9 it became to go out, i went to sleep after having taken 1500 mg of aspirin and at 3:00 AM a big stomach cramp woke me up: waaaah please stop that!!! I wanna sleep !!!!</p><p>2CE said me bye bye and then i slept normally.</p><p>Finally, this stuff is no fun, and it hurts to much to have a good trip.</p><p>But what one can discover can be interesting, well, anyway the stuff went into toilets because i dont want to spoil a Saturday anymore like that.</p>",
