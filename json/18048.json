  "I use Salvia as an incense as it is intended for. First I purify some dried leaves with copal resin placed on a hot coal. I like the smell of copal, and it is good aid for meditation. After some time I then take the leaves and crush them and drop them on the coal. Then I just enjoy the fragrance of the leaves as they burn on the coal with the copal.",
  "The incense gives me a very relaxing and anti-depressant, 'glowing' feeling, a lucid clarity of mind and a sense of well being. If done before sleep I will have incredible dreams and dream recall, and many times they will be lucid dreams. If used as intended, it is a beneficial for aid for meditation."
