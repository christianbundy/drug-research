  "<p>Deprivation of smoke can lead to curiosity, which has been said to kill cats.  Fortunately, I'm not a cat.",
  "Prompted by a longterm lack of cigarettes and weed, I decided, a few days ago, to pick some sage leaves out of an herb box out on the porch and try to smoke it.  I left them on a high cabinet where they wouldn't be disturbed for a few days, actually about half a week, to dry.  I would've used an oven, but I researched and found the boiling point of Thujone, the supposed active chemical in Sage, to be slightly lower than that of water.",
  "I checked on the leaves earlier today, and by checking that one of them burned quite nicely when lit with a match I determined they were dry enough to smoke.  I took two thin OCB papers and stuck them together so there would be more paper to help the plant burn, as I was unaware of how well sage burns, and I often either double-paper or spliff when I'm burning particularly moist weed.  I broke up the leaves, observing quite a strong smell that made me think of minty lotion.  I saved a little for later and came out with a relatively thin cigarette.",
  "I had tried once before to smoke sage from a box in my spice cabinet, but it was finely ground into a powder and the cigarette didn't drag well.  I also assume the company must've heated the plant up to dry it quicker, boiling out the water and all the Thujone.",
  "I wasn't expecting much from my sage cigarette as I headed outside, but I figured I might as well smoke it, just to enjoy the act of smoking.  I lit it and found it to burn nicely, though the double papering was a bit unnecessary and the cigarette burned somewhat quickly.  The smoke had that same minty lotion taste and it stung my mouth a bit as I inhaled.  My lungs are quite numb to smoke, so I'd be a poor judge of whether or not it was particularly harsh.  My mindset was clear, though I was obviously bored enough to be smoking garden sage.",
  "I began to experience a bit of light headedness, which I believe happens whenever someone inhales smoke.  But, to my great surprise, I began to feel mildly inebriated.  And it didn't go away.  It slowly got stronger.  I decided that this first cigarette had worked nicely and I'd try a second, rolling the rest of what I had, this time into just one paper.  I smoked it and the effects began to kick in stronger.",
  "The high is mild, though there was certainly a high.  I felt a nice buzzy feeling inside my head, as I always do from drinking or weed.  There was almost no body high.  Weed has often given an effect I like to call crazy thoughts, or the rapid flow of ideas.  Sage provided very little of that, though I was feeling quite spacey.  I smoked the sage about 3 and a half hours ago and I still have a nice buzz in my head.",
  "Overall, fresh Sage gives a nice, and I reiterate, surprisingly nice head buzz and it definitely makes me high, though it's DEFINITELY NOT weed.  I did a little more research, though and found Thujone to be toxic to the liver and brain, so I would not recommend this. ",
  "Anyway, that's about it.  Peace.</p>"
