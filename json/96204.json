 "report": "<p>It's now been almost exactly 1 year since this incident, so I thought I'd get things off my chest and write up a trip-submission. First thing to know : I am a dumbass. Do not ever do what I did and fuck yourself like this.</p><p>The day starts off normally, I get up, get dressed, go to school at 4PM. Nothing out of the ordinary. A friend named Cole gets up and goes to the bathroom for a few minutes, and comes back, breath reeking of smoke and pot. He says to me 'dude, I am so fucking high right now' and me, being the dumbass that I am, said 'wow dude, what did you just smoke', and instead of telling me, he literally shows me the sack of JWH he had in his pocket and the little ghetto-rigged bowl made of aluminum foil and a pen-tube. He looked pretty high, was smiling, looking at me like he held some sort of great big secret that nobody else knew, like the punchline to a hilarious joke that nobody else could understand. I, being a retard, obliged when he said 'here man, why don't you go smoke some, just seal the bag back up and pass it back'</p><p>So I go into the bathroom and smoke the JWH. Less than 1mg, and I think I smoked a bit of plastic there too. But I'm positive it was NOT a whole mg even, he didn't have very much to begin with, so I pulled a couple ant-sized crumbs out of the bag and lit them up in the ghetto-rigged inkpen.</p><p>After lighting the 'bowl', I held the smoke in, so there would be nothing for the teachers and janitors to smell (see I thought I was being smart here and not getting caught) which I thought was a great idea at the time. I held the smoke in for at least 30 to 45 seconds, or however long it took me to piss, zip my pants up, flush toilet, wash hands, dry hands with papertowel etc. I immediately felt intensely stoned upon exhaling.</p><p>I sprayed febreeze in the bathroom liberally, hid the pipe in the bottom of the trashcan (sneaky sneaky), and sealed up the baggy and tucked it into my pocket. At this point, I am gone. Not thinking a single thought whatsoever. I don't remember what I was thinking, because I feel I was literally not thinking any thoughts. And I thought nothing of this at the time, of course. I was just stoned.</p><p>I fumbled around trying to get the door open, but forgot how to work a doorknob for a split second, and when I remembered, the sound it made was so loud, like I was hearing the air rush through the seal in the door. Then my thinking suddenly came back and I thought Wow Marc, You sure are fucked up for such a small amount of fake-weed. I walked back to class, which seemed to take at least 3 hours to do, and I felt like I was entering one of my limbo-like states where everything in a 2 or 4 second elapsed period would loop itself seemingly endlessly. Drove me insane. I finally got back to class, sat down next to Cole, and we started laughing. Then I really started to feel like this was going to be very very bad.</p><p>Cole looks at me with this look that I strangely thought I had seen somewhere before, and he said the words in this voice I thought I had heard before somewhere but coulnd't recall where from. He said 'hey, did you seal the baggie?', repeating this sentence at least 4 or 5 times, then all I remember was feeling like I was flying downward, as if falling from a great height, down through the floor, and a sensation in my skull like someone tapping my chin with a sledgehammer ever so slightly. Then I started seeing these colour-changing balls of light, bouncing with the beats of the hammer on my chin, falling down a neverending staircase, and suddenly realised I was in some kind of coma-like state. I could think, but could not see anything or hear anything other than what I described here. I  began to feel terrified that I would be in a coma for the rest of my life and never wake up. I began to not want to wake up, for if I did I'd be in a world of shit for it with the police, the school, and my parents.</p><p>Then I started to recreate situations from earlier that day in my coma, like putting on my clothes and doing my morning routine, conversations with my mom on the way to school, except the visual-scenery part was all off, like from a different angle, as if I weren't sitting in the passenger seat of the car, but was lying on the floor in the back, as a vegetable.</p><p>I also could not understand a word people were saying, and I can only describe this feeling as 'Feeling like a vegetable.' I couldn't think at all toward the end of this weird trip, which I later found out to be a sort of epileptic seizure, which I am now prone to while/after smoking JWH from now on. I suddenly snap-to, wide awake, but only for a split-second do I have this crazy burst of energy. It ends so quickly I can feel it, and I realise my mouth is incredibly dry and I'm still shaking and sweating and very very exhausted. EMT's soon arrive on the scene and then I realised I was in deep shit, only making me panic. One of the EMT's took my vitals and noticed my heart BPM of about 220, then he shot me with Valium at least 4 or 5 times in the arm, trying to get my heart to slow down.</p><p>I eventually calmed the fuck down and was released from the hospital after one of the scariest most fucked up days of my short life. I later found out from my doctor that my heart could have exploded (dunno about the legitimacy of exploding-hearts, but ok doc) or I could have died really slowly and painfully.</p><p>I will never touch that shit again.</p>",
