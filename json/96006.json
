 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: While it may be that the substances described below are MDA, Sassafras & 2C-P, Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure or misrepresented, often containing chemicals other than those they are presumed to contain. This report is marked as an MDA, Sassafras & 2C-P report, but readers should be aware that this is more of a general Ecstasy report.]</p><p>I am writing this at a point that is technically 2 days after time of ingestion, though yesterday I was experiencing a very strong afterglow and thus will be documenting it as well. I took a tab of 'ecstasy' called a root beer, it was unmarked and had the color of the root beer flavor of 'Bottle Caps' candy. The reason I place ecstasy in quotes is because I was told the pill contained MDA, Sassafrass, and 2C-P; but no MDMA. I have never experienced any of these substances and have nothing to compare it to, but I believe this was an accurate analysis based on the trip I had.</p><p>First, a little bit of background, feel free to skip this section if you just wanna get straight to the trip.  I work at a local grocery store, and it's springtime so we have a bunch of live plants and flowers for sale out front. A few weeks ago, I was inspired to plant a garden of my own (which is doing very well \n</p><p>Set and setting: I had been having a terrible day. I woke up 5 minutes before I had to be at work and had an 8 hour shift on a busy day ahead of me. I arrived late and extremely tired and throughout the day several customers actually tried to use me as part of their complicated plans for theft. When I finally got off and walked home I hardly said 2 words to my family, just went into my room and laid on the floor for a bit. However, when my phone rang and I saw my friend's name, let's call him Jay, I piqued up. We had been planning a Cinco de Mayo party at his house, but I thought it had been called off because he had to move at short notice into a one bedroom apartment. Apparently however, everything was still on and he was on his way to come and get me. I quickly got dressed and stunned my family when I walked back out the door.</p><p>Jays brother and this other guy (who looked like a girl) were with him. I climbed in the car and said hello and we took off. We were taking the girl-man home, which I was glad about because I didn't know him nor want to. Apparently at some point when I wasn't looking however, girly-man stuck a key in Jays nose and told him it was ketamine. When we dropped him off he asked if Jay felt it, to which he gave a big thumbs up. A few moments later however, he kind of zoned out and remarked That wasn't ketamine. I know what ketamine feels like and this is not it. I immediately suspected MXE, especially because he described it as more trippy. Interested and somewhat concerned, I repeatedly asked him exactly how he was feeling and watched his driving. It was somewhat scary for me, as I truly disapprove of driving under the influence, but he wouldn't let me get behind the wheel. Meanwhile, Jay's brother loaded a bowl of some very dank bud. I was already pretty high actually, but a few hits really hit me good if you know what I mean. As Jay is attempting to describe what he feels, I feel like I'm picking up on his vibes and starting to trip too  not very hard, just a general perception change, like something is just different. \r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>When we arrived at Jay's house, I found 4 other people waiting. Jay's roomate, M; Jay's other friend and his girlfriend; and Jay's girlfriend. There were plenty of margaritas floating around and a bong on the table  fun stuff. I took a sip of a margarita but then I remember what M has and what I had originally wanted to do tonight anyway  a Root Beer! ;) Being the great friend he is, he retrieved one for me, and told me I should parachute it. The pill was very hard to crush, it took almost 10 minutes of trying different methods and some powder was lost in transition. When it was done, I gathered up the material and put it in a small piece of napkin, then drank it with some water and licked my fingers</p><p>9:38 PM  The powder tastes disgusting from licking my fingers, it almost makes me nauseous. Forcing myself to forget about it, I grabbed a gallon of water and a glass and brought it to the couch. Jay's friend is playing Skyrim, he eventually hands it over to B (Jay's brother). I have never played it, and I watched with some amusement. I had a great body high already from the bud we had been smoking, and so I was concerned I wouldn't notice the roll right away, but it didn't end up mattering.</p><p>T+~1:00 The game had been turned off and we were switching to watch The Avengers when I had my first OEV  the TV grew about 1.5x and then shrank to about half size, then went back to normal. It was very rapid, less than a second total, but it made me realize something  I was grinding my teeth, and rubbing my hair, and it felt amazing, this couldn't just be the bud. Excited, I decided to try and experiment with CEVs. I happened to close my eyes just as I was taking a drag off a cigarette, and I noticed that I could still see the cig with my eyes closed. It looked like a blue wand or glow stick, and if I waved it around I could see a very faint tracer and whenever I opened my eyes the cig was in the same spot as it had been when they were closed. I excitedly told M about this though I don't remember what he said back to me.</p><p>At this point I neglected to check the clock very often, and my memory of the order of events is somewhat skewed, but sometime during the movie I began having some more intense CEVs. I saw huge, beautiful pink flowers swirling at the edges of my vision, bands of swirling fractals sweeping across my vision, and a field of pepper plants that had just been planted. However the visuals weren't exactly what I expected. They had kind of a black-and-white feel to them if that makes sense. They were very faint, almost like they weren't really there. I think that the best way to describe it would be that they weren't really closed eye visuals, but more like it enhanced my minds eye. Think about it this way, if you're completely sober and you close your eyes and envision something, say a field of grass, you can call that picture to your head and kind of see it. But on this tab, the visions I called to mind just had one extra level of clarity, one tiny link to the actual vision center of my brain, that let me actually see it. However they were not visions I could control, at least not in a big way.</p><p>I spent the majority of the movie zoning out though there was a good bit of talking as well. When it was over, we put some music on and set the visualizer on the TV. It was good music and I was having fun but the computer we were using kept freezing up and eventually I decided to put my headphones in and explore my inner space for a while.  This ends up being the most intense part of my trip, I would say it was around midnight. Flowers were popping up and swirling everywhere, of every type you could think of. Color however seemed to be a totally different pattern  it was as if what I was seeing was drawn on that type of paper that's black, but when you scratch it off there's a swirl of colors underneath. The color background was moving independent of the visuals themselves, but there were exceptions in certain objects that had a static color.</p><p>At one point I tired of the flower theme, and decided to try to see something else. I had been seeing two vertical bands of purple pansies, but when I had that thought they morphed into ghostly faces, with the darker inner part of the flower becoming a gaping mouth. It wasn't scary at all however, and I decided to pursue this vision and escape the realm of flowers. Eventually the faces morphed into a huge crowd, like I was standing on a stage high above them, but I could still make out each individual face. They all rapidly changed colors independent of one another as the colored background swirled behind them, and running through the middle of the crowd was a crooked line. It wasn't very wide but somehow I knew it was extremely deep and ancient. I was very intrigued by it and willed myself to explore it, and what did I find at the bottom? More plants! I allowed myself to enjoy whatever came to me for a little while longer but I began to want a cigarette.</p><p>I took out my headphones and stood up, rather suddenly. M wasn't in the room, so I went to look for him  he was using the toilet. Everyone else gave me kind of a surprised look, and Jay greeted me back to the world. I would say it was around 1-1:30 in the morning by this point, and as I looked around the room I could see some distortion in my peripheral vision and colors appeared much richer. M and I went outside to smoke but after a minute he said he had to go meet his friend real quick. I was rolling pretty hard and had an intense body high so I put my head down on the balcony railing for a bit when Jays other friend and his girlfriend came outside. He had a Newport  he was my new best friend. After we smoked we went in and loaded a bowl before Mr. Newport and his gf had to leave. With every hit I could feel the high getting more intense before I even exhaled. I was also able to take HUGE hits off of a bong with a very nasty reputation without a single cough, which is very unusual for me as even pipe hits can send me into a fit.</p><p>After they left we put on Across the Universe. I had never seen it before, but I didn't really pay attention to it because we were all talking. Turned out moot anyway, as Jay and his girl wanted to go to bed and since they sleep in the living room it meant no more TV. I joined M and his girlfriend in his room instead, and they were kind enough to share some Del Taco that she had went and got. I pigged out like crazy, which she kept wigging out about (Dude wow how can you eat when you're rolling? and stuff like that) but I explained to her that I hadn't eaten the whole day. I actually hadn't realized it prior to that however, which was weird. Anyway, we talked for a little while but soon it was time for bed. I grabbed a pillow and blanket for my spot on the floor, and was actually extremely comfortable. I put in my headphones and was treated to some nice subtle CEVs, I remembered to check the clock before I closed my eyes for good and noted it was 3:30am.</p><p>The next morning I woke up at 10 feeling very refreshed. The moment I opened my eyes I was awake, which hardly ever happens for me. However I immediately was curious if I was still under the influence, and closing my eyes confirmed it  I was treated to a faint vision of two buddha-like figures with a sun rising in between them. I wasn't too interested in it though, and got up for a glass of water. We hung around the apartment for a while, then went outside where I saw his neighbor and recognized him as a friend from high school. We smoked a bowl or three, then went back up to Jay's pad to get ready to leave. I had to take the bus home, so we said our goodbyes and I walked up the street. Across from the bus stop there's a Walgreens sitting up on a small hill, and between the parking lot and the side walk there was a steep incline that had been filled with decorated rocks (zeroscaping, the new thing in my area). As I was sitting there looking at this hill, I became enraptured by it. I felt like it pulled me in and wrapped around me, and it was pretty amazing. I was glad to still be feeling some effects, and looking forward to going to work for once. The bus ride was equally relaxing, I have ridden the bus a great many times and found it easy to get comfortable and zone out to my iPod.</p><p>Work was nothing special, I got off at around 10 and by then I felt pretty sober. When I got home I remembered I had no weed, just a single hit of some very weak hash oil. However I took that hit and needed no more  it not only got me high by itself but it potentiated the effects that I thought were gone and gave me a very nice rolling feeling. I wasn't able to produce any CEVs, however. Sleep came very easily.</p><p>Wow, that's a pretty long report. Overall I'm extremely happy with the experience, not only because I had a good time but because I don't believe that the CEVs can be attributed to either MDA or MDMA, meaning that there's a good chance I actually did get to try 2C-P! I have long been interested in RCs and always wanted to try one of the 2C family, so I'm glad that I was able to without having to go through the arduous process of finding a legitimate online vendor. Soon I hope to try 25i-NBOMe, as recently I have been looking for (nay, craving) a more visual psychedelic trip. As a note to anyone interested in trying this combination, or perhaps even one of these pills, I think that taking it in a more private setting would produce better results. There were too many distractions for me to really let the drug sink in, so to speak. Taking it alone or with one other individual would be best I think, doubly so if that individual is someone you are intimate with. Anyway, happy tripping people. (:</p>",
