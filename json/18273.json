  "I have used Kratom a couple of times and loved it each time.  I have experimented with weed, percocet, xanax and alcohol and I have to say that Kratom is my favorite drug by far.",
  "I usually use around 8 grams of powder.  I take dissolve it in warm water than pour orange juice over it to diffuse the taste which I find works rather well.",
  "In all my experiences I have found Kratom to induce a very relaxing and calm feeling.  Also, I experience pretty intense euphoria for about 3 hours.  After the 3 hour mark the effects start to fade and usually take another 3 hours to completely wear off.",
  "One thing that does suck about Kratom is I am usually left with a headache and a burnt out feeling similar to weed.  All in all, Kratom is awesome!"
