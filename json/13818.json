 "report": [
  "I was prescribed gabapentin for various nerve pains. I was to take 1 300mg capsule for pain as needed. This stuff did nothing for my pain, I even took 900mg at once... and nothing. I read there was some recreational value to it as well so I tried 1500mg all at once... nothing. To me, just a waste of time. the only thing I did feel out of it was some tightness in stomach/abdominal pains. So this was a waste of time."
