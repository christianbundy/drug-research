 "report": "<p>When I entered college, my main goals were to find a college that I could go to and play baseball at the same time.  I chose to go to a junior college so I could get more playing time.  Playing junior college baseball was my first direct contact with anabolic steroids.  Out of a 30-man roster, I would say that at least 12 of my teammates were on some form of steroids whether it be testosterone, Winstrol, or Deca-durabolin.  I witnessed some roid rage, but not directed towards me.  I also witnessed how much the guys who were juiced crashed after they came off of them.  Their bats became slower, and they lost all of the weight that they gained.  I also came to realize that anabolic steroid abuse in junior college baseball is rampant.  Every team that we would play had at least a couple of guys on the juice.  They do not drug test in NJCAA.</p><p>Anyways, three years later, I was at a 4 year university and I decided I wanted to try steroids to see what all the hype was about.  I bought a cycle of Ara-test 2500 aka test 250.  This bodybuilder I met told me exactly how to do a cycle.  So I followed his directions injecting every 6 days with different amounts according to what stage of the cycle I was in.</p><p>A day after my first injection, I felt immediate results.  I stepped up my lifting regiment as well.  It really made a difference while I was hitting.  I felt like He-man.  When I would swing the bat, it felt like I was barely swinging, and then I would watch the ball skyrocket out of the ball park.  I was able to hit the ball farther than I ever had before.</p><p>My goal was not to gain weight because I was already a big guy at the time. I was 215lbs.  I just wanted that extra power to hit the long ball.  I stayed pretty much the same weight, but I slimmed down a bit, turning fat into muscle.  The weight I was benching increased about 40 lbs in 6 weeks!</p><p>Now the drawbacks.</p><p>Steroids made me very angry.  I already had a short fuse before I got on the juice. It made that fuse almost non-existent.  I would blow up on my best friend, my girlfriend, and my teammates for seemingly little reasons.  I would be over at my best friends place, chillin smoking pot, and I would get fired up over nothing.  My friend would tell me constantly, 'Take it easy man.'</p><p>With my teammates, on the road it got ugly a couple of times.  One time my teammates were just messing around wrestling and such.  This skinny pitcher (I am a catcher by the way) decided it would be smart to go after me. Bad idea.  When he came at me, I litterally picked him up off the ground and choke slammed him to the ground.  Steroids made me feel like I could take on anyone who would pose a threat, no matter how small the threat. </p><p>People talk about your nuts shrinking when you are on steroids.  My nuts did not really shrink, they just were pulled up all the time, kind of like when I get out of a cold pool. My face also became puffy from the water retention.</p><p>After I got off the juice, my nuts went back to normal in about a week.  I also went from 215 to about 208 when I got off.  Ironically, I actually played better that season when I was off of the juice.  I think it had to do with the psychological effects of the juice.  I did not enjoy the constant on edge, or wound up feeling that it gave me.  I had a harder time focussing at the plate on the juice.  In fact in order to cut back on the roid rage and the feeling of being on edge, I would smoke pot before we would go to the game.  I was by no means still stoned by the time the game rolled around, but it took the edge off of the juice.</p><p>I do not see how anyone could take juice and not smoke pot.  The constant rage and anger started to eat at me, the only way that I could mildly chill out was by smoking more pot.  I still was angry, but not near as angry as I would have been without grass.</p><p>Steroids made me superhuman.  Little things like walking up stairs, made me feel like I was so much more powerful.  My whole body just felt lighter. </p><p>I would never do steroids again.  I am already angry enough, and I do not play baseball anymore, so I dont really have a reason to do them again.</p>",
