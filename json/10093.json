 "report": [
  "I was prescribed alprazolam for my anxiety problems, and knowing that it's commonly preferred in certain circles, I decided to try more than I was prescribed. At first I took 2 pills (1 mg), and waited for an hour for the effects to kick in. It affected my mind only mildly, and I felt somewhat disoriented, and a slight impairment in muscle coordination. Nevertheless, no significant or desired alteration happened to my mental state. My friend then consulted me, that I should take at least 1 mg more of that stuff. I did that, and started to drink beer in the hopes of some kind of euphoria that I have read and heard from others.",
  "After the fourth beer it started to kick in. It felt like I have drank double as much as I actually did. For some reason (this was very stupid, as you will soon find out) I decided to take 0.5 mg more. After that I had a complete blackout, and woke up very dizzy and disoriented after 5 hours. The bed was full of urine. I was fucked up and mad to myself.",
  "A few days after that I took only 1 mg when drinking heavily, passed out and had no hangover, which is a miracle and a good side effect of this drug :)",
  "The conclusion: I had no desired and good effects with alprazolam alone, but with alcohol it kicks in and hard."
