 "report": "<p>Subjects condition:</p><p>Subject 1: Took it very easy on the beer and smokes last night so relatively good. Slightly 'just got up' feeling if anything.</p><p>Subject 2: Mild Headache and slightly unsettled stomach.</p><p>Time - 13:00</p><p>T+0mins</p><p>Weve just measured out 25gms each of Peruvian Torch powder. It looks like a lot of powder to eat Were going to try taking spoonfuls then chasing with water/blackcurrant squash.</p><p>T+30mins</p><p>After a failed attempt at consuming teaspoons full of the powder, the biggest problem with which was avoidance of inhalation of the fine dust, subject 2 hit upon the idea of form the powder into a paste, then consuming small amounts of the paste followed by water. This method was successful. So far. We now await a sign.</p><p>T+1hr 30mins</p><p>Both subjects report feeling slightly altered. Vision slightly altered though nothing definitive. Confident that the initial effects are being felt. Stomach feeling a little uncomfortable though nothing unbearable. More waves of suggestion whilst writing this.</p><p>T+2hr 10mins</p><p>Both in good spirits though no significant progress. I feel some MDMA like effects  constant grin (especially when watching Bill Hicks), nervous excitement, the yawns.</p><p>T+2hr 55mins</p><p>No change  Slight MDMA like effects thought nothing spectacular. Going for a walk to the shops.</p><p>T+3hrs 30min</p><p>Pleasant walk on a beautifully bright winters day. Slightly heightened awareness of colours and happily content with life.</p><p>T+5hrs</p><p>Both feeling minor buzz but not tripping per se. Having a joint to see what happens. All cool though and still enjoying the day.</p><p>T+15hrs 20mins</p><p>Going to bed now after a fair few joints, and a few beers. Still quite up but dont want to have to write off tomorrow totally. All in all a very pleasant day, akin to taking  an MDMA pill which lasts for 15 hours (pretty cool!). Will try upping the dose to 40  50 gms next time.</p>",
