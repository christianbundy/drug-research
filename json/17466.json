  "After extensive research about rivea, and extensive experience with LSD, mushrooms, chlorinated inhalents, and other various hallucinagens, aquired 100 seeds of this obscure morning glory cousin.  I took 75 to feel out the dosage, and got a mellow body high for about 4 hours. The seeds are tiny compared to heavenly blue, but about the same # per dose."
