  "Substance: Allylescaline",

  "Weight: 256lbs",
  "Post trip notes: I weighed out 15mg and placed into an empty gel cap. I brought this gel cap with me to work, and decided that right before I would leave work, I would consume it. I left my office at 4:02pm. Commute home was 30 minutes. I did take one long walk in my neighborhood between 5:45ish - 6:45ish. My girlfriend ordered a pizza and I had a single slice around 7:00.",
  "Trip Report: ",
  "Mood: slightly tired from lack of sleep; however, also feeling jovial that it is the weekend",
  "3:16pm- ingested. The taste is unique, not bitter, just horribly chemical tasting almost like one of the new synthetic amphetamines",
  "3:22pm- slight anxiety/feeling anxious over how this substance will treat me. I do feel slightly 'off' right now but that has to be placebo IMO",
  "3:30pm- slight elevation in awareness and I feel giddy. My stomach feels tight. I def already notice the same absorption/processing traits as mescaline-churning stomach and what not.",
  "3:36pm- I can feel the familiar onset of euphoria. Stomach still somewhat tight. ",
  "3:43pm- first wave of nausea hit. I also felt the first moment of intoxication. I def have the impulse to continually smile",
  "4:01pm- Communication requires extra effort. I feel high. The come up is quite gentle. ",
  "4:31pm- inebriation setting in. Buzzed. Slightly horny feeling akin to mda/mdma. Head high too.",
  "4:41pm- Nausea coming on and off. I am def feeling the onset of a trip. Very mellow yet steep feeling. Stomach is churning. Slight body load too.",
  "5:08pm- nausea subsided after eating some chips. Slight visuals setting in. I can still function and communicate",
  "5:22pm- feeling it hit a little more. Def coming on in waves. ",
  "5:43pm- high feeling is sustained at the moment. I feel buzzed. Slight visual distortions. Nothing major.",
  "6:44pm- I have settled into the trip. Super mild. Slight visual distortions. Body feels warm. Def feel very good. ",
  "7:04pm- having minor heat flashes. Mild visuals, more distortions than hallucinations. I am seeing some colors. Nausea is gone. Oddly enough, I can consume food on this substance. ",
  "7:55pm- feeling intoxicated. Mildly trippy. No visuals at the moment",
  "8:24pm- I would say it has hit plateau and is slowly winding down. Perhaps still at the peak. I would characterize my state as high, but quite manageable. Overall, I would say this substance is very internal. I would have enjoyed more visuals. My vision is skewed, very mild tracers have been prevalent throughout the night. ",
  "Overall, I will affirm the notion that the suggested PIHKAL dosage is on the low end. I def think more can be taken, and somewhat expect an increased effect with higher dosage. I am also of the mindset that this substance would prove very beneficial in combination with a number of tryptamines. I can also now echo that this substance at this dose is indeed a training wheel psychedelic.",
  "9:10pm- I feel kinda tired. Brain still running. Kinda hoping melatonin will knock me out in 1-2 hours.",
  "9:22pm- Valerian Root consumed in order to expedite the come down. Side note: I have consumed 4 beers between 5pm-9pm.",
  "10:06pm- administered melatonin as well as Tylenol pm. ",
  "Just had sex as well, very tactile. Huge orgasm. Made me feel incredibly connected. Minor closed eyed visuals followed orgasm. ",
  "6:51am- up. Slept pretty well. Natural landing allowed me to pass out earlier than what I expected.",
  "Overall: substance has potential for recreational use. I'd label it as more of a tool for reflection/observation. Def one of the more interesting RC's I have ever used."
