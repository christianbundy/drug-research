  "<p>I have been a heavy opiod user since sept of 1998 when I crashed my snowsled. I was prescribed all sorts of pain killers from hydrocodone to oxycontin and etc.  I didn't abuse them at first, but after 6 months or so they didn't work as good. So I started snorting, shooting to get the pain relief I use to get plus a high that was so enjoyable.",
  "In about the middle of 2002 my doctor cut me off on my oxy's, I was on 3-4 80 mg pills a day.  So I was out on the street buying herion, morphine and just about any other pain pill.  It took me another 4 years, 5 different times to jail, $4000.00 in fines and losing all my friends, having my family mad at me.  I hit rock bottom...I felt like a wast on earth.",
  "Then one day I woke up and called a methadone treatment hospital, they recommended methadone, but I abuse that off the street and liked the high, so I asked for suboxone.  I have been on treatment for 2 months and have never felt better in my life.  I have my life back!  I enjoy doing things, I have money and respect from my family..I feel if it wasn't for the little orange magical pill suboxone, I would be found dead in my apartment with a blank stare and a needle in my arm or not...Thank god for soboxone.</p>"
