  "Previous substances used: LSD, MDMA, cannabis, alcohol, shrooms, DXM, Adderall, meth, and most every pharmaceutical in existence.",
  "Background: I am an evolutionary bio major, at a very religious university, and maintain a 3.8 GPA. I currently have very limited access to any substances. As a side note, I bodybuild. I think that my fitness level has a huge impact on my substance experiences, because I have not had a really bad experience since I started training, except one inordinately huge dose of DXM. I do not count that though.",
  "During my last semester break, I decided to try the meg. Due to the religious environment of my university town, there is a very limited inflow of substances. I wrongly assumed that this would be an interesting legal alternative to other substances. I say wrongly assumed not because it did not work, but rather that it worked so well that one should not view it as an alternative. It is a drug in its own right, and should be taken with the respect it deserves.",
  "I began the evening by going shopping for some beer with my wife. We made our purchase, and proceeded on home. We were both incredibly bored this evening (hence the beer purchase). While drinking I remembered reading that nutmeg could be used to achieve a buzz. I did not entirely believe this, and decided to do some research online. While reading through reports, I decided that I may as well give this a shot. I emptied out three tablespoons into some yogurt, and ate away.",
  "T + 0:00. Contrary to what I had read, the nutmeg tasted quite pleasant. This may have been due to its ability to mix well with vanilla yogurt. I strongly recommend this method of ingestion.",
  "T + 1:00. Not sure if the effects of the nutmeg are being felt yet, but I do feel much drunker than I should off of the few beers I have had.",
  "T + 2:00. My drunken feeling has taken a turn. At this point, I am unsure of how to adequately describe the sensation. I suppose it is similar to being high and drunk, but not so heavy. My body feels much lighter than that substance mixture would generally makes me feel.",
  "T + 2:30. I am thinking that I might feel a bit queezy, but soon realize that this is just a placebo effect from reading other reports. Still no change in feeling.",
  "This state continued until sometime close the the four hour mark.",
  "T + 4:00. This is when the real changes started to occur. I noticed that I had an elevated heart rate, and started to become nervous. I got up from the couch, where I had been sitting for the past few hours, and suddenly realized that walking was a bit problematic. I staggered into the the kitchen, where I decided to get a glass of cold water, and realized that my pulse was actually normal. Thank God, I thought (not a normal thought for me, being that I am an atheist). I chugged the glass of water, and realized that I had been completely parched. The water had a soothing effect on me, and made the whole experience change for the better. I recommend always keeping a glass of cold water handy because of the diuretic side effect this drug gives. I decided to check myself out in the bathroom mirror at this point. What a shock. My pupils appeared to be non existent, and my eyes were more bloodshot then I had ever seen. All this seemed extremely comical in my euphoric state.",
  "T + ?. I lost the ability to accurately tell what time it was. I could not even read the clock from the couch, but had no desire to get up and look at it. The couch was incredibly comfortable. I had intensely pleasurable tactile sensations, that seemed to send shivers up my spine every time I acknowledged them. The only thought going through my head at this time was, what a wonderful life I have. I was not thinking of anything specifically, but rather just thinking back on my memories of backpacking in Europe, and traveling with my family through the states, and Mexico as a child.",
  "I am unsure what happened in between, but the I somehow got up and walked to bed with my sober wife. The only thing I remember before I went to sleep were some interesting hallucinations. I was laying down (my wife was asleep at this point), and was looking at a pile of dirty clothes on the floor. The pile of clothes suddenly started morph into a more jagged structure. It was then that the white clothes overpowered most of the other colors, and I realized I was looking at a snow covered mountain scape. It looked really interesting, and extremely realistic. The closest hallucinations I have had to this before, were some psilocybin induced hallucinations I had in Europe. They looked really cartoonish by comparison though. At some point, I fell to sleep.",
  "Upon waking the next day, I realized how disoriented I was. I could not believe that the experience was really continuing for this long. Nothing in my past could prepare me for that. I felt really stoned, and looked it. My eyes were bloodshot, and my pupils still seemed to have retreated into the depths of my eyes. This was however not an unpleasant feeling. I felt content. Contentment is really the only word worth using to describe this feeling. I did not have a care in the world. Everything outside seemed new, and fresh. I almost felt like a child exploring his environment. How wonderful and serene the world seemed. This feeling continued for the whole of the day, and did not seem to taper at all. I went to sleep at around 10:30 pm, and did not wake until around 10:00 am the next day. That feeling had, most unfortunately, all but dissipated. I felt completely back to baseline, and had no hangover to speak of. I was even able to lift weights with my friends with no negative sides. My vision was fine, no blurs, and my thoughts felt clearer than normal.",
  "Conclusion: I plan on trying this drug about once or twice a year till I die. This did not feel like an experience that I wish to cheapen by frequent use. This will, of course, have different effects on everybody, but I think everyone should give this a go. If you have the possibility of experiencing this, then why not try it?",
  "Side notes: As an avid weightlifter, I drink a gallon of water a day. This has always contributed to my ability to avoid hangovers from anything. I also force myself to eat six meals a day, no matter what I am on, or how hungry I am. Try to eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and I think you should be able to avoid the weak feelings some have reported form this drug."
