  "<p>I am a physician and also have bipolar disorder. I take the following meds: lexapro, oxycarbazepine, buproprion and buspirone. This mix keeps my mood stable, my anxiety under controll and keeps me from tumbling into deep depression and has worked well.",
  "My psychiatrist gave me some modafanil samples to try because my meds cause sedation- sleepiness while driving, during meetings, ect.",
  "I first took it at a medical conference (100mg), I also had a cup of coffee. I was awake and alert the entire day.  I also was able to process and analyze information more quickly and effectively. I felt as if I had just gained 10-20 IQ points.",
  "The only problem is that I also started to feel a bit hypomanic- somewhat euphoric, talkative, ect. While that is quite pleasant for me, it can be difficult to deal with while working with patients. I tried it again without any coffee and the effect was simular but without the hypomania.",
  "I now take it  for meetings, long trips in the car and if I wake up really groggy. It's a great drug but it has been reported to have some signs of addictive potiential but no cases of this reported yet also.</p>"
