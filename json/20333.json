  "Last night I had an unfortunate experience with promethazine. I have a habit of taking 4 tramadols every day. Yes, I'm addicted to it but that is an issue I'm dealing with. 4 tramadols is part of my tapering down strategy. Anyway, last night I grabbed the wrong pill bottle out of the cabinet and took 4 25mg Phenergan. They are pretty much the same size and shape of the tramadols. I didn't realize I'd taken the wrong stuff and I went about my day. About an hour after taking them I started feeling exceedingly tired. I could not sit up. I then started seeing shiny things in my peripheral vision. I thought 'oh great, today is the day that ultram gives me a seizure'. But I didn't have a seizure. I had what felt like a stroke or something. I was hallucinating. I couldn't speak without losing my train of thought in mid sentence.",
  "Every time I tried to walk, I'd just start leaning over. My husband wanted to take me to the ER but I convinced him to just let me lay down. I slept for 15 hours. I tried to figure out what happened and noticed that the promethazine bottle was in a different place than it was the day before. To any person out there who is considering taking this drug recreationally, let it be known that you are making a mistake. There was nothing pleasant to say about how it felt while this stuff worked its way out of my body. My limbs are still shaky."
