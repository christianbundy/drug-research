 "report": "<p>A few weeks ago I was flying from NY to Detroit. My flight kept getting delayed, so I decided to take my normal prescribed dose at 5:00pm instead of 11:00pm.</p><p>As it turned out, like 30 minutes later they started boarding and it was a only 2 hour flight. Though I do not remember it, I must have went unconscious on the airline.</p><p>I had airline blankets and 'Skymall' magazines when I woke up at my friends house the next day.</p><p>I had so little memory of that night, I needed to be reminded of just about everything. It was kind of scary, not knowing what happened. I was with a trustworthy friend, but if I was not, I would have a full night blank.</p>",
