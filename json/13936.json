 "report": [
  "While walking in a forest of Northern New Mexico a friend and I came across a fresh Amanita muscaria. We decided to eat some of it. Acting as my inner guide, i began to scrape off the white spots from the mushroom. He then intuited that we shouldn't eat the red part, nor the outer white spots for the matter. I agreed. I then cut a sliver from the mushroom and then took a bite- only the inner white part, including the infant gills forming. The effects of happiness and expansion were instant. An amplification of my emotional body also occurred. That is, my emotions were more intense, yet very subtly so. The effects lasted for 30-45 minutes and that was it. I had no gastrointestinal upset. My friend noticed a mild stomach upset at the nighttime, almost 6 hours later.",
  "I've repeated the dosage quality and quantity twice, and have had the same effects."
