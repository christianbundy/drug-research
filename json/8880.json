  "<p>1kg poppy seeds, 60mls lemon juice, lingerie bag (either squeeze lemons or get the concentrate. It is cheaper to use concentrate about nz$1-$2 for 250mls.",
  "Put seeds in lingerie bag and put in a bowl. ",
  "Put lemon juice in a cup with water and pour liquid over seeds just enough to wet them.  Make sure all seeds are wet.  Leave for an hour and a half.  It is important to leave them so the lemon juice can do its work and extract the opium.",
  "Boil about 1200mls water and let stand for 10minutes.  Pour water over. open lingerie bag enough to fit a big spoon in and stir like mad for about 5 minutes. Pick up lingerie bag and squeeze all liquid into the bowl.  The lingerie bag is brilliant as all the seeds stay in there and not in your drink.  the liquid should be a brown milky liquid.  Now if your into self torture drink now but if you want to give your taste buds a break boil down the liquid to about 50mls. This takes about 45 minutes. The liquid is so disgusting block your nose while drinking and have another drink nearby to take straight after. This can dry you out so drink at least a glass of water every hour.  This recipe makes about 10 doses for a first time user.</p>"
