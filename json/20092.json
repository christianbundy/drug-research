  "I have a manic disorder.  I also really like to trip.  Now that I am on Zyprexa this is interestingly difficult most of the time. I recently attempted to enjoy MDMA.  I've done it pre-Zyprexa and liked it a lot. I took the MDMA orally (I'm always on the Zyprexa, 5mg per day).  I got some effect, mostly just heightened physical sensations, and an overall feeling of well-being.  Unfortunately, about 2 hours later I also had the beginnings of a nasty migraine.  To resolve the headache, I smoked about half a gram of primordia (baby psylocibe mushrooms. 10 minutes later the headache was gone. I never did get much more out of the MDMA, but hey - a feeling of well-being isn't a bad thing."
