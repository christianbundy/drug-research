  "If you have not heard about Stadol it is a nose spray prescribed primarily for migraine headaches.  I have taken many painkillers over the years but yet have I found one to help with my headaches like Stadol.  I am also taken 50mg of Elavil and 1000mg of Depakote daily to help with my migraines.  This combo seems to be working quite well.  Anyway, back to Stadol.  As I said it is a nose spray which means it will go to work very fast(usually within minutes).  The first thing I feel is a very calm feeling all over but mostly in my head.  I have actually sat for a hour without saying a word to anyone in the room.  If I do like three or four 'squirts' up my nose I will get a drip in the back of my throat sort of like a cocaine drip.  It will actually numb my throat for a little while.",
  "But there is one down-side to Stadol.  I have found that it can make me extremely irritable and frustated at the most stupid things around me.  I dont know why this happens but just about anything can set me off.  Also, as you might guess, Stadol is very addictive and very hard not to do when I have nothing else better to do that day.  Anyway, thats my two cents worth.  I'm just waiting till Monday so I can get my script filled.  Hope this has educated someone out there.  Later.."
