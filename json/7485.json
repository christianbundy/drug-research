 "report": [
  "I obtained 28g of Syrian Rue seeds and 28g of Mimosa Hostilis root-bark through ebay. I wanted to make enough for 3 people, and I decided on a dose of 3g of syrian rue and 8g of mimosa. Since I didnt have a scale, I used the highly scientific method of halving to get 3g of syrian rue. I dumped out the package, halved to 14, halved to 7, halved to 3.5, and then took away a little bit. For the mimosa, I just removed a large piece of bark and hoped it was about 4g.",
  "I was too lazy to boil two things at once, so I put both ingredients in a coffee grinder, grounded the syrian rue to dust, and the bark to stringy fibers and put it in water with 500mg of Vitamin C. I put it on a slow boil for 20 min, let it cool, and strained the whole thing through a shirt. I added more water to the goop left over and boiled for 10 more min. I strained it again. I was left with about 25 oz of ugly brown liquid. I boiled it on high for about 30 min until I was left with about 11 oz of the liquid. I poured it into 6 shot glasses. 2 per person.",
  "We waited until it cooled and then dosed at 4:15. It tastes like shit so we chased with OJ. I had only eaten some yogurt that day, and we all had maintained a diet appropriate for maois for the past 24 hrs.",
  "Jon downed both within a minute. Josh and I had one shot glass each and waited.",
  "T+00:17 - 4:32 - Jon pukes 7 times. Josh and I dont finish the rest of ours because we are pussies. We had about half of our decided dose, so about 1.5g of Syrian Rue and 4g of mimosa hostilis.",
  "I am extremely nauseous from t+30 to t+2:00. I try to puke, but cant. After two hours, dizziness is gone. I feel fine, my stomach is a little upset, but it might be from not eating. I have a hamburger. None of us have any effects. We all feel completely normal.",
  "Two lessons from this story: If you puke too soon, you wont get any effects. If you dont have enough, you wont feel any effects."
