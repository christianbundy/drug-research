 "report": "<p>I once had taken three hits on a Saturday, but my boss informed me that I HAD to come into work for an emergency meeting. By this time I was 2 hours into the trip and in no shape to attend such an event. I downed 4 or 5 250 mg kava capsules, and by the time I got there, only a slight body stimulation remained. The visuals were non-existent and I had enough mental clarity to make it through the meeting. It sucked that I had to 'abort the mission' that day, but hell it saved my ass from looking like a fool in front of my boss.</p>",
