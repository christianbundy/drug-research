 "report": [
  "I was given half a 'suboxone' by a recovering addict friend.  Sucked on the nasty 'orange' flavored pill (with a big cross imprinted on it), after a drink or two.  After about an hour, I was filled with a definite but not overpowering sense of stoney happiness and well-being, but in particular there was a positive, almost mdma-like sense of opening up unlike other opiates I've tried.  It lasted for a good four hours, then afterglow for a half day more.  It seems to let me down slowly enough to mitigate any crashing/ withdrawal.  Only thing is, for the next 12 hours, I literally couldn't pee.  It was very upsetting."
