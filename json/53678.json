 "report": "<p>Okay so i'm really bored and on a nasty drug testing regime and I've really been needing SOME kind of mental distortion (reality is BORING for me!).</p><p>I recently got prescribed Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10mg a day. I am really bored so I just took four of them to see what happens.</p><p>T+0:00 I just popped four of them, it's 9:11pm, we'll see what happens, im currently just listening to some music and surfing the web.</p><p>T+0:45 nothing happening yet...</p><p>T+1:00 Been really giggly, I cant stop smiling and laughing at pointless stuff, I dunno if im just in a good mood or if somethin is happening.</p><p>T+1:10 yeah it isn't the lexapro, cuz now I feel normal again.</p><p>T+1:20 I feel a lump in my chest, it doesnt feel bad or weird, I kinda like it actually, kinda feels like I swallowed something big whole or something.</p><p>T+2:00 I went and smoked a cigarette and kept laughing for no reason, it was pretty enjoyable, now im just gettin into some music</p><p>T+3:00 I'm pretty delirious I dunno if im tired or if it's workin, I'm laughin at things I normally wouldnt.</p><p>The next day: I woke up feeling extremely tired and groggy, but once I got moving I felt really relaxed and in a very good mood</p>"
