  "<p>A little background on my experience with drugs, I used pot a lot when younger and I still go to Canada once in a while for 222s , when I had teeth pulled or got a  few hydrocodones, I enjoyed that.  Now, I got some Ultrams for my foot problem and . Ultram is between codeine and hydrocone, but trams do last longer than both, but Ultram takes longer to peak effect than either.     ",
