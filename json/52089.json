 "report": "<p>I had read about Madagascar Periwinkle and found a few shaky references to it being used as a psychedelic drug. There is a large plant growing in my back yard so I decided to try it. One night, I got home around 4 AM and decided to light it up and see what happens. One hit, nothing. Two hits, third hit. Why is my couch rippling? I decided to stop right there and not push it. I definitely felt altered. Objects were rippling just a little.</p><p>The next day I tried it again with three leaves. Nothing. I tried it again with six leaves a couple weeks later and nothing. So obviously placebo has a big effect.</p>",
