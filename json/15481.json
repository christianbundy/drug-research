  "Background: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.",

  "In short, my 'sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.",
