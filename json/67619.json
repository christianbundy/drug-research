 "report": "<p>[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.</p><p>The author of this report incorrectly refers to the inhalant used as nitrous oxide. It is not nitrous oxide. See What is in computer duster?]</p><p>I was inhaling nitrous (sic) from a dust remover can while my friend played Guitar Hero. He was really engrossed in the game, and I kept holding the nitrous (sic) in longer and longer. Finally I dissociated so bad that I went blind, forgot how to breathe, and passed out.</p><p>When I came to I had a mild concussion and a bump on the back of my head the size of a grapefruit. I had to go to the hospital, couldn't sleep for days... Please learn from this story and be careful when you do shit like this, alright? Especially don't stand up on a concrete floor.</p>",
