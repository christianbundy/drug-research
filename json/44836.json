 "report": "<p>For more standard highs I think it makes the body buzz more powerful, and sense perception is enhanced ie. hallways with a breeze can feel and or sound like wind tunnels.</p><p>Dosages:</p><p>Substance: Weed (or high-like substances)</p><p>Use:  To enhance highs in general</p><p>Dosage:  100mg - 200mg in the morning or at night (to take it in the morning would basically just make me feel nice and ready to start the day but others think it works better to take it at night so the body moderates the level out to a good level before one would interact with any substance).</p><p>Use:  Post high enhancer</p><p>Dosage:  100 mg - 300 mg, the time is around an hour before smoking (I have tried 300 mg once by itself and then smoking and I had good closed eyes and in general everything seemed to have a lighter shade to it, even the dark night, but this is pretty much the maximum that would fall under regular usage and at that it is used as the highest dose to help sleep.)</p><p>Substance:  Ectasy</p><p>Use:  Preloader = roll enhancer</p><p>Dosage:  I do 100 - 200 mg T-2 hours. (the closer I take the 5-htp to the ectasy the more likely its gonna be a bad negative effect [too much of a good thing end up being a very bad thing])</p><p>Use:  Post-experience = 'down' fixer</p><p>Dosage: 100 mg and maybe 200 mg depending on the situation.</p>",
