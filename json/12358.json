  "I abused diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate on a regular basis w/ and without DXM for about 1-1/2 to 2 years.  Ever since then I hear voices every day, the same way I hear them when I am on a dramamine trip.  I recommend to never abuse either of these substances because hearing voices every day sucks."
