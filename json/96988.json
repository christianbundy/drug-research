 "report": "<p>When I first started, I just wanted EVERYONE to have a taste of it, it was so beautiful.</p><p>I've given up pilling now, because last week I had to have an abortion - had I not been eeeeing off my face the whole time, I firstly would never have slept with the guy I slept with, let alone do it without contraception!</p><p>Now the thought of E makes me nauseous and sad - when I first took it, it was the best, best best thing I'd ever experienced.</p><p>I remember begging friends to take e with me, and telling them it's different to normal drugs. I don't think it is anymore.</p><p>It's just such a pity that people can't feel like they do on E, naturally.</p>",
