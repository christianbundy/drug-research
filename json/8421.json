The music to me was the best I had ever heard.

  "Mind at time of come down: head drifting in and out of soberness, not able to show my freaking-outness properly, like my insides was scared and swaying from 'Im ok' to 'Im sick' yet my body looked totally fine and I was acting normal. It may sound very scary but at the same time I was very happy which helped calm me down*. I just wanted to escape the concert but I was very astute and even bossy to my friend as to the fact that I wanted to leave.",
  "Thought example at come down: 'stupid drugs playing with my head, luckily my friends are here, I want to vomit ick!, but come on its just the crowd and lack of food, when you get home you can have a good sleep'",
