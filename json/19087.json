 "report": [
  "<p>I had not particularly wanted to do 2C-E, but being an experienced recreational drug user (Ive tried Mescaline, Shrooms, Acid, etc.)  I decided to try it out as the opportunity presented itself. I read several trip reports, as I do with most new drugs, to get a feel for the effects it would have. I had candy flipped before so I felt that I was ready for 2C-E, since most people describe it as that kind of trip. My friend S and I decided to do it together on the second day of a music festival we were at. Heres my recollection of that day, 5 days after the trip took place.",
  "T  1:00 S and I wake up in our tent, eager and a little nervous for our trip to begin. We had decided not to eat because of the nausea and stomach pangs others report using 2C-E. I started to drink as much water as I could, making sure I stayed hydrated for the trip.",
  "T  0:00 We cracked open our baggies that contained the substance in its white powder form. I was hesitant to take the whole bag as our friend F instructed, we didnt have a mg scale and I only wanted a threshold dose for my first encounter with the drug. We each took dips into our bags with our pinkies, and licked up the drug. I would estimate I took about 6 mg, S said she took less, probably 5mg. Our friends at the festival were looking at us with awe, we were the designated drug gurus to our psychedelically dabbling friends, and this was us living up to our title. It would be fun to sit around with them and watch their antics on our heavy trip.",
  "T + :30 We werent feeling it yet, so we decided to go for a walk and look at the tapestries and art installations for sale at the festival. The heat was affecting us on our walk in the hot sun, and we felt that was activating the drug faster, subsequently temperature seemed to become variable for us. We couldnt really feel too hot or cold even though it was in the mid 90s all day.",
  "T + 1:00 In line for a bag of ice, it started to dawn on me. I began to feel like I was rolling as hard as I ever had, yet the come-up was virtually unnoticeable. Talking to S I began to see that she was feeling the beginning of it too, and an awkward conversation with the ice dispenser solidified the realization that we were tripping. On the walk back to the tent area our group had set up colors all around me became intensified, and I was feeling the acid like element of the drug as well. At this point I was extremely happy with the world around me and the fact that I hadnt eaten, because I sometimes get terrible stomach cramps on acid if I have food in my stomach.",
  "T + 2:00 sitting in a circle with our group of friends we were at the first peak of the 2C-E. The conversation was flowing smoothly and S and I were giggly and funny. Each time I would focus on one person my peripherals began to expand and contract as if all objects I could see were breathing. Looking at patterns on shirts or tapestries was entertaining because they it was as if lines were all moving around in waves. S decided to eat some food, I abstained because I wasnt feeling hungry at all despite the fact that I hadnt eaten. She ate some pasta and threw it all up about 15 minutes later. 2C-E is not a drug that you can eat on apparently. We were enjoying the conversation with our friends and answering their questions about how many drugs they should take and how often etc. This kind of knowledge is very useful at a festival with beginners haha.",
  "T + 2:15 I was still peaking hard when we decided to smoke some weed, I was feeling a little antsy from the rolling effects of the drug and thought weed might chill things out. S and I finished about .3 grams in a bowl and once we put down the pipe things got a lot more intense. The pot added a whole new dimension to the drug, the hallucinations were deeper and more complex, as well as the rolling effect intensifying. I was feeling more centered than I ever have on a drug, I was in an ultimate zen state. Aside from minor conflicts with some people in our group I felt better than I ever had on a drug this intense in the past.",
  "T + 2:30 I get lost in a conversation with my friends and then see S intently looking at her hand. She saw a kaleidoscope type of visual come out of nothing on her hand. I was seeing strange colors in the sky and thought a cloud was when it wasnt, it was weird to be tripping this hard but still feel so extremely calm. I decided I wanted more so I dipped another bit of the 2C-E, I would estimate I took another 7mg. S said she was at a great level and didnt want more. Spacing it out was a good call for my first time because I like to be cautious but still feel the drugs presence heavily when first trying a new drug.",
  "T + 3:30 The second wave hit me and I felt an even stronger sense of relaxed tripping coming over me. It was very pleasing but the visuals were beginning to fade, I built up a tolerance quickly. I just felt the rolling effect to a larger extent for a while, which was nice but didnt feel as special as the first wave. Next time I will try a larger dose at once and relax away from a social environment where I can feel more in touch with the effects of the 2C-E.",
  "T + 5:30 S and I left to go see an artist, the effects were mildly still present. The light display at their show looked normal and for the most part I was feeling like I was rolling a tiny bit and tripping with no visuals.",
  "T + 6:30 We sat down by a river and S said she felt totally sober. I was still a little woozy from the days events but coming back down for sure. It didnt last as long as I thought it would, but I didnt do a heavy enough dose for that. Still, I felt like tripping was getting boring and was ready for it to end. We decided to go back to the campsite.",
  "T + 7:00 The effect completely subsided and we smoked some weed. We felt sober enough to eat, and made some mac and cheese. We had no problems keeping it down this time. There was barely any come down that I could recall, I just felt tired from the long day of tripping face. We slept fine that night and woke up relaxed the next morning.",
  "Overall I enjoyed the trip and am glad I experienced this drug. Candy flipping in one dose feels incredible and I have never felt more centered on any drug. If I can get my hands on this at home I will buy as much as I can and experiment with larger doses. It is my favorite psychedelic drug to date, it's up there with DMT for sure. But I have many more experiences ahead of me to report.</p>"
