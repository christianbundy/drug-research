  "I started taking paxil because of mostly gen. anxiety and depression. The psychiatrist started me off on 10mg/day then up to 30mg. I felt pretty sick the first 3 days. I was sick to my stomach and felt like my head was floating above my body.",
  "The 4th day I FELT GREAT!!! I had never rolled on extacy that come later but if I could campare my year of being on paxil to anything it would be like rolling everyday for a year! I loved it. I had soooo many new friends, I moved out of my parents house and went totaly nuts. I had the tingly warm body high. About four months into taking paxil I tried extacy and it was awesome! When the X wore off I still felt great and I campared it to rollin 24/7.",
  "My parents and my doctor decided that I liked it a little to much since I had upped my dose to 60mg without telling anyone....yah I was feelin good. But anyways I was forced to quit taking it and went through all the horrible withdrawl symptomes and yes the zaps are real but I kinda liked them. It felt like electricity was going through my body and I still halucinate to this day from what I'm sure is Paxils afterefects. For the next year or so after I quit paxil I craved it and couldn't stop thinking about it. I currently take Zoloft but I love Paxil although I know it is a bad idea for me to take it."
