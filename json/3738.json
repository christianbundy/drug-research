 "report": "<p>After reading several pieces on this and related sites, I must write in defense of 'opium tea', or poppy-head tea.  Most of the gripes are with the strength, taste, and variable nature of the high.  I have been drinking 2-3 g of opium 2-3x / wk. for 5 yrs. and have had learned a few of my own tricks...</p><p>First , to help out that earthy taste, add peppermint, cinammon, and/or anise while the tea is brewing. Much better and the peppermint will help first timers with any nausea. Secondly, use enough material. 5-6 'giants' are good for a 150 lb. adult, but you need at least 20 smaller heads (10-12 grams powdered) to get off (2-3 g opium). Take on an empty stomach with 500mg tyrosine.</p><p>I feel much stronger , longer lasting effects than with smoking.  The price and availability of good heads here in NYC make it easier to buy fresh and dried flowers than to grow your own. I have shared this tea with special revered guests who always feel the highest high when we share this drink coupled with sacramental marijuana.</p>",
