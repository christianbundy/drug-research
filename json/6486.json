  "I have been taking 200mg of 5-htp for the past week (100mg in morning and evening)and I have noticed a more balance view of life.  Concerning addicitions (if they so can be called) to sugar, caffeine, sleep, etc. I have noticed a large decrease in the desire to obtain these things. Concentration has not really improved but since there is less of a drive for stimulation, I can now focus on more serious things.  I also find that I have quicker reflexes (mentally and physically) and that I just overall feel better. Lastly, the sleep is AMAZING, every morning I feel like a million pounds, and progressively become as light as a feather.",
  "good stuff!",
  "Also taken with niacin to assist with metabolic functions and to allow the 5-htp to be digested more effectively,"
