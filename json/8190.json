  "Prepared some Damiana tea with some Orange Pekoe to mask the taste, was a good tasting brew.. mild after but overall a pleasant experience, I feel something light, almost light-headed.. more stimulated yet pleasantly relaxed.Change in body temperature also seems to be present, and it's not just from the warm tea, much more pronounced.",
  "I've tried smoking this stuff, which is also pleasant but didn't feel much.",
  "Tea is how I'll be preparing this henceforth and forever (maybe)."
