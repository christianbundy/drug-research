  "<p>There has been a lot of speculation about the chemical and its use in Spice. Intrigued, I received a small sample and decided to try it for myself, in its pure (or impure) form. Here are the results:",
  "2 milligrams was weighed with a .001g scale and placed on a small strip of aluminum foil. Looking at it, it is only the size of about 3 grains of salt. Cutting it is fairly difficult. It has the consistency of plastic, and a VERY pungent and unpleasant odor.",
  "Experience Number 1:",
  "------------------------------------------------------------------",
  "(11:15): JWH-018 vaped off of aluminum foil. The taste is bearable, but only just. It tastes very similar to smoking plastic.",
  "(11:16): The effects are felt almost immediately. I first noticed a slight visual change that grew slowly until it was very pronounced. Everything seemed close up and the room oscillated back and forth. It felt almost like being on a boat.",
  "(11:18): I burst out into uncontrollable laughter while my friend prepares his dose. This lasted for about 45 minutes (this isn't an exaggeration!) My throat was bone dry afterward, and it continued to hurt the next day.",
  "(~12:00):  Waves of fiery euphoria sweep over my body. It starts as a burning sensation in the back of my head and travels to my chest and lingers down my spine. Making a sharp pulse towards my feet, it comes back home to rest on the upper parts of my back. This continues for several minutes, with brief bursts of laughter and headache.",
  "(12:45): I now begin to think I am losing my mind. I grab several bottles of water and begin to chug, trying to wash the substance out of my system. I spend about thirty minutes on the toilet trying to go to the bathroom. Eventually I get nauseous and proceed to projectile vomit into the floor. My friend leaves and I go to bed. I wake up groggy the next morning, but have the best sleep of my life.",

  "Experience Number 2",
  "------------------------------------------------------------------",
  "Despite the negative effects of my first dose, I liked the positive effects so much I decide to give it another go the next day.",
  "(6:00): Roughly 1 milligram JWH-018 is vaped off of aluminum foil.",
  "(6:15): I'm not feeling anything, so I eyeball around 250-500 micrograms more and vaporize it.",
  "(6:20): The effects begin to show. Most anything makes me laugh, vision is stretched, tingling burning sensation makes its rounds over my body. You could probably chop my hand off and I wouldn't notice it.",
  "(6:45): I stare at the floor enjoying the typhoon of euphoria that explodes on my shores, and begin to notice that the sun is going down. The light that came through my window was a vibrant neon blue. I sat 20 minutes watching it flow into my living room and engulf everything it touched. The technocolor pigment shined off of the furniture making a crystal-like surrounding. It was borderline psychedelic.",
  "(7:10): I decided to lay down and enjoy some music. I put on a number of things, ranging from the Tiger Lilies, Hank Williams Sr., and Bob Dylan. One the things I liked was the music appreciation. Everything seemed more vibrant and deep. Especially with some of Dylan's work, I noticed I could 'isolate' a certain instrument or sound in my mind and follow it through out the song. The complexity of my experience was a complete Sound-gasm (TM). My friend also decides to order some food. Chinese.",
  "(7:45): The food gets here and I dive in. There's nothing I won't eat. General Tsao Chicken, Crab Rangoon, Egg Drop Soup, Fortune Cookies; you name it. The munchies are definitely a part of the experience for me with this substance.",
  "(8:15): I'm very tired, and fall into a foggy sleep. It is very restful.",
  "(10:40): I wake up groggy and get on the computer. The grogginess dissipates after 10 or 15 minutes, leaving me mildly but pleasantly relaxed.",
  "------------------------------------------------------------------",
  "Conclusion: In moderation this is a very good substitute for cannabis. Since my first experience I have bought a gram which should last a good while. The price is also very economical ($100/500 doses per gram = $0.20 per dose). Everything is there: Munchies, music appreciation, red eye. The effects were speedier for me though and the time dilation significant. 5 minutes in feels like an eternity. For me it also has dissociative and psychedelic undertones. It should be noted that because I have a cheap scale, my doses may range a bit. My first dose of 2 milligrams may very well have been 3 milligrams, however it did say 2 milligrams on the scale. Because it could have varied either way ( to 1 milligram or 3), I decided to average it out and leave it at 2 milligrams.",
  "PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THIS SUBSTANCE!!!! IT IS EXTREMELY POTENT AND AN OVERDOSE IS NOT PLEASANT. I would start with 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligram and re dose as needed.</p>"
