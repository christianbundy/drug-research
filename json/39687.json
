 "report": "</p>I trusted the Spectrum Labs to be honest and forthright in their advertising.  I spent my hard earned money on the additive product so that I could hopefully keep my job.  I was responsible in keeping up with the formulation ratings and subscribed to their website for current updates.  I followed the directions on the product and adhered to their recommendations.  I lost my job last week.</p>",
