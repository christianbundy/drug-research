 "report": [
  "I read quite a few reports about poppie seed tea so I figure I would give it a shot.",
  "First of all I am an experienced opiate user including hydrocodone, codeine, oxycontin, percocet. My usual dosage of hydrocodone is 30mg",
  "I started out buying 350g of poppie seeds from a local market. I poured the seeds into a class container and poured approximately 2.5 cups of hot water accompanied with about 1 lemons worth of juice. I let it steep for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionly, then straining through a t-shirt.",
  "T+:00 ingested the 2.5 cups of tea which was suprisingly not bad at all. Even without adding any sugar or honey.",
  "T+:25 effects start to come on like a mild opiate buzz, warm feeling, slight euphoria.",
  "T:45 I started to develop a slight stomach ache, the buzz is for me about equal to takign 15mg of hydrocodone.",
  "T:90 stomach ache has subsided, left with a calm feeling and relaxed, great time to watch a movie.",
  "The effects lasted approximately 2 hours, but could tell there was a trace for almost 8 plus hours after ingestion. I did not detect any sort of constipation. the only downfall was the stomach ache that last for about 45 minutes.",
  "I just ingested 550g of seed tea to attempt to get a more powerful trip. subsequent report will be up soon."
