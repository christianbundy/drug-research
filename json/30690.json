  "<p>DO NOT sniff cyclobenzaprine.  It hurts more than you can imagine.  It sucks ass!!!!  But, it did make the onset quicker-basically as hit my mucous membrane, I was high.  It was no more intense than taking 10mg orally.  I also swallowed 5 mgs at the same time.  Good body buzz, muscles relaxed, and uphoric happiness.  Great pharmy-the best muscle relaxant and comparible to perc and vics.</p>"
