  "Saturday, 8:00PM",
  "T+00:00 80mg of BK-MDEA (ethylone) down the hatch, gel cap, light meal two hours before.  only water since.",
  "T+00:08 get the methylone belch, similar taste",
  "T+00:27 the belch again, first alert, feeling 'light'",
  "T+00:38 rushing, antsy, walk from room to room. stare into the mirror, put on some tunes",
  "T+01:00 yawning, light headed, more yawning and a sense of neck tension",
  "T+01:15 very mild, methylone-ish, but less stimulating and less euphoria",
  "T+01:25 ho hum, its not getting much better, if anything slight waves coming over me, but this is a tease",
  "T+01:35 parachute 100mg more in a rolling paper",
  "T+01:40 wow, a 180mg dose, I quickly decide that no matter what the outcome I've had enough for a first trial",
  "T+01:43 hmm, did I really need that booster? is that first hit just now fully coming on?",
  "T+02:10 wow, ok, hello bk-mdea  wow wow woo",
  "T+02:15 chatting on irc, what a blast, but I wander around outside quite a bit",
  "T+02:50 fairly high, very similar to MDMA but much less stimulating, not as euphoric as methylone, but fun. must go walk around outside.  music is great!  physical sensations are enhanced.",
  "T+03:00 I'm guesstimating that a 200mg dose would be more then enough for me!",
  "T+03:08 pretty sure I'm feeling full effects, very nice, empathy, minimal stimulation per say, neack and head muscle tension however",
  "T+03:13 desire some cannabis, so I go smoke",
  "T+03:18 ok, I could see dancing on this stuff, I've got happy feet, but I feel clumsy",
  "T+03:24 I'm pretty high, very ecstasy like",
  "I go roam around a little, watch the night sky, try to count bats (we have these cool mexican freetail bat population that migrates through here this time of year..), carpe nichtem, etc.",
  "T+04:25 been on irc and chat quite a bit night, pretty fun.  it slowly ramped up to a level of intoxication similar to the same amount of methylone, but not nearly as emotionally healing as methylone or as stimulating as MDMA.  fun nonetheless.",
  "T+05:00 spend an hour or two in conversation with the wife, but didnt try sex. :(",
  "Approx 6 or 7 hours have passed; I have a few beers to sleep.",
  "Similar to methylone, but less euphoria, similar to MDMA in musical and tactile enhancement, but dancing felt awkward. 'Stoning' but not quite as lethargy inducing as MBDB. ",
  "Unlike the way methylone opens a person up in a very theraputic way, bk-mdea  ramps up slower and delivers an enhanced and chatty mood lift,  not as forced and unaturally lovey as MDMA and lasts last at least 6 hours. There was musical, tactile and emotional segment to this experience which was nice, but it scattered my thoughts...making a true level of healing introspection very difficult.  This is not really a good party drug, but might have more value then most.",
  "Next day: hangover, similar to MDMA."
