 "report": [
  "My brother told me to try smoking morphine one night. I had 1.5 110 mg pills that my friend gave me, so what the hell.  I ate the half pill, and I crushed up the full pill (not very finely) and sprinkled half of it in a glass pipe half packed with weed, then I packed the bowl to the top and sprinkled the rest on it.  To my surprise it smoked, smelled and tasted JUST LIKE opium!  I smoked with 2 other people, and the one bowl lasted for 15 minutes, no joke.  About 10 minutes later I was so doped up, I couldn't talk right.  The high was like opium, but with more of a sedative type feeling.  The weed high wore off after about an hour, but the morphine, smacked out feeling, lasted until I went to sleep (really the morphine put me to sleep).  I got a great night's sleep and woke up the next morning feeling very apathetic and lazy, but other than that, everything about smoking morphine is great.  Words of advice:  If you are going to do morphine (at least in pill form), make SURE you have a decent amount of food in your stomach when you take it or you will yack your guts up!  I recommend some kind of dairy product."
