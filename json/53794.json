 "report": [
  "<p>I recently started taking geodon. Almost 15 minutes after I popped my fist pill I felt the effects. There was tingling feeling in my arm and legs.  When I sat down my feet wanted to move. It felt great. I couldn't stop smiling and I was laughing at serious things that are not funny. ",
  "I found it very helpful in making me relax. I got the best feeling from it when I lay down.  I can feel the tingling in my back and arms and legs and I am giddy and stupid with laughter.",
  "Every time I take it I have similar effects.  The only problem I have with geodon is when it completely wears off which is usually 4 p.m the next day.  When it wears off I find myself in an uncontrollable rage. All I need to do though is take one geodon and the rage is gone in five minutes.",
  "I am on Geodon with Xanax and Wellbutrin and Zoloft.</p>"
