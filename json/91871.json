  "<p>Previous experience MDMA, shrooms, kratom, weed.",
  "Had a normal size meal 3 hours prior to taking 200 gm MDAI swallowed as a bomb",
  "First effects noticed: 40 min lift in mood and a coming up warm feeling very nice and gentle unlike MDMA.",
  "1hr 30 mins: Very good euphoric feeling similar to MDMA without the super fast rush.  Very pleasant, totally submersed in a warm loved up bubble, some jaw tension and eye movement not as bad/over the top as MDMA. Music sounds good. I had a LED light slow changing colour and was totally submersed in the colours mind drifting but clear.",
  "2hr 30mins: 100 gm taken as a bomb",
  "3hrs: Feeling the second dose and it came on fairly strong but felt very very good not too over the top totally lost in the lights and music with waves washing over. For the next 2to 3 hrs was lost in music and lights sense of touch or of being touch enjoyable. Drifted off to sleep. Woke up the next morning, felt rested no real side effects apart from a lovely warm glow and feeling good. No side effect 2 or 3 days later.",
  "Will be using again in the future preferred over MDMA.</p>"
