  "I took 5ml yesterday my biggest dose yet and I'm 260lbs and it completely and totally knocked me on my butt. The stuff comes on hard and fast. My head was spinning so much I could hardly tell if I was standing up or laying down. I finally made it to the couch and passed out. And then when I woke up 2 or 3 hours later I thought I was going to die and I cried out to God to spare my life for the sake of my Mother and Father. I don't really think I was anywhere near close to death but at the time I was so out of it I though I was. So do be careful. I will never take more than 3ml myself at any one again and keep in mind I'm 260lbs for someone half my size it would have been twice a much, they probably would have just collapsed on the spot and become unconscious for three or four hours. So please be careful please. 3ml gets me so wasted I just sit there at my computer and wobble like a Weeble. It's great fun."
