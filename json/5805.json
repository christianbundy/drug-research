  "One day I was bored, so I decided to check our medicine cabinet to see what drugs we have. I found a bottle of caffeine pills, so I downed 7 pills. I had read up on it, not expecting anything special, just some energy.",
  "Bit of energy.. right. I spent the next 9 hours in my bed shaking and feeling sick. It felt like constant panic attacks. I finally fell asleep and felt tired the next morning.",
  "And yes, I'm skinny, so 700 mg affected me. To think that I almost took 15 pills (about 15 cups of coffee). Caffeine's good and all, just don't take too much."
