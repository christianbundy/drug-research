  "<p>I took 12 Nature's Bounty brand Kava Kava capsules after hearing good things about it.  This amounted to 3600 mg.  I decided against opening all the capsules and making them into a drink because I had heard the taste was horrible.  About 20 minutes later I experienced some stomach discomfort, not really nausea, just an ache, but I had heard this was normal.  About 40 minutes into the experience I began to feel some sedation, which was similar to 5 mg Valium.  I was expecting things to get better from here, but around an hour and 45 minutes after I had taken the Kava, the mild 'buzz' was completely gone.  This was a big disappointment and the mild sedative effect wasn't worth the stomach discomfort.  I'm going to try again with another brand, but I'm not expecting much.</p>"
