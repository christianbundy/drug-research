  "I took 150mg, waited 30 minutes with no effects, took another 150mg, waited 10 minutes and BAM!!! I was very high, it feels like a mix of an Ethanol, Cannabis (Potent Indica), low dose of Peyote, and MDMA high. Amazing. It does little for my Neuropathy (stemming from 7 fractures in foot and ankle), but right now I don't give a damn about any pain. I think in the foreseeable future the tyrant DEA might catch on that this is a little too good for Schedule V, III at least seeing as it's way better than any CIV Benzodiazepines or Barbiturates. Might have to take Hydromorphone if I have a flare up and if that's the case, can see myself being in the Clouds. Way to go Pfizer Pharma!"
