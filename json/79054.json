 "report": "<p>I have been using MDPV the past 2-3 weeks, more or less daily, with a dose range of 10 to 30mgs per day. The peevee was the white one which is said to at least contain peevee, but it definitely contains some impurities.</p><p>I bought the home drug screen tests for amphetamine and MDMA in order to check the rumor that MDPV causes false positives on these tests.</p><p>I drug-tested this morning some two hours after getting out of bed, last MDPV dose was about 16-18 hours ago. The drug test stripes were manufactured by a company called 'gabControl' and i got one 'AMP' test (representing amphetamines [the lady at the drug store thought that 'AMP' is supposed to mean 'ampules' when searching in the online catalogue, hehe]) and one 'MDMA' test (representing MDMA ).</p><p>So i went and tested myself and BOTH tests showed TWO clear, red lines meaning the test is NEGATIVE.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>With the above-mentioned habit of use, testing methods and so on, MDPV does NOT show up in urine. It's giving neither a false-positive for amphetamines nor does it for MDMA.</p><p>Assuredness, finally. Great. =)</p>",
