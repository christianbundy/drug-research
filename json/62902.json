 "report": "<p>Rhodiola rosea is wonderful! </p><p>I have been consuming 350mg. r. rosea in pill form every morning for the past month.  In retrospective summary, I can say the following:</p><p> - r. rosea is mentally stimulating, yet does not contain any of the negative effects associated with other stimulants I have used, such as caffeine or amphetamine.</p><p> - r. rosea increases physical endurance, easily noticed in aerobic activities such as running, and swimming.</p><p> - r. rosea provides me with a clear state-of-mind, and a general sense of peace.</p><p> - r. rosea was helpful to me in simultaneous cessation of my tobacco and amphetamine addictions.</p><p> - r. rosea is wonderful.</p>",
