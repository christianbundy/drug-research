  "[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]",
  "This is what happened the first time I tried sniffing paint.",
  "I had previously tried smoking weed and drinking beer, but thats it.",
  "Well on this day it was afterschool, I home alone and was bored and had no weed, or any other better drug to do. I was thinking what I had around the house that I could get high on?, I had heard of people sniffing paint, and I decided what the hell I'll give it a try, and there was several cans of spray paint in my garage I knew the gold is the one. I shook up the paint, and sprayed a good amount inside a plastic baggie. Then I put the bag to my mouth and inhaled deeply, like when I smoke weed. The smell of the fumes were strong and it was hard to breathe it in. I quickly inhaled those nasty shit fumes in and out , then felt the need to sit down so I sat down on the floor. I began to feel dizzy light headed and my body started to feel really heavy, and then I felt like I was moving in slow motion, that feeling lasted for about 30 seconds.",
  "I felt like I was very drunk but in a strange way. The whole thing lasted about 6 minutes. Afterwards my head and body felt hot and I didn't get a headache but I knew it was bad shit and swore I wouldn't do it anymore, but I tried it again the following day. Since the first time, I have done it about 10 times altogether.",
  "I don't feel any addiction to it, though. The only reason I have done it is because there was no better drugs available at the time."
