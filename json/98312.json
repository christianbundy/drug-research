 "report": "<p>I purchased 1 x 500ug tab from a reputable online vendor. I did my research and decided that because I couldn't source acid, 25i would be as close as I could get.</p><p>At midnight, I placed the complexed tab between my gum and cheek and waited for 30 minutes. I disposed of the tab and waited for effects.</p><p>I quickly (within 10-15 minutes) began to notice a shift in saturation in the room. Colours began to appear slightly richer. This is when the nausea set in.</p><p>Feeling rather sick and depressed, I decided to retreat to bed and relax. I got into bed and lay on my side. I hoped the nausea would pass but it only got worse. At about the 40 minute mark, I was lying on my side, in bed, feeling like I had a bad dose of the flu.</p><p>60 minutes in and there were no CEVs and no OEVs. I felt sick, uncomfortable, depressed, irritable and wanted to go to sleep. This is how I remained for 7 hours.</p><p>At approx 8am, I finally dropped off to sleep and woke up at approx 10am feeling heavily hungover and depressed. I went to the toilet, looked in the mirror, and noticed that my face was bright red. I spent the rest of the day lying on the couch feeling moderately ill as if I was hungover from heavy alcohol use.</p><p>It took 48 hours to rid of the feeling of nausea. For a week after the experience, I felt quite calm and refreshed.</p><p>As you can guess, I won't be repeating the journey.</p>",
