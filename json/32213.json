 "report": "<p>I began taking Tramadol for pain in my knees after skiing. I hate going to doctors so I acquired some from one of the many available legal sources. It worked quite well for the pain and doses around 200mg had similar affects to Hydrocodone without any stomach upset.</p><p>While taking it, I noticed an unreported affect; that being a significantly reduced appetite. This occurs at the normal 100mg dose (for my weight). In fact, over a period of three weeks I lost 10lbs. I simply just didn't eat as much. I am continuing to use it while attempting to drop another 30lbs.</p><p>On the down side, difficulty urinating, constipation and slight withdrawals while waiting about three days for a refill have been noticed, however, they are not sever and are manageable.</p>",
