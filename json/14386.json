  "I used Coleus leaves from a greenhouse at my school. I did what someone had recommended with the blender and the homemade filter. The filtering worked to some extent but it kept getting clogged. Next time I'll either try a coffee filter or another way of consuming the plant.",
  "Now, as far the my 'trip' went, it never started. There were a number of things that could've gone wrong though. Your supposed to use fresh leaves and by the time I used mine, it was almost two hours after they'd been picked. Another problem was probably the lack of leaves. I only had thirty. Although I didn't recieve any results, I plan to do it again and do it right. I will probably try smoking them and using them in a tea again. I'll report back later but until them, have a good trip."
