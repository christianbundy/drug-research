 "report": [
  "The first time I did coke it was a very small amount with cannabis. It felt good, but I never did any again until 1 year later.",
  "That night my friend gave me a line that was about 1/3g in one line. I had no idea what a good amount was. I took it and almost immediately started sweating, head was spinning, i fell to my knees and tried to vomit but everything was moving too fast. I couldnt think or tell what the hell was going on. Eventually I found myself outside the club laying on the ground... apparently i had passed out in the stall and the bouncer carried me out... embarrassing!",
  "I have realised since then that my body chemistry has a severe intolerance to stimulants. I can drink a very small amount of caffeine and feel very awake. A whole cup will cause anxiety.",
  "I have much more fun doing small amounts over a long period to help stay awake, than trying to get totally spazzed out and nonfunctional."
