  "I just ingested 5.5mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, obtained from a different source than the last 2 samples. This batch is a white, fluffy (well, looks sorta like cottonballs under a magnifying glass), crystalline powder which has a very strong indole smell. I opted for a small dose because I've noticed that this substance has a long tailing stimulation that lasts several hours after other effects have worn off, and I'd like to get to sleep before 4AM.\r8:55PM",
  "Alert! A generalized tingly sensation...\r9:15PM",
  "Things are going pretty well...still building though. I have the bright colors, warm tingly feel, and the sensation of comfort that I am fast coming to recognize as the signatures of this substance.\r9:50PM",
  "Pretty nice! I think a larger dose and a better setting would have been nicer, but oh well, I just wanted to sample this batch and compare. Effects are pretty much what I expected, based on my other 2 experiences. This is a nice alternative to sitting around and watching TV.",
  "I've got some stomach upset... nothing major though. Unsure if its connected. I got it the first time I did 5-MeO-DIPT as well, but not the second time. Could be coincidental... could be from having eaten beforehand... although all I had today was a bag of pretzels. Perhaps NOT having eaten much? \r2:30AM",
  "Wow...damn... Still having strong effects. This was quite a bit more than what I was expecting! This seemed much more of a stimulant and was alot more LSD-like in its feel - though it was definately the same drug."
