 "report": [
  "I was bored one night, and had remembered a friend had told me that he once smoked catnip and got a little buzzed, so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a try.  Here's a description of what happened:",
  "6:00 pm",
  "I took some ground up and dried 'cosmic catnip' and constructed a pipe out of the tubing of a toilet paper roll and a used up coke can.  I took the ground up leaves and lit them up in my pipe, and took a few hits.  I see no change as of yet.",
  "6:05 pm",
  "Starting to notice a plesant minty feeling in the back of my throat, spreading down to my lungs, otherwise I feel quite normal.",
  "6:12 pm",
  "The minty feeling has spread to all of my lungs and appears to be spreading a bit outside of them.  I'm starting to notice that reality is taking on a bit of a different look *THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL CHANGE*.  It is hard to explain, but when I move my head my eyes do not seem to be in sync with my head's movements, it is like moving a digital camera and the picture does not follow your camera's movements fluidly.",
  "6:17 pm",
  "Minty feeling leaves back of throat and is entirely in my lungs, this feeling is very pleasurable.  Starting to notice slight muscle weakness.",
  "6:24 pm",
  "Feelings of mintyness in lungs still there.  Things still same as previous input at 6:17.",
  "6:48 pm",
  "Minty feelings decrease a bit, but are still there and feel good.  The slight change in reality is still there, although does not seem to be as noticable as before at 6:12 pm.  I'm feeling slightly tired.",
  "6:50 pm",
  "Eyes feel a bit heavy.  Minty feeling in lungs dissapearing very slowly.",
  "6:55 pm",
  "Feeling slightly relaxed all over my body.  I am now in a chatroom and seem to be typing slower and making more typos more often than usual.",
  "7:00 pm",
  "Relaxed and somewhat euphoric feeling increases a bit, but is still very slight. At about this time the lid of a garbage can fell off and startled me, the rush of fear was felt stranger than it would usually feel when I'm startled.  It was not a more scary or less scary experience, but it just felt different.",
  "7:04 pm",
  "Feeling a slight giddiness, for no apparent reason.",
  "7:07 pm",
  "Minty feeling almost completely gone, can feel a bit of it in the bottom of my lungs.  I'm in a semi-euphoric relaxed state.  Giddiness gone completely.",
  "7:15 pm",
  "Relaxed state decreases a bit. Can still feel some of that minty feeling in my lungs. ",
  "7:18 pm",
  "Relaxed state wearing off. Minty feeling in lungs gone.",
  "7:30 pm",
  "Returning back to my normal state.  Relaxed state pretty much gone.  I am however feeling somewhat sleepy.",
  "7:50 pm",
  "The slight buzz I had has worn off, I am completely normal now, no drowsiness at all or anything.",
  "\t\t            MY CONCLUSION:",
  "Catnip is worth the try if you will be satisfied with a very mild buzz, somewhat similar to marijuana.  Do so if you wish, I had a pleasureable experience with it.  You should use dried leaves and it should be smoked.  Note that I used 'cosmic catnip' which comes in plastic containers with crumbled up leaves.  You can buy this stuff at some pet stores."
