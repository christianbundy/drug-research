 "report": "<p>I have been taking Ritalin for 3 years now, all that time I have never abused it. But I had an exam, and I needed to stay up late. So I took 2 15 mg pills (I was always trustworthy so I kept the Ritalin in my room) crushed them up into a fine powder, and snorted then.</p><p>The burn was bad, but nothing too serious. After I was done, I remember thinking 'Damn, it didnt work. Little did I know I'd have to wait for the drip (which was the nastiest tasting thing ever) to feel anything. I thought it be great. I could study, get a good grade, and pass my class.</p><p>Wrong! At first it was O.K. Mild euphoria, peaceful, etc... But every drug has its dark side. I was snapped back to reality real fast.</p><p>First it started when I could feel my heart beating like a lab rat's, I swear, I thought I was gonna die. I tried to calm down and played 'GTA Vice City' (I forgot about studying). No use, still felt like my chest was about to explode.</p><p>Finally, I said 'fuck it' and tried to sleep. HA! Not one fuckin wink. Then, as sudden as it started, it stopped. It was around 2:00 (I snorted the pill around 12:00). I finally got some shut-eye.</p><p>The next day I was the mean as ever. I felt tired, cranky and wanted to snort another line. I never did though, and I finally got out of that phase (and I didnt pass the exam).</p><p>Methylphenidate is one powerful, and I think my experience was one of a kind. It was 24 hours in hell for me.</p>",
