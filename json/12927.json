  "OK I've done E three times and think I have some usefull info to contribute.  The first time I dropped one tab on a whim at a friends house with a small group of people.  I rolled very hard and ended up spending the night with a girl, cuddling and talking etc.  It was a great experience, but the whole next week I was very down, definetely depressed.  The second time I dropped another tab from the same batch one month later and rolled just as hard as the first.  This time I did a little reading and took a bunch of antioxidants afterwards.  This cleared my head up much quicker, but I still was very depressed for almost a whole week.  So this third time, a month later, I dropped two tabs, three hours apart, and had another great time.  This time afterwards I took 200mg of 5-HTP, followed by 50mg a day for three days.  I had no depression!  I would say that within 48 hours I felt totally normal.  This is somehat unusual as far as I understand.  I highly recommend that people use this with E.  Next time I plan to load up on it in the hours before hand to see if it makes the high better.  I'll let you guys know how it works.  I should also say that I wrestle in college and have found that meditating in the time between coming down and going to bed has improved my wrestling VERY drastically(Without practice!  This is quite amazing.  I basically beat people I had never beaten before, without stepping on the mat in between.)  I recommend you try this with something that is important to you. Thanks to all for the experience reports, you have been an invaluable resource."
