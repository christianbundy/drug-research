 "report": [
  "When my sample of Salvia divinorum came I sat at the kitchen table and told my Wife that I was gonna try it and she should watch me. The first time I took one good bongload as a test and sat there. A buzz came on, definitely psychedelic, and I sat there for a couple minutes, then stood up, noticing a very definite 'tug' to the SE no matter which way I turned... This was just a 'test' to get an idea as to the effects. I planned on trying a 'committed dose' later that evening in the dark peace and quiet. I noticed that no kind of external stimuli was attractive...\r",
  "Later that eve, I got 3 good hits together and sat down with the bong. I laid out a cushion in the floor in case I wanted to lay down. I let my Wife lay down in the next room, which could've been a mistake, because when Salvia divinorum hits, you are gone. I took a hit, held it in and then repeated. By the time I finished the 3rd, I barely made it to the cushion...",
  "Well, let me say now that I have always considered myself a very 'spiritual' person, very experienced in 'psychedelics'  and was unafraid of whatever may comewhat DID pass was, in fact, somewhat disturbing:",
  "As I literally fell to the cushion, I was transported to a 'farm'. This farm was run by a very 'American Gothic' couple, except the woman had a rather 'Swiss Miss' look to her, older, but with broad white collar and nurse-like cap... Anyway, I could really only 'see' them through goggle-shaped windows about 3 feet in front of me. They were watching me staked out in their garden as thousands of furry red and black caterpillars gnawed me into the earth! There was a grinding sound of the continuous chewing as I was being pulled into the soil and the older farmer couple kept repeating over and over 'Pembly Grimseed', 'Pembly Grimseed'",
  "To tell the truth, I was a bit dismayed at being treated as fertilizer and admittedly was expecting my usual transcendent psychedelic experience, but as soon as I figured out what was happening and struggled a bit, The caterpillars became the legs of larger tarantulas more intent on letting me know who was in control and the annoying-but-painless composting of my body by the caterpillars was by far the more attractive situation! I so wanted to play another (any other) role on this 'farm', but fertilizer I was",
  "I tried to get a better look at the rather benign older couple repeating 'Pembly Grimseed' ad infinitum, but the goggle-windows began to fog over and I realized that only my left arm was being chewed and then upon coming back to THIS beloved 'reality', in a cold sweat no less, I realized just HOW GONE I had been! I washed up and went and crawled into bed with my wonderful wife, very thankful to be alive and well!",
  "The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and although a was very depressed afterwards, I realize this morning that I never was 'afraid' at all and I wasn't really connected consciously to the body being chewed. I know that the body must die and go back to the earth etc. But, it's not the most pleasant image to watch!",
  "All morning, I have been recalling the apparent name of this Farm, 'Pembly Grimseed' and the lyric to an old song keeps flooding my mind. It's a piece of 'Supper's Ready' by Genesis w/ Peter Gabriel called 'Willow Farm': 'When you go down to Willow Farm, to search for butterfliesyou've been here all the time, so like it or not, you'll like what you got, cuz you're under the soil, yes deep in the soil!'",
  "I am gonna try it again, mainly because I think I see the lesson here, but if this seemingly benign couple continue to treat me this way I think I'll vacation elsewhere than 'Pembly Grimseed Farm'!"
