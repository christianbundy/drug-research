 "report": "<p>I recently aquired a gram each of pure JWH 019 and pure JWH 250. This is not my first time taking drugs, however it is my first experience with any JWH. I have used cannabis, 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-B, Salvia, 4aco-DMT, Opiates, and Mushrooms in the past. I have had a few trips where I felt uneasy, but never what I would consider to be a bad trip until the night I smoked JWH.</p><p>It was around 8:00 PM when I just finished weighing out ~5mg of JWH 250 and ~5mg of JWH 019. The JWH 250 was a light pink in color, and it had the consistency of fine grain salt. The JWH 019 was pure white and had a very fluffy texture. I placed a small bowl of cannabis in my pipe on top of a screen, and then poured the two JWH powders on top of it. I laid my pipe down, and turned on some music before lighting up.</p><p>I had just discovered the band 'No Man' an hour earlier. I put on my noise canceling headphones and turned on the track titled 'Together We're Stranger'. I placed the flame to the bowl of my pipe and inhaled two hits. The smoke was very smooth, and had a nice taste to it.</p><p>Just as I was getting ready to take a third hit, I instantly felt the JWH kick into full force. There was no gradual come up - it hit me like a freight train. The song started to become darker and deeper sounding. All I could do was focus on the song that was playing. My body was frozen in one position. My left hand was holding the pipe in the air, and my right hand was holding the lighter. I stared at my laptop as it slowly morphed in to 4 different laptops. They slowly spiraled around in a clockwise motion going in sync with the song playing. My eyes began to close shut and all feeling of my body was fading away. Once my eyes fully shut, I felt my head drop downwards and I was in a deep trance. I saw my entire life flash by me. I was reliving memories that I had long forgotten. I saw every moment that I had spent with my family and friends. I replayed vivid memories in my head of the most important times in my life.</p><p>I was no longer aware of my present self. I could not see where I was sitting, I could not feel my body, I had no idea what I had just smoked. I felt as if this was my end. I was going to die. I had visuals of my mother looking over my body once they discovered I was dead. I have never felt so terrible in my life. I just wanted to reach out and hug her and apologize for ever putting her through this. It was at this point where I very slowly became aware of my presence. I managed to open one of my eyes and I saw my laptop sitting in front of me. I could not turn my head or move a single muscle in my body. I could faintly see the song still playing in iTunes. It had only been 7 minutes since I smoked the JWH. I could feel tears running down my face as soon as I realized how little time had moved on. It felt as if I spent an entire lifetime during the trip I just had.</p><p>The song continued to play. I could feel my body trying to go back in a trance. I had to fight it. I felt a surge of anger explode in my body. I could not let this happen to myself again. I visualized trying to kill whatever it was that was making me feel this way. I tried to use anger to force myself to wake up. My eyes opened again and this time the tears were pouring out everywhere. I was finally able to turn my head. I looked down at my right arm which was still holding the lighter from earlier. I tried with all of my power to move my right arm but I failed. I continued to cry when I was unable to move my limbs.  With one final attempt, I used all of my willpower to try and move my arm. I focused as hard as I could, and finally my arm was lifted.</p><p>The happiness of moving my arm overwhelmed me. I let go of the lighter and moved my hand toward my laptop mouse. My vision was extremely blurry, and my laptop was still split in to four, spinning in a clockwise circle. I could see the faint image of my cursor moving across the screen. I moved it toward the X, and managed to exit out of iTunes. Finally the song had stopped playing. I regained consciousness in my limbs, and I ripped off my headphones. I sat there in my chair just staring at my computer screen.</p><p>I was traumatized by what had just happened. I began to tremble in fear and broke down in tears once again. I ran over to my bed and jumped under all of the covers. I was still wearing all of my clothes, but I wanted this night to end as soon as possible. All of my lights were still on in the room, but I was too shook up to go turn them off. As I laid in bed, I continued to have closed eye visuals. Every time my eyes closed, I would start to fall in to a trance. I spent the next four hours of the night trying to fight this off.</p><p>I am not sure when I finally fell asleep. I woke up extremely traumatized from the previous night. This was by far the most terrifying experience I have ever had in my life. I have absolutely no plans to try any JWH in the future and I strongly suggest you do your own research before diving in to it yourself.</p>",
