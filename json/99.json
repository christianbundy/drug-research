 "report": [
  "Setting: Having nothing better to do I was having a few drinks (meaning I was drinking through the whole night until 3-4 hrs before going to sleep, about the equivalent of 1 beer 33 cl / hour + 1 line of synthacaine 2.5 hrs before) and gaming a little on my PC. Have had these two pills of each a mix of 100mg MPA and 50mg MDAI lying around for a while and thought 'what the hell'. So I scratched about 5-10mg off of one of them and put it under my tongue. No reaction after 20 mins so I decided to go ahead and try.",
  "Dosing: Since I have read all the trip reports I could get a hold of I felt like being cautious and decided to only take one half at first. It seemed like many had taken a high dose (up to 500mg!) and ended up feeling a horrible serotonin depletion for many days afterwards. Even though David E. Nichols labeled it a 'non-neurotoxic MDMA-like SRA' (paraphrasing here) theres no reason to think that taking 5x the dose one would of MDMA and think it safe (I know, maybe not the same substance but you get my meaning). Be sensible.",
  "23:30 (50mg MPA + 25 MDAI)",
  "Felt a little better and a slight mood lift, but nothing major so I took the other half.",
  "00:30 (+50mg MPA + 25mg MDAI)",
  "Felt really nice stimulation with a moderate euphoria - very pleasant - no anxiety at all. Had a great time gaming and was never annoyed when it didnt go well (as I can normally can get furious). Felt really good and decided to take #2 pill since the experience was not overwhelming.",
  "1:30 (+100mg MPA + 50mg MDAI)",
  "Kept gaming and had a blast. Got up some times because I wanted to feel what it felt like to move. Very nice. No trails or pronounced dizziness - felt especially good to breathe.  Everything seemed a little soft to look at, like the edges were smoothened, but other than that no visuals. All through this no pupil dilation!? Was looking in the mirror every time I went to the bathroom. Seemed weird since I would have definitely expected this to produced wild pupil dilation.",
  "5:46",
  "(about an hour before this point, no more alcohol) Still riding the high and noticed the pupil dilation I had been waiting for - bigtime. Odd having to wait this long for the effects. Didnt feel much different though - still high, pleasantly so and not overwhelming.",
  "8:00",
  "Effects have attenuated a little bit but still high. Slightly sobering",
  "9:00",
  "Still feeling the effects - not much different from 8:00 apart from sobering up. Ok, have been awake too long now. Want to sleep so took 3 mg etizolam.",
  "9:30",
  "went to sleep and woke up at 16 feeling relaxed. No unpleasant after effects noted except the usual emotional numbness I feel after etizolam.",
  "Tip: Etizolam + alcohol or any other GABA modulator/agonist at the same time will often make my eyelids twitch for weeks after. I try to sober up before using etizolam to fall asleep (easiest with clean drugs).",
  "Conclusion:",
  "I would do this again. Was a nice experience and just what I was looking for in that it was not too much for the circumstances. Note:The next night (almost 24 hours after original dose) I took a rail of synthacaine which havent given me pupil dilation sofar - but this time - bigtime (same batch as previous)! Leads me to believe that MDAI, especially, might have a very long half-life akin to 6-apb. Thats another reason to keep the dose low. This might help to explain the people who got depressed after taking this. MDAI seems to be better as a mixer with MPA, which is also considered a good mixer - both might not be that great on their own."
