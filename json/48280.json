 "report": "<p>I am currently on Valium, and I ended up taking more than was indicated when I first got my prescription filled, so I have been on the hunt for substitutes until I get it filled again to ease the withdrawls, as I can only take 5 mg. of Valium per day, as opposed to the 15 mg I am supposed to be on. I am on Valium as as substitute for alcohol, as I am an alcohol-dependant person.</p><p>I had tried kava kava in fairly high doses many times, with some luck. It would simply make me feel dissociated and quiet, no noticible euphoria or intoxication. Tonight, I went to a local health foods store and picked up some kava kava gel tabs, and powdered valerian root capsules. The recomended dose of the kava is 1 tablet 3x per day (225 mg. kavalactones) and 3 caplets as needed (1,590 mg) valerian root. Because I have experiance with both I decided on 1 tablet of kava and 2 to start of the Valerian, as I wanted to play it safe. The experiance goes as follows.</p><p>+0.00 - I down 1 kava kava gel tab and 2 valerian root caplets. I go to eat. I have a really bad headache.</p><p>+1.00 hour - I feel more relaxed, hungry again and somewhat thirsty. Mild benzodiazapine effect. Head pain easing up.</p><p>+1:30 hours - I feel good, but leveled off so I decide on 1 more Valerian caplet. No more headache.</p><p>+2:00- I have now devoured a baggie of Dorito's and lots of water. I'm thirsty as hell, and a little off balance, I feel good.</p><p>+2:30- I take three more valerian caplets. More than reccomended, but I feel like I can handle it.</p><p>+2:30 - 5:00 hours later - Feeling intoxicated. I feel like I've had a few drinks, talkative and more social. Slightly euphoric. Cigarettes taste AMAZING. Slight nausea.</p><p>All in all, while I had to consume twice the recommended dosage, this can be a powerfull herb. Very relaxing and disinhibiting. Feels like low dose alcohol/ low dose marijuana. Killed my pain, but when the extra three began to kick in I have an awful taste in my mouth, alot of extra mucous and feel a little nauseous. I also have a slow, pounding heart.</p><p>This is a very safe alternative to illegal substances/ chemicals. I highly recomened it. It seems like dosing a second time after the first dose wears off is neccisary for maximal effects. The first dose acts as a primar, the second as a true tranquillizar/intoxicant. With a low dose of kava kava, this is really good stuff. I highly prefer it over doing more risky things like smoking marijuana, taking benzodiazapines or drinking. It is a much healthier alternative. I also suffer from high blood pressure and my blood pressure has dropped way down, which Valium does not do for me.</p>",
