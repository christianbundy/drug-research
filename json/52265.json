 "report": "<p>Recently I have been put on Paxil for social anxiety. I noticed I was feeling some of the side effects such as being dazed a bit, and not feeling like myself at times. Anyways, the other night I found out about another one of Paxils side effects. Sexually. I met a girl at the club I was at and things clicked and she ended up coming back to my apartment. The sex I had that night was the longest and most intense I've ever had. It went on for about 4 hours and I was getting exhausted and confused as to why it was so hard to orgasm. However as it finally did hit it was the most powerful orgasm I have ever had. I was shaking and shivering and even teared up.</p><p>This is about 10x more intense than my best orgasm ever. Anyways she loved it too I won't go into details about anything more.</p>",
