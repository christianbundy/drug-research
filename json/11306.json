 "report": [
  "This took place on two separate occasions separated by more than a week, but the setting was similar (same place, day of week, time).",
  "Each dose was injected in a quiet room free from distractions, six hours after eating a small, easily digestible meal to minimize nausea (bagels).",
  "Both doses were accurately measured to 4mg. I had earlier prepared a 20mg/mL solution in saline, and both doses were taken from this solution measured in a 1mL syringe with 0.01mL graduations.",
  "1) Intravenous",
  "Within 5 seconds of withdrawing the needle, bodily tension and shivering was fairly severe, but nothing alarming. A quickly rising nausea gave way to several dry heaves at the 30 second to two-minute point, and then declined to a level of general discomfort for the rest of the trip. Some patterns were noted, but not very many, and the nausea was distracting.",
  "2) Intramuscular",
  "4mg in 0.8mL saline was injected into the shoulder muscle. The injection site became fairly sore but was not unbearable. The bodily tension seemed to rise gradually for the first 5 minutes or so, when it reached a steady state that faded out gradually throughout the experience. Nausea was slight, it was felt but not to the point where I felt I should go to the bathroom 'just in case'. Visuals were different from the iv visuals. No patterns were noticed, but the lack of nausea made it easier to appreciate the subtler color enhancements and rainbows around edges."
