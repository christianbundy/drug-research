  "<p>It was one of those very strange weekends where I was going to pull an all nighter, so I decided to load up on caffeine. Coffee, Mountain Dew, Jolt, Surge, I was drinking whatever I could find.",
  "Anyway, the night went rather well, as I was bouncing off the walls. Over the next 24 hours, I phased in and out of sleep. At about seven o'clock that night, I went right to sleep. Everything's going okay, but wait, there's more.",
  "I woke up at about two in the morning. I got up, drank a glass of water, and went back the bed. The next moment stands as one of the strangest experiences of my life.",
  "I heard a strange, indescribable sound. It resonated, and echoed, growing louder every time. I knew it was coming from the inside, but I was still very afraid. When it soon seemed to get unbearably loud, it stopped. I got up. Or, at least I tried.",
  "For the next few seconds, couldn't move at all. Any commands I send to my arms and legs wouldn't work. Of course, I knew that I had sleep paralysis at that moment.",
  "I waited a few seconds and was able to move again. Some people have these experiences and think it was divine, or perhaps even interstellar.",
  "But I know that these strange effects were the result of caffeine.",
  "Please tell me I'm not the only one that hear's these noises. It happened again, and for the same reason. It started to scare me.</p>"
