 "report": "<p>I am a 5'9' healthy, athletic, 27 year old male. I take 4mg of Dilaudid (hydromorphone) 4-5 times a day, for back pain (herniated disks), I smoke about 2 or 3 bowls of pot a day as well, and have been smoking that much or more for about 3 years now.</p><p>Saturday I recieved an expensive ecstasy pill the my friend got over in Japan. I took the Ecstasy that afternoon and it turned out to be the best single pill I had ever had. I was in a great mood and during my roll I ended up talking to another frind in the bay area who told me he had 2 doses of DOI (Dimethoxy Iodoamphetamine). DOI is a substituted amphetamine but instead of being a stimulant it is a very high potency hallucinogen. the original plan was that we would each take one and trip out together. that plan fell through becuase he had stuff to do on sunday but offered to trade me both doses of DOI for some of my Dilaudid. I took him up on the offer.</p><p>Once I got back home at about 2am, I took:</p><p>- 3mg DOI (on a sugar cube)</p><p>- 4mg Hydromorphone (railed)</p><p>- 1g Pot</p><p>By 3am I started feeling it take effect and by about 5am I was enjoying a nice trip with excellent closed eye visuals and sensory enhancements and enjoyed this for another couple of hours when I decided to step it up a notch</p><p>at about 9am, I took:</p><p>- 3mg of DOI</p><p>- 4mg Hydromorphone</p><p>- 1g Pot</p><p>(I also continued the hydromorphone and pot throughout the trip althought not sure of exact times it was roughly:</p><p>4mg of Hydromorphone about every 4 or 5 hours and about a gram of pot at those intervals as well.)</p><p>Shortly after I was completely consumed in the trip. a definate +++. open and closed eye hallucinations, not just visual hallucinations but also sounds, smells, tastes, and physical sensations. I could see through time and be in different places as diffferent people simultanously, sometimes these paths would cross even and I had to learn how to communicate with all of my different selves when they ran across each other. other times I was completely overwhelemed with images or sensations. every memory Ive ever had in my life (real or imaginary) was recalled and like somehow mixed in or presented to me as if to show me how it all fits together, and how each one is for a reason. I was able to understand the flow of lifes energy.</p><p>In the movie 'The Matrix' a person could look at a screen of numbers and clearly see what they all meant and instead of 'seeing' numbers they simply felt whatever sense was applicable..... well this was slightly that way only it wasnt number.... it was 'anything'..... for example I may see the world as an oil painting but in full motion.... but it didnt matter what appeared to be there..... I understood what it meant or stood for..... then a miute later instead of a painting I only felt the world as if it was water.... then the next minute the world all appeared to be tiny neon lights all woven together.... this kept changint from theme to theme and never the same one twice.... it was almost like changing the skins on computers only it was the skin of the world....</p><p>The most significant feeling for me however was the perspective it put on the way life interacts with other life. It was this ability to be able to feel OTHER PEOPLES emotions from their point of view, to know exactly how they see something and understand fully all of the reasons that they feel the way that they do, instead of jsut trying to imagine how they feel...  it was this perfect sync with the elecricity of life. I could see the cause and effect of absolutely everything. almost like I was always staring at a bunch of dots wondering what they meant.... then suddenly the dots connected and I could see how each thing affected the next or what it was caused by.....this continued all day sunday and all that night too. I had already not slept saturday night becuase of the ecstasy then the DOI early in the morn sunday.</p><p>By sunday night I was exhausted. but the drug was still blasting along at full speed. sunday night/monday morning was difficult. the exhaustion led to paranoia and paranoia and high powered hallucinogens are not a good mix. I distanced myself mentally and tried to clear my mind, which was a futile battle and only made it worse. I was alone.... not jsut physically but in the trip I had been stripped of every posession Except my exhausted mind. this was my test. or so I felt.... I was locked away in a dark dark hole with nothing... only my exhausted hallucinating paranoid mind.... my body was not even with me. I couldnt move or walk or anything I just existed.... this was my test to see if I could be honest with myself. becuase if you cant be honest with yourself then you will secretly hate yourself. and if you cant learn how to get over problems and repair mistakes then you will be alone and live in hatred.</p><p>If I had to use a word to describe what the trip was like I would jsut say 'perfect'</p><p>It seemed as though my entire life had actually been perfectly choreographed and was all jsut the set up for THIS TRIP..... that this is that perfect trip that i have always been searching for but could never find. I feel like I dont even need to do drugs at all anymore.... it seems pointless now.... I just got everything I ever wanted and all kinds of other new stuff I never even knew I wanted before....</p><p>When you find yourself riding a dead horse the best strategy is to dismount.</p>",
