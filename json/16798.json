  "Okay so i'm really bored and on a nasty drug testing regime and I've really been needing SOME kind of mental distortion (reality is BORING for me!).",
  "I recently got prescribed Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10mg a day. I am really bored so I just took four of them to see what happens.",
  "T+0:00 I just popped four of them, it's 9:11pm, we'll see what happens, im currently just listening to some music and surfing the web.",
  "T+0:45 nothing happening yet...",
  "T+1:00 Been really giggly, I cant stop smiling and laughing at pointless stuff, I dunno if im just in a good mood or if somethin is happening.",
  "T+1:10 yeah it isn't the lexapro, cuz now I feel normal again.",
  "T+1:20 I feel a lump in my chest, it doesnt feel bad or weird, I kinda like it actually, kinda feels like I swallowed something big whole or something.",
  "T+2:00 I went and smoked a cigarette and kept laughing for no reason, it was pretty enjoyable, now im just gettin into some music",
  "T+3:00 I'm pretty delirious I dunno if im tired or if it's workin, I'm laughin at things I normally wouldnt.",
  "The next day: I woke up feeling extremely tired and groggy, but once I got moving I felt really relaxed and in a very good mood"
