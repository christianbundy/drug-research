 "report": "<p>I'm a 42 year old male with a fairly wide range of experience: MDMA (my favourite), 2-C-B (also very fine but too potent for me!), cocaine, shrooms, crystal meth, pot, acid (once--yech!). However at the time of this experience I had been fairly clean for almost ten years, having had quite enough of the trip in my early thirties.</p><p>Lately however I've been going through changes--end of a long-term relationship, creative breakthroughs, travel--and felt the desire to experiment again. Many research chemicals are still unscheduled in my country, and after much consideration I ordered a quantity of Ace. I had always wanted to try Foxy, but never found any--Ace seemed like a milder version and I was definitely interested in the erotic side of it!</p><p>The day of this, my first time with it, I'd had two light meals, and nothing for about 4 hours. I was not on any medications. 10mg in a gel cap were taken orally, with another 10mg at the ready if I felt like it--it turned out to be unnecessary! I do tend to be very sensitive to hallucinogens.  Setting was my apartment, clean and ready to go. My cat would be my companion.</p><p>I started to do housework, waiting for the come-up. At twenty minutes, I started to feel warm but relaxed. I washed my hands, and the hot water on my skin felt sparkly and sensual--something I'd experienced on 2-C-B. I did some drawing, but at thirty minutes I was definitely coming up and felt compelled to stop and take some deep breaths, as I felt some tension. The reports were right, it acts fast! No more work was done that night.</p><p>At forty minutes (my notes says 'only 40 minutes?'!) I felt the restlessness others reported. Stretching helped, and also felt quite good. I found I had to do a light, moving yoga to stay on track. My abdominal area was really rolling, but not in a nauseous way. I felt that all the physical, emotional, and spiritual baggage I carried in the solar plexus was being unpacked.</p><p>In some reports I noted people getting very agitated at this stage, and if I were not alone and simply able to move about as I pleased I might have been very upset too. Not like MDMA though, where dancing becomes an imperative--here I just need a place to kind of roll around voluptuously. My leather recliner was perfect for this and I spent the next hour or so there. At this point the notes I was taking stopped for a while--there was too much going on.</p><p>People describe Ace as being pink and soft -- this definitely kicked in. I found I needed to stay warm. Blankets were an incredible delight. My cat settled on the couch and looked impossibly fuzzy and round, for which I laughingly rebuked him. I had tuned to an electronica station, but the music became a little too hard edged. Ambient music fit the bill much more nicely. Music did not acquire multiple dimensions as it does on pot or MDMA (I am a musician), but the soft sounds were exceedingly pleasant. Soft lighting, especially candles, were wonderful. I did not experience open eye visuals, but closed eye visuals were again rounded, simple, but a touch forbidding--usually this is one of my favourite parts of the experience, but not here. I can't explain why it felt as though I was looking at something that shouldn't be seen</p><p>I pulled a book of paintings by Rubens off the shelf and sighed enormously at the colours, compositions, and emotions depicted--here were happy lives in perfect harmony with nature and not lacking in grandeur or ambition either. This was as heady as it got--no big thoughts, just feelings of ultimate rightness.</p><p>I really needed to eat at this point and thoughts of luscious fruit dominated my thinking for some time until I realized with joy that I had some yogurt with berries in the fridge. Eating this was an extreme sensual delight, though somewhat difficult.</p><p>I then stripped down to a pair of shorts, as I was warm and the clothes felt confining. I was enjoying being in my body, though it was still rolling. There is definitely an edge to the substance! I didn't lose my mind though; I remembered to feed the cat, and was generally able to perform simple tasks, though very slowly. The cat was no more or less delightful than he always is, which I found curious, given the other sensations.</p><p>A note at one hour and fifty minutes reads 'invoking sychronicity'. This was the peak of the head trip.</p><p>I always found the randy part of MDMA on the downside, and that was the case here. Most definitely. At two hours sex kicked in and the two hours following were spent in the most mellow and voluptuous way imaginable. A multifaceted erotic experience that cried out to be shared with a hot partner--it was everything I expected and more. I also kicked up the music to progressive house and that was very, very nice.</p><p>Once I got my fill I kind of puttered around I was definitely on the way down now, a soft landing that took about ninety minutes. Then baseline.</p><p>So the reports were right: fast acting, sensual, easy comedown. This is not a substance for clubs or parties. With what happens here, I would have to be pretty intimate with the company. I also want to be in a very comfortable, soft and safe space. This substance rewards the experienced--and the research I did was rewarded, as I was able to take its difficulties in stride.</p><p>Like a fine wine, savour it with someone you love.</p>",
