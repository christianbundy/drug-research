  "I have taken Hydergine for more than 10 years with a few breaks of 1 month or more for various reasons.  Going off Hydergine left me with a noticeable deficit in retention and recall of learned information.  It takes about a week of a daily regime of 1mg in the morning and 1mg in the evening sublingually. One word of caution, Hydergine has been linked to plaque build up on a valve in the heart.  This is a very rare condition.  Talk to a medical professional if you are concerned about this. Another draw back is that Hydergine is quite expensive.    ",
  "About 8 years ago I added Nootropil to my daily regime. When first starting or starting over after a break of a week or more I'd need to take an attack dose of 5000-6000 mg.  Nootropil has no has no LD (lethal dose) and has no know side effects at very high dosage.",
  "I discovered that if I take 2 mg Hydergine with Nootropil at the suggested dosage 2 x 800 mg morning and evening (3200 mg daily) that I lost the ability to take what my mind was thinking and easily put it into words. I did several experiments and this is definitely a real effect.",
  "Nootropil is much less expensive than Hydergine and I found that if I cut my daily intake of Nootropil down to 800mg twice a day that I could get maximum benefit from Hydergine with no side effects at 1 mg every other day.",
  "My recall and ability to articulate complex concepts is greatly improved while on Hydergine and Nootropil.  I can truly tell the difference when I stop taking them."
