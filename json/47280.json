 "report": "<p>Me and my friends ordered some fly agarics off the internet and recieved some salvia free with it. Not being very knowledgable about salvia we thought we would wait on the shrooms to kick in before we smoked it. When we smoked it I was already feeling really good from the shrooms.</p><p>I took a monster hit and held it in. I don't remember exhaling. I was already traveling through time. I went billions of years into the future. Past the end of human life. Our spirits were now one with god and I found my own spirit. Every thing was very simple then. Solid dense mass rolling on top of its self back and forth in a square pattern, filling up the emptyness of space. This is the hardest thing to explain. I felt it was reality. When I started coming to again, I had to travel backwards in time. I was very disappointed when I woke up to be in the present. This was the best and worst thing I have ever experienced in my life.</p><p>I do not recommend mixing salvia with anything. It gives the plant too much to work with. It is a very intimidating drug in itself and doesnt care much about a person, so when mixed with another drug they are 100% helpless.</p>",
