But just for refrence, I was in a room with friends.</p><p>Your mist tasted of strangeness</p><p>the people said goodbye</p><p>I was gripped into your depths</p><p> at an alarming rate.</p><p>My limbs were ripped off and I ceased to exist along with my friend, time.</p><p>we saw god who was revealed as everybody in the room being ripped apart.</p><p>tearing. everywhere.</p><p>the true state of reality was chaos.</p><p>I was being pulled and cracked -- god  was  breaking.</p><p>I could not exist for much longer in this universe.
