 "report": "<p>At first I'd like to state that I've done methylone while using zyprexa (7.5 mg/day) few times before and it was really good. This time I had just started Effexor (75 mg) but didn't take it in the morning. My girlfriend eats Effexor, too, but not Zyprexa. She also left it in the morning the day we tried methylone and it was not her first time to try the substance.</p><p>First we both took 300 mg each orally. We were waiting for the regular methylone rush and euphoria which normally comes in 15-20 minutes, but after about an hour we realized that the Effexor is reducing the euphoric effects very much. We took 90 mg of methylone more, but it didn't really enhance the effect that much.</p><p>Mental effects of methylone didn't seem to reduce very much, since I got relaxed, kinda peaceful and a clear mind. Somehow the effects on consciousness were still decreased. We both were disappointed and wouldn't take Effexor with methylone again. It's kinda waste of a great substance.</p>",
