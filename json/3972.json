 "substance": "Betel Nut",
 "bodyweight": "175 lb",
 "report": "<p>A very large percentage of the folks living in the islands (Micronesia) have betel nut 'going on' all the time.  I've only used the fresh nut, so I don't know about the products you'll be getting through the mail if you order it...  With a fresh nut, just slice it in half, put a pinch of lime on the internal surfaces, wrap the whole thing up in a nice fresh kabui leaf, and chomp on it a few times (very hard and fibrous)and then 'couch it' between your gums and cheek.  Soon you'll notice a slight to heavy buzz...and your perceptions will take a turn for the luminescent.  It is easy to build up a tolerance...  It is mellow and pleasant.</p>",
