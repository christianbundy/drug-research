 "report": "<p>One afternoon at school, after showing them off to my friends, I took 4 milligrams of xanax.  It was lunch time at school and I took them on a full stomach. </p><p>I went back to English class and everything was starting to get a little dizzy.</p><p>I went on to band class, in which we were doing nothing because the director was leaving us.  I only know this because I was told, I don't remember what happened in that class at all.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>After school I somehow managed to safely drive home.  It's beyond me how I didn't wreck or something.</p><p>I came home and soon crashed in the recliner.  I must have zonked completely out.  Later when my mom was home,  I staggered like a drunk man into our living room.  She asked what was wrong and I drunkenly replied 'Nothin...' And went back to the recliner.</p><p>I woke up later that evening and felt normal.  My mom didn't think too much about the episode that afternoon, though both my parents remarked that my speech sounded slurred.</p>",
