 "report": [
  "The school day started off like normal, but on this day my anxiety was through the roof.",
  "One of my close friends had 2 Xanax bars and gave them to me. I took one bar, then waited 10 minutes to take half of the other.",
  "It took around 40 minutes for the effects to really start. My body felt slow, numb, and most importantly my anxiety was completely gone. The day flew by and I don't recall what I was saying to people.",
  "My social skills were absolutely amazing, it made me realize how wonderful this drug can be. The day ended and it felt like a daze. Benzos are defiantly a drug that eats up hours and feels like its only minutes."
