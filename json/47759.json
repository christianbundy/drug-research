 "report": "<p>I have tried shrooms three times and acid twice, all on separate occasions. (1/8 of shrooms and 2 hits of acid)</p><p>Every time I have taken these, I have had friends that took them as well.  Every time my friends would trip and I would not!  I do have depression and am on wellbutrin and zoloft.  I am aware that antidepressents can decrease the effects, but I had absolutely none!  Perhaps it's the dose, or maybe my serotonin does not work at all.  I have no idea, and clue.</p>",
