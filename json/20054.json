 "report": "<p>I recently obtained some oxy (Roxycodone) and tried it.  I took 30 mg both times.  I chewed the tablets.  The biggest effect was carsickness and nausea.  The high wasn't very good.  It was intense but not very good and combined with the carsickness feeling I just wanted it to be over.  It only got even remotely nice when I lied down in a dark cool room with some music on.  The best way to describe the high was clean.  It felt very clean, but it wasn't worth it.  I would not try this drug only because the bad effects outway the good.  Even alcohol is nicer.  I felt very much like the most intense effect was motion sickness, in my stomach and in my head that was among the most unpleasant effects in my life. </p><p>During the second time I tossed the rest of my pills down the toilet they were so bad.  I tried to keep a log of the times but the light made me very sick so I could not do that.  This is the worst recreational substance I've ever tried and I won't try it again.  I was disappointed because usually I get completely euphoric for hours after a couple tyenol with codines and a couple bowls of pot.</p>",
