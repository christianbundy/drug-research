  "Now the thought of E makes me nauseous and sad - when I first took it, it was the best, best best thing I'd ever experienced.",
  "I remember begging friends to take e with me, and telling them it's different to normal drugs. I don't think it is anymore.",
  "It's just such a pity that people can't feel like they do on E, naturally.</p>"
