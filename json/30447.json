 "report": "<p>I won't spend much time discoursing on set and setting or anything since this wasn't a terribly psychadelic experience.</p><p>To begin, let me just say that I was quite fascinated by the PIHKAL entry for this chemical and the idea of 'smart drug', focus aid, chemical insight enhancement, or whatever you want to call it. </p><p>I took around 10mg at approximately 12 oclock at night.  I had intended to hit the books and ascertain what, if anything, this drug might have to offer with respect to totally utilitarian (ie non-recreational/spiritual) consciousness altering properties.</p><p>It came on much faster than I have previously noticed a phenalthylamine to, and I felt undeniably speedy in 20 or 30 minutes.  This stimulation was roughly similar to the mental aspects of something like caffeine or adderall, but physically seemed much more gentle. </p><p>You see I say gentle because, at one point, I was using caffeine fairly regularly to alleviate the irritation of waking up in the morning.  Randomly, I would get small amounts of blood in my nose and ears when I showered, presumably because the heat of the water brought the blood vessels closer to the surface of my skin and the increased blood pressure/heart rate burst small capillaries close to the surface.  Not a big deal, but somewhat disconcerting.  Also, lots of caffeine always makes my stomach pretty uncomfortable, and my muscles sore.</p><p>This contrasts quite a bit with 2C-D, since the body buzz resulting from it was actually somewhat pleasant.</p><p>I'd say it peaked around 2.5 hours after ingestion.  The peak was actually slightly psychadelic:  there were subtle breathing effects and some other mild visual distortion.</p><p>As for the studying, well.. I can't say it went well.  My natural tendancy towards ADD was probably stronger if anything.  However, I don't exactly feel right about calling Shulgin and company wrong either.  The thing is, I don't doubt that this could be described as 'insight enhancing' given other circumstances.  Had I been reading something (for english say, or a philosophy class) or an architect or artist working on studio homework, I actually think it might have gone great. </p><p>The kind of insight enhancement provided by this drug is not suitable for work that is ultimately methodical.  I say that because I was doing math and computer science homework, and I didn't put even put a dent in the number theory OR the code.</p><p>Additionally, although I certainly wouldn't reccomend it until you've found a dosage appropriate for you, I imagine this would be very effective for long monotonous tasks such as driving.</p>",
