 "report": [
  "<p>I have tried Vinpocetine on a few occasions.  I have tried both 5 mg and 10 mg doses.  I have tried it on an empty stomach, and with a meal.  Every time that I have taken it, I just haven't been able to grasp any positive effects.",
  "I have heard that Vinpocetine is good at increasing blood flow to the brain, and that it can increase concentration.  I may feel the increase in blood flow, but it doesn't necessarily feel good to me.  When I take this it makes me feel dizzy, like I'm about to fall forward over myself.  This feeling is not overwhelming, but is somewhat constant. ",
  "I have much experience with smart drugs/nutrients including Hydergine, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, DMAE, P. Choline, and daily dosages of Piracetam.  I enjoy all of them, except for DMAE.  Vinpocetine is not something I will continue to take.</p>"
