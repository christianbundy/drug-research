  "Im always looking for some kind of new cool shit to get my dirty little hands on. Thursday night the shit came to me. A nice young fellow brought me a box of pills from him mothers cabinet to identify and when I did so he preceded to give me a couple Amitriptyline.",
  "I went on a burn run and ate 2 Amitriptyline thinking I could determine my dose once they started kicking in. An hour and a half later I felt nothing so I popped 3 more and began to feel a body buzz. I figured I had better drive home and so in doing so I started to hallucinate. I thought a deer was in the road and slammed on the brakes for no reason.",
  "When I got home the walls were crawling and I found myself lounging tiredly at the computer. When I heard my mom pull in I jumped into bed and told her id been up all night and that I was going to take a short nap.",
  "My short nap lasted 17 hours.",
  "17 hours of talking and walking in my sleep. Some of the strangest dreams Ive ever had. the one time I woke up, I was in a trance and could hardly make my way to the bathroom."
