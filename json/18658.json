  "<p>I wanted to try the rectal use of DPT, since snorting it always degrades the quality of the trip, cause of the nasty drip. I cant recommend the rectal use of DPT. I normally rail 35mg to get sucked out of the universe, when 60mg rectally dont do much. Slight colour enhancement, a little bit of the DPT feeling and very little to none nausea.",
  "Overall not worth it. I stick with the classic route of administration. Rectal use of DPT just takes to much mgs.</p>"
