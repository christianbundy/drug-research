 "report": [
  "<p>I started taking Melatonin four days ago along with a vitamin B complex in hopes of enhancing my dreams and maybe sleep a little better. I also take OTC Claratin and St. johns wort. I would take 1.5 m.g. of Melatonin and vitamin B at about 9:30 p.m. The first night I fell asleep fast and had some pretty intense dreams. The dreams I can remember were about work and were very vivid, but not worth explaining.",
  "That day my allergies were horrible and the Claratin I took had no effect at all, so I thought I had come down with a severe cold.That night I took the Melatonin and vitamin B along with some cold medicine. I did not sleep very well and was sneezing all night with a swollen throat.The next to days and nights were the same and I was taking lots of cold medicine to get through. This morning was the worst yet. My nose was runny and my throat and toungue were very swollen.",
  "I ended up going home after two hours and was thinking about going to the hospital because I was having much difficulty breathing. I found my girlfriends albutoral inhalor and took three puffs. After the swelling subsided I decided to look online for more information on the drugs I was taking. I found out that I am alergic to Melatonin and that I should not take Melatonin since I have seasonal allergies.",
  "The symptoms I experienced at first were much like that of a common cold with severe seasonal allergies and I had no idea Melatonin was the cause.</p>"
