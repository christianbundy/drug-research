  "Here is my experience with HBWR.  I obtained a packet of seeds from an online botanical company, and proceeded to scrape them clean, and ingest them by chewing them the best I could, and washing them down with a cup of water.  The taste was a light, nutty flavor, and not specifically bad. ",
  "The first effect I noticed, was an increased 'brightness' to everything.  Colors were enhanced, and I coulden't wipe the smile off my face.  I have no experimented with LSD or mushrooms, but the effects were similar to descriptions of those substances.  Mostly, the effects were mild.  Soon, however, I noticed my stomach was feeling quite upset indeed.  After about and hour, I became VERY ill.  I vomited about seven times over the next few hours. ",
  "The high took a turn for the worse.  Insted of a happy brightening of my surrondings, I was overcome by a terrible feeling of anxiety and urgency, like the feeling you get when your in deep trouble, or before a scary ride at the amusement park.  this lasted throughout the trip.  I felt hot and sweaty, with an itchy tingling feeling all over my body, and inside my throat and nasal cavity.  I slept for about 3 hours, and woke up several times to vomit. ",
  "Overall, I can only describe this experience as being poisoned.  Any high I had, or any interesting effects can be achieved better by drinking drano.  I will never take this substance again, I was in a state of misery for about 6 hours.  Please, if you must try this, use a LOW dose, this will lessen your pain later."
