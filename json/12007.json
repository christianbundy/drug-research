 "report": [
  "I had never had the pleasure of attending one before, but I never",
  "expected drugs to be sold so openly at music festivals. My journey to",
  "Spookstock 7 was long an uneventful, and mostly was spent mentally",
  "preparing for whatever psychedelic experiences I might have. I was",
  "actually doubtful that I would be able to find any doses at all, as",
  "it's fairly uncommon in my home state. I was not to be disappointed.",
  "I awoke to the rising sun at about seven o'clock, on the second day of",
  "the festival. I had arrived at the campground at midnight the night",
  "before, to something like an all-night music and drug party, and",
  "hadn't slept much in the intervening time. I was feeling strangely",
  "refreshed anyway, for some reason. I think it was something about the",
  "atmosphere of this place; everyone I met seemed to non-verbally",
  "acknowledge the strange, subtle connectedness that the psychedelic",
  "state awakens me to. It was, perhaps, the change that was refreshing.",
  "Not many people I normally interact with have been awakened in this",
  "way.",
  "As I climbed out of my friend R's car, stretched, and stumbled around,",
  "I encountered three new arrivals, camped out in the space next to",
  "us. were yelling at passerby, 'Molly!  Mescaline!'. (T-1:00)",
  "'Mescaline', I thought. That was definitely on my long, but",
  "shortening, list of 'Substances To Experience Before I Die'.",
  "In addition to the connectedness, everyone here is just extremely",
  "friendly, too. Maybe it's all the good pot and beautiful scenery. I",
  "don't know. Anyway, I talked to this 'mescaline' guy for a while, and",
  "he invited me over to his campsite, and offered me some hot chocolate.",
  "He told me that what he actually had was MDMA, Peyote extract, and",
  "2C-B, which he explained was like synthetic mescaline.",
  "However, I already knew 2C-B well from my research. I had never",
  "experienced it, though. It is indeed chemically similar to mescaline,",
  "but it has its own unique and interesting effects, also. I knew that",
  "it's effects are described as 'Somewhere between MDMA and LSD, but",
  "completely unlike a combination of the two.' He agreed to sell me one",
  "of his few doses. I took it on the spot, and proceeded up the hill to",
  "the site where people had been gathered around the bonfire the night",
  "before. I knew there would be a good aura up there. (T0:00)",
  "As a bit of background information, I've been having a mild identity",
  "crisis over the past few months. A lot of my friendships had changed",
  "suddenly, and I found myself more alone than I'd ever been. I realized",
  "at this point that I had been defining myself too much by the people I",
  "was associating with, and, in the absence of them, I wasn't entirely",
  "sure who I was, where I was, or even why I was alive. It was very",
  "disconcerting, to say the least.",
  "The embers of the bonfire of the night before were still smoldering",
  "when I arrived, and about ten of my fellow early morning trippers had",
  "been drawn up here as well. They were all sitting around it, smiling,",
  "sometimes talking sporadically, but mostly just relaxing and being",
  "generally amicable towards the world. I'd never met any of these",
  "people before, but the seemed friendly enough.",
  "A kid in glasses and an all-over print t-shirt welcomed me over. This",
  "was the first time I'd seen the camp in the daytime, and I must say,",
  "it is beautiful beyond description. It was a perfect day. Clear, blue",
  "sky with a warm sun beating down its pure energy onto us. The",
  "greenest, softest grass I'd ever seen encircled the fire like a",
  "carpet, stretching away into the woods at the bottom of the",
  "hill. Birds were flying in an unbelievable dance of life far above us,",
  "as the fire crackled in what I thought was a wise and especially",
  "soothing manner. I was definitely beginning to feel the effects of the",
  "drug now. (T+0:30-0:40)",
  "All of my previous trips have been with tryptamine compounds, and what",
  "I found is that, if 2C-B is any indication, phenethylamines are much",
  "more pleasant. Much warmer, much friendlier, less 'glitchy', and with",
  "less distracting visual activity. That's not to say the visual",
  "activity is not there. If anything, it was much more intense than with",
  "other drugs I've tried. However, I was able to ignore it much more",
  "easily. It wasn't as mesmerizing as what I would see on, for",
  "example, LSD. This was a good thing, as it lets me focus more on my",
  "soul, which is what I came here to do.",
  "When it finally arrived, after maybe 45 minutes, The come-up was fast",
  "and fairly intense; almost overwhelming. I felt the energy of it",
  "washing over me in waves, and it felt amazing. If I had been in a more",
  "neutral or hostile setting, things probably would have been",
  "frightening at this point, but I knew that everyone around me",
  "understood, and was supportive of my state of mind. This made it much",
  "easier to bare my soul, and slip into a pleasant state of openness and",
  "unity with my surroundings. (T+0:40-1:00)",
  "Before I had been there thirty minutes, the kid in the glasses and an",
  "old hippie got together with a guitar and a drum, and started playing",
  "music. It started off rough, and before long the kid admitted that he",
  "was 'too fucked up on mushrooms' to be playing guitar well. Everyone",
  "laughed in that kind of spaced-out way, they switched instruments, and",
  "then proceeded to play the most beautiful music I've ever heard. The",
  "trees swayed, the wind blew, the birds swooped and dove in intricate",
  "patterns, and it seemed as though the whole valley was dancing to the",
  "beat of our collective soul.",
  "Colors ... are amazing. Acid never did the colors thing for me, but on",
  "this ... the grass was the greenest green I have ever seen. I'll never",
  "forget it, as long as I'm alive. The world is a beautiful place, if",
  "only you can eliminate your bias and stop filtering the beauty through",
  "your worldview for a moment. I am in love with this place.",
  "The birds ... its almost as if they act as a single organism, some",
  "kind of a pseudo-hive mind. Every one of them has a soul, but,",
  "together, they are something greater. Something ... beyond ... mere",
  "birds. They are a collective. WE are a collective. We are at peace.",
  "It was quickly apparent that 2C-B is also much more of an intoxicant",
  "than LSD is, at least for me. My memory was dramatically affected, and",
  "somehow in-sync with the waves of energy crashing over my",
  "consciousness. The rest of the trip was superimposed upon sets of",
  "clearly-defined waves of beauty, awareness, and clarity. It was as if",
  "I was in a movie, and, at points, I would suddenly 'awaken' in a new",
  "place, as if a cutscene or transition had taken place. I was fully",
  "sane, conscious, and aware in the intervening time, and I remember it",
  "clearly, but it's not nearly as important as when I was on the crest",
  "of a wave of energy. Its as if I was coming to orgasmic revelations,",
  "every twenty minutes or so.",
  "I remember clearly, at the peak of my come-up, two older clean-shaven",
  "men came over and sat down around the campfire with us. For some",
  "reason, it was obvious to me that they were undercover cops. Looking",
  "back, I'm not sure if they actually were. However, a man in camoflogue",
  "came over to the campfire, talking in a walkie-talkie, convincing me",
  "beyond a doubt that we were surrounded by some kind of undercover SWAT",
  "team.",
  "He reached down behind a log where a kid was sitting, and picked up a",
  "bag of weed. 'What's this?'  he said. 'Will you please stand up, sir?'",
  "I was sure that we were getting busted, and was really high at this",
  "point, so it was kind of starting to freak me out. But, it turns out,",
  "the guy was just selling weed. 'Crappy weed is what it is. Nugget",
  "delivery service!' he said. 'Somebody buy some nuggets!' I didn't see",
  "or hear about anyone get arrested during the entire festival. The guys",
  "that I suspected were cops even smoked some of the pot with us. (T+1:30)",
  "As I started to come down from the crest of my first wave, I wandered",
  "away from the campfire, and walked down 'Shakedown Street', the place",
  "where all the vendors are set up. Everyone's face was severely",
  "distorted, but not in a menacing way. It was an obvious drug effect,",
  "so it didn't cause me much worry. The people didn't seem to notice",
  "that I was tripping, or just simply didn't care. I felt a strange",
  "benevolence towards everyone, tinged with a hint of suspisciousness,",
  "as I still suspected there were more undercover cops around here,",
  "somewhere. I didn't have anything on me, so it wasn't a fear, but",
  "rather an understandable delusion that I held for twenty minutes or",
  "so. There probably were cops around there, with all the drug",
  "trafficking going on. However, I recognized it as a drug-induced",
  "delusion, and brushed it off before I left Shakedown.",
  "Eventually, I ended up by the creek that runs through the bottom of",
  "the valley. It's nothing like the creeks from my home state, all muddy",
  "and brown. No, this one was perfectly, unbelievably clear, like in a",
  "dream. Three more dudes were sitting by the creekside playing drums,",
  "and again, it seemed like they were playing to the beat of the",
  "river. Through the music, it seemed to me that they had uncovered the",
  "secret heartbeat of nature. Why hadn't I heard this before? (T+2:00)",
  "I sat there for nearly two hours, in the sun, listening to the drums,",
  "the river, and watching the golden spiderwebs of the morning sky dance",
  "across the perfectly clear water. I bathed in the radiance of the",
  "heartbeat, its warm, pulsating waves. The energy of that time was",
  "absolutely amazing.",
  "I find that, personally, with the exception of Ayahuasca, the 'comeup'",
  "of psychedelics in general is not nearly as useful, in terms of",
  "introspection, as the 'comedown'. That is, the comeup is more",
  "enjoyable, but, if I take anything away from the experience, I'm going",
  "to learn it while descending back to sobriety. That turned out to be",
  "especially true with this substance. During the last four hours or so,",
  "I spent a lot of time wandering around, both in the campground, and in",
  "my mind.",
  "I realized that my identity crisis was more an issue of where I was",
  "derived from. That is, I need to be part of a collective, a culture,",
  "perhaps, or a group of friends, but I cannot be OF that culture. Much",
  "like the flock of birds on the hill, I need to enter into it,",
  "independently, as a developed person, and bring something new to",
  "it. Any other way, I would either be defined by cultural norms, or an",
  "outcast. I need to push out my identity to those around me, rather",
  "than pulling in theirs. This was my problem, and the realization of",
  "this greatly settled my soul, and still does, as I write this more",
  "than a month later.",
  "After the sun had ascended so far into the sky that I could no longer",
  "justify calling this a 'perfect morning', I ended up back at the",
  "campsite of the people who had sold me the 2C-B. They were rolling up",
  "a blunt. Perfect. Everything had that shiny, plastic sheen of order,",
  "yet identity, about it. They invited me over to smoke. It was a",
  "wonderful, communal experience. I felt close with everything. I had a",
  "very intense feeling of having arrived home, at long last. (T+4:20)",
  "There was what seemed to be an extremely long period of intoxication,",
  "after the main effects had ended. This may or may not have been a",
  "product of all the marijuana I had smoked over the course of the day,",
  "though I suspect it was not. I had the same 'waves of energy' feeling,",
  "but without any of the visual activity, or really anything other than",
  "a mild feeling of drunkenness. It was not unpleasant in the slightest,",
  "but it did seem to go on well past the peak of the experience. I was",
  "just confused as to how I could still feel like I was tripping hard,",
  "but without any kind of visuals at all.",
  "I finally was completely sober around 3 or 4 PM. The world retained",
  "its beauty, however, and, strangely, the grass retained its surreal",
  "green color. Even today, I will occasionally come across a",
  "particularly green patch of grass in the morning or evening, with the",
  "sun falling across it just right, and I will again be overwhelmed with",
  "the beauty of the world.",
  "All in all, I think this was hands-down the best trip of my life. I",
  "didn't learn as much from this substance as I did from Ayahuasca, and",
  "it wasn't nearly as intense as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, but,",
  "rather, a soft, warm day spent in paradise. I'm glad I had the",
  "opportunity to experience this. Highly recommended."
