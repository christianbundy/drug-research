  "I find the active dose for this stuff is in the grams-- So why not insufflate it to get around that pesky first-pass metabolism?",
  "Famous last words.",
  "If you bother to look at the structure or just say the name out loud, you will notice that it is of course a phenyl-substituted gamma-aminobutyric ACID.",
  "It was confirmed to be Painfully Acidic by bioassay, and Pretty Damn Acidic by some ancient pH paper. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to blow it back out which was hindered by nasal passages that had immediately swollen up so as to prevent further airflow. Apparently my nose didn't trust me after that little stunt.",
  "At least I didn't begin by plugging!",
  "Psychopharm bioassays are rendered inconclusive by other drugs, days of sleep deprivation, and mild insanity resulting from too much science. But seems pleasant enough."
