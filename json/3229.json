  "I have read many reports here about Kava. It seems that there are many people who have tried but not experienced the wonders of this plant. I believe that this is usually due to an insufficient dosage. When I looked for a good source of Kava, I came across a product that contains 900 mg of kavalactones (the active chemical in Kava) per capsule. Though somewhat expensive, I ordered this product for my first experience.",
  "I had been somewhat depressed over a failed relationship. A good friend of mine, Adam, came to visit me from out of town. He also had just been involved in a failed relationship. I was hoping that Kava might be a good healing herb. The second day of his visit, we awoke somewhat late from a night of drinking. The day was flawless...about 75 degrees and sunny with almost no humidity. I figured that the Kava might be a good daytime experience. I was right. We started with 2 capsules each. After about a half hour, I decided to take a shower. This is when I began to notice the first effects. I first noticed an elevation in my mood. I was rediculously happy to be in the shower! I then began to feel very mentally and physically relaxed. All of the issues that had been hampering me seemed to be fading away. I felt sort of 'stoned'...but not quite like a marijuana stone. When I got out of the shower, I asked Adam if he was getting any effects. He stated that he wasn't quite sure. In order to bring him to my level, we each took one more capsule. He went to take a shower.",
  "When he emerged from the bathroom, he was in a very similar state of mind as myself...like there was nothing that could possibly bother us!",
  "We spent the rest of the afternoon sitting in the courtyard in front of my house. We just talked and laughed, enjoying the beautiful day. Adam is a smoker, so I bought myself a box of clove cigarettes to accompany him in this ritual. We were completely happy and at peace with ourselves. All of the issues that had us depressed were discussed light-heartedly. We both noticed that the effects of Kava seems to come in 'waves'...one minute you will feel totally normal, but after a few minutes you are engulfed in a wave of Kava bliss. It was a very memorable experience.",
  "Since this experience, I have tried Kava a few other times. I have noticed that the setting greatly affects the experience. Basically, it is best to be in a relaxed setting without much commotion. Lots of activity in the general vicinity can be almost irritating and takes away from the experience.",
  "In conclusion, I love Kava. It is a wonderful and healing plant. I would highly recommend the experience to anyone, especially those whose problems need a different perspective."
