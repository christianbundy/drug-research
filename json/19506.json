 "report": [
  "I was at my GP's for ingrown toenail, when after conversing on that topic, I informed him I had difficulty sleeping and did not want over the counter sleeping remedies such as 'Nytol' which are apparently addictive. So he prescribed me melatonin. It took a while for the pharmacy to stock it but after a week they had it in. I took it home and at about 9pm one night I took one 3mg capsule.",
  "The effects were quite noticable. There was a severe tiredness, an urge to close the eyes. But there was more, my body still had the energy to go places and move, but I could'nt move. I was sleepy and I tried to get up and found even moving was quite a challenge. So I lay down on my bed and drifted off. I had a few capsules left the other day so me and my friend tried something different. We emptied the contents of two capsules (6mg) into a joint (We refer to it as a joint because it was tobacco and melatonin, not cannabis) and smoked it. The joint was very sweet and the effects of the melatonin arrived quick and powerful, things were slow and there was again a very severe urge to sleep."
