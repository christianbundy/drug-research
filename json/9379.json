 "report": [
  "I'd done a little research into so called natural highs and I settled on a mix of herbs that I picked up at a local herb and tincture shop. My first intention was to smoke this mix, which indeed i did, with little effect. It tasted fine but there was no high at all. My next throught was to brew it in a tea.",
  "After the first cup of this mix, a woody strong flavor but not unpleasant once you get used to it, I started to feel it. Not as heavy or strong as I had hoped but the feeling was definitely relaxing. It made me a bit sleepy and really lay back.",
  "I also noticed that when I did go to sleep it helped me have a deeper more relaxing sleep than I usually have.",
  "I definitely recommend it.",
  "PS: It had a nice side effect. I have asthma and this tea blend did a really great job of easing that up a good deal, moreso than regular tea."
