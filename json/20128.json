 "report": "<p>I took heroin for the first time about three years ago. I have been already taking methadone and a opium tea so when my friend came with a proposition to try something else I agree. As the needle touched my skin all my fears were gone. I've no longer been a scared, lost and lonely little girl with nothing to say. I became a god. I can't say that it was good or bad, it just was. Something like a death I guess. I can't resist it. And I was a god for a next few years while everything around me fell apart.</p><p>But the most important thing is that now, when I am clean for about a three months I just don't know how to live in the real world. I am depressed, I don't know how to function in the every day life with people who are near me. I am scared of life, even more scared than ever before.</p>",
