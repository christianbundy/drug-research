  "<p>I started using Piracetam about 2 months ago and have noticed positive effects.",
  "I started with an  Attack Dose  of 4800mg (6 caps) for the first 3 days then dropped back to 2400mg in 3 divided doses during the day. At first I felt nothing but it was about a week into my usage I went to the doctor and when asked for my health care card I reeled off the 10 digit number off the top of my head  something I could not usually do. This surprised me so I thought of my licence number ( which I previously didnt look at all that much ) and remembered it, I checked my licence and I was correct. My car rego number  didnt know it previously but could recall it now, I checked and again I was right.",
  "I want to stress that piracetam is not an Instant Einstein pill, but they do, in my experience, have positive effects on memory and strangely vocabulary.",
  "I tried taking 2400mg (3caps) in the morning and 2 at lunch and another 2 in the late afternoon for a week and noticed the emotionless spock type feeling others have experienced. Also at this dose I couldnt remember things well. For example, at work I would be told there would be a discharge in room 16c, 2 minutes later I would have to check again which room because I forgot. Went back to 2800mg 2-3 times daily and this has stopped and Im not so emotionless.",
  "On another note I saw a report that piracetam does not decrease the effects of downers, opiates etc. I would definitely disagree. I use a cocktail of opiates, opioids and benzodiazepines Very regularly (almost daily) and have found if I take piracetam shortly before or any time after it does diminish the effects of these drugs greatly. On a positive note, if I start to get cold, clammy and sweaty because Ive taken a couple too many trams or oxys etc I take some piracetam and within 30 minutes the feeling has gone, so has the high to a great extent : ( . Maybe there could be benefits for mild opiate/ opioid overdose with piracetam?</p>"
