 "report": [
  "I took roughly 20mg DIPT (mixed 1g very well with 5tsp flour, then took 1/8 tsp) at 1:00am. I should mention that I take 10mg paroxetine (paxil) daily.",
  " Effects came on in 45 minutes. All sounds slowly acquired a low pitch, I didn't even notice at first, because I started watching a film I'd never seen before right as it kicked in, and didn't realize that the voices were wrong. Only when I spoke did I notice. It was quite remarkable.",
  " It got stronger over about an hour, with a few slight visual distortions (lights seemed to flicker a bit, vague geometric patterns, distances were hard to judge accurately, and the whole room seemed small when I stood up.)",
  " Music was at first hard to listen too. But after a few minutes, it became like listening to my favorite songs for the very first time, noticing things that I'd never noticed before.",
  " It took a very long time to tune my guitar, because I was hypersensitive to even the slightest bit of dissonance, playing was very interesting, but singing along wasn't difficult. (Next time I should record it and see how good/bad it sounds afterwards.)",
  " So I expected it too only last 8 hours at the most, and I went to sleep with much difficulty at 6 hours.",
  " Much too my surprise, I awoke 6 hours later with about 3/4 the full effects. Noticable deepening of pitch lasted until at least 21 hours after ingestion."
