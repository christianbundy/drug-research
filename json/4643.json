 "report": [
  "<p>I first brewed 5 grams of dried sinicuichi in two cups of water for half an hour.  While the tea was brewing, I ate ten caps of psilocybin cubensis.  After eating the caps, I smoked a 1 gram joint of sinicuichi.  The caps were down at 7:15pm, the sinicuichi joint at 7:20pm.  The bitter sinicuichi tea was drunk at 7:30.  The mushroom stem tea, brewed for 10 minutes, was drunk at 7:45pm.",
  "I had fasted all day, since sinicuichi and mushrooms are best felt on an empty stomach.  I felt initial effects by 8:00pm.  At that point I began lesurely smoking my expensive high-grade weed.  The sinicuichi and the mushrooms combined together to create another type of buzz, one that was neither siniccuichi nor mushroom nor what one would think a combination of the two.  Instead, the buzz seemed similer to LSD, but with notably 'mushroom' visuals.  The initial effects---breathing of space, wavy vision, loss of motor coordination, slight auditory distortion, heavy thought distortion---felt by 8:15pm, would become much stronger.  At the peak of the trip, the visuals became so generally intense, things became so difficult to look at that I had to shut down most of the lighting.  My ears had become so sensitive I had to unplug my stereo, and my equilibrium was so fucked i couldn't be vertical without holding on to something for support.  The silence eventually lent itself to full auditory hallucinations of psychadelic rock, lasting for about two hours. ",
  "The visuals---breathing, flashing patterns, llilputian hallucination---had become so overloading that I was now in bed with my eyes closed, and experiencing the radical infinity of time space---that certain point about ten yards down from full ego-death where the vastness of eternity seems graspable.",
  "I found that, whenever I could move, if I smoked a bong hit or two I would immediately have to lay down again, and the trip itself would increase tenfold.  Thus sinicuichi seems to have a symbiotic effect with other natural psychadelics.  Weed becomes intensely strong, while the visual detail and intensity of the mushrooms is increased with the strength of buzz.  IThis combination gives that certain kick too much LSD gives without the manic hysteria.  Also note that setting is extremely important---the music I listen to will alter the shape of the headbuzz.  Amyl butinol seems to eat the entire trip for 30 seconds before returning me to it, and overrides all other substances in the brain at that moment.",
  "The sensitiveity to weed enabled some amount of direct control of the trip. Consequently, even though the peak was gone by 11:00pm, I was able to jump it back up however I wanted it for another two hours---long enough to catch Red Dwarf---.  This means that total time to peak was an hour after consuming the last of the mushroom tea, so about 90 mins from initial mushroom consumption with the method.  The total peak time was about 150 mins.  The trip is mellow, but extremely intense.  There was a complex blend of tactile, auditory, and visual euphoria, almost similar to MDMA.  The next day had little to no hangover, but a respectable amount of lethargy.  Unfortunately, most of the peak seems to be a complete blank, so memory loss does occur at this dosage level.  Sinicuichi + psilocybin + cannabis seems to equal sinicuichi x2 + psilocybin x2 + cannabis x5, and this should be borne in mind when attempting sinicuichi with any other combinations.",
  "Even though the sinicuichi tea is not pleasant to drink, it gives that added bang to the buck.  Its even possible that topping up with either tea os smoked sinicuichi would extend the mushroom peak indefinately, but I lacked the desire to try this, having achieved psychadelic contentment at the time.  Also bear in mind that the dosage levels here---6 grams sinicuichi, 10 psilocybin cubensis, and 2 grams cannabis, seem to be at least twice needed for more than ample effects in everyone I know except myself.  Please bear this in mind if attempting to mimmick the dosage.</p>"
