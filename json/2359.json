 "report": "<p>This was far from my first time using cocaine... I'd had it perhaps 2 dozen times since 1990... but this time I decided to try and document the effects as they occured.</p><p>Nov. 23, 1997</p><p>-------------</p><p>11:27pm:</p><p>    I just cut out two medium-to-small sized lines of cocaine. I've</p><p>already had about 6 or 7 lines over the past 3 hours or so, the last</p><p>being a little over an hour ago. I smoked a bowl of pot about 45 minutes</p><p>ago, but its effects are pretty much unnoticeable, except maybe a slight</p><p>reduction in the edginess of the cocaine effects. I'm definately still</p><p>feeling the effects, although I'm in the come-down stage at present. The</p><p>next 2 lines should give me a pretty typical high-dose cocaine experience.</p><p>At present, I feel contradictorally wired and tired. I feel as if I could</p><p>fall asleep if I wanted, although from experience I know I couldn't yet. I</p><p>feel a warm fuzzy feeling all over my body, similar to the feeling of the</p><p>second wind you get when you stay up all night, but there is also a mild</p><p>feeling of stimulant tension. Euphoria has definately long since passed.</p><p>Cocaine makes me dehydrated, and this manifests itself primarily in the</p><p>feeling of dry mouth. I will frequently suck on my cheeks, trying to</p><p>salivate, I guess. It's not really a conscious thing. Its a bad thing,</p><p>actually, as it makes the dry mouth worse, and sometimes will leave my</p><p>mouth feeling uncomfortable the next day. I'm going to finish my</p><p>cigarette, then do these lines.</p><p>11:33pm:</p><p>    I snort the lines, and immediately feel both euphoria, and a</p><p>passing urge to get the rest of my coke out and do more. I get the urge to</p><p>smoke a cigarette, so I do. The high intensifies for a minute or two then</p><p>levels. I'm mildly euphoric, but very stimulated. Its a distinct</p><p>stimulation, more like amphetamines than caffeine. But definately</p><p>different. There is a mild anesthetic property, mainly concentrated in my</p><p>mouth and nose, and a generalized tingly, warm sensation. I notice myself</p><p>typing alot harder, but pausing more between sentences. The urge to smoke</p><p>my cigarette is overwhelming. There is a warm feeling along my spine.</p><p>Mentally, I feel both calm and stimulated, somewhat paradoxically. If</p><p>there were people here, I'd be talkative.</p><p>11:38pm:</p><p>    I am feeling a barely perceptible decrease in the high, and decide</p><p>to stop typing for a little bit to enjoy it, probably with another</p><p>cigarette. The urge to do more coke occasionally pops into my mind but</p><p>then leaves just as quickly.</p><p>11:53pm:</p><p>    I went and smoked a cigarette, and alternated (quite frequently)</p><p>between walking around my room smoking it, sitting on the edge of my bed,</p><p>and putting down the cigarette to lay down and close my eyes. Laying down,</p><p>I felt very calm, and as if my body were floating. The peak wore off</p><p>gradually, and not evenly. I would alternate between feeling come-down</p><p>effects and peak effects, with the come-down periods becoming longer and</p><p>more frequent.</p><p>    The euphoria is mostly gone now, and the thoughts of doing more</p><p>coke are a little more frequent and longer, but are nowhere near</p><p>irresistable. Simply being aware of the craving seems to make it go away.</p><p>I took a multivitamin just now, which I always do before bed anytime I do</p><p>any drugs outside of my usual ones (pot, tobacco, and caffeine). It</p><p>generally reduces day-after fatigue. The stimulation is still quite</p><p>strong, and more amphetamine-like, although it is beginning to fade into</p><p>the post-peak mellowness of cocaine. I am almost back to the point I was</p><p>when I began writing this.</p><p>    Physically, the dry-mouth has become more noticable again. My</p><p>lungs feel sort of grimy from smoking too many cigarettes (cocaine tends</p><p>to make me chain smoke), and my nasal passages feel somewhat clogged and</p><p>sore from doing coke all night. I snorted a few drops of warm water to</p><p>help clear out my nose, which helped significantly. I can still</p><p>occasionally taste cocaine in the back of my throat if I snort or breath</p><p>deeply through my nose.</p><p>12:05am:</p><p>    I'm basically back to where I was at the beginning now. I feel</p><p>calm and quiet. I don't really feel bad, although there have been times</p><p>when I've felt quite depressed and physically worn when I've done alot of</p><p>cocaine in a short time. I feel physically worn out, and mentally a little</p><p>tired, but its definately not a bad thing - basically like being</p><p>overtired, despite the fact that I know I could not fall asleep right now.</p><p>I've probably done about 1/2 gram over the course of about 4 hours, which</p><p>although is alot, is nowhere near the most I've done; that would probably</p><p>be about 1.5 grams over 2 or 3 hours. Aside from the two lines I did while</p><p>writing this, I used the cocaine in a social setting tonight, with a girl</p><p>and a guy I'm friends with. Its when doing it alone that I'll sit there</p><p>and do line after line until it's gone or I just can't take anymore.</p><p>    I plan on smoking a small bowl of pot to relax, and write a little</p><p>more. I'm going to take a 3mg melatonin tablet and probably a shot of</p><p>tequila before I go to bed, to counteract the stimulant effect that would</p><p>keep me from sleeping. I'll still probably be unable to sleep for about an</p><p>hour, perhaps more, but it will definately help, though it will probably</p><p>make me groggier tomorrow.</p><p>    Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but not outstandingly so.</p><p>Cocaine simply isn't my drug of choice. I'm glad I did it, but it'll</p><p>probably be a while before I do it again.</p><p>12:16am:</p><p>    I take my melatonin, and take a hit off my bowl. This experiment</p><p>is at an end.</p>",
