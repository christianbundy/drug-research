 "report": [
  "I'm 21 years old and by no means have trouble performing in the bedroom.  However, I saw on a news magazine show that many herbs really can boost sexual performance.  So I decided to do some investigating.",
  "I was casually strolling through my local pharmacy when I stumbled across a bottle of yohimbe.  It was on sale to my surprise.  Buy one get one even!  That was a deal I couldn't pass up.  I got 2 bottles of 135 500mg capsules for ten bucks.",
  "Before consuming any of the pills I did a little research.",
  "The recommended dosage on the bottle stated 3 caps a day with meals.  However, I found in my research many other brand of yohimbe recommending up to 2000mg in a single dose.  I figured somewhere in between would be safe.",
  "I took 2 capsule with about 12 oz. of water to help the coating on the caps dissolve more quickly.  I then waited 30 minutes.  I called my girlfriend to see if she could come over but she was working.  Disappointed, I engaged in some self-stimulation and got an erection that made me feel like I was built from steel.",
  "The effects peaked about 2 hours after I initially took the caps and slowly tapered off to my normal, healthy libido after another 2 hours.  Needless to say, I was impressed.",
  "I tried the same dosage later that night when my girlfriend was off from work.  She told me she noticed a difference in my energy levels among other things (alright!).",
  "The only unpleasant side effects I encountered were some mild abdominal cramps and I became quite flushed toward the end of our encounter."
