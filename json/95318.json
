 "report": "<p>Preface: I take 200mg of Lamotrigine daily when I wake. for a mood instability disorder. I also take 100mg of 5-HTP daily, as well as a complex multivitamin, and sometimes extra supplements of Zinc, Vitamin B Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E. I am a type 1 diabetic and insulin dependent.</p><p>My past experiences include cannabis, alcohol, Salvia Divinorum, 2C-E, 2C-I-NBOMe, MDMA, mixed amphetamine salts, methylphenidate, ethylphenidate, modafinil, alprazolam, 4-fluoroamphetamine, MDPV, DXM, and DPH. I have also been prescribed Bupropion in the past.</p><p>My goal was to use 4-FA instead of MDMA (since I had none of the latter) to supplement my first 2C-B experience. The intent was to cruise on 4-FA for a few hours at a party, then take 2C-B and continue to party.</p><p>T -8:30: I take my 200mg of Lamotrigine and my vitamins.</p><p>T -3:00: I take some ethylphenidate, not as part of my attempted experience.</p><p>T +0:00: I take 100mg of 4-FA at home.</p><p>T +0:30: I feel like I am rolling. My entire body feels tingly and warm and I am very chatty.</p><p>T +1:00: I consider the euphoria to be greater than 100mg of MDMA provides, but the empathy is lesser. I am also very horny. I leave home and visit some friends, where I have two drinks and chat for a while.</p><p>T +1:30: I decide to bump with 10mg of 4-FA intranasally to provide a rush. After doing so, I feel incredibly thirsty, probably because of the stimulation and having had a few drinks.</p><p>T +2:00: I still feel like I am rolling, much to my surprise. I walk to another friend's place and stay there for a few minutes, then return home to prepare for the party.</p><p>T +2:30: I arrive at the party and I have a few more drinks. My euphoria begins to decline, but I am still warm and chatty.</p><p>T +3:00: My euphoria is mostly gone and I no longer feel like I am rolling. I feel simply stimulated. Still chatty and warm. I consume no more alcohol.</p><p>T +3:10: I decide that since my 4-FA peak has ended, it is time to take 2C-B.</p><p>T +3:30: My entire body begins to tingle. Instead of the speedy and rolling tingling of 4-FA, I feel a more slow tingle. I realize that I am feeling a body high from 2C-B. The tingling starts in my feet and legs and works its way up, in waves much like those on the shore of a beach. At first it is subtle, then it becomes hard to ignore.</p><p>T +4:00: I feel like I am receiving fellatio on my entire body. I don't have any visual effects at all, but I am in such overwhelming physical pleasure that I simply stop being able to chat and dance. I stand in corners and make orgasm faces uncontrollably. My body feels melty as well. Physical contact with women is miraculous and I want sex badly, but I am too incoherent to attract the opposite sex. Hugs from both sexes are pleasant, however.</p><p>T +4:30: Visual effects start. I see silhouettes behind objects and coronas around the edge of objects. Colors become somewhat more vibrant. There was a light show and it was completely enthralling, but blinking lights were overstimulating and had the effect of making me confused. Walls have the appearance of melting. I see tiny ripples of rainbows, especially as CEVs. However, all of these visuals are mild and do not convince me that reality has changed. I also begin to experience a very interesting physical effect upon others touching me. Their touch seems to linger on my skin.</p><p>At this point I start to become so overwhelmed by the physical pleasure that I forgot to keep a timed log. However, my body high continued to climb until T+5:45, at which point I was able to keep a log again. I also found that I was unable to keep a beat, making dancing even more uncomfortable. I experienced slightly heightened empathy, but for the most part I was not more outgoing than normal. My sense of touch becomes enhanced to the point that I become convinced that I can communicate through my tactile sense for a short while. Additional visual effects included more blurring and shifting.</p><p>T +5:45: I begin to come down and find that I am more able to communicate normally since I am not being overwhelmed by physical pleasure. I begin to feel a bit nauseous, but not terribly. Flashing lights no longer stun me. I feel peaceful and placated.</p><p>T +6:00: I begin to feel dissatisfied, since the duration of my experience had been shorter than I expected. I also did not find any enlightenment or connection in this experience. I recognized that I might have dulled my trip with alcohol, or that 4-FA might not have been the ideal lead. My tactile senses are still heightened, but I find that visuals are reduced and that I can keep a beat again.</p><p>T +6:15: I experience a strange visual effect suddenly. I see flashes or lingering images of people's faces in objects that are in my peripheral vision. Some of these faces seem familiar, and I can name one of them as one of my friends. I see girls hugging each other and people smiling. These flashes happen only for a split second. One particular facial canvas was my shoe as I tied it. My muscles begin to stiffen and I have a few twitches, but nothing serious.</p><p>T +6:30: I notice that I am seeing vision trails after using the bathroom. The ripples of the water extend out of the bowl. Colors are still vibrant, and they become more saturated. I feel lonely. I experience light bruxism and feel malaise, and I sweat excessively. I return home to watch Futurama and lay on the couch, trying to get my mind off my loneliness. Upon laying down I realize that I am drowsy.</p><p>T +6:45: My eyelids are heavy and I feel the drug forcing me to sleep. When I doze off, I begin to have very profound visions and dreams, but I am woken by my roommate within 2 minutes and can't remember what I saw.</p><p>T +7:00: I try to sleep actively now, but I experience strange thoughts. I see my thoughts as a list on paper in my mind upon closing my eyes, but they shift in size, as if they were displayed in a browser and zoomed out and zoomed in. I feel a bit confused, and as I drift in and out of dreamspace, I realize that dreamspace is more surreal than it has ever been in my life. I closed my eyes and traveled to another world. The ideas in my head as I rest with my eyes closed become incredibly realisitc, as if they have manifested themselves physically.</p><p>All in all, I found that 2C-B was loving to me but I put myself in the wrong setting and perhaps gave myself the wrong mix of substances. I did not experience deep connections nor did I 'trip.' I enjoyed the stimulation and physical pleasure, but I felt unable to meet people. Not that I was anxious to meet people, but I realized that I was so incoherent and seemed so strung out that I was off-putting to strangers. It didn't depress me, but it was a definite drawback. I would have much preffered to have had MDMA instead of 4-FA, and to have had sex that night.</p><p>The day after, my throat was sore, my mood was sobered, my muscles were stiff, and my blood glucose was low. I did not feel fried, however, which reassures me about neurotoxicity. I take 100mg of 5-HTP and within 6 hours my normal cheery mood has returned.</p>",
