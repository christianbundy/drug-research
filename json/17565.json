  "T-0:00- One bowl of skullcap smoked.",
  "T+0:05- Took 5mg of ambien, slight effects from skullcap noticable.",
  "T+0:10- Feeling quite wavy, but that is a normal effect from skullcap.",
  "T + 0:23 - Not really much different effects, just sort of a wavyness, felling sort of tired.",
  "T + 0:32 - Feeling very very spacey and very very tired, I got very frightened by a commercial for a scary movie. Also forgot to mention that I did a shot of straight gin about 30 minutes before the initial dosing. Considering going to sleep, school in the morning.",
  "T + 0:40 - Feel very happy, not as tired. I'm putting a movie on and laying down. Typing is somewhat of a challange.",
  "T + 1:00 -I seem to be coming down already, I'm still as tired as I was, but there is no more happyness or wavy feelings.",
  "I think that Ambien could be a wonderful drug to experiment with, but I don't think my dose was quite high enough, or maybe the skullcap or alcholol interfeared with the effects."
