 "report": [
  "On 9/14/99 @ 5:30 pm, I snorted ~7mg of alpha methyl diisopropyltryptamine. Slight effects were noticable by about 6pm. At 6:30, slight stimulation was evident similar to AMT. AT 7:30 definite speediness, no visuals, ate dinner, food seemed to taste slightly metallic.",
  "At 8:30, still speedy, but no anticholinergic effects noted. 9:30, went to bed, read until 10:30. Slept fitfully. Arose @ 6:30 am with no apparent after effects. Conclusions: comes on slower than DPT, feels similar to AMT, has a short action.",
  "7mg does not appear to be an effective dose."
