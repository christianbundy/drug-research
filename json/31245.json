 "report": "<p>As an insomniac and suffering from depression, I had been looking for something non-prescription and non-chemical to help me sleep. Eventually, I tried the regular 150 mg regular dose of Valerian extract. I was on this regularly for about 3 weeks or so, and I started to notice that it put me into REM sleep, and I was feeling nice in the mornings and dreaming at night, something which I hadn't done for about three years. It wasn't so much that Valerian put me to sleep as it was that it mellowed me out.</p><p>One night, after taking 150mg, and still not being able to sleep, I went and took another 150mg pill. I thought for a second and then popped two more and went back to bed. The experience was a little weak, but it was like having smoked some decent Cannabis Indica, mellow, relaxing, and overall just good. That night I slept the whole night without waking once, and had vivid dreams that I still remember to this day.</p>",
