 "report": "<p>I'd like to share my experiences on the above combination.</p><p>Taking 5HTP with speed tends to make the body rushes more intense and me less 'wired' and anxious than speed alone. An odd side effect is I tend to go to the toilet more often (number 2). Speed alone puts me in a 'study' kind of mood when I take it on my own, but this does something else. The body rushes feel like something between a sexual climax and being in 'limerance' - the lustful, passionate feelings at the beginning of relationships. This lasts for about 5 hours, tapering off a few hours later.</p><p>Let me warn you that this experience is not for those with weak self-control. After trying it a few times, I was hooked and it took the best part of a year to break the habit. Very addictive. I don't want to encourage others to try this, as it will probably  cause more harm than good in the long run. Try it at your own risk.</p>",
