 "report": "<p>I bought some herbal cigarettes that were basically a concoction of damiana, wild lettuce, catnip, and passion flower. Before buying them I read up on some of the ingredients and some were said to have mild sedative effects. The effects are not really noticable if you are driving or are busy with something, but I noticed effects when I was listening to some chilled out music and just relaxing. The effects were nowhere near strong and only lasted a matter of minutes. Definitely very very MILD sedatives. That's about it.</p>",
