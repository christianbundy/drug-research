 "report": "<p>After quitting a prescripted ssri for major depression, I started to use St. John's Wort to make sure I won't fall back into depression once again.</p><p>After several month of use I realized that not only my depression was gone, but my summertime - pollen allergies were also missing. (I didnt take any of my prescripted anti-histamins.)</p><p>I searched through the internet, but havent found any mentions of St. Johns Wort having any anti allergy properties, so I started an experiment: I stopped taking it and the next day the good old allergy set in. When I took the alcohol based, over the counter extract again I could feel my allergies diminishing in about a half an hour. The summer and fall passed and I didnt get any allergies again.</p><p>I found it very interesting and looking forward to next summer, when Im planning to experiment on my buddies with allergies also.</p>",
