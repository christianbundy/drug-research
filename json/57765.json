  "<p>I have been taking Adrafinil for the past 9 weeks and I am very impressed with the results.",
  "Anyway.",
  "I decided to do 20 20mg Adderall XR within a matter of 12 hours. I started at 4pm and ended up taking my last one at around 8am.",
  "So at around 12pm I was feeling psychotic and very drowsy.",
  "A research paper had to be done within 48 hours so I was losing it.  So thats when I thought of taking Adrafinil. I usually take 2 (600mg), but I thought I could go for three (900mg), just for shits and giggles.",
  "Having not eaten anything for 15 hours made the pills kick in around 30 minutes. When they did kick I had no more racing thoughts, no more drowsiness and no craving for more Adderall.",
  "The most amazing part was the mental clarity I had while writing that paper. I had just gone through 20 Adderall in one night and did not get any sleep. I was at least expecting some brain farts, but none surfaced.</p>"
