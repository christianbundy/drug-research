  "First off, I've been on drug testing for 6 months, and looking for ways to get high.  So I've been doing stuff WAY more dangerous than pot which I was put on drug testing for.  Parents should keep this in mind if they're thinking of drug testing their kids.",
  "Anyways...I remembered I had a can of this computer duster stuff, and tried it.  I immediately got REAALY dizzy, INTENSELY Dizzy, and my voice sounded like it had been taped and the recording slowed down.  Eveyrthing sounded really tinny, like a cheap reverb on a guitar amp.  It lasted for about 2 minutes.  It was mildly amusing.  I did it a few more times just to see. ",
  "I wouldn't recomend it to anybody.  The effects are NOT worth it, huffing is BAD.  Go to the store and get morning glory seeds (oh how i love them) cause inhalents are fucking dangerous.  Nothing super bad happened to me except a pain in my chest which is now gone, but seriously, DO NOT DO THIS!!"
