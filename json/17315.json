  "<p>During our night of partying we realized we had no ganja! We had consumed a considerable amount of cocaine. I had two shots and two glasses of champagne. I had just bought a lavendar plant a few days before. My friend suggested smoking it for some odd ball reason, and silly me I was so down to try! We all had small snaps out of our bong. It tasted delightful, a delicious after taste. I wasn't really sure of the effects but everyone agreed that it mellowed us out.</p>"
