  "<p>I purchased some of this rare and expensive herb, from a good source, who's website offers Sage Wisdom, along with their products.",
  "I had read elsewhere on the net, that boiling it in slightly acidic water, will help to extract the active ingredient. So, I added a little apple-cider vinegar, to a large plastic mug of about 20 oz. of water, and put it in the microwave until it was boiling. I then put some of the Lagochilus inebrians in a plastic tea strainer (holds about as much as a tea bag), put it into the mug, and then covered it for about 15 minutes. I then sat down and drank it slowly, because it was still very hot. The effects began about an hour later, and lasted about 4-5 hours. Inebriated is a good way to describe the way I felt. It wasnt bad at all, and left me very relaxed but alert, with no bad aftereffects. I slept well that night, and the next day, it seemed that I felt a bit more calm and relaxed than usual.",
  "However, the next weekend, I tried preparing it, and found no effects at all. After waiting for 3 hoursnothing. So, I tried again, with more herb. Four hours laternothing. I couldnt figure it out! Then I tried again, but this time, for every sip I took, I held it in my mouth for about a minute. Well, an hour later, and I was inebriated again! Ive read of other peoples failures with this herb, and thought that they just didnt get the real stuff, but now I think I understand what is the problem. The active ingredient is apparently absorbed sublingually!</p>"
