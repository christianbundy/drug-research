 "report": [
  "I had tried smoking Salvia leaves previously on 2 occasions and had subtle effects but no kind of breakthrough. I ordered some 10x extract and today my friend came over to sit for me while i smoked it. Before I tried Salvia divinorum I read hundreds of trip reports online, but nothing prepared me for how utterly strange and powerful the experience would be! Writing this report is so difficult !",
  "I sat on the grass in the garden and put a very small amount of the 10x extract in my pipe and smoked it with my butane lighter. I felt sensations in my legs and a sense of being led somewhere, so I packed a larger pinch of the stuff (really not very much) into the pipe, lit and inhaled. I got a good hit and held it in, i remember my mate saying 'there's another hit left after that one' and that is the last thing i remember before it HIT me. I don't recall exhaling.",
  "Everything was black and there was the sensation of falling backwards. The only way I can describe it is my consciouness felt like it was falling backwards and I had the thought 'OH MY GOD!!! THIS IS WHAT IT IS LIKE!!!' I felt the sensation of spiralling downwards and being hit on every side possibly by a spiral of multiple hands, but as i had completely just left my body it didn't seem to matter as i didn't interpret the sensations as pain or indeed as touch at all.",
  "According to my friend, as it hit me I fell backwards into some stuff in my garage (hence the feeling of falling and things hitting me) and ended up laying on the floor. This would correspond to what I was experiencing as I can vaguely remember having a sense of the wheel of my bike and the carpet being all around.",
  "It was as if I had forgotten everything! The weirdest feeling! I could sense my friend asking me if I was OK but it didn't make sense because although I felt I should respond to him I didn't know how to. There was the distinct sense that I had done something 'naughty', like I had been shown a secret that I wasn't supposed to know.",
  "I felt like there was a set of rules for this reality and I had forgotten them. I had forgotten the rules of reality. I was just a consciousness separated from my body. I had the sense that there was a secret that I had forgotten and I was trying hard to remember what it was. I eventually realised... I am a person and I have a life!",
  "There was a feeling of 'OH WHAT HAS HE DONE ?!' . I couldn't remember my life and I had the weird feeling that maybe I would be like this forever because I didn't remember I had smoked a drug. Now, I had read about others experiencing that but never thought it could happen to me.  It felt like what it would be like to be insane.",
  "I then reconnected with my body, I saw my life and it was like a suit that I slipped into. I had a feeling of something to do with my childhood.",
  "Being disconnected from my body was the peak of the trip and if I had smoked more I think that state would have lasted longer and perhaps I would have been shown more. I got up and this point, probably no more than 5 minutes after smoking and sat on the grass talking to my friend, I still felt as if what constitutes 'me' was in my head and I had nothing to do with the body that I was attached to.",
  "Slowly over the next 20-30 minutes I remembered bit-by-bit who I was and the life I live. It was very comforting!  While I was on the grass I laid back and looked at the clouds, they moved in geometric patterns, like cogs in a machine and seemed very much like whisps of gas.",
  "When I first came to I was aware that I had a body but couldn't remember the rules of reality properly, I remembered I had smoked Salvia which helped. It was kind of scary although I didn't freak out and kept reminding myself that the experience would be over in ten minutes or so. I kept repeating 'THIS IS SO WEIRD !'",
  "I have no memory of falling over and apparently I told my friend to leave me alone but I don't remember.",
  "The experience was like being reborn in a way because it was like rebuilding my life and piecing together what constitutes 'me' from the bottom up.",
  "Words cannot really come close to describing how strange this was. It was not what I would call a fun experience. However, it was certainly amazing. After I had smoked I told myself I will never do this again, but upon reflection I think that I may. However, I will approach the experience with much meditation beforehand and treat the Salvia with the enormous respect that it deserves.",
  "Use a sitter."
