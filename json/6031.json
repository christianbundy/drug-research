  "Setting: Quiet night in",
  "These capsules claim to produce an effect similar to that of magic mushrooms.",
  "10.00pm",
  "Took one capsule on an empty stomach. Very heavily under the influence of cannabis.",
  "10.30pm",
  "Took two more capsules.",
  "11.00pm",
  "Nothing had yet happened. Cannabis consumption continued.",
  "12.00am",
  "Still no effects.",
  "12.30am",
  "Still no effects. Ceased smoking cannabis.",
  "01.15am",
  "Ever so slight trailing(*) of lights.",
  "01.30am",
  "Sleepiness set in. Think this was due to the cannabis rather than the capsules",
  "(*)Trailing, as I mean it, is in the same sense as if someone waves a glowstick past your face when you're on MDMA. Only this was nowhere near as pronounced as it is on MDMA.",
  "Since that night I tried again with a full dose. I had not been smoking cannabis. They had no effect whatsoever. I do not have sufficient knowledge to propose whether or not there was an interaction between the capsules and the cannabis the first time, or whether cannabis consumption increases/decreases the effects.",
  "I wouldn't bother buying them again, I can get a fresh portion of shrooms for the same price anyway!"
