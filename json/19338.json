  "I brewed some tea with 2oz of galangal root following others' recipes. I ground it up in a coffee grinder and steeped the powdered root it in a french press with 2c boiled water for 15min. I consumed it all at once and experienced no effects. Nothing after 30min, 2hrs later....still nothing. No warmth, no visuals, nothing happened."
