  "I take these three medicines, as prescribed by my Psychiatrist, for severe depression. I take them exactly as prescribed.",
  "After I take the Seroquel at bedtime, I start to feel tired about three hours later. When I turn out the light I am treated to amazing visuals until I fall asleep. Crazy geometric shapes in different colors move around in my vision. I just think of this as a positive side effect from the medications I need to take to be mentally stable."
