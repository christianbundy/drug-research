  "This is the first smoking mix that I've tried that comes close to the real cannabis resin experience, and I've smoked a lot.",
  "Very subtle to start. Within 30 min graduates to a heavy indica type smoke - drowsy, chilled. Within 1 hour this is surpassed by a 'Leb Red' type high & euphoria. Very nice.",
  "No hangover but touch expensive and on reflextion I should made it 1g a joint to spread it out more.",
  "Overall I rate it very good."
