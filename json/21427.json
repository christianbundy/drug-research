 "report": "<p>Well, I did this when I was very young. I was simply interested.</p><p>This is beyond dangerous, aparently this is bordering on the fatal dose of nicotine! It was certainly very unpleasant.</p><p>Anyway, three 'regal' cigarettes were put in a tea-pot with some boilling water and left to brew for about 3 minutes.</p><p>The resulting tea was then drunk, it tasted very nice.</p><p>Then, for about 3 hours I experinced a form of agony. I had a powerfull aversion to light, I had to cover my eyes in a darkened room, there was also a horrible full body buzzing sensation and a mild headache.</p><p>Finally it all went away, and I have smoked ever since.</p><p>Regal makes me feel sick however.</p>",
