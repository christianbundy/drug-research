 "report": "<p>Smoked 1 bowl full of material in a water pipe. About 5 hits total. Smoked only the flesh scraped from red skin.</p><p>Felt effects almost immediately.  Very similar to marijuana.  At first more focused, but as I type this 30 minutes later I'm a little dizzier and losing ability to focus. </p><p>Sounds are enhanced.  Eyes are watering more than usual.  Getting a little jumpy.</p><p>Overall, nice effect, seems to be a nice substitute for marijuana.  Will definitely try again, probably blending with marijuana next time.</p>"
