  "There was a degree of uncertainty to this as when I received the substances I was told it was pure LSD-25 crystals, or pure swiss criss as some would say. After weighing it out at 27 mg, I realized there was no possible way it was LSD as 27 mgs doses that several friends had already taken and had enjoyable experiences from, if LSD-25, would have been a gross overdose as the LD-50 for the drug is only 12 mgs. This being said I still wanted to give it a try. And would later find out the powder was a mixture of DOM and 2C-E.",
  "0:00 I consume all 27 mgs by parachute and observe a bitter taste as I lick up the residual powder on the aluminum it came in. (LSD-25 is both odorless and tasteless)",
  "0:20 A heavy body and head load begin, I feel somewhat nauseous and highly anxious. In truth I'd been visualizing this for the past twenty-four hours.",
  "0:30 visuals begin at + levels and body and mind high continue to a ++- meaning +++ for strength however  at the end for strong but very negative feelings.",
  "1:00 I stand to use the bathroom and as I enter the visuals progress to a clear +++. The visuals looked and felt to me more like I wouldve imagined mescaline to feel like however, in truth 2C-E and mescaline can be very similar in nature as their both phenethylamines and colorful ones at that.",
  "1:10 I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and see myself as a shadowy being, which both accelerated my visuals and dropped my body high to a +--. I'm at this point very apprehensive, as well I note that the initial come up of these drugs should be considered very chaotic and at times difficult to deal with.",
  "2:00 I've reached a peak/pleateau on both the DOM and 2C-E at this point. Visuals have maintained +++ and physical and mental load had moderately increased back up to ++-.",
  "8:00 I am still peaking on BOTH at this point with visuals remaining at +++ and physical and mental status increased to just slightly below +++. Music as well has become bright and vibrant and continues to be till 25:00",
  "9:00 at this point having been awake for almost 24 straight hours already I decide to see if a can sleep. Aside from a few muscle spasms I sleep well while still in a +++ all around.",
  "14:00 I wake up and notice a very obvious transition. Visuals have gone down to ++, as I am mentally and physically +++ or better. At this point the 2C-E had almost completely wore off leaving the DOM running strong.",
  "18:00 At this point I'm at a park the visuals are just below ++, and with body and mental still very well at +++ its hard to imagine the complete opposite feelings about 16 hours earlier.",
  "24:00 I have amazing conversations still and have all day, however now visuals are just barely at + and are somewhat comparable to the brightening of colors effects of MDA at higher doses. I almost feel better than +++ somehow even this late in.",
  "25:00 After the past hour, except for my mood, things have for the most part calmed down. I sleep peacefully at 25:30 again save a few minor muscle spasms which didnt really bother my...",
  "Comments - Although I'm still not sure entirely how much was what I'd imagine the 2C-E content being at least 20 mg due to the strength of the visuals, and due to the duration of the trip I'd assume at least 6 or 7 mg of DOM were present. Overall I found it to be a powerful and wholesome experience, with the only negative being an overwhelming come up, and no other negative side effects to report. Given the opportunity I'd do this again in a heartbeat and I'd ask the guy to dose it exactly the same way with perhaps an extra 20 mg of 2C-E for the second twelve hours."
