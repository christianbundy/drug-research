  "It was suposed to be like any friday I was suposed to dex with my friends and just chill out...wrong.",

  "I am getting tracers and patterning extremly intense CEV's.",
  "10:20 in D's car with me and H, H points out the street lights and we both stare at the luminecent ball of light that is exploding rays in every direction spinning around the light and then sucking back in we marvel at this is know we will be peaking soon. We smoke about 3 bowls and drive back to J's house to pick up J, T and B",
  "10:30 H and I are just about peaking and we get back to J's house and I find out that both T and B are peaking on the DXM just as we peak on the 2C-I.",
  "10:45 We are all in D's car and I have my eyes shut marveling at the CEV's. I am wondering around the tunnels of my mind. Psychedelic caverns with ever moving walls shifting and melting into each other. very intense.",
  "12:00 just me and B at my house. We talk about whats on his mind and whats on my mind.",
  "1:00 B leaves and I am alone, I decide to try and get some sleep even though I am still tripping.",
  "3:45 Last time I checked the clock before falling asleep. I have a few very detailed dreams and wake up in the morning with a slight headache but feeling good and rested.",
  "All and all this was a wonderful new experience. 2C-I is a very warm and comforting chemical and I cannot wait to try it again."
