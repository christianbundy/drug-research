  "<p>Milk thistle grows wild here in the woods and its fall so I found some naturally dried leaves around the dead milk thistle. Awhile ago I tried eating six dried leaves and smoking a bowl of it but with no effects. I recently made a gravity bong and wanted to try it out so I thought I'd try it with milk thistle.",
  "I loaded the first hit and took it. It wasn't rough smoke at all easily went in and easily holdable. After exhaling I got this little tiny rush like a wide eye feeling and the next three hits were the same way. It's maybe ten minutes later and there's a very minimal buzz. My pupils aren't dilated and I kind of have a quicker motion of movement like my hands typing this. I could see this working well in much higher doses.</p>"
