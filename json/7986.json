 "report": [
  "I have been taking Ultram (Tramadol) every day for about three years now for arthritis pain. When I first took it I took 150 mg and it's effects were a lot like Codeine and it had a mild speedy effect also. After taking it for a few weeks the Codeine like euphoric effect becomes less noticeable. I have quit taking it entirely for a couple weeks with no adverse effects.",
  "You don't want to take more than 150 mg at once or more than 400 mg per day as the effects of higher doses of Tramadol is very unpleasant, it gave me a headache and made me feel sick. Very large doses can give you seizures. Tramadol is converted in the liver into it's active opioid component. For me optimum effects are achieved by taking 50 mg every 2 hours. It is a good pain reliever and in my experience it is not addictive. It is not a classified or scheduled drug."
