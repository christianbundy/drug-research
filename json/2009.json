 "report": "<p>I got to my destination at 8:00pm, at 9pm i took 2 liquid hits of acid, and about an hour later I consumed 2 pills of E. I was sitting down then as i stood I could feel my heart and eyes flutter I made no sense to anyone and I made no sense to my self. I thought i could fly but i knew i didn't have wings. So i sat on the bed hoping for this god awful feeling in my back to go away but in the mean time i thought i would go see how the others were doing.</p><p>As i stand up i feel my self falling back now. By this time its almost midnight and nothing has worn off, it seems to have gotten stronger. So I lay on the floor watching what to me looked like the sky but was only the ceiling. At about 4 am the affects of the acid wear off. Ii feel like shit and i cant sleep. My back hurts and my brain is clouded. If i can say that i learned anything its not to mix 2 drugs that are mind and body altering as much as these 2 were. Its not necessarily safe and if you get scared its not fun!!</p>",
