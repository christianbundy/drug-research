 "report": [
  "First of all I want to add that everyday I take Venlafaxine (150mg), Lithium (1.2g) and Quetiapine (25mg) but I've never experienced any problem in combining my 'medical dose' with other drugs, including Alcohol, cannabis, some anticolinergics, sibutramine, etc. Lithiums seems to add resistance to my mind, since I hardly experience hallucinations and delirium with the same dose that my friends had taken (and they become insane).",
  "Well I was at the University very sleepy, I had a test coming so I decided to try bupropion in high concentrations. I took 600mg at once, the effect was useful, I could focus a lot, I felt tired but not sleepy, my mind could think faster, which after the test was useless (really I couldn't stop thinking about EVERYTHING). In my way home I decided to smoke a joint to relax, bupropion makes me feel more nervious.",
  "Less than half the joint and the world started to move, I got in the rear seat of my car and started to experience some hallucinations, like dreaming. It was hard because I got out of the car to piss and the trees were really scary, I had auditive hallucinations too. Normally I never hallucinate with cannabis, no matter how high the dose is.",
  "I 'woke up' like 3 hours later, felt a little bit dizzy but perfectly normal, no nausea, not sleepy, not stupid, so I drove home."
