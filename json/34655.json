 "report": "<p>I have tripped on dxm before and it is an inward experience that has amazing closed eye visuals. Most people I have met that have heard of it drink the syrup which is not a fun experience so we went to the local store and found a new form which comes in a liquid gel cap. We then took this one step further and said how can we ingest the required amount with good taste. So we decided to make brownies.</p><p>All we did is take the gel caps and put them in a very low amount of boiling water stir until they dissolve the new red water actually doesn't taste that bad so we just added the red water to the brownie mix and followed the directions. Then we took the amount we added to the brownies and divided by the number of brownies we cut. The brownies didn't taste bad at all but the only bad thing I found was there are different effects. It is a more stoned feeling with almost no visuals, I think there might be some sort of breakdown of the dxm in the cooking progress.</p>",
