 "report": "<p>Prenote: I took 50mg (standard dose) of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) only for allergy reasons, but this could have played a role in my experience.</p><p>I received a prescription for 20 .25mg Xanax pills. I decided on 3mg total. I took them all at once with water at 7:00PM</p><p>At about 7:30 minutes I felt very relaxed and when I got up to use the restroom I was fairly disoriented and had a small bit of trouble walking, but felt very good, a relaxed and slightly euphoric feeling.</p><p>I then went to the kitchen to get one beer to help 'boost' the effects a little, this is where I guess things went down hill...</p><p>The next morning I awoke in bed, feeling fine, but not having a clue how I got there, luckily for me my girlfriend said I had I came in there about at 8:30 and promptly passed out. I would say I slept very good.</p><p>Unfortunately I don't remember any of the fun of the trip, next time I think I will take a lesser dose and NO beer.</p>",
