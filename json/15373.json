  "I used to think coke was this magical drug that only movie stars could afford and it created feelings of pleasure so intense that it was up there with heroin.  After a few years of trying it I just realise that it is a flat out waste of money.  You are paying a ridiculous price for something that lasts about 30 min, whereas you can pay the same amount and get enough tweak to last for days. ",
  "I dont see why people will say they hate tweak (amphetamines) and love coke, the high is almost identical!  Imagine snorting 4 lines and feeling like that for 6-8 hours!",
  "It's alright on very rare occasions, or if you just have a lot of money to waste.. It makes you feel like a champ, but why not pay the same price for something that will last 16x as long?"
