  "<p>I am an infrequent user of X.  I've only used it once in the last 6 months and that was 3 months ago.  Last week, I had to take a pre-employment drug test as a condition of hiring.  They did a hair test off my legs (I have short hair), and I came up over three times the positive/negative cutoff (18.6/5).  The test was meant to find the NIDA-5 within the last 90 days, but the test results that my employer got specifically pinpointed the positive as MDMA.  I don't think I'd pass in another two weeks as high as the result was. ",
