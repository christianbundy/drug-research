  "I've been taking Effexor for the last 9 month and have occasionally smoked moderate amounts of Marijuana since. I was somewhat perplexed after reading experience reports on this site involving the two substances and from my personal experience over the last 9 months I feel that these reports are either isolated instances or hypochondriactic exaggerations. My experiences with Effexor & Marijuana don't tend to differ much from a typical Marijuana high, aside from a slight decreased tolerance to Marijuana (i.e. the amount it takes to attain a high seems to be lower than it was prior to taking Effexor) and a somewhat increased sense of well-being (likely attributed to Effexor's anti-depressant effects). The difference, however, is subtle and has become less distinct after taking Effexor over an extended period of time."
