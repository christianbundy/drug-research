  "I seem to be one of the unlucky people that 'crash' very hard although i have noticed it (obviously) being worse with stronger pils or higher in-take.",
  "My experiances often range between the following:",
  "Self Consiousness: A sense that everyone is looking at me and talkin about me.\rFeeling dirty and that people think i look dirty.\rFeeling un-loved.\rJealousy: A very strong feeling that people are trying to take my girlfriend away.\rTiredness and resentment that it is all over.\rHeadaches and sensitive eye's.\rSuspiciousness: Thinking that people who are talknig to you have a hidden agenda.\rGet very up-tight and moody and just want to go home.\rVery emotional and weepy about past events (usually with speed).\rInsomnia.\rStill an uncontrollable appreciation of music e.g. i could be brushing my teeth and dancing to music in my head.\rUncontrollable shakes."
