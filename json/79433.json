  "<p>This report stems from personal experience and concerns the possible use of LSD in treating migraine headaches. In my family, a number of my direct relatives suffer from regular migraine headaches. This fate visited itself upon me starting with the age of 12. I would get migraine headaches once a month; almost like clockwork.",
  "At the age of 17, after having suffered migraine headaches monthly for approx. 5 years, I began taking LSD for non-clinical (recreational) purposes. After I began to take LSD, my migraine headaches completely ceased; even after I stopped using LSD. This headache-free period lasted approx. 6 years (approx. 2 years after I stopped using LSD altogether). After this period I started getting migraines again, although they now only occur a few times a year.</p>"
