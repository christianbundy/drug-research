 "report": "<p>Its by far not the first herbal mix to claim the right of an appropriate cannabis substitute but the first to make this true. I tried most of the legal high smoking mix bullshit and believe me: they DON`T work (if you consider some catnip, damiana and skullcap potent psychoactives then give it a try). </p><p>The first thought that hit my mind after the effects of Spice kicked in was: </p><p>My cannabinoid receptors are tingling! </p><p>The effects of Spice are virtually the same as those of cannabis, but with a slight delay in onset. Spice produces no kick, even if smoked in a water bong. The full effect takes place ca. 10 minutes after consumption and last approximately 5 hrs.  It has less mind altering properties and somehow more body load.  There are almost no hallucinogenic effects, no euphoria just the usual cottonmouth and pronounced sedation. This is what methadone must feel like for the heroin addict.</p>"
