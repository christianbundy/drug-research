 "report": "<p>I insufflated exactly 50mg at around 1pm, and tripped regularly as I normally would, as I use MXE a lot. Then later on, about 8pm I had another line of 70 mg. Instead of all the normal signs of tripping, I felt numb and cold, with no euphoria or happiness, just tingly all over and it wasn't pleasant.</p><p>This 'bad trip' lasted about 2 hours and the effects began to wear off. This was the first noteable bad trip from MXE I've ever had, and I've been using it for about 7 months.</p>",
