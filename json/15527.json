  "I have been experimenting extensively with this plant since I had the good fortune of befriending a local grower of exotic plants and entheogens. My kanna is freshly picked, then shred to a fine(not powdered)consistency, allowed to ferment slowly in a plastic container, and then air dried in a cool environment. It is very effective, either alone or in combination with cannabis. It provides a dreamy, content state. There is an initial feeling of alertness, brightening of colors, and an internal warmth. This is followed by a giddy, light-headed, slightly drowsy state. I just can't put your finger on it. An interesting substance for those looking for a good legal smoking herb.",
  "It can be beneficial, I find when encapsulated and taken in combination with natural hallucinogens. Most strikingly with mescaline, but vibes well with psilocybin also. I take 2 250mg caps during the initial phase of a trip and sit back.",
  "I hope more people become aware of the good stuff in this ally."
