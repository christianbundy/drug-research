Though I describe my self-awareness using the words  I and me, a normal, tangible sense of self was often absent during the peak of the experience.  Although much of the imagery used sounds pleasant, the actual trip was physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually taxing.  It also took a much longer period of time for me to integrate and gain insight from than most psychedelics.  When I did, however, I indeed felt heavens kiss.  Tryptamines are good medicine, but they deserve our utmost respect and prudence.</p>",
