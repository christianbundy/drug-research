  "<p>Waking from the illusion of physical discomfort,",
  "I lay in the warmth of a new sun rising.",
  "A gentle presence moves about me,",
  "Takes my hand and touches my mind",
  "Tides of emotion rise and fall",
  "In a sea of iridescent geometry",
  "Tension builds to a crescendo of inner conflict,",
  "Then the waves retreat;",

  "A blanket of cool wind",
  "dancing to soft jungle drums.",
  "The rhythm drives the trance.",
  "Then a shift; the moaning of the ocean",

  "Lines of binary code flood all awareness.",
  "The presence reveals its gaping ambivalence",
  "Promising to swallow me whole.",
  "Fear is alien; anxiety an abstraction",
  "The experience is real and nothing besides.",
  "As the raging waters cease their toil",
  "I bath my naked soul in the fading light",
  "Lying there; panting, wishing, smiling",
  "I feel heavens kiss of softened hues and gratitude",
  "With crystal clarity I open my eyes,",
  "And witness a Divine Perception of Truth.",
  "*Inspired by the effects of dipropyl-tryptamine, an analogue of DMT.  Though I describe my self-awareness using the words  I and me, a normal, tangible sense of self was often absent during the peak of the experience.  Although much of the imagery used sounds pleasant, the actual trip was physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually taxing.  It also took a much longer period of time for me to integrate and gain insight from than most psychedelics.  When I did, however, I indeed felt heavens kiss.  Tryptamines are good medicine, but they deserve our utmost respect and prudence.</p>"
