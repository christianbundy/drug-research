  "Considering the fact that my Ritalin reports have not been posted before, yet there are no other ritalin reports on this site, I decided I will try again, I think that people have the right to know about every drug there is.",
  "Well, it took a long time to finally get some ritalin, I finally talked someone into giving me some. I ended up paying 50 cents for a bottle full of half 5 mg and half 10 mg, about 70 tabs in all. But, then I found out that ritalin is easy to get and later aquired a bottle of about 70 10 mg tabs and 70 5 mg tabs for free.",
  "Mindset:",
  "I had a slight cold, but I was in a ok mood and ready to go snort some of the tabs.",
  "Experience:",
  "I always snort ritalin, it gets in my bloodstream faster and gives a bit of a buzz.",
  "6:00 -- Two friends of mine chop up 60 mg, the usual amount to get the ritalin buzz, I do 65 mg because I had been using ritalin all week.",
  "Normal Ritalin Buzz kicked in. The ritalin buzz is hard to explain, it's reminiscent of speed, but different. I feel a pretty nice euphoria, the need for sleep dies out completely, and I get the urge to talk alot. I mean alot.",
  "It lasts for about an hour to me, and then I get about a half hour of a still buzzing, yet coming down feeling. I've did it with some people that the buzz stays with them for hours and hours. So, I guess it all depends on how your body takes it.",
  "8:00? -- Well, after this wore down, I snorted about 50 more mgs, for a total for 105 mgs. By the way, after I've been high on ritalin and am on the comedown, I can snort all the ritalin I want and I won't be as high as the first time for some reason. (There is a way to get around this, and that's smoking it, gotta smoke it over a tin foil, like with meth.)",
  "9:40",
  "Well, I decided to go for about 45 more mgs, I didn't even get a buzz this time, it just kept me from feeling like crap.",
  "12:30",
  "I felt like crap, I didn't want to snort any more ritalin because I wanted to go to sleep, I thought I could, but I couldn't, I just sat on my friend's couch all night and didn't sleep a wink until 9:00 the next morning."
