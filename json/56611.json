 "report": "<p>Just my observation. I got my Doctor to suscribe after pestering him. I do overnight yacht racing and find it hard to stay alert. I thought that Modafil would fit the bill.</p><p>Took 200mg during the day at 3pm. Felt baseline with a little anxiety as I did not know what to expect. At 10pm still felt baseline. Went to bed at 12am, still baseline but a little tired.</p><p>All night I had the most intense dreams. Very uncomfortable. Even had audio, texture - just too much. Maybe I will test again in an all nighter, but going to sleep on the stuff is a little too much for me.</p>",
