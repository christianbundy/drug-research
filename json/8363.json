  "<p>Four days ago my doc gave me Mirtazapine because he still believes that some medicine could help me with what I believe to be burnout.",
  "I took the Mirtazapine in the evening, as suggested. Even though I could not sleep well during the past days, I very soon felt sleepy and had some 8+ hours of sleep. I woke up, but still my mind was in dreamland. I decided to get my waterpipe, always a good thing in such situations. My mind did slowly clear up. Another one...and then I realized that I was heavily tripping.",
  "I continued the combination. The effect of the combination has grown strong since then. Few minutes ago I had my fourth pill.",
  "The effects are deeply changed music appearance (goa is great), vivid color images to music, movies just like if I were dreaming. Few times during the day such things would come up for a fraction of a second, just if I were awake for a very long time and were about to fall asleep. Which might be the explanation for my experience: the side effect of Mirtazapine is, especially during the first weeks, extreme sleepyness. Maybe the psychedelic effect goes away, but until then I'll enjoy cinema. It's great and can be turned on by closing my eyes. Similar to LSD, but still different. Rather feeling warm and cozy than the easy appearing coldness. The eyes are not forced wide open, but I was easy able to switch to 'ACID-Focus'.",
  "If I would not feel so sleepy, I'd say the combination with Cannabis gives a great psychedelic. Definitely good to get down from being overly aggressive/stressed. Handle with care - you won't know what will come up from dreamland, and fractions of dreams can invade your vision while you have your eyes open!",
  "I think it can help me figure my problems out, but that will have to be seen.",
