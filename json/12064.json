  "I'll try to keep this short and sweet. I'm an alcoholic. And I've done just about every drug in the book. Anyway...",
  "I was in a foreign country (name omitted to save myself, but suffice to say it's developing) and I discovered that they had 30/500 codeine effervescent tabs.  Over the course of a week I began experimenting with them.  Trying different combinations including drinking on them. Bad idea.",
  "Over the course of one day, I took roughly 250mg worth of codeine. I had attempted an extraction, but I can't really guarantee how much codeine was extracted. I started at about 3PM and felt great.  I slowly sipped the concoction over the course of the evening and by midnight I was feeling good but a little disaffected, kinda weird.  I finished the last of it at about 1PM and started kinda getting worried that I might have taken too much.",
  "I sat out for a while and didn't exhibit any of the signs of opiate overdose but about 3AM I started having a pain in my side, about where my liver was.  I started freaking out and didn't get much sleep.  I woke up the next day and felt miserable, and my side still hurt. I made the decision to go to the clinic.",
  "At the clinic, I was admitted with severe dehydration and possible paracetamol overdose. The estimated possible amount of paracetamol I could have had in my system was 5500mg (I probably extracted at least some of the paracetamol decreasing the potential amount), well below the threshold for a normal person, however I am an alcoholic which greatly decreases the toxicity level.  Suffice to say, had I been in a developed country, I would have had access to better health care, blood tests and the antidote for paracetamol poisoning. I had access to none of these.",
  "Now it's just going on 72 hours since I first experienced pains and I'm still alive, but kinda nervous. I was discharged this morning with the instructions to drink plenty of water and juice.",
  "The moral of the story is not to mess with paracetemol if I am an alcoholic. Seriously, it causes some serious problems and I'm still not sure I'm in the clear.  Additionally, I ought not mess with drugs like that outside the developing world.  I really begin to realize that my life isn't worth anything when I am lying in a clinic watching children die from cholera."
