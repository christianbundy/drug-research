 "report": "<p>I have been on several antidepressants for years--fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and citalopram (Celexa).  When SSRIs seemed to loose effectiveness (grossly attenuated response and a new major depressive episode), I was put on bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, then XL), which was titrated to 450 mg qD and venlafaxine (Effexor XR) at 150 mg qD.  I also take modafinil (Provigil), for excessive fatigue.  Provigil has been perhaps the best chemical I have ever taken, it produces a very clean, smooth feeling: alert and happier, but without the amphetamine discontinuation symptoms. </p><p>Anyway, while studying for my biochem, pharmacology and synthetic/med chem. exams (yes, 3 classes, 3 exams, 3 days...a complete nightmare), I decided to take advantage of the fact that a friend of mine got a script for generic 'Adderall' (75% d-amphetamine + 25% l-amphetamine (why, I have no clue)) and did not react well to the generic, hence, got a replacement script for the brand-name.  I received 2 weeks of generic 'Adderall' and figured that this was the best time of all to use it.  I took one of the 30 mg tabs.  It is interesting.  I have ADD as well as chronic depression, hence the Wellbutrin, Effexor and Provigil (NE, DA and 5-HT reuptake inhibition, as well as whatever the hell Provigil does--no one really knows) but have never taken a pure amphetamine for the condition.  The amphetamine is nice.  I feel very awake and alert and not as jittery as I have previously with d-amphetamine spansules and (-)-ephedrine that I took when I was on an SSRI only.  I wonder if the Wellbutrin and Effexor are blocking my DA and NE transporters, hence, preventing the release of DA and NE that causes the amphetamine 'buzz'.  Realistically, I feel no 'euphoria,' only an increase in body temperature and alertness. </p><p>Anyway, overall, the amphetamine has been helpful...I'm on hour #40 right now.</p>",
