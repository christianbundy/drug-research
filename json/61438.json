 "report": "<p>I have taken provigil for around 5 or 6 months. I was initialy prescribed it for the somnalent state produced by being on Methadone maintenance, and am now prescribed it to help regulate my sleep state and combat the fatigue of methadone withdrawals. When I first started taking it the first week or so I noticed a marked improvement in mood and wakefulness. The improvement in mood just went away one day while the improved wakefulness has continued. I think it important to note that I have never taken it everyday and usually never take more than 200 mg.</p><p>600 mgs, which I took for the first time today, really has me jacked. My hands shake when extended and I am writing a report that I am almost always to fatigued to write. No real improvement in mood, just increased atention. Feels like coke after that initial rush feeling is gone. My skin feels slightly crawly and I have a bad case of the jitters. Could also be described as feeling like taking a couple no doze, but is much more like that nasty coke feeling. Nothing like adderal or the other usually abused stimulants.</p>",
