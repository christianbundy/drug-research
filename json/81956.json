 "report": "<p>I took 1mg of lorazepam and 40mg of 4-Fluoroamphetamine.  The effects of the 4-FA were a little stronger than caffeine is just before it gets jittery.</p><p>I was talkative and alert, but without any jittering or jaw grinding.  The effects passed after about 4 hours and no ill after effects were noted.  I usually go for 80-120mg for full effects of this substance.</p><p>I took a drug test the next day for the military and 4-FA did not show up, but the lorazepam did.</p>",
