 "report": "<p>I have just recently discovered the mystical powers of Yerba mate.  I had ordered a couple pounds of premium Yerba mate from Brazil.  I drink this every morning now instead of coffee.  In the middle of the day, I experience sort of a flashback to the feeling it gives me and I miss it.  It gives me a feeling of being in love. </p><p>I grind up about 10g of loose herb in a coffee grinder.  Heat a cup of water in microwave about 2:30.  Put contents of ground herb into cup of water and let steep for 5-10 minutes.  Dump through a coffee filter, and drink. </p><p>I might want to down the cup of mate for speedy results. Then once I start to feel really good, simply smoke a bowl of good green bud(cannabis). I have done this numerous times and notice that every time I get a feeling of being on cloud nine.</p>",
