 "report": "<p>I acquired 1g of (supposedly) 99% pure MDAI from a reliable source.</p><p>My intial plan after the allergy test was to try a small dose, in this case 35mg, and then an actual full dosage of around 120mg the following day. I injested the 35mg at around 6 P.M. and in about a half hour began to feel slightly warm. I watched television, mostly stand up comedy, which seemed particularly funny. The effects were very subtle with little stimulation, just a nice mild relaxation. At around 10 P.M. I settled in bed to call it a night. This is when things went badly.</p><p>At first a sense of 'something is wrong' popped into my head. It literally came from nowhere. My heart started to race and I began to sweat and feel stomach pains. I became extremely agitated and required a benzodiazepene to calm down. I would liken the experience to a comedown off of strong MDMA, but at least with MDMA the days following would have their ups and downs, the ups being therapeutic in nature and the downs being crippling anxiety. MDAI seemed to only have the latter in the days after. My only guess as to why this may have occured is that there was too much serotonin released in the receptors responsible for anxiety, but this is at best speculation.</p><p>It may be non-neurotoxic, but if you are prone to anxiety attacks I would not recommend this substance.</p>",
