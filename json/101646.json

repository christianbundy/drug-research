 "report": "<p>Having last reported on the first compound in Pihkal it was fitting that I recently came into possession of AL-LAD, the first compound in Tihkal. Doses that I read about ranged from a modest 75ug to a heroic 750ug. While most guinea pigs made it seem like 150ug was a solid amount and that potency was roughly similar to that of LSD I decided to take a deeper voyage with AL-LAD. I would dose 300ug with no tolerance, put on some music and wait.</p><p>Launch</p><p>The day was going splendidly. I had gone for a long swim, spent time with people I cared about and was mentally prepared for what I intended to be a psychedelic exploration of some new music that I had acquired. At 4:30pm I dosed 2 x 150ug AL-LAD buccally. The cream-color blotter paper was thick and had AL-LAD printed on it. It was tasteless and odorless. Good news.</p><p>T + 0:20</p><p>My research had me expecting a long come-up on AL-LAD but this blotter wasnt moseying. Twenty minutes in I was at a solid ++. My girlfriend drove me to a nearby forest to check out the water and greenery and our walk was characterized by a massive grin on my face, childlike wonder at the world and lots of churning visuals. My girlfriend reports that I kept saying Wow! and commenting that the greenery was spectacular and cartoonlike.</p><p>T + 0:40</p><p>I tried listening to some music but found that I preferred to have my headphones off. Juggling was close to impossible (I am usually a good juggler) and my trip was at a strong +++. I stood by the water taking in the beauty of the flowing river and informed my girlfriend that I was ready to head home. I grew quieter as the trip intensified but my grin stuck around for the entire trip.</p><p>T + 1:00</p><p>Shortly after I got back in the car I hit ++++, my first time ever at level four. I was nearly silent and movement was difficult. Time became meaningless and my visual connection to reality rapidly dissolved. Synesthesia was complete. I heard all colors and saw all sound. Music influenced my mood dramatically but I was not paying attention to the music itself.</p><p>T + 1:15</p><p>The description of the following two hours are sourced through a combination of my recollection, narrative told to me by my girlfriend, and audio / video recordings of me.</p><p>We arrived at home. The walk from the car to my bed is about 200 and I told my girlfriend that I wasnt sure that I could walk.</p><p>My eyes were wide open and I was looking everywhere, commenting repeatedly at how beautiful everything was. At the same time my girlfriend had to lead me as if I were a blind person  the beautiful things that I was seeing and the real world in front of me were blending together in such a way that I was not sure what was real and what wasnt.</p><p>T + 1:30 to T + 3:30</p><p>(A two-hour block)</p><p>Once I reached bed I rolled around gently for two hours, my eyes looking everywhere and a big smile on my face. I constantly asked my girlfriend for reassurance that things were safe and private.</p><p>Time continued to be meaningless. I had visions of rocketing into the universe and literally plugging in to a universal consciousness. The unity of things was apparent and I had been transported to a new dimension of peace and love. Much of my experience seemed as though I was a virtual being in a gorgeous simulated reality.</p><p>My girlfriend occasionally left the room. On her returns I was always happy to see her and always asked for reassurance that things were still safe. I could not communicate to her at the time why I needed her reassurance but I was able to explain later: It was because things seemed to be too perfect in the new dimension that my mind was in. I asked for my girlfriends reassurance that I hadnt hurt anyone during the trip, that I hadnt spent lots of money, and that I was physically okay  all because I couldnt believe that I could experience such beauty and nirvana with the ingestion of a harmless and inexpensive substance.</p><p>During this time I had some of the most transcendental experiences of my life. My girlfriend encouraged me to close my eyes but there was almost no difference visually between having my eyes open and closed. For a brief period at the end of the ++++ I felt nausea and a high body temperature but my girlfriend reassured me that I was fine and the discomfort quickly passed.</p><p>T + 3:45</p><p>After a bit over two hours at level four I began communicating more and was able to focus my energy instead of being overwhelmed by it. I decided to take a shower and when I looked in the mirror I experienced tremendous joy  it was me! I had found myself, I was back in reality and people that I loved and cared about were around me. I ran downstairs and hugged my roommate and said hello to our cat. I proclaimed how happy I was with my reality and went off to enjoy a most spectacular shower. My trip had dropped to ++.</p><p>T + 4:30</p><p>I played a card game with my roommate and we all (myself, my girlfriend and our roommate) watched a movie. The trip continued to stay at ++ for a while and we walked to CVS to get some snacks. My girlfriends Thai food tasted fantastic and eroticism was spectacular.</p><p>T + 7:00</p><p>Beautiful erotic unity with my girlfriend. Trip at level one.</p><p>T + 10:00</p><p>Sleep was difficult, solved with 10mg Ambien.</p><p>Other Thoughts / Notes</p><p>As I came back to reality I got stuck in a thought loop about a friend who I had been having concerns about. It helped to talk this through with my girlfriend.</p><p>The whole idea behind this trip was to explore new music while in a psychedelic state. Big fail on that goal. My girlfriend told me that I seemed to really like The Beatles during my trip but next time I want a music trip Ill be dosing for level three. During most of the ++++ experience I heard a heartbeat and vibrating hum, even though a variety of music was playing in the bedroom.</p><p>It is wild to watch video of myself taken during the peak of my trip. If you are comfortable with it I recommend having a close friend video you during an intense psychedelic experience.</p><p>Experience: DMT, Allylescaline, LSZ, 2C-E, 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-I, LSD, 25I-NBOMe,    nitrous oxide, psilocyble cubensis, MDA, MDMA, hydrocodone, cannabis, amphetamine, alcohol.
