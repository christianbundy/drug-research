 "report": "<p>Several months ago I began using Adrafinil (a 'Nootropic') semi-regularily and am impressed with it. Generally tablets are 300mg however I've found that as little a 50mg has significant (albeit subtle) effect.</p><p>I find it stimulating in a way similar to l-deprenyl but a bit more intense(IMO).  Concentration, 'speed of thought', memory, energy, motivation, and alertness are all significantly increased for about 4-6 hrs.  Mood is mildly elevated.  For me there is a hint of anxiety as well but much less so than with 'dirtier' stimulants like caffeine or BZP...  Very 'crisp' feeling and as though my brain likes it.</p><p>Effects (for me) come on quite 'noticably' about 1/2 hour after ingestion and something of a 'rush' is felt with very mild but pleasurable 'energy waves' detected.  This is with 300-900mg. </p><p>It is worth noting that I consume absolutely no caffeine, nicotine, or any other stimulants and so am likely a good bit more sensitive to Adrafinil's stimulating properties.</p>",
