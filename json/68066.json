 "report": "<p>After being prescribed Lyrica for some time now, I have just come to the realization that this drug can actually produce a very euphoric feeling.  I Decided tonight to take a higher dose than I normally do to see what effect it might have on me.  So far I am very pleased.  It produces an effect similar to a high dose of valium.  Kind of like the first time I ever tried a Benzo.  My moter function is completly lost as I wander around with a cloud like feeling of floating.  Things seem to be a lot more funny to me than when not taking the drug, like I'm giggling at everything for no reason.  It's quite fun.</p>",
