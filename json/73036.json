 "report": "<p>After learning about Kava through a report I had to give in an Anthropology class, I decided to give it a try.</p><p>I ordered ground Kava root powder imported from Vanuatu. After receiving it in the mail, I made up a batch for myself and my friend using a blender/strainer method as recommended on the bag (with 1 rounded tablespoon kava per cup of cool water). The resulting liquid made my mouth slightly numb within a few sips. I became unable to fully enjoy the taste of other foods, especially sweet ones.</p><p>Physically, the Kava didn't really have any dramatic effects on my vision or sense of balance. At this dose, I was able to easily walk straight and keep my balance.  My friend seemed to stumble for a bit, but he had chugged all of his beverage in two big gulps rather than drinking it slowly as I had. Mentally, I didn't feel the kind of perceptual blur that comes with imbibing any significant quantity of alcohol. Rather, I felt clear minded and rather normal. Emotionally, I didn't feel ecstatic or overly happy, but rather calm and collected. The fact that my girlfriend had asked for a split earlier that day no longer irked me. I felt like it was something I could handle.  The only extraordinary emotional response I found was when my friend and I broke out laughing for a good five minutes due to the fact that I was holding one of the cookies we were eating upside-down.</p><p>After the fact, I found some minor gastrointestinal discomfort, but this had relieved itself by morning.</p><p>On the second night, I had a similar dosage except this time I prepared it by the traditional straining method. This batch seemed somewhat weaker than that prepared in the blender, but had a lighter taste. Its effects were much the same, although on this night I found myself a bit dizzy later in the night. However, this method of preparation seemed to spare me the discomfort afterward.</p><p>All in all, I found Kava's effects enjoyable without being inhibiting. As long as it is taken responsibly, I feel it has great antistress and enjoyment potential.</p>",
