 "report": "<p>I'm on the third day of kicking narcotics (oxycontin, vicodin, percoset, poppy pod tea, heroin).  I was pretty much bed ridden with cramps, chills, weakness, (you know the game)until i decided to take some dxm to see if it would help.  well, i'm out of bed now because it's helping alot.  it's anasthetic properties are a godsend.  there is a bit of awkwardness the first hour after dosing but worth putting up with until the 'plateau' comes.  I finally feel like I can handle this. I read somewhere that DXM could be a partial opiate agonist, like the prescription drugs given to kicking junkies.</p>",
