 "report": "<p>Today I finally got a stash of Amanitas that had caused me much strain attepmting to aqquire.  There was an address problem and I don't wanna get into the amount of people that were railing me about these amanitas I was supposed to have.  We picked up the stuff from the package center on campus and then I smoked the first of two doses of amanita skin.  Unfortunately I was without marijuana because I had run out last night at 5.  This didn't stop my curiosity so I lit up a bowl in a friends appartment off campus and I felt a weak head buzz and slight euphoria stimuli.  The taste left to be desired but it was kinda earthy and I managed to smoke the whole peice of skin which took and amazing 7-8 hits out of my brand new bubbler.  Conversation seemed to be a lucid but abstact strong contact highs and a new tool to lenghthen the time of a marijuana high.  I would definitely recommend puttin it on weed and smoking it the taste is neutralized and the effects synergize well.  I will report back later tonight as I will attempt to ingest some of the amazing fungi.</p>",
