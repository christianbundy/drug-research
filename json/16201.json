  "<p>Well, I'd read several experience reports on catnip and it seemed fairly harmless and possibly even a little fun, so, one boring Sunday afternoon sitting in front of the computer, I thought I'd give it a shot. Plus, I was out of weed, so this made for a semi-decent substitute. I was still a little bit hung over from the last night of drinking, but I was pretty sure most of it was out of my system by this time. It should probably be noted that I smoke marijuana almost every other day and had partaken the day before, as well.",
  "I'm not sure what brand of what specific kind of dried catnip I was using, but we'd had it for a good few months since its purchase, for use with our two cats. I'd read that mixing tobacco with catnip enhances the effects, so I'd taken some from some older cigarettes I'd kept in my backpack and mixed it with equal parts catnip. I'd prepared three small piles, each to be used in my bong (which uses a rather small-ish bowl by the way), one after the other.  I was psyched and ready to try something new, since I'd only ever smoked marijuana before this experience.",
  "I'd taken my first few good hits off the bong in fairly quick succession (about a minute or less apart) and began to feel the effects that I normally associate with a nicotine buzz.  The tobacco flavor drowned out most of the catnip flavor, I noticed.By the time I'd killed off the first bowl, I felt really nothing more than a simple nicotine buzz, more or less.  There was a very slight feeling of relaxation, but again, that could be attributed to the tobacco I'd added.",
  "I started in on the second bowl about 20 minutes or so after the first and smoked it much in the same fasion I'd done the first in.  About 2/3 of the way done this bowl, I began to notice some effects.  I became very relaxed and certain objects in the room became very interesting to look at. My set of blue computer speakers, for instance, were particularily fascinating. I loved the shade of metallic blue.  Also, my neon green bong held a good minute or so of staring time for me. ",
  "As I polished off the last of the second bowl, I could distinctly taste the catnip, now.  What a lovely flavor... at least, in contrast to the weed I'm normally used to smoking.  It tasted minty and a little spicy at the same time.",
  "Finishing off the second bowl after about 45 minutes after starting the first, I noticed the effects begin to intensify a little bit.  Colors were sharp, my limbs felt a little heavier and I had a general sense of relaxation.  I'd started in on the third bowl about an hour into this.",
  "I polished the third bowl off quickly (in the space of 10 minutes) but didn't notice any additional effects since finishing the second one.  After about 10 minutes, I decided I'd go for a little stroll around the apartment.  Standing up was a little different. Bit of a head rush seemed to cloud my vision for a brief moment.  I noticed that I began to talk rather slowly and my senses were dulled just a bit.  This state of relaxation lasted a good couple of hours before it blended back into baseline.",
  "In summary, it was a fun little change.  For me, the effects are nowhere near comparable to weed but are nice if you want a good chill-out.  Very relaxing.",
  "Note:  After about 2 1/2 hours (at a point where everything seemed to have returned to 'normal')  I'd decided to fool around with a friend of mine and experienced a bout of erectile dysfunction... this had never happened to me, before, ever.  Whether it was because of the catnip or a more serious issue I need to look into, I'm not sure, but I feel it's appropriate to mention.</p>"
