 "report": "<p>After hearing about the unstudied effects of periwinkle, I picked some leaves off of my plant in the garden, and dried them in the microwave. After that, I laid back on my balcony and loaded my wooden pipe with the dried herb. The smoke was harsh at first, but it was extremely enjoyable, and had a rather pleasant taste. I waited about 3 minutes, and slight closed eyed visuals started to appear. I saw a brightly colored, cartoon-like bird land in front of me, and start talking to me. It asked me why I was using it. I told the bird that I was a shaman, and I wanted to learn more from it, and I asked if I could use it as my spirit helper. It agreed to do so, then told me I would make a good medicine shaman, and flew off. At this point, I was able to see through my closed eyelids, and I saw the grayish sky in front of me. I lifted my hands up, and they appeared as dark grayish shadows. After a few minutes, these effects stopped, and I returned to a happy, sleepy state of mind.</p><p>This was a very interesting experience, and I fully plan to continue experimenting with this plant in the future.</p>",
