 "report": [
  "I was interested in trying a MJ sub. So I bought some Damiana and Scullcap in bulk for dirt cheap. My expectations where fairly low and for good reason.",
  "I smoked a few bowls of the mixture from a pipe, I felt a good feeling and music seemed to give a better feeling, but nothing like MJ. To compare, I would say it would be like how I feel an hour or so after smoking a bit of MJ when its starting to wear off. And the feeling lasted no longer than 20 min.",
  "In conclusion I would say if your looking for a small high and you plan on sitting and listening to music it could be a nice temporary relaxent. However, this is no where close to the feeling of MJ, more comparable to tobacco than anything else. I plan on combining the herbs with MJ and see how that goes, otherwise the rest of my stash is garbage."
