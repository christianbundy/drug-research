  "OK, so I like experimenting with new things, and one day, salvia caught my curiosity. After doing a little research and discovering its legality, I ordered some from the internet. I ordered a gram of 5x and a gram of 10x. I decided I'd start with the 5x and figured if the effects were pleasent, I'd try the 10x. So I loaded my glass bubbler with some 5x and fired it up at around four.",
  "I inhaled the first hit and quickly loaded up the second, knowing that speed is imperative when dealing with salvia. I didn't want to overdo iot one the first day, not having a sitter and all. So after the second hit, I put my pipe down and lied back in my bed. As expected, nothing really happened. It just felt like a very light marijuana buzz. Disappointed, I continued the rest of my day without any incident resulting form salvia. That is, until the next day.",
  "I work as a dishwasher (I know it sucks but I'm only 18), and I have ADHD, so I take my perscribed 20mg of Adderall before school or work. It was 3:45pm when I took the Adderall. It usually will kick in 20 or 30 minutes later and I have fuel to get me through the night. This day however was different.",
  "About 1/2 hour after I took the Adderall, I'm in the middle of punching fries in the fry press, when I suddenly start to feel a little light headed and woozy. I shrug it off and continue on with my duties. 10 minutes later, one of the chefs finds me propped up agianst the freezor. I feel TOTALLY stoned! He takes me outside and has me sit down for a while. I sit out there for about an hour watching the trees wave at me and the ground ripple like a black asphalt sea. A truck pulls into the parking lot, and although it's about 100 feet away from me, I jump in my chair out of the way, convinced it's going to hit me. I slowly return to normal and continue on with the rest of my night. EVERYONE who works at this place smokes weed, but a few others other are harcore consumers of illicit substances. It is not at all uncommon for a chef to come in stoned out of his face, so of course my little trip was received with laughter rather than trouble.",
  "I am convinced that my trip at work was the result of the Salvia I smoked the day before."
