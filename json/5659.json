  "I was at a friends place and we decided to take some lotus which I had ordered from an internet vendor. It was the first time for my friend but I had taken lotus two times before. Because Blue Lotus is said to be boosed by alcohol in moderate amouts, we had bought some beers that we drank during the evening.I made tea of my lotus by butting it in almost boiling water while my friend smoked his lotus from a bong. Both methods worked really well and I the tea did actually taste very good in my opinion.",
  "The effects of lotus are quite downer-like; relaxion, tieredness and apathy are adjectives that describes the experience quite well. The effects are very pleasant if you want to escape your problems and just relax, but lotus is no party drug. The ideal uses for lotus is as an 'escape drug', it allows you to ignore your troubles and makes you tired enough to fall asleep easily if you want."
