 "report": [
  "About a year and 4 months ago, I was a student with an important deadline to meet. At the time I was chronically tired and unable to work, as the result of severe insomnia. ",
  "So I began taking small doses of LSD (tenth of a tab,at a time) as a stimulent to give me the energy I needed to prepare my presentation. After doing this for about a week, I was admitted to hospital with muscle spasms in my neck and shoulders, which kept me more or less incapicated. ",
  "Extensive tests failed to detect anything wrong, and the spasms wore off after a week. However they had not gone to stay, and reoccured regularly over the next year. Prolonged tensing of neck and shoulder muscles, preventing normal activity,confining me to bed and computer games....Severe depression.....still unemployable.",
  "Advice to self: LSD is a very powerful drug, NEVER take it like coffee."
