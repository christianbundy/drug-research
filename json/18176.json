 "report": [
  "As for the effects of Spice or any of the other cannabis substitutes that's been around for the last couple of years, I have nothing to complain about. These products do make me stoned, and the differences to the real thing isn't that obvious.",
  "However, after trying several different products, I can conclude that they are all far harsher on the throat and lungs compared to smoking cannabis or hashish.",
  "I bought 4 different brands and tried, and although I actually gave away at least 4 of my 12 grams to save my lungs the pain, a good week after smoking the last of it I am still not recovered from this ordeal. I can't smoke ordinary cigarettes without pain in my lungs, I feel almost constant pain in my back and have a tired, weak cough that won't go away."
