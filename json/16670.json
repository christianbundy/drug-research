 "report": [
  "At 9pm I was at my computer doing nothing so I decided to experiment by mixing drugs.",
  "I took:",
  "2x 10mg blue valium (diazepam) pill",
  "6x white 60mg codeine phosphate pills",
  "5x white co-codamol OTC pills 8/500",
  "So all together it was 400mg of codeine and 20mg of valium and 2.5g of paracetamol. Prior to mixing these drugs I looked up on the internet that they have interactions but in hospitals they mix valium with morphine so I ignored that. The mindset I was in at the time was calm but bored I had not eaten for 4 hours so my stomach was basically empty.",
  "So I then took the hand full of pills with a pint of water and sat there and waited.",
  "40 minutes later and I was listening to SOAD at the time I started to feel the warmth and mild euphoria set in with a slight itchiness. I was in a very blissful warm euphoric state witch nothing could harm me. Probably the affect of the valium amplifying the codeine.",
  "The whole experience lasted about 3 and a half hours with the only side affect being mild itchiness and a dry mouth. At about 1am I went to sleep had very strange but nice dreams and I awoke at about 11am I had a mild hangover feeling with a very dry mouth I also had urinary retention but I just ran the tap and that went away. So my conclusion is that it was a very good experience using only drugs I got from the internet and the doctors. It was a very nice high witch definitely is worth it for the mild side affects in the morning."
