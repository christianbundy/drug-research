 "report": [
  "I have suffered with insomnia off and on for years.",
  "I was given a 5 mg Ambien to try- to see if I liked it in order to ask my doctor for a prescription.",
  "I took one pill at approx. 10 pm.",
  "At 10:30, things in the bedroom started to look funny.",
  "Every surface that had a straight line (such as a piece of paper, the tv, a table) was starting to move. It was as if the lines were moving, very hard to describe.",
  "Inanimate objects were suddenly shifting and moving.",
  "The visual disturbances were so extreme that I would have been a danger to others and myself if I was alone or if I had gotten up.",
  "I did not feel sleepy or tired at all, just very weird.",
  "I don't drink very much and I have never done any recreational drugs so this was a scary event.",
  "I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you are alone.",
  "I did go right to sleep as soon as I closed my eyes."
