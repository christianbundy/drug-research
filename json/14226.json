 "report": [
  "In regards to background I've been an IV heroin user of some four years and a methadone user for around two years. I'm familiar with many psychoactives from across most chemical groups.",
  "Having seen how few reports there were regarding ethcathinone, I went ahead and ordered some from a reliable vendor.",
  "The first thing to mention is that people with a greater knowledge of biochemistry than I expected ethcathinone to be more of an agonist at norepinephrine than at dopamine receptor sites, which I feel I can confirm. For me this chemical caused tachycardia, hypertension and peripheral nervous system stimulation long before a 'satisfying' dose was reached. Potential users should be aware of this.",
  "I started by insufflating some 10mg, then proceeded to titrate an IV dose up to around a total of 300mg. This chemical is comparable to amphetamine, with less euphoria and an uncomfortable, ephedrine-like spikiness. While an increase in motivation was noticed, it was somewhat difficult to concentrate on a single task due to remarked akathisia.",
  "In a separate experiment I injected a dose of >300mg, during which a resting heart rate of ~120 and hypertension was noted, with an uncomfortable level of stimulation accompanied by diaphoresis and bruxism. Oops.",
  "I imagine any compulsion to redose with this chemical would be moderated by the uncomfortable side effects, but fiends will fiend. I just hope they've got strong hearts.",
  "Expect little sleep, even for a stimulant.",
  "Regards,",
