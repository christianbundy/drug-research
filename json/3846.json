  "I spent several months prescribed Tramadol. When I was in hospital the second time I asked to have it every night. That way I could drift in and out of a bizarre reverie all night and avoid the reality of the hospital by sleeping through the day. It wasn't as effective or as pleasant as morphine, but it was enough to kill the pain and allow me some escape.",
  "Outside of hospital I remained pretty dependent, partly as a replacement for smoking cannabis (I had to stop dead because of the lung disease that put me in hospital in the first place).",
  "I started sharing them with my wife and she got hooked too. My wife describes it as psychedelic, which in the broadest sense it is, but it's a more dreamy than trippy drug. Soon we were farting all the time and had dreadful gut pains, and we were frightened of the television. Spontaneously started crying a lot too, though that was partly due to my recent reminder of my mortality.",
  "Then one day we ran out. Thank God for that, my insides couldn't stand much more. The withdrawal wasn't serious. Felt very exposed to reality having been on it so long. Didn't try and get any more, just scored some E and grew some shrooms."
