 "report": "<p>This is my first experience with Tramadol. I suppose I would say that I am an inexperienced opiate user, having only taken hydrocodone and oxycodone once each. The pills I have are Ultracets (37.5mg of Tramadol, 325mg of Acetaminophen/paracetamol).</p><p>4:47PM. I popped one tablet. I hopped online and waited for an effect, and exactly 30 minutes later, still felt nothing.</p><p>5:17PM. Smoked a cigarette, popped one more tablet. I was still feeling very little effects, so I got back on the computer again.</p><p>5:48PM. I'm definitely feeling something now, but I can't really describe what. I feel slightly dizzy, but no nausea at all. It's kinda nice actually. I also must note that I am feeling rather warm, like it's hot in the room.</p><p>5:57PM. I just went outside for another smoke. My walking and coordination are not at all impaired, but I do feel a difference in visual perception. I also just took a piss, and I noted that my urine is quite clear. I am feeling fine, still no nausea or other ill effects. I don't feel a strong effect yet, so I am going to browse the Internet for awhile and wait to see what happens.</p><p>6:10PM. I still am not feeling any strong effects. The pleasant little head high is still around, but I am still not feeling any numbness or tingly sensations usually associated with opiates. However, I've been reading about this drug and it appears that it can take between 1.5-2.5 hours to reach its full effect. It has been less than 1.5 hours since my first dose and only about 1 hour since my booster. I suppose I will continue to wait, at least for right now.</p><p>6:20PM. I went out for another smoke. After this, I made myself some dinner and ate at about 6:50. After a few bites of food, I thought I might be getting nauseous, but a simple glass of milk fixed this problem. I enjoyed the rest of my food and beverage without any further nausea.</p><p>It is, again, difficult to describe how I am feeling. Normal is not it though, that's for sure. My head feels like I have been drinking, but I have lost no coordination or speech skills. I keep 'zoning out' for several minutes at a time. Nothing serious, but I will find myself blankly staring at something for a minute or more. My father arrived home awhile ago, and I was surprised at the ease in which I conversed with him. I usually have a hard time concealing when I am under the influence of anything, but today it just seemed like it was no big deal. I am rather carefree and enjoying myself. I'm thinking of putting on some music, but I can't find my earbuds. I am also thinking of taking another boost, since it has been almost 2 hours and 20 minutes since my first dose.</p><p>I like the effects so far, but I wish they were stronger.     </p><p>7:08PM. I went outside yet again for my usual after dinner smoke. As I was sitting smoking, I noticed a slight tingling sensation in the muscles of my lower back. After I finished, I came inside and went to the bathroom. I was feeling waves of nausea, but I think it was because of the cigarette. I usually get a little nauseous if I smoke right after eating. It has subsided now that I am back upstairs. I was considering taking another tablet, but I decided to postpone it for right now. I am feeling a pretty decent effect; as if I had drank 4 or 5 beers. Still no lack of coordination though. I am thoroughly enjoying myself, feeling relaxed and not tense at all. The only adverse effect that I feel is the fact that I am pretty tired. Due to my shitty nights sleep last night, I really cant say whether this is the drug or just circumstance.</p><p>7:27PM. I am feeling very tired, and keeping my eyes open is a challenge. I am going to head to my room and lay down, perhaps take a nap. I'm still feeling the 'drunk' sensation.</p><p>8:13PM. Ahhhh! That was so relaxing, I just lied down for about an hour. I didn't really fall asleep, just kinda faded in and out. As I lay down, I felt as if I had no body. My mind seemed if it was the only part of me in existence. It was wonderful. My brother just arrived home, and I was able to retrieve my headphones from out of his car. I just popped another tablet at 8:12. Now I am listening to the Pink Floyd album The Division Bell. I love this band, and the music sounds amazing. In regards to the music, I feel a bit like I'm high. This drug seems to be enhancing the sound quite a bit. However, I still have the drunk-like perception, but the nausea is completely gone. I also have noted that the time seems to be going pretty slowly. The night seems to be lasting forever, but that's fine with me. I feel fantastic! Soon the effects from the third pill should be hitting me and will really be feeling great. </p><p>8:29PM. I just went outside to smoke a cigarette. I think I just figured out why I had that spell where I had to lay down. I have two packs open right now; one pack of Marlboro 100s and another pack of Camels. All of the times I've smoked I had smoked a Camel, except for the time right after I ate. Maybe the Marlboro cigarette is what put my stomach upside down. They have always seemed harsher to me, and I've never really liked Marlbs, so maybe I am more sensitive because of the pills. I still am thoroughly enjoying the Camels though, and no nausea, so Ill stick with them I think. I am feeling really pretty fucked up, for only taking 112.5mg of Tramadol. I was expecting very weak effects, but I am buzzing real nice. I have to say, it's not a typical opiate experience. No, this is different. It's more like a head high instead of a body high. I sure do like it though.</p><p>9:37PM. The effects are wearing down now, but only slightly. About two minuets ago, I experienced the best part of my entire high. I was lying in my bed, lights off and extremely relaxed. I was still listening to The Division Bell when the last song came on. High Hopes. This probably my favorite song of all time, and when it got to the amazing solo at the very end, I was absolutely overwhelmed with euphoria. It was mind-blowing just how amazing it was. I can't even describe how much I enjoyed that song. It was phenomenal. I feel like I will never be that happy again, as I was in those two minutes or so. My buzz is still hanging on pretty strong, but its slowly dying. I am experiencing no ill effects or unpleasant comedown at all, so that's good. I just can't wait to get buzzing on this drug again and feel like I just did.</p><p>OVERALL: I am probably doing this wrap-up a little prematurely, but I'm more than likely gonna go back to my room and listen to music until I fall asleep pretty soon. It is now 9:47 PM, exactly 5 hours since my first dose. I have really enjoyed my time. It was a great head high, and I was fully functioning the entire time. This drug will be perfect for work and school because it causes no speech or motor skills impairment. It's by no means the best high, but it is pretty fucking awesome. I look forward to doing this again, and soon. I highly recommend Tramadol to anyone who likes opiates. The uptake was pretty slow, so I'm glad I didn't pop 5 doses due to not feeling high right away. It will come eventually. Stay safe, have fun, and enjoy.</p>",
