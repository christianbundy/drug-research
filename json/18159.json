  "I bought 2oz of Bali Premium Kratom powder.",
  "I was first time user, thus I took only around 6grams of powder on day #1. Effects started appearing relatively fast, after 10-20 minutes I started feeling warm feeling in stomach, momentum force when moving head and music felt softer, almost cotton-like. As time passed by nausea started appearing. It was relatively mild, but enough to stick fingers in throat and puke. That night I had extremely good sleep, I slept long and woke up well rested.",
  "Second day experience was significantly worse. I took larger dose, perhaps around 12g. I felt more nausea, no positive side effects what so ever. This was major let down and I simply threw up all powder I had left in my stomach. It also made me sleepy and my face had swollen up a bit.",
  "I will never do kratom again.",
  "BTW: I am unable to cum the day after consumption."
