  "This happened awhile back but I thought I'd post it because it's a fairly novel experience that has some correlation to eating kava. Usually my experiences with Kava aren't very noteworthy. The drug just relaxes me enough to smooth out a trip and provides sleep when I need it. I don't use it that often though, because it tends to give me an exhausted feeling in the morning like I've slept too hard.",
  "For this particular experience I took pre-capped Kava bought from a health food store. The gel caps were Nature Herb's brand and contained 250 mg of standarized (30%) extract along with 275mg ground Kava root. I opened up 2 and stuck them on the back of my tongue and drank them down with milk. It tastes like a strong dirt and sawdust mix if I get any on my tongue. This was my first 'real' experience with Kava as I had a drink of tea days before but spat it out!",
  "I felt tired after an hour but it was late at night and I was listening to some very airy ambient music. The tiredness was the only 'effect' I got while awake. When I went to sleep I slept VERY hard and had very vivid and colorful dreams. The dream that caught my attention the most was of a welcome back party for one of my friends. I was sitting in a chair talking to people. Then I looked out these 3 windows that were side by side. I noticed that the windows were actually a TV screen on which a movie like White Fang was playing (lot's of Alaskan scenery and snowy mountains). I got so engrossed in the movie that I began to feel like I was actually in the movie. I soon became a character in the movie. The crazy thing was that I would alternate watching/being in the movie and looking back at the party to talk to someone. This was the first time that I have ever had 2 dreams at once.",
  "I've experimented more with Kava, even finally trying it with hypnosis although this relaxed me so much that I fell asleep. However, I have never experienced the simultaneous dream effect again. I'm a lucid dreamer and I've experienced weird stuff like waking up in the middle of a dream and then going back to sleep and continuing the dream from where I stopped. I've even dreamt that I woke up. However, the switching back and forth between dreams 'mid story' is something new. I do realize that since my dream patterns are strange anyway, this could have had nothing to do with the Kava. Sounds like an excuse for more experimentation! ;)",
