  "<p>I started with 50 seeds, decided to keep 5 to see if I could grow them as houseplants.",
  "10:00 - I begin by eating 2 seeds. The flavour is strange, the bitterness is too much. I decide to crush the remaining 43 seeds and make tea from it.",
  "11:10 - Finished drinking the tea.",
  "12:00 - A very mild change in awareness.",
  "2:00 - Nothing much is happening so I go to bed.",
  "The next day I vomited when I woke up. Felt weak. Partially incapacitated. Got some gut aches and hot flashes. Around 6:00pm I vomited again after only drinking water all day. It was green.",
  "Gut pains persisted for days.",
  "Conclusion: this is poison.. not worth trying.</p>"
