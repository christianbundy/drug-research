 "bodyweight": "130 lb",
 "report": "<p>I started with 50 seeds, decided to keep 5 to see if I could grow them as houseplants.</p><p>10:00 - I begin by eating 2 seeds. The flavour is strange, the bitterness is too much. I decide to crush the remaining 43 seeds and make tea from it.</p><p>11:10 - Finished drinking the tea.</p><p>12:00 - A very mild change in awareness.</p><p>2:00 - Nothing much is happening so I go to bed.</p><p>The next day I vomited when I woke up. Felt weak. Partially incapacitated. Got some gut aches and hot flashes. Around 6:00pm I vomited again after only drinking water all day. It was green.</p><p>Gut pains persisted for days.</p><p>Conclusion: this is poison.. not worth trying.</p>",
