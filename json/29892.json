 "report": "<p>I have been reading up on ADD medicine and how taking lots of it could be like speed. I got a free bottle of some 30 pills of 54mg Concerta from a friend and read up on it. I thought it wouldnt hurt to try it. I took one dose and felt great, never before have I felt happier or talkative. I also seemed to concentrate more.</p><p>Later that day when I got home from school I was reading up on some expiriences. Most were positive, so I decided to crush and insuffilate 2 pills at around 10Pm. It felt great, like coke. I was having fun blasting music. Its hard to describe what I felt, an overwhelming sence of pleasure and I could concentrate on anything. At around 10:30PM I decided to chew one more 54mg pill.</p><p>Bad mistake, at 12:30 I felt sick to the stomach and I could not stop shaking. I decided to lay down for a while. Suddenly I began to hallucinate. It was scary what I saw and I never want to go through it again.</p><p>Now its 5:30 Am I had a fear if I fall asleep I would die. And I kept shaking the entire night hallucinating. Now the hallucinations have stopped but I am still shaking and my blood pressure is high. Im not sure when I will sleep. I have work in four hours. Never again am I touching that.</p>",
