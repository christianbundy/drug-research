  "Tramadol Part 1: The First Trial",
  "Introduction",
  "I had read about Tramadol/Ultram as a synthetic opioid with fewer/less pronounced side effects than more traditional prescription opioids.  While traveling in Cambodia, I found myself in a little boy in a candy shop situation, the candy shop being a pharmacy/medical center with a very inviting pharmacist behind the counter...",
  "Originally intending to purchase effervescent Codeine lozenges, I was given free sway to the pharmacists small selection, and purchased several blister packs of ten capsules of 50 mg Tramadol at about $2(USD)/blister pack.  I also acquired two blister packs of ten blue tablets of 10 mg Diazepam for about the same price.",
  "Dose",
  "I considered myself to be well-acquainted with opioids  I was a regular user of Codeine, though I was accustomed to other higher potency opioids as well, in addition to several experiences with raw opium itself.  Thus, I felt 3 capsules (150 mg) might be sufficient for a moderately strong experience.  In addition, I took one tablet (10mg) of Diazepam which I let dissolve in my mouth (allowing a potentially quicker onset via sublingual absorption). ",
  "Set & Setting",
  "This would be my regular drug preference  a mixture of opioids and benzodiazepines; consequently I felt quite comfortable with the dosing and had no anxiety with ingesting a new opioid.  I was very relaxed to begin with  at the time I was living in Taiwan, and this was my first week of Chinese New Year vacation.",
  "I consumed my doses in the privacy of a guesthouse, and then my friend and I walked for about ten minutes to the beach.  This was a quieter and more secluded beach area in Sihanoukville, Cambodia.  A general lack of noise and people added to the peaceful setting, which was quite tranquil already  soft white sand, a clear and bright star-filled sky, the rhythmic surge of incoming waves.  A cool breeze came in from the Gulf removing the oppressive temperature and humidity felt in the town.  My mind and body were completely relaxed. My friend and I walked around the beach and rested on lounge-chairs set out in front of a few beachside bars and restaurants.  The occasional traveler would pass by, and usually nod in our direction.  A few food vendors came around selling bbq squid and fruit.  All non-threatening.  My friend consumed some alcohol, but was otherwise straight.  In the event of any problem, he would have helped out and/or protected me.  (There is a slight chance of potential danger with gun-toting locals in Cambodia, but being tactful and being in a group at night has always made things feel safer there).",
  "The Experience",
  "What transpired was an experience much stronger than I had expected... ",
  "Within 30 minutes:",
  "I felt the mild but pleasant surge in my arms common to the onset of opioid drugs.  This was followed by an also familiar light-headedness.  At this point I felt mildly high in terms of a subjective high.  It was pleasant, and comparable to a large dose of pure Codeine.  I had heard reports of people describing a rush feeling in the early stages of Tramadol, but I did not experience this, perhaps due to the sedating effects of the Diazepam.  I was still able to walk, talk, and think clearly.",
  "30-60 minutes:",
  "The pleasurable surge turned into a full body numbness and intensifying lightheadedness.  I was slightly dizzy, but I could still talk fluently, though my attention was shifted to the pleasantness of the night and I chose not to talk as much.  I was still able to think coherently, enough so to realize that this moderate high was probably still in the onset phase.",
  "60 minutes +:",
  "I went on the nod.  I came in and out of this state for the next 3 hours or so.  I recall waking several times and muttering all sorts of things.  My friend said I spoke about how beautiful everything was, and also said a lot of oddball eccentric things  as a writer, this would be somewhat typical of me.  While I was quite opiated as I like to call it, my friend noted that I was still speaking eloquently and intelligently, though more quietly, and with the characteristic creaky voice.",
  "Moving from one area of the beach to another, I noted that I was quite dizzy, more so than with other opioids.  It was partially the high, though Im sure walking in sand had something to do with this also. ",
  "We sat out on the beach for several hours looking at the stars, and occasionally talking.  Some kids came and talked with us for a while.  A woman selling squid came by  I ate some squid (unlike others, opioids have never subdued my appetite).  A very large long-horned beetle landed on me and I found great pleasure in watching and feeling it crawl up my leg.  At some point, I took off my sandals and walked out to the water and let the waves come in over my feet, which also felt very pleasurable. ",
  "We walked back to our guesthouse and I had a pleasant sleep and felt fine the next morning.",
  "And In Retrospect...",
  "As mentioned, I was much higher than I had anticipated I would be.  The onset was quite pleasant, as was the plateau.  Those that dont like the nod in, nod out experience would not enjoy Tramadol, nor most opioids I would imagine.  On a subjective scale, I would rate Tramadol to have a similar onset, but lower-strength plateau than Oxycodone; however, the plateau lasted much longer than Oxycodone.  I would say the high was stronger than Hydrocodone, and slightly longer lasting.",
  "All in all, it was a great opioid experience.  Given the frame of mind and my location, I often think back to this night as one of the most beautiful nights of my life."
