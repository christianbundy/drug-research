  "Hello, I was looking through the net bumming for some kind of mind altering substance I might have easy access to.  I noticed passionflower and decided to try it.  It's been my experience that it takes a lot less to get you off on a substance when you smoke it as opposed to eating it.  I decided to take some dried passion flower and smoke it.",
  "I packed a bowl and sat around puffing it.  It burned easily and went down pretty easily so my puffing method was similar to that on a cigar.  Within 2 minutes after the intake I could feel some sort of change.  The change was very mild and subtle, but there.  I felt more tranquil, slowed down and content.  There was a pleasant body feel but it lacked the euphoria I was looking for.  My suggestion is this might be a good thing to smoke before bed, or to calm the nerves."
