 "report": "<p>Smoking 1/2 of a medium-sized Anadenanthera Colubrina seed invoked a sense of slight stimulation, and was much like a small cannabis buzz without the narcotic or slowing effects, and distinctly different. Objects, colors, and textures were brighter, with my vision taking on a definite 'trippyness'. Smoked slowly to prevent nausea. Effects are best obtained with a torch-style lighter. I peel the dark brown outer bean covering, and do not use everyday due to the unknown properties of Bufotenine, an active ingredient in Yopo seeds. Cannabis has a synergistic effect. I have yet to experiment with smoked Anadenanthera Peregrina.</p>",
