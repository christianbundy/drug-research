  "I've tried nutmeg once...if ones going to explore all possibilities, then even this should be tried. I consumed 20g of freshly crushed whole nutmeg (blended with milk and chocolate flavouring). I found the experience to be interesting, and worth trying only once - there is very little to recommend another attempt. It was a case where my mind was unaffected, but my body was stoned. Speech became slurred, limbs heavy and vaguely numb. I sufferred no nausea but remained in this 'wrapped in cotton wool' state for about 24 hrs. During this time I slept a dreamless sleep and awoke to find the effects had hardly diminished. I look at psychedelics and entheogens as a way to expand my mind, and percieve self from another perspective...nutmeg provided nothing of worth, no new thoughts or sensations. There was no real hangover from the experience although I did feel a little flat for the next 48 hours. So...feel free to give it a go, just don't expect anything too amazing.",
