  "<p>October 2001",
  "30 mg of DPT",
  "I carefully weighed out one hundred milligrams of N,N-dipropyltryptamine hcl, and dissolved it in two milliliters of distilled water.  It was very difficult to get the DPT to dissolve, and I found it necessary to add a little heat to get it into solution.  Then I filtered the liquid through a .02-micron filter for sterility.  After transferring the solution to a sealed glass ampoule for storage, I measured out .6 milliliters of this solution, which of course was equivalent to thirty milligrams of DPT hcl.",
  "This was my first experience with intramuscularly administered DPT, and I rightfully decided to start with what I viewed as a low dose.  Never one to enjoy snorting odd smelling powders, I was anxious to try DPT via a new method of administration.  Though I was a bit nervous about the injection process, I was looking very forward to comparing the effects of IMing this material to insufflating it.  Those Ive spoken with who have taken it both ways swear by the IM method.  Plus, DPT was always administered by IM injection when it was researched as a psychotherapeutic tool in the 1970s so it seems to be a well-explored manor of administration.",
  "Using my trusty automatic injecting device, I administered the thirty milligrams into my upper thigh.  There was no burn and the injection went smoothly.  No immediate effects were noted.  I decided to spend the onset of the experiment outside, so I packed a bowl of marijuana and brought one balloon of nitrous oxide with me and made my way outdoors.  For an evening in October in the Midwest, it was unusually warm.  There was not a cloud in the sky, and also very little humidity.",
  "After ten minutes there was still nothing happening, so I decided to smoke some pot figuring it would help kick in the effects.  Two or three hits was all it took.  After the marijuana, I noted the distinct DPT-vibration in my body.  The night sky was suddenly filled with colors and there seemed to be life and activity stirring about in the trees.  I was amazed at the relative smoothness of IMed DPT. Previous experiments with insufflated DPT were very forceful and demanding in nature.  In some ways this was actually gentle, or at least during the onset of the experience it was.",
  "Around fifteen minutes into the experiment, the effects seemed well developed and I decided to take my balloon of nitrous oxide.  As usual, the effects were overwhelming.  I can only describe the place I traveled to as serene.  There was complete silence as the universe and I became one.  My ego ceased to exist and the I simply became one with everythingTrue bliss and universal harmony.  This lasted around 3 minutes, though I had no perception of time as this event occurred.  It was on my return that things got a little weird.",
  "As soon as I became aware of my body again, I noted a strangeness in the air.  I could not quite place my finger on what it was that was so weird, but there was a certain foreboding feeling in the air.  Almost as though I was no longer alone.  I decided to gather my things and make my way back inside.  The walk down to my room was a little difficult.  My motor control was a little off, and I seemed to sway as I walked.  The visuals had also grown quite intense, and it was actually a little difficult to see clearly over the intense trails and colors that filled my perceptual field in the dim light I was walking through.",
  "I put on Donovans Please Dont Bend, which is a very beautiful acoustic ballad that has a biting edge to it.  Very intense song.  What happened next is beyond my ability to describe rationally.  It is definitely the sort of event that is completely unbelievable unless you experience it first-hand.  As soon as I sat down on my couch there was this creature/entity/being there with me.  It sat directly behind me in the couch and started to massage my scalp.  It was shaped in a humanoid fashion.  I could not make out any specific features because I did not turn around and examine it.",
  "I was paralyzed with fear and did not attempt to intervene or stop it from happening.  I just sat there and let it do what it wanted to do.  I am not in a position to say any of this was a figment of my mind.  Not only could I clearly detect the presence of someone or something there with me, but I could also feel these hands in my hair, and my hair was also visibly moving.  There was certainly no wind or breeze in my bedroom moving my hair in the fashion it was.",
  "The entity event seemed to end as soon as it began.  This occurrence was over by the time the song had ended.  The experience of having my scalp rubbed by a presence I was not used to left me rather unnerved, and I spent the remainder of the trip attempting to put the pieces back together and figure out what happened.  For the next hour or so, I rode out the raves of fear and uncertainty that I was feeling; knowing the effects of the DPT would soon wane.  Though I never reached a state of all-out panic, it was not a comfortable trip after this event.  I did not expect to have entity contact from a mere thirty milligrams of DPT and I suppose I was in a bit of shock from the whole thing.  By the third hour, I was mostly down.  Only my body was still buzzing.",
  "A few days later, I visited my local wise lady, who is a Native American, and she seemed to know exactly what it was.",
  "Its a shadow person, she said while laughing.",
  "Thats what they do, among other things.  Massage the scalp.  They mean you no harm.",
  "My friend was really convinced thats what it was, and said my description of what happened fitted the bill completely.  She has had three such encounters herself after deep meditation and says many Native American legends speak of beings that she feels are what we both have encountered.  She did not know exactly what Shadow People were or where they came from but did offer a few theories.  The most reasonable of which I thought was Shadow People exist to comfort us.  The touch they provide is their means of bringing soothing feelings.  So I guess that is what it was.  And with that I am satisfied.",
  "That trip will have to go down in my books as one of the strangest events I have experienced.  I have had entity contact from smoked DMT, but nothing like this.  Not direct physical contact.  I also believe that the DPT may have been a catalyst in this event, but it was not the cause.  Though I cannot even begin to decipher the meaning of it all, hopefully in the future this mystery will reveal itself to me and I can bring real meaning to it.</p>"
