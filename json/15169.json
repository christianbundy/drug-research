  "[Erowid Note: 20 pills of carisoprodol in a 24 hour period, even if they were of the lowest available strength, is considered an extremely high dose.]",
  "Here is my little retrospective of the 24 hours after I purchased 20 Somas.  I had taken 2 pills at a time on 2 occasions and even then I was wasted.  This time was different.  I'll start with the purchasing of the half-scrip at 9:30 PM on a Wednesday night. ",
  "9:30 pm - Somas purchased, two taken orally with dinner and milk.",
  "10:30 pm - Feeling that familiar buzz, numbness, loss of coordination, etc.  Then I take 2 more.",
  "11:30 pm - Feeling quite a heavy buzz, drank a couple beers and smoked a bowl to add to the effects.",
  "12:30 am - The friends I was hanging out with leave, and I take another Soma.  The count up to this point, 5 soma, and I am definetly feeling wasted.",
  "1:30 am - Watching TV, well trying to anyways, as my vision is quite distorted and I am unable to move without thinking about it really hard.  So I take another Soma.",
  "2:30 am - Reaching the peak of my nighttime Soma experience.  Feeling complete loss of coordination and motor skills, stumbling around when I had to get up and for some reason I decide to take 2 more.",
  "3:30 am - By this point I have consumed quite a few shots of mcnaughtons to go along with my soma swallowing.  I am laying in my bed smoking cigarettes when all of a sudden my energy returns and I decide to clean up my room.  I wouldn't usually think that muscle relaxers would keep me up all night and make me want to clean my room.  So I stumble around managing to clean some dirty clothes and garbage up.  Then I try to push a loveseat up my stairs by myself.  I'd get it half of the way up the stairs and try to get around it to the bottom so I could push it up and it would slide all the way back down.  Exhausted, I give up and retire to my bed, falling instantly into a deep and dream filled soma sleep. ",
  "9:30 am - I wake up to go to work, still in a daze from the night before.  After taking a shower, I take 3 more soma and head to work.",
  "10:30 am - An hour has passed at work and I realize that I haven't accomplished a damn thing.  My eyes were completely out of focus and I couldn't even see the computer screen unless I got 2 inches away from it.  I take 2 more soma and soon decide to take a break.",
  "11:30 am - In the upstairs part of my office, I smoke a bowl and a cigarette and notice myself nodding off quite frequently.  I remember thinking to myself 'I'm too fucked up to work right now.'  So I head outside and hop in my car to drive home. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  On the way, I noticed I was too fucked up to be driving as well, as I was in the other side of the road quite frequently and rear-ended a minivan at a 4-way stop.  Since I had weed, a pipe, and somas on me I just kept driving and never did get a call from the police about a hit and run (this is about 6 days later).  Paranoid, I race home to lock my doors and shut the car in the garage.",
  "12:30 pm - By this time I am home safely and sound asleep while I am supposed to be working.  Passing out never felt so good.",
  "3:30 pm - I awake, and I realize I should head back to work and clock out so I could get paid for being fucked up all day.  I make it to work safely and nobody suspects a thing.  I am such a cheapskate haha",
  "4:30 pm - When I get home, I take 3 more soma and consume a short glass of mcnaughtons whiskey.  Just as the effects were wearing off, I had to do more.  I continued to explain to my friends about the fucked up last 18 hours or so I'd been having.",
  "5:30 pm - I am about in the state I was late the night before.  Unable to hold my head up under its own weight, slurring words, speaking rubbish, total loss of motor skills and coordination.  I proceeded to drink a couple beers and smoke some weed and cigarettes. ",
  "6:30 pm - Still wasted beyond belief, I think it might be a good idea to take the remaining 3 out of my original 20 somas with another glass of whiskey.  By this time, one of my friends is ripping on me because I'm so freakin wasted and I remind him of his soma experience a few days earlier to shut him up (He took 3 and was acting like a 7th grade girl getting drunk for the first time).  In a vain attempt to load a bowl of shake, I spill weed all over my pants and the floor but don't really care all that much.",
  "7:30 pm - Once again I am delerious and not too aware of my body or surroundings.  I tell my friends I'm gonna pass out before I hurt myself, and they agree its probably a good idea.",
  "8:30 pm - Sound asleep once again, 23 hours after I purchased the somas.  I end up waking around 11 when my friend shows up and I tell him the story of how wasted I got off soma for a day straight.",
  "Restrospective - This was definetly one of the funnest 24 hours I'd had in a long time.  As you can probably tell, I have a problem with taking things to the excess.  Alchohol and weed definetly enhance the effects of this drug, which are nothing like hydros or any other pills Ive ever taken.  Another thing, the one soma that was unaccounted for was taken over time through the act of snortation.  I would crush out a little line of the stuff and snort it when I would take the others orally.  I hope this experience was helpful but more likely it was just entertaining."
