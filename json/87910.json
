 "report": "<p>I've been using Piracetam for almost a month. The days I use and the days I don't are very clearly distinct from each other. When I take it, I take about 4500 mg in the morning, with one choline capsule after breakfast. In about an hour, I usually feel wired, like no caffeine could ever accomplish. I work quickly, effectively, and I make substantial progress on whatever I'm working in. The peak effect fades after 2-3 hours.</p><p>After 5-6 hours, if I don't re-up, I feel lethargic (but not groggy or fuzzy), and sometimes will even doze off. I've never taken more than two doses like this per day - once in the morning and once in the late afternoon/early evening. On days that I've dosed late at night, I've found myself up until the early morning hours working.</p>",
