 "report": [
  "This isn't going to be a detailed report of my first jump with the substance, but rather a short summary, as I didn't find the experience to be too memorable or really worth too much mention.",
  "Dose : 125mg dissolved in cranberry juice",
  "The taste was kind of putrid, but manageable and thankfully it had no aftertaste.",
  "The comeup seemed kind of familiar- the elevated hear rate, the anxiety, the slowly shifting perceptions of reality etc... though it was never overpowering or troubling.",
  "The high itself was pretty relaxed, like a low dose of poppy tea. I sensed no real tactile or auditory enhancements. Just in an altered and relaxed headspace. Mouth was dry throughout and was very bored for the duration, though there never came a time when I wished it would just go away.",
  "It seems like a pleasant way to spend an evening indoors if I just want to be at peace and relax, but I don't see any other uses for it, and at its price, I may as well just smoke some cannabis.",
  "Overall I give it a 4/10. Will try a higher dose in the future.",
  "It also should be be noted that I had dosed 15mg of Mirtazapine the night before to go to sleep and was still experiencing the sluggish hangover that comes with it."
