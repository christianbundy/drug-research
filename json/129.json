  "I have been a heavy pot smoker since I was about 13. I am 16 years old now and smoke at least 2 or 3 joints a day minimum.  For about a year now i have been experiencing some pains in my chest after smoking pot.  At first, i didn't take much notice, but lately it has become very painful and uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels like it is my heart, sometimes it feels like it's the entire left side of my chest.  The pain is hard to explain, it is like a tight, constricting pain.  Applying pressure helps to alleviate some of the pain. I don't want to quit smoking pot and don't plan too, but if it is necessary i will."
