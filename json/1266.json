  "Finally came by some pure NA-GHB in powdered form, since I didn't trust the stuff that you can get in the bottle.  Have heard this stuff called many things but the one that stuck in my mind is liquid ecstasy.  Prepared the GHB in a mixture with 3.5g weighed into water.   Downed it and waited for the effects to turn on. ",
  "T+45mins, finally getting threshold effects... decide to move around, and see what that is like.  Not too much, unstable enough to know that I would not drive. ",
  "T+1.5 hours.  This is the peak, I put on some music to see if that would be interesting, nothing special there.  Go outside where there is always a bunch of people in a party mood.  Nothing special there either. ",
  "T+2.5 hours, well this is bretty boring, like being on the threshold of a good drunk but nothing more. ",
  "I go home and fall asleep at T+3 hours.  Don't see what the big deal is with this drug.  Good sleeping aid though, and I would use it for that, and maybe to help me come down off of other substances, but that is about it."
