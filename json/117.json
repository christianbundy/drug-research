 "report": [
  "Unknown, but my new favourite stimulant!",
  "I have chosen to write this report for a number of reasons having read and heard about numerous peoples opinions regarding this substance, love and hate and everything in-between. There is a lot of confusion as-well-as conflicting opinions about ethylphenidate, including potential dangers, doseage, neurotoxicity, effects on the central nervous system and purely general recreational enjoyment. The relationship and process of Methylphenidate being converted to Ritalin acid and finally to Ethylphenidate  EthylPhenyl(piperidin-2-yl)acetate is also much disputed.",
  "Ok first off a brief description of myself:- Im a 22 year old English male, have been experimenting with substances for 7 years (yes I know thats young, and Im not proud or boasting). 6 feet tall weighing about 60kg.",
  "My past usage of drugs includes MDMA, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, a cocaine and crack addiction, opiates (codeine, morphine, heroin IV  I had a yearlong addiction, and finally Oxycontin (oxycodone). Currently on Subutex (Buprenorphine) 8mg daily, down from 18mg a day. As for psychedelics what is there I havent tried and what doors of perception have I not broke through DMT  Dymethyltryptamine is my ultimate favourite, especially the right blend of changa. LSD, shrooms, 4-meo-dmt (synthetic psilocybin - tryptamine analogue  very fun). AMT, 5-MEO-DALT, 5-MEO-DIPT.. 2cB, 2ci and it goes on. Anyway, the point is the receptors in my brain have been through a lot.",
  "More to the point however, my love of stimulants and experimentation with research chemicals, which has only been in the past few years. I have always had an issue with substances which dramatically boost levels of serotonin in the brain, then drop, leaving a feeling of depression and severe lack of inspiration. MDMA predominantly and analogues of. Maybe its because Ive been depressed before and Im an anxious person, I dont know. This leads me onto a more preferable reaction to the brain and central nervous system, dopamine reuptake inhibitors (hence my love and hate relationship with cocaine). Less of a come-down is preferable to me, and the boost in dopamine released in the brain obviously leads to more confidence, energy and unfortunately in some peoples cases, arrogance and a huge, temporary ego-boost.",
  "So, Ethylphenidate is a potent psychostimulant that acts as both a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain, by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. In my opinion the effects I feel are extremely similar to cocaine, however the duration is slightly longer.",
  "My thoughts on Ethylphenidate",
  "Not to be abused regularly; there is neither evidence proving dangers - or lack of danger (short term/long term/neurotoxicity), due to the fact of it being a very new compound. However in comparison to research chemicals such as 4-MMC Mephedrone, other cathinones, MPA etc, I find Ethylphenidate to be healthier on my circulatory system, causing less vasoconstriction and respiratory issues and problems. This, however, is if it is not abused to an idiotic level (high doses, compulsive re-dosing and binging for days).",
  "Ok so Ive tried this a fair few times recently, however the trip/experience I am about to describe started earlier today, and is still continuing currently.",
  "Setting: (Pretty boring..) my room and house, ingesting via nasal ROA.",
  "So this-morning a package of 1 gram (actually 1133mg) arrived from my most trusted RC vendor online. Very fine, consistent crystals, resembling that of very fine ketamine crystals presented themselves to me, in a baggy detailing the full chemical name and symbol. Following a big breakfast (I will never take stims on an empty stomach), I weighed out my first line  20mg. Time being about mid-day, 12pm. Due to the pain of insufflating ethylphenidate, I mix the crushed crystals with roughly 30mg benzocaine. (I used to cut very decent cocaine, producing EZ test results of between 50-65% pure  dont judge, in England cocaine averages at something like 25% pure, so producing slightly higher than that.. well I was making money in my area). Anyway, 20mg first bump  not an extremely fast onset, however 5 minutes I could feel stimulation in my chest and mild tingles of elation in my head. 10 minutes after initial bump, I had a huge craving for a cigarette, which as stim-heads know, is very enjoyable whilst buzzing. Finishing my cigarette I felt great, energy boost, mental clarity (or so I believed at the time) and inspiration. I tidied up my house for about 45 minutes, then decided to ingest another dose. Second dose was taken at about 13:00 hours, an hour later than the first.",
  "This time I upped the dose slightly to 30mg. I believe less is more with this drug  meaning spacing out reasonable sized doses and not compulsively re-dosing OR taking too high a dose at one time.",
  "Still buzzing from the first bump, this one really got me going, energy, chattiness (called my girlfriend and opened multiple conversations with people online), smoking  a lot of cigarettes also. I snorted the second dose of 30mg on its own this time, forgetting the pain insufflation causes to the level of being punched in the nose..! (Water or teething powder are also good to put up my nose to ease pain strange yes, however effective).",
  "So continuing through the day, roughly re-dosing every hour or so (intranasally) - (despite the fact the effects last slightly longer than 60 mins) I would up the dose by about 5mg each time. Later in the day I found it very hard to eat and had complete lack of apetite, however my mood was sustainably very good, and no lack of energy despite lack of food. Frequent drinking of liquids however are necessary as the dose got higher, so did my body temperature. At about 6pm my dose was at 50mg +.",
  "Ethylphenidate is  in my opinion  an extremely addictive substance in the short term, my wisdom was telling me to stop at around 10pm, because sleep would be difficult. This unfortunately wasnt going to happen. I finished with a BIG last dose of 70mg up my nose at about midnight (I would not recommend that size dose). Realising my brother had some Clonazepam, I took 4mg (Rivotryl x2) which eventually calmed my mind and body down, allowing me to sleep roughly two hours later.",
  "Conclusion  as I say, less is more  small bumps with big spaces inbetween will produce a more sustained and euphoric buzz. To be fair Ethylphenidate is far more beneficial to abuse in a social setting (pub/night club), because it makes me so chatty and I dont want to stop rambling on about any old crap. In terms of a come down, there isnt much feeling of sadness/depression, purely craving for more (when the bag is finally empty I feel desperate for more). Benzodiazepines are essential for me after an Ethyl session, they relax my mind and rid my thoughts of craving more of that lovely powder.",
  "I personally love Ethylphenidate, however I understand completely that its a relatively new drug, therefor frequent abuse/usage of it probably isnt wise. As long as I keep the doses low and spaced out, keep hydrated, I really enjoy this substance. Compared to my previous favourite RC (Mephedrone), my body feels a LOT healthier.",
  "Please bare in mind all opinions I express are purely my own, the truth is nobody has full knowledge of long term effects of this substance, however my experiences suggest if treated with respect and used sparsely, it is not too unhealthy/stressful on my circulatory system and heart  compared to Cathinones/MPA/MDPV etc.",
  "Well, thats my opinion of Ethylphenidate  it must be respected to produce great fun, and IMO I prefer it to most other stims including amphetamine, mkat whatever.",
  "Thanks for reading Yours truly."
