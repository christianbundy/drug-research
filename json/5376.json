 "report": [
  "I ordered my stuff from one of these online legal high vendors. It came almost three weeks after I ordered.  The product appears at first glance similar to cannibis buds, so I rolled two joints and lit up.  I felt some very mild inebriation  But nothing to write home about.  A little calmer than normal, but still nothing so intense.  I would imagine that a chemical extract of this would be many times more powerful, but thats for chemist to do...also, marijuana has been bred for many years to be as strong as it is now, and if someone would breed opium lettuce to be more potent it would also help.  I would say that it is a mild alternative for pot, its not a complete waste of money...but if you can get pot, get that instead."
