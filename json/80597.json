 "report": "<p>I was coming off heroin one night and I knew it would get bad late at night and wake me up, so I took 75mg of Trazodone to knock me out. I woke up some hours later totally disoriented and sweaty. I walked into the bathroom and collapsed. It was like the most intense head-rush you can possibly have, I couldn't even see. I layed in the bathroom naked for some more hours until I felt better. I'll never use that stuff again.</p>",
