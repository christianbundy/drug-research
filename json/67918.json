 "report": "<p>Mmmm phenibut, it has been decribed to me before as a similar feeling to being stoned but without the headache feeling (that soapbar headache); valium; and GBL.</p><p>After drinking 8 cans of guinness, I ingested 4grams of crystal/powder phenibut. I approx had this at 9pm. Currently at 10.40pm I feel relaxed with a slight, slight euphoria but a very similar affect and feeling much like valium or even nutmeg! I feel that this is an excellent sleep aid. It has been sugested to me that it takes around 3-4 hours to work, although I think the affects take around 1-2 hours, then like EXTC or good skunk the feeling seems a while or delayed to reach its peak, but when it does it seems like bed time.</p><p>This an ok drug. Nothing special, or nothing special for someone who would want to be more social (as in going out - not sitting in yer mates bedroom!!!!) I would recommend it as an aid (used like valium) for comedowns or withdrawls.</p>",
