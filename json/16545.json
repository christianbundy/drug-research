  "These things are great except I experienced severe anxiety. I have anxiety and I take medication for it, so its under control.",
  "I havent had a problem with anxiety for years now.",
  "I only took 2 Modafinils, which were 200 mg each. They worked excellent at not letting me feel tired the whole entire day, but the anxiety was so horrid that it actually wasnt worth it. I was so worried about ridiculous things and afraid I was getting fired for NO reason.  I know u must be thinking that anxiety isnt THAT bad, but it was mind blowing bad! I felt so scared the whole day.",
  "By the way, the pills are so horrible tasting."
