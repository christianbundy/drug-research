 "report": "<p>I am a 19 year old male, with experience in mdma, mushrooms, cocaine, amphetamines, 2c-e, 2c-b, dmt, lsd, ketamine, spice products, marijuana, and various pills.</p><p>Onto the story. I picked up a 500 milligram vial of 'bath salts'. Brand name 'Eight Ballz'.</p><p>I had to visit my mom, so i decided i would test out this new substance while in her town. I got to her house, settled down, and decided to go with a walk. Went to a park and settled down behind some trees, making sure nobody would see. I dumped out a very large line, as i later found out in later experiences. Not sure how much mdpv was actually in this particular blend, but I cut it out and insufflated it. \r[Erowid Note: For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See related article]</p><p>Very little burn, and within 30 seconds, felt a rushing, 1.5-3 minutes into my adventure, felt as if I had insufflated the largest dose of cocaine in my entire life. I walked around, experiencing one of the greatest euphorias of my life. Easily cutting out oxycodone. Possibly a tiny bit more euphoric than MDMA, but far too speedy, (in my opinion). I progressively felt as if I had poisoned myself.</p><p>This soon progressed to extreme nausea, leading to me dry heaving in the middle of the street. Shortly after drinking a small amount of water (drinking or eating anything is extremely unpleasant on MDPV, I have found.) Soon after this episode, I calmed down enough for the euphoria to shine brightly again. I was singing in the streets to my music playing, talked to a friend on the phone about how amazing I felt, and visited an old girlfriend. Attempted sexual relations, but heart was racing far too fast, and I knew it would be extrememly dangerous, so I decided on returning home.</p><p>Fortunately my mother was asleep, so I slipped into my room quietly and attempted sleep. T+3.5 hours.</p><p>As time went on, the euphoria dissipated and left me feeling empty and depressed. Eyes unable to close for more than 3 seconds top. So I laid in my bed, hating my life, unable to sleep until approximately T+10.5 hours. A horrific price to pay for astounding euphoria and joy. Would need alprazolam or diazepam to attempt again in an effort to sleep if I were to try again. I do not believe it is a good idea.</p><p>I'm going to stay away from this substance, as future adventures left me fiending for days, giving in multiple times and staying up for 2 days, combining this with marijuana, cigarettes, MDMA, and alcohol. Should have researched more, but I had an invincibility complex at the time. I research on just about everything else online. Safety first people! Do not attempt to experience anything like this as I believe I should have been in the hospital or taking anxiolitics.</p><p>Anyways, just thought I would share with and warn people of my experience. Safe tripping! </p>",
