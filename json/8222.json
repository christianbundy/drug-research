 "report": [
  "At one point in my life I was taking 6-8mg of Xanax daily for nearly a month.  This was partly a psychological addiction on my part, but what I want to focus on is the physical withdrawal symptoms.  Withdrawal for me involved, no sleep, nightmares, constant nausea, pain, mental agony, major sinus problems.  In other words, a living hell.",
  "Would I do this drug again?  Yes, but I will never get physically addicted again.  Even though I had the mental strength to stop, it is so incredibly painful and dangerous I would not repeat it ever.",
  "Experience at 6mg:",
  "T+0:00",
  "Pop 3 2mg pills. ",

  "Feel very 'out-of-it', drunken euphoria, little nausea, all cares and worries go away.",
  "T+1:00",
  "Get hungry, my sinuses are cleared up, I like just hanging out watching TV.",
  "T+1:30",
  "My ability to store memories is practically gone.  I have no inhabitations.  I fall off a bike and cut myself, but am completely numb to pain.",
  "T+2:00",
  "It's a fairly sedate and restful feeling also.  The feeling is not euphoria per say, but a permeating numbness."
