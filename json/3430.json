 "report": "<p>I ordered an oz of WA grown grade A mushrooms from a place in Indiana.  Thinking that they would blow my mind from some of the things I've read, I only took 5 grams on a slice of pizza (I had not eaten for 2 days prior hoping that it would increase results.)  After 2 hours of nothing (not even the common nausea), I made a trip home to get some more (I was at a friend's house).  I grabbed the rest of the oz and some home-grown anti-nausea smoke.  When I returned to my friend's house, I made some cream of mushroom soup and added 5 more grams of the amanitas.  It tasted nasty, but I ate the whole thing and smoked a hitter of bud.  After 2 more hours of nothing I gave up and went to bed.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.  My advice: stick to the ones that stain blue.</p>",
