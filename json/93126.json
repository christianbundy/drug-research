 "report": "<p>I'll keep this short and sweet.  Methoxetamine does nothing to me, even if I take high dosages IV.  With my friends it is a nice party drug when in a dance place with music and lights because it tends to trigger synesthesia and in that sort of environment people don't get too freaked out.</p><p>For me, though, it seems to put me in an active mood and bring me out of the depression part of my bi-polar disorder.</p><p>I take Seroquel and Lamictal. Perhaps that interaction causes this effect on me.</p>",
