  "I have abstained from all psychoactives for 30 days. I've done this routine plenty of times, so I thought I would finally contribute to the community and document it for the record. I'm listening to my favorite upbeat music throughout. I ate some cheeseburgers 4 hours ago. Looking forward to the mild experiment that follows:",
  "[t+0h:00m] Ingest 40mg ephedrine hcl in the form of 4x 10mg broken in half pills, with a cup of lemonade (organic, not from concentrate). Lemonade is alkaline, and that will supposedly improve the bioavailability of ephedrine, but who knows. From my experience, the ephedrine will reach peak effects at exactly T+1:00.",
  "[T+0:15] Heart is beating harder. I feel like boxing or jogging, or playing an online first-person shooter, mainly in anticipation of the imminent stimulation.",
  "[T+0:30] Ingest 3oz (2 shots) of whiskey. This will negate all the negative non-psychological stimulant effects of the ephedrine (hard heart beat, shakiness). Not that they're very intense, so more importantly it will add a euphoric effect that ephedrine alone lacks. Since I don't have a tolerance to alcohol at this point (abstained for a month), the way two shots will hit is just right. The alcohol will also reach peak effect at T+1:00.",
  "[T+0:45] Since T:0:30 I've been playing a first person shooter online (cod4). I'm in first place with a 4:1 ratio. For anyone who knows about FPS games, that's very desirable :). I'm normally very good, and I attribute the enhanced reflexes and cognitive improvements to the ephedrine and the way alcohol suppresses the second-guessing mechanism in my brain. I'm effortlessly landing shots that I legitimately didn't expect to land, and I'm noticing myself moving frantically yet with a calculated flow.",
  "[T+1:00] As planned, the effects of both the ephedrine and alcohol have peaked. I've been told by friends with stimulant experience who have tried this that the feeling right now is comparable to a low dose of amphetamines. In my own words, it feels like I'm at a really good party with lots of friends, or I'm boxing someone and wrecking them. Basically, the feeling is that of unquestioned confidence, unnecessary happiness, slightly numb, and I feel like doing something productive. The effect is perfect for parties or social times, particularly because ephedrine lacks a 'comedown'. At this point I masturbate for 15 minutes in an effort to release even more happy chemicals in the brain. My thoughts throughout are aggressive, and the orgasm is powerful and lasts longer than usual, but within seconds my dick is flacid again and I've all but forgotten about it.",
  "[T+1:15] With the rush of serotonin or dopamine or whatever orgasms release, I'm feeling quite awesome for a completely legal experience. I wish I could feel like this x10, for several hours, but I suppose that's what amphetamines feel like. I feel perfectly content, and I'm smiling at the thought of effortless joy. I have an urge to do something that would benefit from my enhanced mental state. I also feel as though excelling at something would further increase the mild blissfulness. Now I blast the music and finish writing this report. Feels good man.",
  "[T+1:15+] From my experience (been doing this for more than 2 years), this is how the rest of the experience will unfold: I will feel great like this for another hour. Starting at T+:2:00 the feelings will begin to fade away over the next 2 hours. At T+4:00 I will be essentially sober. The afterglow feels like being very mildly 'out of it'. Throughout the entire experience and afterward, achieving sleep is not at all difficult.",
  "For reference, I don't do any (other) drugs. I eat organic and abstain from caffeine and nicotine. I use the ephedrine no more than once a month, and not always that often. The best times are at parties or unusually fun times with the girlfriend. She also likes ephedrine, as do all of our friends. The general consensus in my circle is that it's a great pick-me-up, particularly because it lacks a significant comedown. It's most enjoyable when accompanied by the rush from drinking a medium amount of alcohol all at once (i.e. 2 or 3 shots at once), specifically when there's absolutely no tolerance to alcohol (alcohol produces a much more euphoric feeling when there's NO tolerance), on an empty stomach."
