 "report": "<p>One day I was very bored getting some fish and chips at the local Chinese shop. I went across the road to a dairy to get a red bull (I had already drunk three that day). While inside the shop I saw a rack of legal highs (Common in New Zealand but the shop has since removed them). I asked their effects and picked one out called 'hypnotic' It said on the packet that it was a relaxing yet high energy buzz. I pick my fish and chips up and went home.</p><p>8:00pm - I take 2 pills and play battle field for about an hour. No effects.</p><p>9:00pm - I take 1 more pills. No effects.</p><p>10pm - Feeling like I had been scammed out of $20 I take another pill. Then after about an hour I feel very relaxed like everything is so soft and content.</p><p>10:30pm - I feel I can do everything better! I start doing the house work. Then I feel I cannot breath I feel like I am going to die. I talk to my friend on MSN he tells me to take a walk. I try breath fresh air. It comes in waves I feel fine then like I am going to meet my death.</p><p>11:00pm - I get help from my mum tells me the same thing to relax and wont drive me to the emergency room.</p><p>2:00am - She drives me to the emergency room because I cannot walk and am crying out in pain and screaming that I am dying. I legitimately feel like I am going to die. I begin to relax in the car then I start having muscle spasms. At this point I cannot breath (We are about 5mins away from the E.R)</p><p>I am placed in a wheel car in the E.R and left in the waiting room. I feel relaxed now and safe. I begin to sober up. I am checked out and sent home at this point everything seems slow and time seems freezed. I stumble to my room and try sleep everything is spinning around slowly. I wake up about 12 times during the night feeling like I am dying. I power vomit 4 times.</p><p>For about 3 days after the experience I felt very depressed and 'odd' sort of out of place not myself. I just wanted to be with my girlfriend and loved ones I had a new outlook on life felt that I would never use drugs again ( A week later I used san pedro)</p><p>It would have had to been the worst experience of my life and left me with anxiety issues for months later.</p>",
