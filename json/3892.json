 "substance": "DXM",
 "bodyweight": "150 lb",
 "report": "<p>After doing much research about DXM, I decided to go for it. I swallowed 6.8oz of Robitussin Maximum Strengh, and this is what happened:</p><p>Within the the first three hours after taking the drug,I had some interesting experiences with my eyes closed, abstract imagery and linguisticly hard to define concepts; It all had a dark and negative feeling to it, heavy is a good word to discribe it. Thanks God I was psychologically prepared and did not freak out, but it was NOT a pleasant experience. Then about three hours after I had taken the drug, I started feeling sick, really sick. This are some of the symtoms I experienced:</p><p>- All of my body felt extremely itchy.</p><p>- I experienced chills and sweat.</p><p>- The worst headache I have ever experienced.</p><p>- Comfusion, like daydream nightmares.</p><p>- Heat waves all over my body.</p><p>- Nausea and vomit.</p><p>- Fever.</p><p>I was looking for a spiritual experience, but this is what I got.  I came to the conclusion that I had an allergic reaction to the high dose of cough medicine I took. I was confident when I decided to do this drug, the amount of research I did on the subject made me feel like I knew what I was doing. I did not. I learned an important lesson, everybody is different and so are their reactions to a drug.</p><p>Never ever again.</p>",
