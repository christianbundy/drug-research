 "report": [
  "Last night about two hours before going to bed I chewed up and swallowed two grams of dried valerian root. I then chewed and swallowed one gram of kava, which made my mouth pleasantly numb. And to top it off I took seven chewable melatonins, 1mg melatonin and 3mg B-6 each.",
  "In about an hour or so afterwards I was overtook with a feeling I had never had on any of these substances alone. It was a very unique psychedelic feeling. I had mild coloured shapes and such, and it was quite hard to keep my eyes open. Eventually I stopped fighting the urge to go to sleep. From then on I had the most extreme and intense 'dreams' I have ever had. They were so real I felt as though I had slipped into another dimension rather than sleepy land. All I can say is any one who likes wild and vivid dreams this is definately a good combination."
