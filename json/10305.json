 "report": [
  "First, a little background info on me. I am a 22 year old male. When I first used Viagra I was 19. I am taking the following prescription medications. Zyprexa 20mg, Minocycline 200mg, and Adderall XR 20mg, a day. Through some research and talking with my  psychiatrist and therapist, I have come to suspect that the Zyprexa is the culprit for causing my Erectile Dysfunction and Decreased Libido.  From what I can tell.",
  "From personal experience, I can say that other drugs that are also used for treatment of Erectile Dysfunction do not work as well or as fast. For example Cialis. I took cialis one day, waited a half an hour, then two hours and I wasnt even able get an erection after physical stimulation. Viagra has worked the best for me. After taking two 100mg Viagra pills, I was able to achieve and maintain an erection when physical stimulation was used. This affect with me usually takes anywhere from fifteen minutes to a half hour.",
  "After the stimulation was stopped, my erection went away in about five minutes, and didnt come back until sexual stimulation was applied again. This happened for a good four hours. So for four hours I was able to have sex with little time in between to recuperate. I must add, along with the physical part of it helping with my erection, it also gave me greater sexual appetite, and sex was more enjoyable and pleasure was increased. I have used Viagra many times since then with the same affects and benefits."
