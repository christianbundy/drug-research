  "<p>Im a psychologist in training and work at a nationally recognized specialty AD/HD clinic. However, the following should not be construed as psychological and/or medical advice. I am simply reporting my personal experience with the above named substances.",
  "I was diagnosed with AD/HD at a young age; however, I was intelligent enough that I was able to go med-free until ninth grade, which is when the pre-IB track began picking up. From about 15 years of age to 20, I took 40 mgs of Adderall (amphetamine salts) per day. Although it was effective, there were some down sides. With Adderall, there was an on and off feeling; that is, I knew when it was working, and when it wore off. Although mitigation of my AD/HD symptomology was a necessity, I didnt always feel like myself- after all, spacing out, hyperactivity, etc. are who I am. Not all of it is bad- Ive had great insights during some of my space outs, in this instance more appropriately labeled dissociation. I stopped taking the Adderall for six months. It was hell. I definitely have AD/HD, and I could barely function.",
  "For the last five years, Ive been taking 80mg Strattera (atomoxetine) each morning and 45mg Remeron (mirtazapine) each night. Together, the two work synergistically to mitigate my AD/HD symptoms, with no on and off feeling. While they may not work quite as well as amphetamines or methylphenidate, I still feel like myself; that is, I can concentrate when I have to, but still be AD/HD at appropriate times. Since Im currently working on my PhD, I have to concentrate a lot. Ive got the motivation and the cognitive-behavioral skills; the medication is the missing piece that allows me to realize my full potential.</p>"
