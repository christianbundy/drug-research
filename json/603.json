  "Being somewhat of a speed-freak I have always been interested in what over-the-counter stimulants will do to my mood and energy..etc.  Anyway I have heard a lot about ephedrine (the Chinese herb Ma Huang) and heard that it was stronger than caffeine.  My usual dose is between 25-50 mg, maybe more depending on how I want to feel. ",
  "Twenty-five milligrams of epehdrine will make me feel bursting with energy and have a very, very small euphoric feeling.  Music sounds a little better on it.  But I make sure I am taking just strainght ephedrine and not any of that Two-Way bullshit that contains guaifenesin.  Too much of the guaifenesin, an expectorant, makes me feel like shit.",
  "I have used ephedrine when wanting to successfully stay up all night and not feel like shit but the next day the crash is pretty bad.  I would never go over 150-200 mg because after this point you are pretty much putting your heart at risk.",
  "This is a pretty good OTC substance when used responsibly and can be pretty fun.  Well, stay safe...keep cool."
