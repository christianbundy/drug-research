  "[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.]",
  "The problem with this drug is that its high is surpassed only by its speed of tolerance. ",
  "I started by snorting one pill 10mgs (only after a three year daily oxy habit), it was an incredible rush of warmth and euphoric security unprecedented by my past opiate/opioid use such as handfuls (rather nosefuls) of oxycodone, hydrocodone, and as much Fentanyl as I could beg, borrow, or steal.  The rush seemed to start in my brainstem and very quickly cover my head including the tongue and then my entire body inside and out.",
  "It took only three days to work up a tolerance of thirty mgs just to get the most minimal high- very little rush.  After only two weeks, I was trying to jam 8 of these pink bitches up my nose, to no avail.",
  "So I have been IVing for the past two months; I started with half a pill 5mg and now I have to put 4 full pills 40mgs in a 3cc rig to get that rush but ooh that fucking rush! The nod is not much to speak of; basically I am puncturing my veins multiple times a day in anticipation of a two or three minute rush.  When IVed the rush is more of a warm, beautiful specter overpowering me from behind and before the needle is empty she has wrapped me in love, peace, and, happiness, but by the time I catch my breath (literally) she is gone to leave me wanting Bitch.",
  "The only grace I have if at all, is that I always run out before my new script so I suffer, terribly suffer, for a week or two until I can hit the Doc.  I stay the withdrawals by taking suboxone (wearing a fresh 100mcg Fent patch wont even help). I gave half a pill 5mg to a low tolerant friend and he was sick for three hours puking, lethargic, wishing he was dead.",
  "As for my drug experience; over the past 18 years, I have used almost every substance reported to get you high (even banana peels), I have been to raves and Dead shows alike, as a connoisseur of not only drugs but the various cultures.  Over the past year I have been prescribed Opana 10mg 4xday and 100mcg Fentanyl every 72hrs (usually bump it to 200 or 300) also I did a couple of ounces of cocaine (several thousand dollars), and some pot (when free), and a few doses of morning glory seeds (nice) and once mescaline (what can I say) and DXM (use only when needed) and lots of alcohol."
