  "One afternoon at school, after showing them off to my friends, I took 4 milligrams of xanax.  It was lunch time at school and I took them on a full stomach. ",
  "I went back to English class and everything was starting to get a little dizzy.",
  "I went on to band class, in which we were doing nothing because the director was leaving us.  I only know this because I was told, I don't remember what happened in that class at all.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
  "After school I somehow managed to safely drive home.  It's beyond me how I didn't wreck or something.",
  "I came home and soon crashed in the recliner.  I must have zonked completely out.  Later when my mom was home,  I staggered like a drunk man into our living room.  She asked what was wrong and I drunkenly replied 'Nothin...' And went back to the recliner.",
  "I woke up later that evening and felt normal.  My mom didn't think too much about the episode that afternoon, though both my parents remarked that my speech sounded slurred."
