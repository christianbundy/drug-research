  "I had a pretty bad toothache one day, and I remembered that cloves were a good antiseptic so I picked some up.",
  "As soon as I got home I chewed on 3 pieces, the taste was horrible and I would recommend just snapping them in half to release the antiseptic and not chewing them, but it worked pretty well and cured the toothache for about 20 minutes."
