 "report": [
  "About an hour before I go to sleep I usually take 3 mg of melatonin and 50 mg of diphenhydramine to help me sleep. Yet tonight I desired to have a vivid dream or a lucid dream that I would remember. So I took 4.5 mg instead of 3 mg. This is the following experience.",
  "12:30 I ingest the melatonin about one hour after the tylenol pm Im already a little tired.",
  "1:30 a.m. I already feel the melatonin and I get increasingly tired and procceed to bed.",
  "The second I hit the pillow I'm out like a light. During this extremly good sleep I have the most intense dreams I have ever had in my life and to top it all when I wake I can remember the dreams with perfect clarity all the way down to colors location and what was said. In short this was the best dream enhancing drug I have ever used and it had no ill side effects.",
  "1:25 p.m I awake feeling great and not groggy at all.",
  "A very good experience."
