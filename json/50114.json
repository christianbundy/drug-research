  "<p>I was looking for an alternative to getting back on ritalin after deciding I am the definitive poster child for ADD.  At age 37 I have a business that should be 10x more successful, six half finished movie scripts and countless other brilliant ideas on the 'back burner.'  I am now officially drug free (no weed, coke, alcohol, nictone--nothing) but feel a mild stimulant of some kind will help me gain needed momentum.  Because quite frankly, a daydreaming slacker doesn't have a chance in today's workaholic businessworld.",
  "I heard about Modafinil from reading an article on the internet about a guy who described his experience as 'remarkable,all I wanted to do was work, and I was happier than hell while I was plugging away, wanted to work more at end of day', etc. So I ordered some Alertec (no prescription/ consultation required, which seemed strange for a stimulant) from a company labeling them smart drugs (another red flag). ",
  "My overall take on Modafinil?  It almost worked.  But not quite.  Kinda of like smoking catnip as opposed to dirt weed.  Modafinil did keep me awake,  so I tried 300 mg thinking my dosage was too low.  Nothing extra, I could not discern the difference.  Don't see the point of trying 400mg.  Modafinil, in my opinion should be used like coffee--only to stay awake.</p>"
