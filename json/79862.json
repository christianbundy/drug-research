I was outside at night in the little playground of my neighborhood, slowly coming down while watching the stars and trees--nothing special. Then I noticed my cat, who was my best partner in mushroom experiments, staring at something. I gave a look, and saw a sparkle of light. I thought that it was the eye of a mouse, when the light moved, and I saw that it was a sphinx! It was small--at the best the size of a German shepherd. But strangely, he was transparent--I could only see his outline. Then I noticed that there were sphinxes everywhere. They weren't moving, but I had the feeling that they held great power, just like when you see a tiger sitting at a zoo. The movement of the first one that I saw was distinctly feline. They were very beautiful, not threatening, and they seemed to be made out of the purest of crystal. I don't remember if their faces were feline, canine, or ovine--a combination of all three perhaps? (Their faces were not human, fortunately; that would have been scary.) I didn't try to communicate with them; they were there minding their own business, and so was I. I soon thought of something else, and they disappeared. -- S.H., France</p>",
