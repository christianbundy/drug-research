 "report": "<p>\nI received about 8 HBRW seeds from a friend who couldn't give enough accolades about his and other friends experiences.  I have used all kinds of substances for over 20 years and I have always taken caution when taking anything the first time.  To be more specific I have used Cocaine, Crack, LSD, Mushrooms, Marijuana, Heroin, PCP, MDMA, just to name some mainstream drugs.  I was excited to try something that my friend highly recommended and was cheap and legal at the same time.</p><p>Before I used the seeds I spent several hours researching the effects and possible things to be concerned about.  I decided to start with three seeds and to be frank all I was worried about was the possibility of nausea. </p><p>I took three seeds, scraped of the fuzz, ground them up and chased them with orange juice on an empty stomach.  I started to notice a buzz within 20 minutes. </p><p>T + 1:00 Nice mellow buzz like a mild MDMA experience.</p><p>T + 1:30 Head buzz intensifying rapidly.  Starting to feel a little sleepy.  I Drink some Ice Tea.</p><p>T + 2:00 Buzz like strong LSD intensifying.  Strong visuals. Melting objects etc.  At this point I was thrilled.  No Nausea.</p><p>T + 2:30 I eat another seed.</p><p>T + 3:00 Start to feel a little panic.  Very strange since I have a very solid career, health, love life, money, anything I want for the most part.  I can't understand why I am panicking.</p><p>T + 4:00 till T + 12:00 Eight hours of terror.  My heart was beating so hard that I almost went to the emergency room but being the veteran that I am... I rode it out.</p><p>I have had a few semi bad experiences with drugs including a couple of times where I may have come very close to an OD but this was light-years beyond anything I have ever experienced.  I believe that my bad experience was most likely just me.  But I wanted to share this in case anyone has any reservations.  It can be bad.</p>",
