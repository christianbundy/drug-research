 "report": [
  "<p>I read about this stuff somewhere on the net. The report claimed you could eat it (aprox. 5 flowers worth. Another report claimed you could let it steep overnight in a bottle of wine and then drink it the next day to achieve effects. I tried eating aprox. 5 tablespoons of the dried, crushed mix. No noticable effect after several hours.",
  "Next I attempted to brew a tea from the mix. It actually worked to a noticable extent. I felt an opiod-like buzz, mostly in my head (especially the temple region. I only brewed the tea for 3-5 minutes. Perhaps brewing it longer will bring better results). The tea wasn't a tasty beverage, but with sugar and on ice it was downable.",
  "Finally, I tried smoking it. I took 2 small bowls through a water pipe concocted out of a mountain dew bottle and within a few seconds after inhaling I felt a tingling sensation on the crown of my head. I then began to notice a light, marijuana-like high. It wasn't as stoney as marijuana, but a had a defininate buzz-on! I am going to purchase some more and use it to strech my ganja out.",
  "I wonder if there is a better way of extracting the 'opium like' alkaloids in from the plant to reach an even fuller effect? All in all decent stuff, much better than that dream herb crap!</p>"
