 "report": "<p>I was trying to get the hallucinogenic effect of hyoscyamine on this trip, I took 25 tabs of .375mg. After 20 hours I figured nothing was happening then I realized that I was on a powerful anti-psychotic. It appears seroquel will arrest any hallucinogenic episodes, schizophrenic or drug induced.</p>",
