It's suspected that the 'Mitsubishi' pill she had taken may have contained a cheap but deadly amphetamine substitute, PMA.</p><p>The teenager went into a coma last Sunday and was taken to Buskerud central hospital. She never regained consciousness.</p><p>Light-brown tablets were discovered in her jacket pocket with a Mitsubishi car logo on one side and a cross on the other.</p><p>White tablets with the same markings have claimed the lives of two men in Denmark this summer. Theses pills contained the amphetamine substitute known as PMA, or 4 methoxy metamphetamine.</p><p>The tablets found on the girl have not yet been analysed.</p>",
