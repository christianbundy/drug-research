  "I have had many years experience with mushrooms and LSD so I thought to myself this would be an easy one...after all it is legal to buy, how can anything legal be any good. My husband and I both ate 48.5 grams dried powder, we first took 50mg of Dramamine and then at 4:00 p.m we set about swallowing 10 00 gelcaps every 10 minutes for and hour, we did this to protect our stomach's.",
  "We swallowed  a total of 55 pills and waited, and waited, and waited...then it happened, around 7:00 P.M I started to feel the slow climb to the top, we took another 10 pills just for the fun of it, it took about another hour to come on full but once it did...WOW.. that is all I can say, I peaked for at least 5-6 hours...it was a constant peek, totally unbelievable. This cactus deserves respect, use it wisely and she will be good to you."
