  "<p>Last August (2011), about 8 months ago, I purchased a 100mg bag of pure 4-HO-DMT, or Psilocin.  I ingested roughly 27mg of the fine white powder, orally, in 2 separate capsules about 80 minutes apart (about 16mg in the first pill and about 11mg in the second).  What followed was an extremely humbling experience with vivid visuals and strong emotional feelings, in addition to overall strange sensations like my brain falling into my throat, or getting urinated upon by a large mammal of some kind, or shrinking to the size of a small child.  I described my trip, and the effects of the chemical, as savage in nature because of the style of visuals that I experienced.",
  "Since that experience I have ingested psilocin a fair number of times (more than 10, maybe 20 at most).  It has become my favorite psychedelic by far.  This is just a matter of opinion, but Psilocin beats LSD, 2C-B/C/D/E/I, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, Moxy/Foxy, and everything else, at least in my mind.  Ive never tried DMT or mescaline, so I cannot honestly make a comparison to either of those substances, but I cant imagine them being more benign and versatile than Psilocin.",
  "Ive tried varying dosages, but usually I start with 15-25mg and then, sometimes, Ill take an additional 5-10mg after the peak starts to dwindle.  These 5-10mg doses usually are quite effective at rejuvenating fading visuals, and cause no stomach issues.  It is at this point that I should mention that I have never been able to replicate the savage style visuals that I experienced during my first trip.  Every Psilocin trip after the first one was very colorful and light-hearted and fun.  Communication is easy at lower dosages but quickly becomes difficult as I creep above 25mg.  Psilocin is more clear-headed than mushrooms, I can say that with confidence at this point.  Also, I could hypothesize that the additional active compounds in mushrooms are what cause the mind fuck or severe confusion which can occur on high dosages of Psilocybin mushrooms (cubensis specifically), like Baeocystin and Norbaeocystin.",
  "However, this report is not about those trips, it is about my most recent trip.",
  "Last Friday, April 27th, 2012 I decided that I was going to take some Psilocin.  I had worked 42 hours in the 5 days before-hand, only slightly more than usual, and felt a particular need to unwind.  I didnt have to work again until Sunday, which gave me the whole of Saturday to recover from whatever I would do on Friday.  I decided I was going to start on the higher side, with a 25mg dose, and see where that took me.  It had been a few weeks, at least, since my last Psilocin experience, so my tryptamine tolerance was next to nil.",
  "I did not intend on writing about this experience, and as a result I did not write anything down as it happened, nor did I make an effort to note the timing of doses and peak effects, so Ill do the best I can.",
  "Sometime between 6pm and 7pm, around 6:30 I would say, I took the first capsule with 25mg in it.  I had intended for this to be my only dose of Psilocin for the night, however that was not to be.",
  "I started the night by putting on a couple of episodes of Game of Thrones Season 2 to pass the time while waiting for the welcomed mind-alteration to wash over me, and before the first episode was over I was already beginning to feel the, now familiar, early effects.",
  "I know people who use Psilocin in public settings, at clubs and raves and parties and such, and theyre usually only taking about 10-20mg, and mixing it with who-knows what else; but personally I like to take Psilocin at home, where I can lay down on my bed, which is where I spend 95% of my time while tripping.  I think there may be potential in mixing Psilocin with MDMA for improved motivation and movement capabilities but unfortunately the opportunity hasnt presented itself yet.",
  "So there I lay, on my bed, face down with one eye closed and one eye open.  I start noticing the two separate images start to meld in the center, creating one solid interpretation from the two different realities.  The visuals at this point cannot be ignored, and are strong enough for most days, but nothing exceptional or worth mention.  Im feeling great, but not as good as hoped, so I decide Ill quickly measure out and ingest another 15mg capsule.  The process of weighing and capping is not hindered much by the 25mg of Psilocin already in me, and Im feeling good about having a strong experience.  At this point its probably about 8:45pm, or roughly two hours after the initial ingestion, and Ive also decided that Im going to watch Tropic Thunder in 1080 HD while waiting for the 2nd capsule to take effect.  I chose Tropic Thunder because its a comedy (an especially good one, in my opinion) and also because it has spectacular scenery which lends well to the psychedelic experience and mindset.  Tropical jungles and big, fiery explosions and lots of hilarity; sounded like a good mix to me.",
  "At about 9pm the movie goes on and back on the bed I go.  About 30 minutes into the movie I decided I wanted to vaporize some high quality cannabis to try and further encourage a psychedelic mindset and improve the visuals.  I put a half gram or so into my vaporizer and did 3 bags at 175, 180, and 190 degrees Celsius respectively.  By 9:45 or 10:00 I had finished all 3 bags and went back to the bed to keep watching Tropic Thunder.  I remember almost immediately after laying down that something was building inside me, I felt different than before.",
  "The visuals started intensifying, slowly.  I remember what was happening in the movie at the exact moment the effects started increasing, Nick Nolte was using a flamethrower and screaming has he spewed fire.  The visuals were beautiful, and vibrant, with crisp, bold colors and very defined borders.  The fire seemed to almost come off the screen.  My entire field of vision was being engulfed by the power of the Psilocin, even in my peripheral vision I could see beams of light shooting off of objects, seemingly piercing my eyes and penetrating directly into my brain.  I could feel the light touching me, not in a painful way, just a light pressure, as if to say Hello without being annoying.  Objects in the room began to glow all sorts of colors, as if they had an aura unique to them and I could also see visual effects and distortions which seemed to hang in mid-air, something Ive only seen a few times, most memorably on a combination of 4-Aco-DMT and 5-MeO-MIPT.  That is to say, rather than just looking at something and seeing the two dimensional visual distortions we all know and love, I was seeing three dimensions of this psychedelic world, with manifestations of light appearing between me and the opaque object Im focused on.  Like clouds made of frozen, color-changing light particles, shifting slowly enough to see them for all that they are.  I had a hard time focusing on one thing or another, but instead tried not to blink and just soak in the grandeur and beauty of the scene before me.",
  "So Im on my bed about 10 feet away from my computer monitor with the movie on it, and Im lying on my side looking in the direction of the monitor, so my entire field of vision is made up of the computer tower, both monitors, the computer desk, the computer chair, and a tall wooden bookshelf.  Around the computer desk I start to see a doorway, or gateway, starting to form.  This was an older style peaked-top doorway (with a pediment at the top; Google it, I had to) and it was just framing the computer desk and monitors, but was probably 7 or 8 feet tall.  There was no actual door, or light coming from within, but it was just adding to the intensity of what I was seeing, providing a sort of fantastic surrealism.  At about this time the borders of certain objects (like the computer desk) became comprised entirely of small color-changing pentagons that were rolling in a clock-wise rotation around objects, at the borders.  I believe I actually spoke out loud and said, in a very Keanu Reeves sort of way, Whoa.  Its very difficult to explain what I was seeing.  If you had asked me, right in that moment, to describe everything happening, I could not have done it.  Too much was happening, and my communication skills were diminished severely at this point (possibly because of the cannabis).  My mind was racing, my eyes straining to keep open, my mouth is becoming dry from staring slack-jawed.  Even now, days after this trip, its hard to find the words that can even attempt to describe it.  It was fucking awesome; clearly awesome enough to inspire me to write this half-assed report despite being so ill-prepared.",
  "I continued to watch the pentagons and light-clouds and Tropic Thunder for another 30 minutes or so, completely at peace and loving every moment until the peak started to fade into a more basic experience.  Unfortunately my memories of this night get kind of fuzzy right after the peak, at least as far as specific visuals, but I didnt end up falling asleep until 2 or 3 am, despite being tired by midnight.",
  "Overall I would say Psilocin is a versatile drug, capable of taking many different forms.  In my time using it Ive had my ego shattered with savage visions of blood, sex, and death, Ive also used it for therapeutic purposes and went through a very special sort of trip that involved re-living the day that my mom died (almost 10 years ago) but from the point of view of an adult.  I didnt cry during that trip, but it was indeed a powerful experience.  Not fun, per se, but beneficial and burden-lifting.  Ive also used Psilocin (primarily) for recreational purposes, to just escape the day-to-day world and open my mind to new ideas and emotions.  Psilocin has helped me to discover for myself certain things that I could improve about my actions and my life and how I can better help the people around me who matter most.  Overall it has improved the quality of my life, on multiple occasions, and Ive yet to have a single bad trip or nausea or any other health issues.",
  "Id have to say that my initial assessment of this chemical being savage is incorrect.  That first experience with Psilocin was certainly very different from the rest of them, but as I explained, it can really be used for just about anything.  If youve got the right mindset, know what you want, and are smart about your dosages, Psilocin can be one of the greatest psychedelic tools in the world.  Or, it can be a lot of fun.</p>"
