 "report": "<p>I found a large stand of St John's Wort growing over the summer.  I picked several whole plants and allowed them to sun-dry on a hot sunny day.  I collected the dried leaves and flowers. I use a good wildflower field guide to identify the plant.</p><p>I tried a small pinch in a pipe.  The taste reminded me of a stale cig but did not have the harsh feel to it.  Not flavorful at all, a subtle taste.  It burns fast but that must be dependent on the humidity of the leaves.  The feeling was subtle and brief but I was sure it felt like St John's Wort capsules that one can buy from a pharmacy.</p><p>I stepped up the dose to a full tobacco pipe bowl.  Wow.  It was an uplifting feeling.  Very refreshing.  Highly enjoyable.  Goes well with sage mixed in.  Joints are fun too but burn quickly.  Next time, I will not dry it out to a crisp.</p>",
