 "report": [
  "I recently went to a music festival and there I thought would be a good time to let go because of spring break and have an even better time at this rave. over the course of 8 hours I had 1 blue dollar (ecstasy) 3 hours into the rave. And then an hour later had a blue crown (ecstacy). Later on I meet some people that were selling 2C-I. I had ever heard of it before. they told me it was a lot like acid, but I had never had that either.",
  "I have done mushrooms twice before which is the only hallucinogen that I have done. I opened the capsule and poured the powder on my tongue to ingest it for faster effects. After 45 minutes I started to have fairly intense hallucinations. I sat on a hill watching the stages in the distance with their lasers and lights. I would see spin offs and flares of fire coming from the lasers. When trying to use my phone the screen looks like water drops were falling on water so I was very difficult to use my phone. When I would be dancing the people's faces around me were constantly changing and it was hard to make out anyones face no matter how close they were. Sometimes I would even see extra faces right next to someone as if I was seeing their face in double vision.",
  "I had many different visual hallucinations which were pretty intense but were not scary or disturbing. They were pretty fun hallucinations actually. Sometimes I had to look very hard at my friends faces to see who they were (maybe it was because of the darkness). After dancing I sat back down on the hill and had a thinking session with some of my friends just like someone on acid would have. the mental high go fairly intense after about 5 hours and started to make me fairly paranoid. But the paranoia lasted less then an hour. All in all 2C-I was a good trip."
