 "report": "</p>[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.]</p><p>I've been an opiate addict for years and (of coarse) my preferred delivery system is injection.  I got one of these orange octagons so like every thing else, I shot it.  I experienced instant withdrawal symptoms (diahrea, nausea).  My whole body went tingly and I experienced extreme vertigo.  I later found out that there is another drug in this pill which is an opiate inhibitor.  I have yet to take as directed so it may be very good.  Just my 2 cents.</p>",
