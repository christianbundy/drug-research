When I drank Absinthe I felt great increased energy, 'permasmile', euphoria, and very social.  However i also felt nausia and anxiety.",
  "If you believe Absinthe to be a psycoactive wait untill you quit!!  In my experience, the withdraw from Absinthe from someone who has been drinking for a while is utterly horrible.  Sleeplessness, constant fear, clenching of teeth, hullucinations, and if you ever wanted to know how it feels to be completely insane wait till you start having Absinthe withdraws.",
