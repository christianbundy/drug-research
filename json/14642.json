  "<p>The reason I am writing this is because back in Febuary 2002 I",
  "decided to experiement with Morning Glory seeds. I accidentally",
  "came upon this website and actually researched the seeds before",
  "trying them. You guys gave me so much good information that I",
  "decided I should give back.",
  "Here's how it all happened for me. On 1 afternoon I went up to",
  "the local K-Mart to look for MG:HB seeds. While in there I found",
  "Martha Stewart brand MG:HB seeds. I proceeded to buy 4 packs",
  "(6grams, roughly 240 seeds). Then I came home and prepared the",
  "seeds. I washed them with dish washer soap, then dryed them on a",
  "paper towel, then ground them up in a coffee grinder.",
  "At 9pm I poured the seeds into a cup of water. Then drank the",
  "potion and ate the remaining chunks of seeds. It was pretty",
  "nasty but definetly wasn't that bad. At about 20 minutes the",
  "effects started to kick in. But these were mild effects. Also",
  "though, my stomach started to hurt and my limbs became very",
  "heavy. So i drank some pepto to help my stomach. At about 1 hour",
  "the effects really started to kick. And once the trip began to",
  "take over all stomach pain just left. At 1st I began to think of",
  "it as just a mild acid trip, which I was happy with. It wasn't",
  "untill about 2 or 3 hours into it that the MG trip REALLY began",
  "to kick hard. Then it felt exactly like an acid trip. Walls were",
  "rolling and breathing. When i walked around the house the floor",
  "began to slant. It felt like the world was tilted. Once I turned",
  "the kitchen light on I was very light senstive. It felt as if",
  "everything was glowing around me. Best way to describe it is,",
  "imagine walking out into the street in the middle of the night,",
  "standing directly under a street light, you can feel the light",
  "beaming down on you. Honestly, the peak lasted from about 11pm",
  "to 5am. It was very intense and lasted for a very long time. and",
  "i mean peaking, I'm not counting the 'afterglow', which as",
  "everyone knows goes on for many hours after the peak is gone.",
  "In conclusion, I highly recommend it, it was fantastic. I've",
  "read many negative reports on here, and I've come to many",
  "conclusions. Maybe they had to low a dosage, got bad seeds, or",
  "weakened the seeds during the extraction process. My advice,",
  "get at least 6grams, clean them, dry them, grind them, drink",
  "them. And don't forget the pepto.</p>"
