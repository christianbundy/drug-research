  "<p>While my trip to Peru may have seemed abrupt at the time, in retrospect my involvement with this substance know as ayahuasca was completely in step with the direction I had been headed for quite some time. Even now, I can't identify a single rational reason why I decided to fly to the jungle and test my fate, though there was a nagging curiosity that would not go away. I felt I needed to go.",
  "From what I had heard time and time again, ayahuasca not only had the ability to heal the sick, but it could also open a direct line of communication to something supreme inside ourselves. With just a small amount of planning and having never set foot in South America, I booked a trip to Refugio Altiplano, an ayahuasca retreat center outside of Iquitos, Peru. During my time there, I was able to shoot some amazing footage and document the entire experience in a short I called 'Eye of the Needle, An Ayahuasca Journey'.",
