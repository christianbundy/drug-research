 "report": "<p>I bought 25 grams of fresh, organic catnip. Tried it as a tea, and noticed only very mild relaxation. I then took many bong hits, followed by a massive joint, and felt absolutely nothing apart from a VERY mild mellow feeling. I've tried it again on numerous occasions, all to no avail. I understand that the effects of catnip vary from individual to individual, but for me it did next to nothing.</p>",
