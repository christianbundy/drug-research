 "report": "<p>This is an account of the recreational use of Phentermine, which is supposedly similar to Amphetamines. The pills are 30mg. For this experience I am only taking 1 pill to see how my body reacts. Note: I have only had one experience with Methamphetamine and I was drunk at the time so I do not remember the feelings other than I could not go to sleep. Therefore, I have no real experience with stimulants to compare this to.</p><p>11am  Have the day off so I decided to try Phentermine which my parent uses for weight loss. Decided to eat pizza first because the drug causes a loss in appetite.</p><p>12pm  Took one dose of Phentermine 30mg orally.</p><p>1pm - Not really feeling Euphoric, just a little speedy as I started to clean my room.</p><p>1:30pm  Starting to feel a *very* mild sense of euphoria, a little mood uplift. Still cleaning room, it feels good when I clean.</p><p>2pm - No Change  room is cleaned.</p><p>3:30pm  Just played my guitar for an hour and a half still feeling the same, I have a feeling either this stuff is time released or that this is the peak. I am going to exercise now.</p><p>4:00pm  Finished exercising, it felt great. I cant tell if lack of fatigue was due to the Phentermine or just my muscles becoming more efficient. I still dont notice much of a difference in mood. I am now going to study to see if I can concentrate better.</p><p>11:00pm  Studying was a lot easier, my mind was able to absorb the information easier and I was able to concentrate better. Didnt have an appetite (guess the pills work) but ate dinner anyway. Im not tired but I need to force myself to go to bed.</p><p>All in all, it was an interesting experience. Im sure I had increased energy throughout the day not much euphoria but it would be interesting to increase the dosage to see if it brought about euphoric effects.</p>",
