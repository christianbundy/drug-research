 "report": [
  "It really is affecting me in a way inconsistent to what I thought it should. I am currently writing this about 30 min. after ingesting both zolpidem pills. The effects are difficult to describe but I'm feeling various things right now. I am in the center while everything around me sways or spins in slow motion. Music fits well with the motions of the environment. I feel a strong disassociation between my mind and body. Simply put my mind is drift, drift, drifting, while my body melts into a puddle of R&R and everything just sways and moves around me.",
  "This has so far been a pleasant experience. I'll try it in combination with marijuana and perhaps a small dosage of percs, who knows. Exploration is fun. Writing while on this is a bit difficult, not anything like writing while on Robo."
