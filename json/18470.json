 "report": [
  "Recently, my friend introduced me to rolling tobacco which I have grown to love. He puts lavender or a dash of cinnamon into his rolled cigarettes. I decided to try it myself.",
  "I would either put a stalk of it into the pouch for the smell to rub off onto the tobacco, or place a small amount of flowers directly into the pouch.",
  "I don't notice a difference in the buzz, but I do notice a pleasent taste difference and slight sedative effects that may be placebo.",
  "I do enjoy adding lavander flavor to my tobacco."
