 "report": "<p>I read up on the internet about 'red-rock' opium before hooking up. It's been available for God knows how long. I will admit it has no attributes related to heroin or oxy-cots, but it fucked me and my boys up last weekend. We usually can't chug a half-gallon of vodka - each! And then go to work 3 hours later.</p><p>I whipped out the smoke as we drank and talked shit until sunrise. Our memories and energy levels contradicted each other. No matter what I read about red-rock, I maintain my own opinion. Every time I fuck with it, weird shit happens and I regret it the next day! I seriously doubt the stuff I get is dragons blood, it's more effective than 'chronic'. In fact everyone that smoked the red-rock, the next day thought they smoked high-grade pot. I can guarantee you they didn't. We never know with red-rock.</p>",
