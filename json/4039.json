  "<p>I have had a few experiences with Salvia Divinorum, ranging from the subtle and relatively easy to define to the incredible and impossible to describe. Up until recently however, I had never witnessed somebody else under the influence of Salvia. When I did so earlier this week I made an important observation.",
  "A friend had decided that the time was right to experience Salvia so I explained the importance of set and setting and asked him to lie down and relax, breathing deeply and slowly for a few minutes whilst I prepared the water pipe. Both of us were mildly stoned after vaporising some THC oil approximately an hour earlier. When he felt ready he brought the tube to his mouth and I lit the bowl. I had explained earlier that Salvinorin A metabolises quite quickly in the body so that it's important to get as much into the lungs as possible and to hold it there. I had also mentioned that he would know after the first lungful whether he needed more, and he duly took a second hit as I lit the bowl again.",
  "Then, within the space of a second all his muscles relaxed, his breathing became regular and sounded like snoring, and his eyes flickered rapidly from side to side under his eyelids. I'm betting that if an EEG (Electroencephalograph) machine were connected to his scalp his brain would have exhibited a predominant theta state, indicative of dreaming activity.",
  "He found his experience typically hard to describe but did not say it was akin to a dream. The next time I take Salvia I will wear my Novadreamer (a device which measures and records eye movement to initiate lucid dreaming) to check whether the same effects occur, as I prefer taking Salvia on my own (although I advise anyone new to Salvia to always have a sitter present).</p>"
