 "report": [
  "My experience psychedelics is more than most and I know what my body can handle.  After having some legit L this summer and the many doses I had then were different than these... I've heard a lot about 25i before ingesting last night and have been wanting to do it and experience life as a new being.  Was going to drop 3 hits for the first time but my friend I got these from said I should just do 2, as they are very potent.",
  "Dosage is unknown as of now, I asked what it was and buddy hasn't gotten back to me yet.",
  "6:53 PM",
  "T:+ 0:00hrs - Put two tabs in between me lower gum and lip in the front.",
  "T:+ 0:20hrs - Started to feel a little eye distortion and a shifting of the ceiling pattern. Ate what was left of the tabs.  Was very pleased with the visuals at this early in the trip.",
  "Smoked some good nugs at the start of the hour mark, this only intensified things more.",
  "T:+ 1:00hrs - Effects keep intensifying as the trip goes deeper.  Started to freak out a little bit at this point because I didn't know what was happening to my body. Walked around a little bit drank some water and laid down.  At this point of looking at the ceiling I calmed down and started to come one with the trip.",
  "T:+ 1:30ish hrs - I feel everything in the universe coming at me and through me.  My brother and his girlfriend were watching some TV and as I watched I had a slight 3D vision, could see the muscles and veins on the outside of the skin.  That was definitely tripping me out big time. Another way of putting it is to say that I say everything and nothing at the same time.",
  "T:+ ?? - Lost track of time and just got lost in the intense headspace of the journey I was embarking on.  Reminded me of the DMT headspace I experienced earlier this year.  I remember just thinking about everything and nothing at the same time.  Around this time an old neighbor and friend stopped by, I was completely out of this reality and into the one I had created, and could barely connect with what they were saying.  Only things I really connected on were some memories him and my brother were talking about, and it took some time before I even did that.  I keep getting lost in the kaleidoscopic of colors and fractals throughout the apartment. Trying to think of whats going on around me and inside of me.  It felt as if I had no body in between my head and feet, only the feeling of my insides were there.",
  "T: 3:14hrs - At this time I decide to try and walk back home, I've been wanting to talk a walk at night while frying this hard.  Right when I walk out I look up into what I perceived as the sky.  Saw every little fractal of life in the stars as I was walking.  Felt very connected with everything, a spiritual awakening you could call it.  Walking home was kind of difficult as I kept getting lost in the space of the night and my ability to walk was hindered at that.  While I was walking home, I noticed a line of cars coming and going from both directions and they didn't seem like ordinary cars or people driving them.  All the cars was using the middle of the two lanes instead of one particular lane, and they kept dipping in and out of the side streets of the neighborhood.  I don't know if if the 25 that made me realize this or the fact that I had seen the same cars pass by me as I was getting closer to my house.  I walked into the middle turn lane of the street and none of the cars seemed to even notice I was there still following on their predetermined paths.",
  "T:+ 4:45hrs - I finally make it back to my house after the short mile or so walk that seemed to last forever.  Finally got inside and realized I brought in nugs to the house...a big no no as my parents are against me smoking still :/  Went back outside smoked a little bit, and that helped restart some the trip.  I make it back inside and start watching TV again noticing I can come in and out of seeing the actors' veins/muscles as the shows went on.  Seeing this reminded of some Alex Grey paintings I look at online.",
  "T:+ 6:35hrs - At this time I mute the TV and lay back to relax and close my eyes.  Definitely felt a higher sense of headspace.  As I lay there my body felt one with my bed as if they had morphed together in the reality I was in, this happened everytime I sat/laid down anywhere.  The CEVs I was getting were very spiritual and almost felt natural as if I was supposed to see them all along.  I laid there and tried to think of what had happened thus far in the night and the more I tried thinking the more I got lost.  A very different way of thinking came about me during this, a higher sense of what was happening in the universe.",
  "T:+ 8:00-11:25hrs - At this time the TV was off and I tried to get some rest which was not happening anytime soon I could tell.  The more I laid there the more the headspace expanded and the dark room helped illuminate  a new light in which I could only see.  As the day progressed I started to come down and come back to the reality before I had left this place. ",
  "At this point I just thought about what I had experienced through the night and what I could compare it to, but that could be nothing as I have never had such a full fulling trip. Definitely going to venture into the universe again, this time with a better understanding of what will happen this time.  Overall I would have to say one of the best fries I have had ever..felt connected with everything around me, started to pick up on other peoples' thoughts as I was in this headspace...Visuals were by far the best I have ever had aside from DMT meditation visuals."
