 "report": "<p>This was my first time smoking salvia, and my second time with any type of hallucinogen. I had a fairly typical trip in that I hallucinated, went somewhere else, and laughed a lot.</p><p>However, since that night, which was over 2 weeks ago, I've had incredibly vivid nature dreams almost every night. They all involve animals: dogs, puppies, owls, eagles, coyotes, wolves, and elephants to name a few. I can talk to the animals in every dream, sometimes psychically. The dreams consistently feature atmospheric effects such as clouds that speak to me and have faces, bright full moons, bright blue sky, oscillating rainbows, clouds pouring slowly and with great detail over mountain tops, or the vivid effect of shimmering heat in the air. These dreams did not occur before my salvia experience.</p>",
