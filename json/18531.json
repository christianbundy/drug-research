  "0m Insufflated 30 mg of powdered 2CB.  It hurt my nose like hell.",
  "5m Tripping almost instantly.  It's almost too intense.  Got an amazing body buzz and have a hard time standing and talking.  There's neon yellow, pink, orange, green, and blues all over.  Patterns are moving and it looks like I'm inside a colored crystal or kaleidescope.  The guys seemed to get really hot, but me and the other girl seemed to be cold.  Then I got comfortable.",
  "30m I settle into a comfortable trip.  I still have intense visuals and a body buzz, but I can now think and talk.  I didn't lose my appetite on this or get nauseous like acid or ecstasy.  I feel very erotic and amazing.  The colors are so pretty.  They are like nothing I've seen.  Very neon.  My friend was playing xbox and it looked like clay.  It was snowing outside and looked so beautiful.  There are tracers as well.  We called them issers because a person would leave the room but you'd still see them there.  They were very long tracers.",
  "4hr  I start to taper down a bit.  Still lots of visuals, but not as intense.  I insufflate another 30mg and start tripping intensely again.  My boyfriend and I went into the complete dark and we were kissing.  It felt so amazing.  All I could see was just a neon explosion of colors whether my eyes were open or not.  The body buzz makes sex amazing.  The kaleidescope of colors is so bright and intense that I can see the basic gist of what's around me, but it's really hard to pay attention to details, like lighting a cigarette.  I could see the air, feel the music.  Sometimes when I talked I could hear echoing in my head.",
  "8hr  We decide to go for broke and insufflate another 30 mg.  It seems the people that ate it didn't trip as hard.  It hurt like hell, but it's better to take it straight to the head.  We're rocking out to tool and dancing.  We decide to go for a walk up town to buy cigarettes.  We went into the Casey's gas station and the tiled floor was just swimming with colors.  We walked back and watched the trees dance and move.  We go back inside and watch my friend play guitar.  He looks like he has 100 fingers. ",
  "12 hr We trip hard for another 4 hours.  I'm still seeing amazing colors, but I have to go home.  It's about 4 am.  I'm driving in the snow and it looks insane.  (I wouldn't recommend driving on drugs or alcohol.) [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  I went home and layed in bed eating cheerios.  I try to close my eyes but I see bright neon  colors for another couple hours. ",
  "14 hr I finally fall asleep.",
  "The next day I didn't wake up to any sort of hangover feeling or any other side effects.  I slept pretty well  What's so amazing about this drug is if I bump up I start at a peak trip again.  It feels so amazing and I've never seen colors like this.  I would do it 100 more times."
