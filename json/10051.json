 "report": "<p>First off, the only reason I tried the stuff is because I couldn't find any Kava Kava root at the grocery store, so consequently I felt forced to buy some other root/herb with similar described effects. The bottle said 'for tension relief and mood enhancer,' so I gave it a shot.</p><p>My first observation was in fact the very distinct rotten fruit mixed with a bunch of dirty socks smell. I wondered momentarily if it was really worth the effort to force them down. Being such a Kava enthusiast, I figured it was my duty to experiment with closely related roots.</p><p>I took the 8 caplets and chased it with some soda to avoid the aftertaste, which can work. I felt and tasted the root for nearly 3 hours afterwards, so I would suggest eating beforehand. I went to my mothers house because I was very bored, still. No affects as of 45 min. after consumption.</p><p>I started feeling a bit nauseated and cramped, maybe slightly calmer than before but still uncomfortable. All night my stomach was stirred up, but the feeling of looseness and free spiritedness progressively increased until I fell asleep. It wasn't necessarily easier for me to sleep, but I did awake feeling rested and in good mood. Later that night, I ended up using marijuana. Much like Kava, Valerian provided me with an unsubtle difference in effect. I felt comfortable in every way, loose, unbalanced, in less control of motor skills but in great control over my emotions. It is possible still that the true effects of the Valerian root made little difference on my high, but having the right attitude can make the biggest difference.</p><p>I would not recommend this drug to recreational users whereas without mixing other chemicals. Not enough effect by itself. It seems to be a plant that possibly can affect a wide variety of users in completely different fashions, but I was not impressed.</p>",
