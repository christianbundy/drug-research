 "report": "<p>My god, I write this as I am experiencing one of the worst things ever.  Sinicuichi, don't do it.  I seems like 3 or 4 other people had the same report I'm going to give.  I am SORE.  My entire body aches.  My fingers hurt as I type this.  It is about 1.5 hours after ingestion.  I have ingested about a spoonful of goop that was the result of boiling down 1 ounce of Sinicuichi leaves.  There was a slight stoney feeling between the naseau and intense (And I MEAN INTENSE) muscle soreness.  I hope my heart hangs on, as it's a muscle.</p><p>NOT WORTH IT.</p>",
