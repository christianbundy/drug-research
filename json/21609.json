 "report": "<p>Just a general note about my experience with poppers (Amyl Nitrite / Butyl Nitrite), the quality differs greatly, with 'liquid gold' being the best in my experience. Sometimes I get really bad banging headaches, always my heartrate goes through the roof, loss of bodily control (similar to being drunk, but less severe) the effects wear off after 5 minutes, and it's possible to continue my normal day. I've heard that if a person does too much at once their lips turn blue for a while, but I've never experienced this myself. Good when mixed with caffeine and alcohol. In the UK they're cheap and legal (2.50 to 5 for a small bottle)..</p>",
