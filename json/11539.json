  "After seven full days without Paxil (I took 40mg/day for five years), I couldn't stand the constant crying over nothing and the body shocks that are so well known by other people going through Paxil withdrawals, so I took 100 mg 5-HTP. After a couple of hours, I didn't notice any difference in my attitude, and my withdrawal symptoms were just as severe as before."
