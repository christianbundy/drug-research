 "report": [
  "<p>I happened to have on my possession in preparation for an upcoming party some mephedrone and some BZP. I am a little bit worried because still very little is known about mephedrone and a simple google search find no result for the combination of these two substances. I took on myself to test it with moderate dosage. I took orally 85mg bzp and 12mg tfmpp.",
  "An our and a half later I was definately under the effect of the bzp. At this point I decide to make a test, I snorted a very very small amount of mephedrone. And what happened at this moment stupefactied me, in a matter of seconds of snorting the small bump I felt the bzp high desapeared, left only with a slight stoned feeling. After 15 minutes on this disappointing state, I did more mephedrone and felt the expected mephedrone high, I did not use anymore BZP that night. I did not notice an increase in heart rate of the mixing of the 2 substances.",
  "In conclusion, it appears to be no advantage in mixing these two substances, as the mephedrone appears to cancel the euphoric type of high that is felt with bzp.",
