  "The smoke is very enjoyable.  It is tasty and fairly smooth.",
  "At first I don't think anything is happening.  The more I try to feel something the less it works.  I've been smoking it the last few days (mostly bats, a few bowls, some bongs) and I'm noticing more and more that I just stop and smile more.  I'm not as rushed or hurried... I'm not as concerned with things that I can't control.  I don't notice a high, rather a difference in myself - a welcome relaxation.  Almost... tranquility.",
  "The nicest thing about it is that it doesn't really impair me at all.  I feel very lucid."
