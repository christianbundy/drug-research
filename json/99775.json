 "report": "<p>I am 42 years old. My drug history:</p><p>Smoke weed more days than not. I occasionally go a few days without but prefer to have some in. Recently I've had mephedrone, speed, coke, blue pearl and a few other legal highs which I can't remember the names of. In the past I've tried mushrooms, LSD, heroin (once - it made me sick), ecstasy and combinations of all the above (except heroin). I smoke hand rolled cigarettes.</p><p>I bought some Ethylphenidate. It took 4 days to arrive in a padded envelope. Inside this envelope was a small brown envelope containing a folded plastic, resealable bag. Inside this bag was a smaller resealable plastic bag containing the Ethylphenidate.</p><p>The drug itself is a white crystalline powder.</p><p>The day it arrived, I dipped a dry finger and tasted a tiny amount. It had the usual 'miscellaneous research chemical' taste but I could feel the effects within about 5-10 minutes. The effects off such a small amount were minimal but I could definitely feel a nice buzz.</p><p>At around 10pm that evening, after about 3 pints of beer, I tried snorting a small line. The line was about a third the size I'd normally do if I were taking blue pearl, mephedrone etc. I could feel it almost instantly. It was about as fast as coke to hit. I didn't crush it up at all as it was already a very fine powder.</p><p>After about half an hour, I really wanted to have some more. I'd drunk another pint or so of beer but did not feel drunk. I did another very small line. Again I got the lovely instant effect. I could still feel the buzz from the last lot but the hit from the fresh buzz was most welcome.</p><p>I didn't have any more but spent the rest of the evening in a lovely, almost E like state. I spent a lot of my time writing down my experiences for a close friend who also likes to experiment. I also felt the urge to smoke more cigarettes than usual but this is normal for me on these type of drugs. The next day I felt slightly rough but no more than any other drug/alcohol combo I've tried.</p><p>It's 4 days later and the Mrs. has gone to bed. I have 3 days off but work nights so normally stay up pretty late on my days off. I've had another 3 pints of beer. I wasn't going to but decided at about 11pm to have a small line. Aware of how it went last time, I prepared an extremely small line. We're talking about 3cm long and about as thin as you can get it before it disappears.</p><p>I snorted the micro-line and, after the mild nostril burn, felt the familiar lovely rush. This stuff is amazing. Just sitting here sort of watching telly but not really paying attention. Had another couple of pints. Feeling amazing.</p><p>My daughter came downstairs at about 0100 and I had a great chat with her. I didn't feel self conscious or too spaced out to talk. I'm getting a bit of the lovey-dovey feel of a nice E but not quite as strong.</p><p>Most of the legal high powders I've tried have been comparable to various combinations of E, speed and coke. Some have been more speedy, some more cokey and some more like a nice E. None of them have have had much of a personality of their own until this one.</p><p>Ethylphenidate gives a swift, buzzy high upon first dose. This settles down to a long-lasting, very pleasant few hours. I'm alert, fidgety -but not unpleasantly so,- and desperate to do something.</p><p>I do have to fight the urge to re-dose. I've had 3 of these tiny lines but constantly feel like I want another one. This stuff makes me want to write like no other drug I've tried. I suspect if someone else were here, I'd be boring their socks off with constant talking. Last time I spent most of the time writing constant email updates to my friend; this time I've searched out this site to share my feelings and experiences.</p><p>Overall I'd rate this as one of my favourite highs. I reckon I'd prefer some extraordinary coke but that stuff is extremely rare and expensive and I've only had it a couple of times. This stuff is miles better than your average street coke and certainly the best legal high I've tried so far.</p>",
