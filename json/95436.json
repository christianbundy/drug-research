 "report": "<p>Set : My friend's flat</p><p>Setting : I was feeling pretty good, but didn't want to stay too late and take too much because we already took some 3 days ago, so I wanted to wait a little. Well, I didn't..</p><p>So we were at my flat, I had 500mg of 2c-d, which we put into 20 capsules, making 25mg capsules, which we ended up separating in half through the night. I took a small one of 15mg of the remaining powder that spilled on the table, and I took half a cap, just after. F and A did the same, and we went to F's flat for the party. It was 8:00PM at the time.</p><p>By 8:30, the effects started, as we were going to the party by foot. The thing that we all noticed the most was how it affected sound, and we felt like our brain on overdrive, we could hear lots of detail that we wouldn't be usually noticing, and we felt great. The body load is smooth and nice, I felt like my feet were wrapped around fluffy stuff like cotton, and my hands were a little numb. On this chemical, my skin feels numb but I'm very sensitive to touch, it's a weird, nice feeling!</p><p>As we arrived at the party, we bumped into F's girlfriend and her friends who were going out, so we had the appartment for ourselves. We hang around listening to music, F is starting to be very agitated and we are trying to handle the overwhelming come up that we are getting, kinda cold, not very pleasant, but after a few drinks and talking, as we are hitting the plateau, the feeling of this drug gets pretty awesome. Very euphoric, we start dancing around and laughing. No visuals still, but a very nice euphoria.</p><p>At T+2:30, I start to feel the initial rush of euphoria coming down. As more friends get to the party, we start giving some to them and we take a second dose of 15mg.30 minutes later I was back in that sweet spot of amazing euphoria, sexual arousal and empathy, but this time it's stronger and things are more vivid, I start to get psychedelic effects from this. No visuals but thoughts are playful and my head is light, it feels like it rewired my brain to be in a fun state. Everything is very lucid, even after we drinked kinda heavily through the night, I don't seem to feel the full effects of alcohol. Colors are enhanced and people are seriously starting to look weird, but in a good way. We feel that everybody is connected and we talk a lot, I feel this drug is very social.</p><p>At around midnight We go outside to get more alcohol as we drank everything, the streets look fake and we feel like being in a video game, detached from the real world. We have the feeling of not belonging, but it feels nice. I am always surprised by the absence of paranoia with 2c-d.</p><p>We get back to F's place, and have more fun, everybody wants more and so we take a new dose at T+3:30, and it gets better again, more euphoria, some visuals start to show, and music sounds amazing. People are really loving this, nobody gets dark thoughts or anything, very fun state of mind.</p><p>As F's girlfriend gets back and is tired, we leave at T+4:00 to go to my appartment, my friends are on fire and do stupid things in the street, yelling at strangers and whatnot (some had a urge to get into a fight, which I found stupid). So we lose a few people there, and at T+4:30 we take 15mg more, at my place. Things start becoming complicated in our heads and I see more vivid colors, and distortion. My friend A says it's very much like LSD at this point.</p><p>We feel very good but start getting tired at around 5:00AM, and people are leaving, still very much fucked up though. So I start cleaning up a bit, and I put on some Pink Floyd, and go on my computer. I was delighted by how amazing I felt, and the music was truely fantastic. I thought my brain was working a 200% and I was feeling very happy, my senses at their peak, beautiful and euphoric. The 'mdma effect' started coming down at about 6:00AM and was feeling tired, but still had the visuals and the mind blown away. So I got to sleep at about 6:30 with no problem.</p><p>Woke up a 13:00PM, feeling good and refreshed, with just a small short headache.</p><p>This drug is amazing, it's my first psychedelic RC, and one of the best trips I ever had. Very good for partying with friends. It's short lasted, easy on the head and very very fun !</p>",
