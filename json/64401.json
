 "report": "<p>I have been humbled by DOI.</p><p>To set the scene, I have taken amongst the largest doses of LSD and mushrooms as anyone else I know and have never lost control, never had a +++ experience in the sense of 'The subject is totally engaged in the experience, for better or worse'. While in these hallucinogenic experience I have had obvious CEVs in the form of fractals, and OEVs like shifting dripping and oozing surfaces. While my mind state my have been reduced to outwardly idiotic, I have never felt uncomfortable, freaked out, or overpowered.</p><p>I took Friday off. I had some pharmaceutical grade DOI, 3.19mg I weighed out myself (on a related note, that DOI had been in its glass 100mg container for approximately 15 years at room temperature, and as you read, it probably hasn't lost any potency).</p><p>6:40am Placed dry powdered DOI under my tongue in the vague hope of sublingual absorption. After about 5 minutes I washed out the eppindorf which had held the DOI with water and swallowed it. The DOI didnt taste too bad, or cause any burning in the long term. I dozed in bed.</p><p>7:20am First alert? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>8:10am My fiance goes off to work. I am alone. Another alert? Definitely</p><p>Between 8:20 and 9:20am I don't know what I'm doing. Am I partially asleep? am I having violent hallucinations? I am not sure. I am hiding under the covers of my bed. I feel I am too old (24 years old, lol) to be doing this kind of self destructive selfish behaviour, I feel very cold. Thankfully I have my 9-month old Labrador Dog to cuddle with. I feel physically uncomfortable, my feet are writhing. I am having bright, involved fractal closed eye visuals.</p><p>9:20am I sit upright in bed, still nude. I flick on the TV, it is some breakfast show rubbish. The sensory input, the massively swimming walls, the open eye fractal patterns and the physical unease are too much. I throw up into the rubbish bin. Painful Dry heaves. Once over, I feel much better and assume that that will be the last of the nausea, I hide under the covers again.</p><p>9:20 to 11ish. I am at the height of my experience, an easy +++. My CEVs are brilliant, clear and very interesting. But I am trying to fight them. I am wanting the experience to end. I roll from side to side under the blankets, in the pitch black and silence. I believe I may have had something very close to ego loss. In a closed eye hallucination, I saw 5 symmetrical boats being pounded on by waves, these 5 separate boats were all me, and I was all of them, I remember being concerned about 'us': I was thinking about myself in plural.</p><p>~11:00am I am freezing cold, and I do not want to seem like I have lay in bed all day while my fiance was at work. I get up, my coordination is poor, I stumble into the lounge. I look at the walls, they are shifting violently in front of my eyes. I know a fair bit about neuroscience, and I think to myself 'This should be enough to set off my vomiting reflex'. The power of positive thinking perhaps, but my mouth fills with saliva and I am violently sick into the sink. Again, I feel much better. I eat a slice of pumpkin pie, realizing I have not eaten since last nights dinner.</p><p>This is a very strange experience. At times the visuals are overwhelming, but when I focus on mundane activities, eating a slice of pie, having a shower, going to the bathroom, I feel largely normal. Unlike LSD or mushroom experiences, my cognitive abilities feel completely intact.</p><p>I have a shower. It feel great, but I still can't get warm. I get back in bed and am quickly overtaken by CEVs again.</p><p>1:00pm My fiance comes back for lunch, I get up and sit with her. My open eye visuals have largely subsided, I do not feel like talking. I feel selfish and physically weak. She leaves, I smoke half a gram of strong cannabis, but I feel nothing from it. I have another shower and go bad to bed.</p><p>2:00-5:00pm I am still cold, I wish the hallucinations would go away. Both the CEVs and OEVs are a lot weaker, but some music videos still strongly set off the hallucinations. I get up at 5:00 to welcome my fiance home. I am still very quite and cold. I smoke another half gram of cannabis, but again feel nothing. Some of the muscle pains are getting worse and my mood is getting worse. I am having GI pains. I eat 2.5mg of Lorazepam, usually enough to get me very drowsy. Two hours later (7:00pm) I have another 2mg of lorazepam.</p><p>9:00pm Physical unease still strong. Most visuals have subsided, I am mentally still very on edge. I have a large glass of cognac 7.5mg of zopiclone and get in a hot bath. I play some Indian sitar music. For the first time I feel comfortable, warm, satisfied. The open eye visuals return, a pleasant play of the ripples over my body. It is worth noting that this cumulative dose of benzodiazepines would normally have me semi-conscious, I barely feel sleepy.</p><p>9:30pm - 10:30pm, I watched the last half of Indiana Jones and the last Crusade feeling largely normal apart from a sore throat and physical weakness. I close my eyes and fall asleep instantly.</p><p>11:00am I awake, and feel normal apart from the Lorazepam hang over.</p><p>What I learned from this experience:</p><p>1 Get dressed warmly before you take hallucinogens, and at least get dressed</p><p>2 It's too obvious, but no matter how experienced you think you are, get the set and setting right. Take hallucinogens in a clean warm room, with your loved ones approval, with some nice music, these drugs can always kick your ass.</p><p>With respect to DOI: 3mg is not a middle dose, it is big.</p><p>I should have taken lorazepam as soon as I felt uncomfortable.</p><p>DOI is stable at room temperature in dry form for a long time.</p>",
