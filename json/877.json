  "===================",
  "What man can fathom the dreamy angles psilocybian",
  "That arise from the earth in sickly-sweet parade",
  "To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded?",
  "Electric is the parade of cascading absurdity",
  "That claws at the soul with talons of flame",
  "And turns things once cherished and familiar",
  "Into gargantuan monoliths of alienation and paranoia",
  "For beyond the wall of dreams lie dismal fields eternal, and a sun that never rises",
  "Through the silent desperation of twilight skies",
  "Frost bitten by undying winds and darkness eternal",
  "And shrouded with the depraved laughter of a million madmen",
  "Lurks the dream psilocybian",
  "To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded</p>"
