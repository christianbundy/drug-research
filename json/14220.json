  "It all started when I was back in high school(around 1999). One of my close friends(Quite Experinced Drug User) from downstate was coming up to where I lived with a bunch of his friends. Anyways when he came up he told us about so-called tripping from cough medicine. I was pretty skeptical, cause I figured how could that be legal and weed not. Well anyways we picked up some Coricidin Cough & Cold(No the other Coricidin products don't work because they don't contain DXM.) And from many people I've heard that coridin is way more of a potent trip for the dosage.",
  "Well it was my first time taking it.  I took 8 pills my first time(Half a box) and we went to a Lynard Skynard concert.  It was about an hour and a half before I felt really and effects. I started to feel a little buzz, like I downed half a beer.  I turned to my friend greg and told him this. I was getting hungry so I stood up to go to the concession stand, and 'WHAM!' It's like I punched in the mind by the Coricidin. They were in full effect. I felt really good, everthing seem disoriented but didn't matter cause I was at a cool chillin' concert like Skynard.  I made my way to the concession stand purchased a hotdog, and I asked where the ketchup was, the lady pointed down. I walked down to the next booth and couldn't find the ketchup, needless to say I did this a few times before I found the ketchup.  I made my way back our friends and we all chilled out on DXM the rest of the night.",
  "Well after that night I couldn't believe how much fun it was.  It was only $5 for a box of 16, I could get them even though I was 17, and they lasted like 4 hours, it was a win-win situation.  Well it turns out me and my friends turned into DXM junkies, we started doing it 3 to 4 times a week. My friends and I continued this pattern for the whole summer or about three months. Hell we liked it so much we made a website.",
  "After a while though the drug seem to lose it's pizazze, so we were doing it less.  And I started to research the drug, I found out that it can do some bad things like cause leisons on your brain.  It was then I decided to stop doing them.  Although I wouldn't trade the time I spent with my friends tripping on DXM for anything, I'm not to lie it was fucking awesome.  I've moved to just smoking weed now just because weed is a great drug too.  The drug is fun to try once and or maybe do occusationally, but don't get hooked like me and my friends did. Another side note: The more I was doing DXM the more I started questioning life, things like why am I here, what is the meaning of life, etc.",
  "As for the 'Buzz' here how it goes:",
  "1. I take drugs",
  "2. 30-45min later, get a sort of nausea feeling.",
  "3. 60-75min nausea is gone feel normal",
  "4. ~90min Buzz is in full effect",
  "5. Whole body numb, disoriented, vision seems like 3rd person perspective, visions also seems to move in frames(no not tracers), you want to be left alone or with the people who are on the drug also, music is really good to listen to espically electronic because of the constant beat and hardly any voices which requires less concentration.",
  "6. Last about 4-6hours depending on dosage(I have never exceeded 16 pills or 480mgs)",
  "hope this helps,",
