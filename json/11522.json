 "report": [
  "<p>I started taking Paxil after being clinically diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks. Now, I have always been willing to try anything once, so I followed my doctors advice. ",
  "It took about 1 week for me to notice the effects of the drug. I started on 10 mg a day and increased to 20 mg in two weeks.  After 2 weeks I was able to function in society without panicking and wanting to die. It was instant confidence for me which before I had only been able to reach through alcohol or E.  Friends and family think it is a miracle. A few friends often get irratated and jealous of my new-found happiness and upbeat nature.",
  "    After a visit to a new doctor today, he mentioned",
  "               a few intersting things.",
  "1. That I will need to be on Paxil for the rest of my life or until    medical science develops something other than a pink pill.",
  "2. That research shows Paxil is re-constructing DNA in certain areas of the brain.... ??? This is quite interesting",
  "3. I do not have medical and it is getiing expensive.... really!?!",
  "          A few side effects I have noticed...",
  "            some are fun... some are not.",
  "1. Balance - like I am walking on a rocky boat from time to time.",
  "2. Very vivid and complex dreams",
  "3. I am like a non-sexual being. No feeling, no interest, no nothin'",
  "4. Enhanced self image, and extreme self confidence",
  "5. Smoking a lot more, Grinding teeth quite often, jaw clenching.",
  "6. Loss of emotion, yet extremely happy and confident @ the same time",
  "7. Have always been blessed by the gift of telepathy, it is now       slowly withering away. Can no longer read minds, and this saddens me.",
  "I am still taking Paxil and will continue for fear of falling back into my old self. I am now vey scared for what will happen if I stop taking the drug. So in fact, medical science has now trapped me financially and emotionally. I am now dependent on a little pink pill... until there is a new teal, turquoise or fuschia pill.</p>"
