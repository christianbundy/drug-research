 "report": "<p>I had to book a urine test last year for dvla(uk). Thought I'd abstain for a couple of weeks, go to the gym and eat as much as possible. These methods may or may not work but amongst my circle of friends and with web based research these seemed to be the best options. Foolishly I thought watered down pee would be the best option. Sadly the first sample was rejected because the creatinine level was too low. Too much water the morning of the test.</p><p>Simple I thought, you can buy this stuff as a suppliment for body builders. Second test was so full of creatnine it was also rejected. By this time I had stopped smoking grass alltogether for 2 months. I passed the 3rd test by not drinking water for 2 days before the test and gave them the strongest pee I've ever seen.</p><p>This year I was required to take another test and stopped toking immediately then wasted as much time as possible before booking the most distant test date possible. This will give me 8 weeks clear and I know I'll pass again. My driving licence is essential to my way of life and the bastards won't bring me down!</p>",
