 "report": "<p>First off, let me say that Ive done over 200 doses of LSD and around 50 doses of mushrooms in my college days.  The biggest dose I've ever done was 9 triple dip hits of micro dots ( called 'triple-dip-hippie-shit'). I've never had a bad trip, in fact I dont believe there are bad trips just people in the wrong mindset who shouldnt be doing the drug, or any drugs for that matter.</p><p>Like the other reports I have read, I have never had a 'bad' flashback either.  I know people who have done well over 1000 hits of Lsd and they have never had a flashback.  I would note though that I have felt a mild euphoria at times almost reminiscent of a mild lsd dosage, but it was very pleasent and welcomed with open arms.  I dont think it was the LSD, but in fact the new perception on reality that I have learned.</p><p>I know longer look at things the same again, I've learned to control my surroundings by using my imagination to see the subtle things that I would never have noticed. Music, paintings, geometrical shapes, they just all seem to make sense now, like they have been hiding something from me for all those years until I opened up my mind to them.</p>",
