  "<p>So, just a background on me. I am a freshman in high school, and started doing drugs February of 2012. This was in June. Anyway, I've smoked almost any pot I buy. Done acid once, and Percocet, Valium, and Ambien. After this experience I have used Concerta. I have diabetes, but no drug I use has an impact other than masking feelings of being low blood sugar or high blood sugar. I have smoked hash (a lot) and drove. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I am still fifteen, have my permit. I have smoked a lot before and during school. I want to trip at school but want practice on how to handle myself.",
  "So, I ordered some 2C-B online and shipped it to my house. I checked the mail a lot and it got suspicious. Finally it came and my dad followed me into the house. I went into the basement and hid the package of two 25 mg 2C-B tablets under a pillow and brought up a bottled water to pretend I went for water. After he was in his room and opened the package and in it was another package. I went outside, opened it and in a small druggie bag were two pills. I put the bag in my pocket and the package in my other. My dad ran out because he saw me open a package. I showed it to him (empty) and said I saw it in the backyard and opened it to see whats inside. I stored the pills between my mattresses and all of this was while I was heavily grounded from sneaking out.",
  "Planning:",
  "The movie started at 11:15 and I researched that it took about 1:15 to start. I took one at 10:00. I was saving the other for a friend.",
  "The Experience:",
  "I was going to see 'The Dark Knight' with my dad and grandpa.My grandpa came at 10:45 and I wasn't baseline. Everything was weird. I was anxious and jumpy and a little dissociative. I could talk, but I kept comments short. I drove to the theater, it hasn't peaked yet, and halfway there, the unusual body load came up. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] It was like a numb feeling without not feeling anything. Like, a very nice tingle. I love this about 2C-B. We go in the theatre and I use the restroom. I can barely walk. People are STARING at me, and whispering. I may have been paranoid. I use the restroom and my pupils are three times bigger than usual. Under bright lights.",
  "I ask the ticket checker (who was about 17) if I was acting sober. She said 'No, you can barely walk and talking to yourself.' Then she saw my pupils and jumped.",
  "I go into the movie room and stumble to my seat. I'm next to my grandpa. Every single trailer was the best movie ever. I wanted to see every one. The darkness made things around me weird. The screen changed sizes a lot, Once the screen got wider for the movie I thought it didn't happen. I was paranoid that people were judging me (mostly my grandpa). Also, the body load was INTENSE. I felt completely numb, yet if someone pinched me, I would still feel it.",
  "I knew the peak lasted 2-4 hours, and the movie was 3:00 so I should be able to drive home after. After the trailers and me talking to myself, and my grandpa judging me, the movie began. Now, no spoilers included. The only thing I'll say about the movie is that there are about 3 or 4 'climaxes.' If the movie was just spitting out story points or information, I was very sober. If it was starting to be intense, I would tense up every bone in my body and I would tense it up more and more and more and more. It was never-ending. Then, I realized I had to be able to control myself like a businessman or drug-lord who was always fucked up, yet talking to employees or the public. I had to be a businessman and act normal. I needed to learn how to handle myself. Badly. If I am fucked up, everyone knows. But, with 2C-B, if I want to peak, I can peak! Then be sober and rest. It is very nice. It made the movie ten times better.",
  "The Body Load:",
  "Very strong. I liked it personally though. I did stumble a lot though.",
  "Midway through I realized I was tensing up so much at the climaxes and nobody else was excited about the movie AT ALL. I thought of myself as a six year old who is obsessed with superheroes. I realized I need to grow up! I still tensed up, going higher and higher and higher and my grandpa was staring at me but I didn't care. Its my life. I learned A LOT from this experience. Its life changing. Beautiful. My favorite drug so far.",
  "Things I learned:",
  "Grow up. I still act like a child. Learn to handle yourself. I always wanted others to know how fucked up I was. I asked the ticket checker so that she knew. Who cares? I need to do drugs to make ME happy. Not others.",
  "Afterwards:",
  "The body load was massive. It defines 2C-B. Very, very, tingly. That's the best word. I didn't want to drive because I was stumbling like a fucker, and everything I said to my grandpa meant everything. It was easier to talk, but also easier to say the wrong thing. After we got home, I went into the bathroom to check my pupils. It was pure black. My eyes are blue and you couldn't see any blue at all. Intense. I was very hungry when I got home. My dad commented on my eyes and I said it might be my diabetes. I ate a lot of food and I ate a jalapeno and it was the spiciest thing I ever ate.",
  "My grandpa told me that he was driving. Without a reason. Freaked me out. I think they knew I was tripping but since I have been grounded for three weeks, and haven't left the house, it would be their fault.I had the biggest life talk while I was going to my grandpas. I couldnt stop smiling. Also I had a migraine the rest of the night.",
  "I used the other pill and it made me restless, energetic, euphoric, paranoid, and I enjoyed watching 'Comedy Central Roasts.' I laughed my ass off. Also, same body load. I suggest it just for the body load.",
  "All in all, 2C-B is an amazing drug. Very controllable (except for the body tingles).  I learned a lot about myself and how I act. Beautiful drug. For me, it made me interested in watching things. Things were more enjoyable and everything meant something! Peace.</p>"
