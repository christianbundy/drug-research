 "report": "<p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Description of subject, the writer.</p><p>Subject: Male, age 30'ish, weight 80kg, height 1.78cm</p><p>Health:  Good physical health, hayfever, asthma.</p><p>Mental:  Diagnosed ADHD-PI</p><p>Medication taken two days earlier: 100mg valium, 8mg xanax.</p><p>Medication taken same day: 10mg Lexapro, bronchodilator, antihistamine.</p><p>Harm-reduction disclaimer</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I felt obliged to note the excessive intake of valium and xanax I took two days earlier since half-life of benzos can be quite long and I don't know if it affects MDPV.</p><p>Now for the MDPV, this is really important to take note of. I have read lots of reports of inability to stop redosing MDPV, fiendish! Be warned that this seems to be the standard with MDPV and a harsh come-down.</p><p>However I did not at any time feel any urge to redose at any time after initial dose. Neither did I experience any comedown or crash, instead just such a slow comedown to baseline I didn't notice it. Whether it was depending on the combination of Lexapro, my mood and mindset or setting, further trials will tell if any.</p><p>==============================================================================</p><p>Description of situation before intake of substance:</p><p>Mindset: Just home from weekend at countryside house. Peaceful and curious.</p><p>Setting: Home alone. I have had a full nights sleep and fully rested, and in a neutral mood and had a medium meal at 15 o clock.</p><p>-------------------------------------------</p><p>The text is written in real-time, and I tried to edit as little as possible to show the change of mind and whatever. However I had to edit away rather large stories as my mind wandered to other things in this same document as sleepyness and focus on the report was lost.</p><p>Description of the substance</p><p>----------------------------</p><p>Container is ca 3x2 inch ziplock brand RIPPIE, with a white label. Label has black text MPDV 500mg left side, and to right black square marking with three smaller squares upper left, lower left, upper right.</p><p>The contents are a white salt, a bit chunky. Smells faintly citrus. Taste is chemical but not nasty. It solves in water with some effort. Snorting it is painless.</p><p>Description and timeline of the MDPV</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>18.00  \t30mg of MDPV is taken nasal and 30mg MDPV orally solved in water.</p><p>\tUnknown amount of snuff tobacco is consumed.</p><p>18:05 \tNon-placebo obscure active substance in bloodstream.</p><p>18:15 \tA weak stimulating body and head buzz.</p><p>18:30 \tNegatives:</p><p>\tMinor jaw-tension.</p><p>\tInvoluntary movement of tounge and lips when not focusing.</p><p>\tThis would be a chewing gum moment in social setting.</p><p>\tIncreased pulse.</p><p>\tHands tremble a bit, though barely noticable.</p><p>\tTiny tactile and balance loss, which I suppose would go unnoticed.</p><p>18:40\tBodyload a chilled out stoned stimulation.</p><p>\tThoughts and memory becoming light, mindfulness and peace.</p><p>18:50\tEyes are still like baseline, there is zero dilation of pupils.</p><p>\tAbove mentioned side-effects remain.</p><p>\tPositive effects have remained a plateau since 18:30.</p><p>19:00   Breathing has grown a bit more shallow but no issue.</p><p>\tTHe head sensations has spread, and is felt all over head,</p><p>\tprimarily at frontal cortex and temples.</p><p>19:20\tWhat is not:</p><p>\tSpeed, activation, euphoria, cns-stimulation, sexual arrousal,</p><p>\tsocial enhancement, ego-boost, and hyperactivity.</p><p>\tWhat is:\t</p><p>\tRelaxation, a calm mix of stony body/mind stimulation, mindfulness.</p><p>\tThe content of being is a sanctuary from impressions.</p><p>\tEverything just is but no name for any of that.</p><p>\tRelease of naming, release of words and knowledge of anything.</p><p>\tThe mind feels a bit like how I imagine being 2-3 years old.</p><p>19:30\tTaking a pause for now in noting.</p><p>\tI lie down in sofa and enjoy listening to the wind from the window. put on Beethoven's seventh, which I normally can't listen because the beauty overwhelms me.</p><p>\tHow will it affect me now?</p><p>20:00\tThe music is passing through me without many emotions.</p><p>\tMusic appreciation is not heightened, but rather disturbing my bliss.</p><p>\tbut it activates me for what to do next.</p><p>21:00\tI am now having a discussion on the net with a friend.</p><p>\tShe tell me I am writing a lot and inspired.</p><p>\tI have no problem of changing subject and being apprehensive of her,</p><p>\tbut only after she mentioned my intense writing.</p><p>\tThis means I am entering a speedy phase of mind certainly although</p><p>\tI didn't notice. Now the bodyload has lessened also.</p><p>21:30\tActivation and speedy mind now. Communicating is important.</p><p>\tKeeping focus on writing this report is decreased.</p><p>\tInteresting note, I am feeling a betterment in my ADHD.</p><p>\tI can focus better, switch focus between things without stress,</p><p>\tand I do not feel the constant wornout mental feeling.</p><p>22:20\tI am listening to Shakti. The speediness has lessened to a more</p><p>\tnormal state. I feel normal actually.</p><p>\tMentally I feel somewhat like when I were on Ritalin without</p><p>\tthe nasty nausea I would get from it.</p><p>\tI am not feeling any urge to redose which is odd, considering this</p><p>\thas been reported.</p><p>\tI have yet to experience any comedown and what it is like.</p><p>\tI am very hesitant to say this is good for ADHD even though I</p><p>\tpresently get this feeling - I know it is only a temporary high.</p><p>\tThe problem is firstly the effect now is different from 2 hours ago.</p><p>\tNow the bodyload has disappeared and feeling rather sleepy peripherally. Head is still stimulated but in a less speedy way. In a almost natural awakened way, if I may say so since I don't know \thow it is for normal people. I feel awake now, but thoughts are not racing.</p><p>23:00\tI have got some rather good things done during the evening.</p><p>\tI wrote a poster with reminders for making budget which is a constant</p><p>\tproblem for me, and also a mental reminder how to handle medications</p><p>\tand drugs in a way which works for me to not get addicted or abusing.</p><p>\tPosted it on the wall for everyday reading in the morning.</p><p>01:50   A very creative state of mind during the last three hours.</p><p>\tLoosing attention for this writing and enjoying texting online with</p><p>\tfriends. I got a very clear mind for expressing some important issues</p><p>\twith a person who I found share some different experiences of reality</p><p>\twhich is very lonely to have nobody share with. I appreciated it very</p><p>\tmuch. Focus is lost for writing more on the report in realtime, I am</p><p>\tenjoying texting with friends and my stoned attention is still</p><p>\tspinning with many ideas. Bodyload is gone and just tiredness.</p><p>05:00\tOh well, very sleepy.. The last six hours just passed like a breeze,</p><p>\tcan't believe it. Still having a alert head, but sleepy body.</p><p>\tThis is sure a long acting substance.</p><p>06:00\tBack to baseline I think. What is now is the beyond sleepyness where I \tcan get a false wakeful alertness, and refuse to go to bed although I know I would fall asleep in minutes and really need it and instead doing obsessive compulsive things. I am wary of going into a trance-like state which happen to me when underslept underfed and when the dopamine floods.</p><p>08:00\tI wrote a story of an life changing experience I had one year ago,</p><p>\tthat I always wanted to get down on paper to a texting friend on the net.</p><p>\tI am reminded by a person on the net to sleep now, and take the advice</p><p>\tbefore I enter zombie-state. I have forgotten to eat properly.</p><p>\tWater as needed. Sleepy time now.</p><p>10:00\tNo sleepy time yet, getting up now and then turning rolling in bed.</p><p>13:00\tI take a shower and do some business downtown. ADHD-confusion made worse by tiredness, noisy - crowded - ugly movement - aura of stress.</p><p>14:00\tI take my adhd-medication Modiodal [modafinil] 100mg.</p><p>15:00\tNow I am trying to sleep again, being pissed off so taking 2mg xanax, 20mg valium and 15mg zolpidem. but alas no sleep. I realized I should not have taken the Modiodal which actualy now is waking me up. \t</p><p>20:00\tI spend the rest of the evening playing online game and beeing buzzed</p><p>\ton valium coffee and xanax, and wondering if a lower dosage of MDPV</p><p>\tyields lower duration than 18 hours.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>SUMMARY OF MY PERSONAL TRIAL</p><p>Positives: \tvery slow comedown</p><p>\t\tno redosing-urge</p><p>\t\tno euphoria</p><p>\t\tmellow stimulation</p><p>\t\tnone to minor pupil dilation depending on dosage.</p><p>Negatives: \tjaw-tension</p><p>\t\twiggling lizards tounge</p><p>\t\tanorectic</p><p>\t\tdouble vision on high dosage/going long time</p><p>Neutral:   \tKept me awake for extremely long time.</p><p>\t\tHad many different long plateaus of varying effects</p><p>duration:  \t18 hours total including ultra slow comedown.</p><p>Combination: \t10mg Lexapro (SSRI)</p><p>Tolerance-build: To find out</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>POSSIBLE USES I THOUGHT OF AFTER FIRST TRIAL</p><p>Medicational uses:</p><p>* If taken in early morning in low dosage could potentialy be trialed for surrogate adhd-medication for emergency or very occasional energizer.</p><p>* I strongly would disagree trying to take this DAILY as surrogate adhd-medication or energizer because finding a correct dosing that doesn't build tolerance I suspect would be very troublesome and also given the generally accepted FIENDISHNESS which I however did not experience. Not to mention reaching a steady state with eye-balling or even a scale with 1-2mg diff would be impossible.</p><p>Best usages in my opinion:</p><p>* I strongly would like try a whole day at a carnival, hanging out with friends talking philosophical or rubbish topics would be proper, festival, or just relaxing a sunny day in the park would be nice.</p><p>* A creative tool for a fine day of painting or writing or whatever artform. The plateaus of different effects make it both a peculiar and entertaining unreliable source for varying unexpectedness in creative outbursts! AND DO NOT BRING A BAG TO AVOID REDOSING.</p>",
