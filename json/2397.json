  "Well as far as Methadone goes it's fun.  Once I get past the shitty throwing up phase it'll rock my world and kick my ass.  If I take it in the morning it'll last me all damn day.  I take them in pill form, so it's time released.",
  "The thing w/ Methadone is that when I take them it's normally at night.  I still get a little sick to my stomach, and normally I throw up at one point or another, but once I do I feel great and it won't bother me again.  Anyhow, I usually take them at night and they kick my ass.  LOL...  I'll be sitting there in a weird state of I'm here but I'm not here. It's fun. ",
  "By the next day I get up and basically feel shitty the entire next day.  That kinda sucks.  I think that's just me though.. All of my friends eat them and they have no problem with that."
