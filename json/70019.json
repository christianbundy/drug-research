 "report": "<p>Made tea from 5 grams of voacanga africana root. I let it steep for an hour. Smells like ginseng, tastes fiery, awful.</p><p>1:00 - Finished drinking the tea.</p><p>2:30 - Mild stimulant effect, similar to caffeine. Not much else as far as I can tell.</p><p>5:00 - Still feel the effect. It's not a bad caffeine substitute if not for the flavour.</p>",
