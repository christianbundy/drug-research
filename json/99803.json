 "report": "<p>The school day started off like normal, but on this day my anxiety was through the roof.</p><p>One of my close friends had 2 Xanax bars and gave them to me. I took one bar, then waited 10 minutes to take half of the other.</p><p>It took around 40 minutes for the effects to really start. My body felt slow, numb, and most importantly my anxiety was completely gone. The day flew by and I don't recall what I was saying to people.</p><p>My social skills were absolutely amazing, it made me realize how wonderful this drug can be. The day ended and it felt like a daze. Benzos are defiantly a drug that eats up hours and feels like its only minutes.</p>",
