 "report": "<p>Having a free and rather dull evening I thought I would try a gram of 10x Amanita extract I bought a while back. I dosed on some syrian rue extract 20 minutes before hand as it may enhance the effects. After dosing withe extract I waited. And waited. nothing happened.</p><p>I ran a bath a rolled a strong joint hoping it would boost any amanita effects (they are meant to go very well together). nothing though. I was spaced out, yes, but it was due to the syrian rue and strong joint combined.</p><p>Picking and preparing ones from the wild are my best bet (trust me, they do the trick).</p>",
