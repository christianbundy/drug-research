 "report": "<p>I am an insomniac, and to add to my troubles, I stayed up partying till sunrise and slept all day.  It was 4p.m. when I woke up and the next day I had to wake up for school at 6:30 in the morning.  I usually try not to take sleeping aids, because it only makes my insomnia worse when I have to stop. </p><p>I had some free samples in my house, so I just decided to take one at 11:00, I laid in bed for about 20 minutes and I started thinking to myself, 'this will never work, I'm not tired at all.'  Then like a switch I was out, the last thing I remember was thinking that last thought.  I never even felt the sleepiness creeping up on me.  When I woke up 5 minutes before my alarm, I felt like it was the weekend, I had never been so rested at 6:25 before in my life.  I have heard that the psychoactive affects are very good when staying awake, but the sleeping affects are more than amazing.</p>",
