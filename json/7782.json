 "report": [
  "Subject is generally healthy 115 lb. male with moderate metabolism and no current tolerance to serotongenic compounds.",
  "T+0h: 10 mg of 2-CB-Fly is ingested orally on an empty stomach.",
  "T+1h: Mild stimulatory and entactogenic are effects are noticed, as well as some mild nausea. Slight CEV's are noted.",
  "T+1.5h: Slight ego loss is apparent, mild synesthesia also noted. OEV's are extremely mild, much less hallucinogenic than 2-CE; however, the body component is highly pronounced.",
  "T+4h: Body component loses its 'warmth', leaving a 'lossier' bodyload than I would find typical of 2-Cx's. Sexual enhancement is non-existant, in fact, every attempt at gratification is abruptly halted by the distraction of something completely non-sexual in nature. No vascular constriction is noticed, and vascular dysfunction normally felt even in sobriety has now dissipiated altogether, long after the effects of the drug have worn off.",
  "T+8h: Baseline. A gentle crash, I found sleep quite easily.",
  "Overall 2-CB-FLY is an enjoyable material, and while not Earth-shatteringly awe-inspiring, could definitely pose as an excellent intermediary to truely psychedelic compounds like LSD or 2-CE."
