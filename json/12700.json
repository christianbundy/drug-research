 "report": "<p>\nI always wanted to smell chloroform so i did alot of studies on how how to use it safely. I turned the bottle over once which I bought online.  I put it on some tissues and sniffed it 2x, but nothing happened.  But when I took 10-15 deep breath I felt very relaxed and dizzy like I was floating and it lasted for one or more hours. I didnt want to inhale enough to knock me out, but i did feel a slight headache after it wore off.  And for some reason late at night i was very rleaxed and felt some of that floating feeling even 15 hours after i sniffed it the 1st time.</p>",
