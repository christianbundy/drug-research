 "report": [
  "When I was quite young, I recall an evening where I was woken up from having severe asthma. Being an asthmatic from bloody near birth I was used to this, and I took my inhaler. But my asthma was quite bad so I took it repetitively until I broke out in this horrible sweat... My asthma had cleared up but I was overdosed, in the panic of not being able to breathe earlier I had taken say 20 puffs and I was suffering now from a rapid heart beat, I was sweating very badly and shaking, my hands wouldn't stop shaking. I felt very light and confused.",
  "This went on for a while and because I couldn't go back to sleep in this state I decided to wake up properly and read a comic book, after I finished it I sat it up on the table beside my bed and I rolled over, later I looked back and I saw the comic book sitting beside me... I thought to myself... Wait a min didn't I sit it on the table ??!? Turned out to be an hallucination.",
  "The entire experience lasted about 4 hours, and it was fairly scary,  it is a vague memory and I'm sorry I couldn't be a bit more definite about the dose... It wasn't a phenomenal amount I think it was between 10 - 20 puffs, and it was also before they started producing CFC free canisters... I reckon that they were a lot stronger then the current CFC inhalers."
