 "report": [
  "Started the night off mixing about 2 decent lines in a shot glass with water, I spent 4 hours finishing my assignment having a decent toke from the pipe about 2 and half to 3 hours in. I lost my assignment changes after the first hour and ticked so I started punching the computer desk 3-4 times before stopping to relise my hand was bleeding.",
  "After 4 hours I had a few tokes while setting up my DJ gear to do a one and a half hour electro/House mix.",
  "This stuff doesnt give me the same feeling as methamphetamine does but is great if I want to stay awake for a long amount of time, it also makes me impulsive and easily angered as I normally wouldnt get that much anger over losing an hours work on my assignment.",
  "I then took some valium and smoked a few cones to put myself to sleep, I would of had difficulty sleeping otherwise."
