  "<p>I was initally very excited to find 5-MeO-DALT, I thought it could be an interesting experience to be a pioneer of a drug. The reports made this chemical seem friendly, and and fun, but this was not the case.",
  "12mg",
  "Nothing, absolutely no discernable effect.",
  "22mg",
  "This is where I got a taste of this mild psychedelic, however it was limited to a pleasurable tingle around my genitial.",
  "34mg",
  "Again, only a taste of erotic energy, and some hunger.",
  "110mg",
  "Very ridgid and clenched. Felt similar to muscular sensations of 2cs. This dose was terribly intense, not in a pleasurable way, but yet its intensity was only relatively strong. Compared to other psychedelics, the entire experience was subtle and mild, with strong body sensations and erotic energy.",
  "As a whole, this compound is uninteresting. I actually think it may have some therapeutic value as it is almost absent of classic psychedelic effects. I would be interested to hear if anyone has actually found this active at Shulgins dose, and enjoyed it.</p>"
