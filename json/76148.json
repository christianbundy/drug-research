 "report": "<p>I am currently in the middle of a nine day trip to Utah in which my friend 'D' and I (both experienced skiers) plan to master the mountains by day and empty both of our drug collections by the time the vacation is over. I am writing this on the evening of the fourth day of my trip while still residually feeling the effects of the substances taken earlier today. I want to commit the events of the previous to writing before they begin to fade from memory. \rDay 1: Codeine and Cannabis</p><p>After 7 hours of strenuous skiing on our first day in Utah, D and I decided it was time to break into our mutual collection of psychoactive substances. I wanted to mellow out after our day of exercise and I thought that codeine and weed would be a good combination to kick off the vacation. I used cold-water extraction on 8 pills (325-8) for a rough total of around 55 mg of codeine in solution. I'm estimating a loss of around 10-15% due to imperfect execution of the extraction process. I drank the solution myself because 'D' had been taking clonazepam and did not want to risk the combination.</p><p>The codeine kicked in around 20-25 minutes after ingestion and gave me a light and happy buzz, about what I was expecting considering my moderate opiate tolerance. D and I began packing a large, finely-ground 1g bong of the weed I had brought (a very high-quality headies strain) and proceeded to smoke it over a period of about 30 minutes. We each got more hits than we could count and were admittedly 'blazed off our asses' as D likes to say. The cannabis seemed to affect D substantially more than me and he laughed sporadically and seemingly uncontrollably in the ensuing hours. He kept talking about how he felt like 'scenes' were repeating over and over like in the movie Groundhog Day.</p><p>I could feel both the codeine and the weed for hours after we smoked and altogether it was a very pleasant high. I ended up playing Gears of War II online with D after the high had settled in a little more and both he and I were amazed at how well I was able to perform in the game. Long before either the codeine or weed had began to wear off for me, D (who was still as blitzed as ever) suggested we redose with something. We settled on more THC and each ate one cookie made with 1.5 grams of midgrade weed followed by one 'THC pill' I had made before the trip. It took over an hour for the high to come on, but once it did, we were both fried for the rest of the night. \rDay 2: Clonazepam, Cannabis, and Alcohol</p><p>After another long day of skiing, D and I broke into the 'goodie bag' we had packed to begin round two of the substance abuse. The poisons for the night: 4 mg clonazepam, and a ton of alcohol and weed. I took 4 mg of clonazepam and started drinking mixed drinks early in the night. After the clonazepam and alcohol began kicking in I took three THC pills (those of you who have taken THC pills before will appreciate just how large of a dose this is) and ate the last weed brownie. Then D broke out the bong and we smoked another gram of the headies I had brought. D informed me the following morning that at this point, I took another 2 mg of clonazepam. I have no recollection of the rest of the night. I awoke at 6:30 the next morning nauseated, pale, and lightheaded to find over a dozen empty bottles of high-alcohol beer around the living room as well as two of the liquor bottles drained. I have mixed feelings about this experience, but would very likely not repeat it. I gave the rest of the clonazepam to D. \rDay 3: Cannabis and Alcohol</p><p>Just beer and weed. A good, but nevertheless unremarkable night. \rDay 4: Psilocybin, Dextromethrophan, and Cannabis</p><p>By day four, my muscles were getting sore and I was fighting a cold, so I decided that it was a good day to break out the shrooms. Unfortunately I had only been able to obtain a single gram of dried Psilocybe cubensis from my friend before leaving. I wanted I stronger trip than 1 gram would be able to give me so, for better or for worse, I decided to combine it with DXM. I took the mushrooms and 240 mg of dextromethrophan HBR about 20 minutes after taking 160 mg of dextromethrophan polistirex. I also took 8 mg chloropheniramine to reduce itching. I followed that with a 1.5g marijuana cookie and one THC pill.</p><p>I prepared a warm bath and set up a 'tripping playlist' on my MP3 player. I was starting to feel the DXM (but not the shrooms or weed) in about 45 minutes and was getting butterflies with excitement and decided to smoke a bowl of the headies to calm down. The ensuing trip was very intense. About 75 minutes after my initial dose of DXM, I started feeling very short of breath and a little light-headed. I shut off the lights, laid down in the bath, turned on the music, and drifted away. The things I saw in the next hour are difficult to put into words. At various times I felt as if I was floating through space, witnessing the magnification of fractals, riding on a train through the air, and other strange sensations. The music fueled my hallucinations, most of which were closed-eye. The most intense experience, however, was a several-minute-long open eye vision of what may have been the formation of a star. Surprisingly, I was still able to perform simple tasks such as rebooting the MP3 player when it froze, and adjusting the water temperature. I do not remember getting out of the jacuzzi, but I recall drying and dressing. I remember having a conversation with an elderly man who was certainly a figment of my imagination. The MP3 player never left my ears. Indeed, I felt as if my whole trip was fueled by the music.</p><p>After getting out of the bath I have a myriad of memories of things I may or may not have done. Some are realistic like pouring myself a bowl of cereal, while others are more fantastic things such as jumping off of buildings or walking through walls. Some of the memories seem vivid, others more hazy, but I am astonished by the sheer quantity of them. I feel like I must have lived through a whole lifetime of memories in the five or six hours I was tripping. At times the trip would become so intense that I would be confined to the bed or couch for periods of what seemed like several hours, although in retrospect they could not have lasted that long. During these periods, I felt ecstatic pleasure coursing through my legs and arms. I found myself forgetting to breathe until my lungs hurt and then remember gasping for breath which was in itself also a highly pleasurable experience. At times I felt as if I was not a solid being at all, and had several instances of what would be called an 'out of body' experiences in which I felt no physical connection to myself at all.</p><p>Even now, over eight hours after taking the DXM, shrooms, and weed, I still feel in a daze and am having periodic flashbacks of the things I saw/remember. I am also still experiencing brief, diluted flashbacks of the physical ecstasy I felt while convulsing, overwhelmed by the power of the trip. I am in awe at how intense the DXM-Psilocybin-THC combination was. The trip was something I would have thought reserved for DMT or 2C-B or the like. I am not planning on repeating the experience on this ski trip, although I am not ruling it out for some point in the future. One other note: I smoked a large bong with D that night and did not get high at all. I can think of no satisfactory physiological explanation for this, but given the events of the day I am inclined to believe that psychologically the weed high was ineffectual after the combination high in the preceding hours.</p><p>I am writing the record of days 5 - after the conclusion of our trip. During this time, I went through my entire supply of hydrocodone and oxycodone as well as the remaining THC pills, cookies, and innumerable bongs with my friend D. As such, while I still do remember the dosages I was taking quite clearly, it is difficult to recall the exact order of events and the time at which the various drugs were taken.\rDay 5: Hydrocodone, Cannabis, and Alcohol</p><p>Christmas Day: time to break out the stronger opiates. D and I skied early in the day and returned to the house at around 1:00. I started off the drugs with 17.5 mg of hydrocodone from a very well executed cold-water extraction, then started drinking mixed drinks with grapefruit juice to inhibit my bodys metabolism of the Vicodin. D and I took two THC pills each half an hour later and continued drinking (from a supply of Aventinus, Troix Pistoles, and Rochefort 10, three of our favorite beers). Once I started feeling the hydrocodone (but before the THC pills had taken effect) D and I smoked a bid bong of the headies and lay down to listen to some music. The full effect of the large intake of weed came on shortly after and the resulting body buzz in combination with the hydrocodone was wonderful. I was very much enjoying listening to the music, but I started to become light sensitive again (although not nearly as much as I had the day before) so I closed the blinds and continued listening to music. D left to shower and I grabbed a few more beers. By the time D finished his shower, I was rather intoxicated and was having a very enjoyable time lying on the couch in low-light listening to music. D and I played another couple games of Gears 2 (and were again both surprised at how well we were able to perform given our substantial inebriation).</p><p>By the time we finished playing it had been almost four hours since I had taken the initial dose of hydrocodone and I was still feeling the drug combination strongly. Despite this, I desired more, so took the remaining 12.5 mg of hydrocodone from the extraction, along with grapefruit juice and 35mg diphenhydramine (to strengthen the effect and increase the duration of the hydrocodone), 8mg chlorapheniromine (to reduce the itching), 75mg pseudoephedrine (so I wouldntt crash), and another THC pill. I began feeling the effect of the hydrocodone in only about 20 minutes, and the THC pill in (I think) about 30 minutes after that, by which time I was in opiate-induced ecstasy. The body high was amazing, especially once the third pill kicked in. The physical euphoria began to feel almost sexual after a while, although mentally I had no desire to do anything other than lie down and listen to more music. This was the strongest body high I had experienced up to this point, only to be eclipsed by the hydrocodone and oxycodone combination from the next day.\rDay 6: Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Cannabis, and Alcohol</p><p>After over 7 hours of skiing D and I were both tired and drinking a few beers and ripping a bong as soon as we got back did little to improve the situation. I took another 17.5 mg of extracted hydrocodone and D (who had a substantially lower tolerance than me) took the remaining 12.5 at around 6:00.  We kept drinking through out the evening, and I think D took another THC pill. At around 9, I decided to be an idiot and blow 5mg of oxycodone and rip another bong (this tine by myself). The high was remarkably similar to that of the previous night, but I was only able to enjoy it for an hour or so before I passed out. Im still kicking myself for wasting the combination when I should have known that I would have not been able to stay awake.\rDay 7: Clonazepam, Dextromethrophan, Cannabis, Alcohol</p><p>Another day of skiing. After getting back to the house D and I each took 2 mg of clonazepam, smoked a bong, and killed a couple beers before going out to dinner at a five-star restaurant. I was able to maintain my sobriety better than he was so I took care of the ordering processes among other things for us. The dinner was frankly hilarious and we both had a great time. When we got back, I desired a different combination than the cannabis-opiate-alcohol trio I had been playing with for the past few days. We still had a ton of acid-base extracted dextromethrophan HBr, so I took 180 mg in an effort to create a solid 1st plateau DXM dose. I had half a dozen beers while watching some Its Always Sunny then bonged 1g of headies w/ D and another .5g by myself afterwards. The resulting high was fantastic. I was mentally functional and fairly clear-headed, but I felt very euphoric and kept up a somewhat ridiculous mental conversation with myself that was actually quite intellectually stimulating, or at least seemed to be at the time. The body buzz during this period was also nice. Altogether I enjoyed the combination tremendously, and was eager to try it out again in a few days.\rDay 8: Hydrocodone, Cannabis, and Clonazepam</p><p>By this point I still had a substantial supply of hydrocodone, so I took another 17.5 mg but this time was too lazy to bother with the extraction. With the fact that I had 1.75 grams of acetaminophen in my liver in mind, I decided to forgo the alcohol for the night, and instead decided to finish off the last three THC pills as well as the last weed cookie. While I do have a fairly high marijuana tolerance, I was unable to maintain any semblance of sobriety once the 3+ grams of weed I had ingested took effect. I melted into the couch and watched South Park and Its Always Sunny for about four hours. The body buzz was quite pleasant however. Once the hydrocodone started wearing off I began to toy with the idea of taking a few mg of clonazepam and smoking another bong. D, who was piss drunk on top of the clonazepam he had taken earlier in the day, persuaded me that it would be a good idea, and so we each took 2mg of clonazepam and smoked a large bong.</p><p>By the time we were done, it was past 9:00 and we were both getting a little tired. We decided to hit up the hot tub with some girls who were staying in a house near ours. They had both been drinking heavily and one of them had taken D up on an offer of some clonazepam. I began to feel very tired after only half an hour in the hot tub, so I decided to call it a night and let D have some time alone with one of the girls. I got into bed around 10:30 and passed out shortly after.\rDay 9: Dextromethrophan, Alcohol, Cannabis, Codeine, Oxycodone</p><p>This was the last day of our trip and D and I both agreed that it called for a celebration. Around 1:00, after a half day of skiing, D took the last 15 mg of hydrocodone and began drinking a fifth of Malibu straight from the bottle. I wanted to re-experience the excellent tri-buzz from two days prior, so I took 140 mg of dextromethrophan polistirex and 120 mg of dextromethrophan HBr in an effort to produce a second-plateau effect and started drinking some of the nice beers we had in the fridge. About a half-hour after taking the DXM, I packed up a huge bong of some of the best weed D and I had seen. The bong ripped forever and we each got a ton of good hits. Although we were both very high at this point, we still had about a gram of ISO hash I had made the day before that we both wanted to smoke, so I packed up another bong of all the hash I had left. This bong yielded only 4 hits, but with each one I could feel my body tingling and starting to feel abnormally light. By the time we were done, D was borderline tripping out. He could not make sense of anything around him and kept thinking that I was someone else. I persuaded him to go downstairs to watch a movie and I grabbed the rest of the Aventinus for us to drink. I was ridiculously high, and frankly Im not even sure how I was able to manage these tasks, but somehow we managed to get the movie going and started drinking. This may have been the strongest mental high I have felt, and although it could not compare to the intense euphoria of the opiate combinations, I still was feeling amazingly good.</p><p>I had trouble following the movie, and after a while decided to close my eyes and relax on the couch. I began to have mild closed-eye visuals, but nothing compared to the all-out trip of day four. Once the movie ended, D was passed out, but I still wanted more. Around 4:30, I took 70 mg of extracted codeine and waited for it to kick in while listening to some good music. As soon as I started feeling the opiate buzz, I realized my mistake: I had forgotten to take an antihistamine. Sure enough, the itching began a few minutes later, but fortunately only lasted about 30 minutes before the clorapheriramine kicked in. At this point, the DXM and some of the alcohol were wearing off, but my overall buzz was still very strong and very pleasant. Even so, I had 10 mg of oxycodone remaining, so around 6:00, I decided to go for it. I took 7.5 mg of oxycodone orally with some grapefruit juice to enhance the opiate duration and blew the remaining 2.5 mg shortly after. I then smoked a small bowl, and took 75 mg of pseudoephedrine so I could stay up to enjoy the experience. And what an experience it was. I was in a state of utter ecstasy for hours, and have no negative aspects of the experience (aside from a little itching) to report.</p><p>And so concludes the greatest vacation I have ever had. In those nine days, I experienced some of the best skiing of my life, and by night, more substance-induced ecstasy than I had ever come close to experiencing before.</p>"
