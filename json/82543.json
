 "report": "<p>I grew both of these herbs in my garden this year, unaware that they both contain thujone.</p><p>I took one of those metal tea steepers and filled it with 80% wormwood and 20% tansy. I steeped them for about 17 minutes and then I opened the steeper and really squeezed out all the liquid. The tea was quite bitter, although I've had worse (strong thyme tea).</p><p>15 minutes later:</p><p>It's about 15 minutes now since I finished drinking it and I feel a little more awake, aware and a little more energized. Other than that I feel completely normal. I feel much more awake then after any other tea I've had, and I drink tea every day.</p><p>25 minutes later:</p><p>It's now been another 10 minutes, and I have a slight head rush. I feel very calm. This will definitely help me do my trig homework.</p><p>I will use this when I am tired with much work ahead of me.</p>",
