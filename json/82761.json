 "report": "<p>It wasn't the first time I smoked 10x salvia but I never had such an experience.</p><p>I found myself in a dark space with nothing around me. I realised it's not me anymore and that my whole life before this was just a dream and all my emotions about everybody I knew disappeared - I couldn't care less about my loved ones, they weren't real. I was a superior being drifting through blackness. There was a spiral moving in front of me and I knew it would be the only thing I'll ever see again in that darkness. Before salvia opened my eyes, I was dreaming my current life and when the experience ended, I felt back to sleep and woke up here.</p><p>I still believe that after I die here, I will just 'wake up'</p>",
