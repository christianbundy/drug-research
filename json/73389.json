 "report": "<p>So I've been into psychedelics for a while now and had been looking for a good, inexpensive means of tripping over the summer. Based on some online research, I decided ayahuasca would be a good idea. I bought 50 grams of b. caapi and 25 grams of m. hostilis online.</p><p>So I wake up one day and brew the mix for 6 hours and then let the power and the light cool in the fridge overnight. I fasted for the entire day, only drinking 2 gatorades. The next day, we meet up, drink the power(terrible taste but bear with it), and then head over to a local garden/nature reserve. The drive may have been 15 minutes, but upon getting there, we realized that none of us had brought a lighter for the massive amounts of ganja we planned on smoking. We get back in the car and drive to Quickcheck. At this point I'm already feeling a slight wooziness creeping up on me - the type of inebriation that you know comes before you start tripping real hard. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>On our way back, I'm hit so hard by the brew. My friends and I are working our way down through the light which we brought in bottles for our journey. We return to the gardens and make our way into a woods trail. After walking to find a good spot, we sit on a giant log and light up a blunt of good headies.</p><p>Now at this point, we really went on a journey of life and discovery. I always feel weed is necessary to enhance and relax the possibly overwhelming experience of a trip. Never could this be more true than with ayahuasca. The 3 of us sat on the log hitting sweet MJ and sipping the not-so-sweet light. At this point I recognize the familiar ripples and tracers that precede full-blown trip. I begin to feel extreme nausea, and feel just about ready to purge. The scene of leaves and diverse shrubs and herbs on the ground began to transform into a silhouette of different patterns. Its almost too much, and makes my nausea worse. The next thing I did however, was look up through the tree line into the sunlight peering through the canopy. Never has sunlight been so powerful an agent of tranquility and mental peace.</p><p>I stopped feeling sick, though I realized it was not so much that the nausea had left my body as my mind had left my body. Every once in a while I would zone back into the intense nausea, but I realized its all about state of mind. So I cleared my mind, cleansed my mind, started regulating my breathing, which I now think is one of the most important parts of an ayahuasca trip. I slowed my breathing until I found a natural sync with body and nature, and I went into the deepest, and BY FAR, most spiritual, meditative trance in my life.</p><p>When I'm tripping other shit, my thoughts race at 100 mph but I can somehow make sense of my thoughts to learn new thing about myself. Ayahuasca, while similar in the visuals department, is yet amazingly different in that there is not the hum buzz of countless thoughts surfing my brain. There is rather a sense of deep knowing and understanding, and very, very clear headedness. I found my thoughts not racing, just in complete tune with my surroundings. And yet, while I was not to any extent making cognitive thoughts about the life issues we all ponder on when we trip, I understood them with a perfect finality.</p><p>In case you're wondering what happened to our bodies in the meantime, let me say this. The trail was maybe a 10 minute hiking trail. We ended up in there for 3 and a half hours. We would occasionally between tripping get up and try to walk further. 25 ft. later one of us would usually stop and sit down, upon which the rest of us would sit down as well, in the middle of the hiking path. And we all lay there, with dog walkers coming through here and there, doubtless wondering and suspicious as to what a bunch of kids were doing lying across a hiking trail.</p><p>At different points, all 3 of us purged. The purge is one of the most humbling, enlightening moments of my life. It took me suddenly, just when I think I'm fine and not going to purge. But let me say that the purge is a very necessary part of the trip. For 1-2 minutes, we were helpless, prostrate on the ground and throwing up with a religious power. After the purge, however, my body seriously is, in every sense of the word, purged. Purged of all aspects of my character and my being, and I emerge cleansed, like a newborn.</p><p>Suffice it to say that there is much, much more to Ayahuasca than a simple trip. While a trip is life changing, an Ayahuasca trip is a spiritual journey. The level of spirituality and soul-infused exploration is on a level of its own.</p><p>As a final testament to the curative powers of Ayahuasca, I have a personal anecdote. I have, every time in my life, gotten flushed as shit when I drink. All it takes is 1 beer for my entire body to  get red. In the past month since my Ayahuasca trip, I have not turned red once while drinking. Nor have I had the next-day hangover and head-pounding since. Without a doubt, my tolerance for alcohol also increased alot.</p><p>When I took Ayahuasca I certainly didn't expect this result, but I'm not surprised. Ayahuasca is a powerful, spiritual guide that takes me on a journey. It goes against all Western medical teachings but I now believe that with the proper state of mind achieved, healing of bodily afflictions comes naturally. This stuff has been around for thousands of years. Entire cultures and civilizations have subscribed to its time-tested methods. Ayahuasca is a powerful, powerful guide to greater understanding that repairs your mind, soul and body in truly unbelievable ways.</p>",
