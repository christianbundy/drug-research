 "report": "<p>This is not the usual trip report, as I have done little tripping. Ever since I was 8, I have had EXTREME Obsessive compulsive disorder. It was horrible, I would have to do EVERYTHING 5 times over all the time. I couldn't sit still for more then 5 minutes, and eventually, because of my untreated ocd, I was 'realeased' from my job as manager of a diner.</p><p>Anywho, one evening I was reading a report that psilybin can help cure OCD. So I ordered a mushroom kit, and after about 2 months, had one ounce dried magic mushrooms.</p><p>6 or 7 times a day I get what I call an 'OCD attack', which is where I do EVERYTHING 5 times over, and I usually get these for about 20 minutes long. I get all gittery and nervous, and blah blah blah. So, one evening, while experiencing an OCD attack, I consumed 2 tablespoons of crushed mushrooms an a light stomach. After about 10 minutes, the attack completely stopped, like dead in its track. I experienced a mild buzz, but nothing to inhibit my daily activites.</p><p>The next day, I noticed an amazing thing: I had no OCD attacks. None at all, so I contributed this to the mushrooms. But, the day after that, the attacks came back. Again, I consumed 2 tablespoons, and about 10 minutes later, they disappeared.</p><p>So, with that I made my conclusion, which is that 2 tablespoons daily of mushrooms stops my ocd attacks. It has been 5 months since I started this treatment, and each day I start my morning with 2 tablespoons of mushrooms.</p>",
