 "report": "<p>  I don't think the experience that I had with Amanita muscaria was something I could prepare for.  It was supposed to be a fun and exciting night but this mushroom totally screwed everything up.</p><p>  I had just gotten home from work when I decided to eat some of the mushrooms that I has purchased from a internet supplier.  I started by eating small pieces of the cap and soon shoved the whole thing in my mouth.  This mushroom has a taste that becomes very unpleasent with time.  Around a half an hour after ingesting the shroom matter I began to feel a slight dizzy-ness and a bit of nausea.  The nausea proceeded to get worse until the point where I just wanted to get the stuff out of my stomach.  This didn't work well due to the small amount of matter in my stomach, but I eventually brought myself to puking it up.  After that things got a little better, and I think it is due to the fact that the mushroom was out of my stomach.  I still has the effect of being dizzy but it was extremely elavated.  This dizzy-ness lasted for a few hours and I went to sleep.</p><p>Overall I do not suggest this as a means of getting a buzz.  The taste coupled with the nausea created a horrible experience that I would rather not try again.</p>",
