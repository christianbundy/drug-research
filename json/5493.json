 "report": [
  "The primary materials I use are: the tin exterior of a tea lite candle, and a rock.",
  "1. Over a lit candle, I put one anadenanthera seed in the tea lite tin. I hold this tin with pliers.",
  "2.  I wait for that seed to either expand in size, or pop and then put it off to the side.",
  "3. Repeat for as many seeds as needed. ",
  "4. After getting 3-4 expanded seeds, I carefully remove the outer shell.",
  "5.  The inside should still be a yellow or off white color. I grind the yellow seeds up, until they are a fine powder.",
  "6. Enjoy my Yopo.",
  "With 1-2 seeds, I use it much like the Yanomamo tribe at times of hunting, as a stimulant.  One or two seeds is just enough to get me going for a short period of time, and also puts me at ease.  For me, it is like a calm jolt of energy."
