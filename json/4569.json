 "report": [
  "amount : 10 grams of kratom leaf finely powdered shared between two people.",
  "I was given the opportunity of bioassaying some kratom recently from a distributor that imports it directly from indonesia.",
  "X (the distributor) described an experience where he himself had taken 1 teaspoon (approximately 2 grams) of the material that had been steeped in a cup of boiled water for 20 minutes and drank material on an empty stomach. To quote him, ' I don't usually take anything now days but after that one spoon full I found myself completely fascinated with the television for close to four hours and I had the sound turned off! '",
  "A plant made television interesting?! - That was enough to pique my curiousity.",
  "I put 10 grams of Kratom into a coffee plunger and filled with enough boiled water for two cups and waited for 20 minutes to steep and cool.",
  "I plunged the concoction to remove loose material floaties. A friend and I then shared an equal amount in two separate cups. The drink was bitter to taste although bearable.",
  "We then went back to some tasks we were into at the time.",
  "At about 20 minutes I started to feel euphoric and chatty although I was noticing a slight slur in my voice and a laziness in my desire to form words clearly. My friend noted an identical effect. We both agreed that the experience was definitely positive and had agreed to repeat the experience at a later time.",
  "We enjoyed the space for about an hour and speculated on what it would be like if we took the rest of the material after again steeping it in some more hot water.",
  "I added the hot water and let it steep for another 15 minutes before stirring vigorously and pouring out two cups.",
  "We then each drank the material and water in one hasty gulp as the drink was close to very foul although I have drunk worse.",
  "Within 15 minutes my body load experience increased and my mind alert and yet drowsy on other levels much like an opiate based stone. I was  close to compelete immobility and a mind numbing stupor. The body load increased and I went into a nausea space noting that my brain felt split in two as my eyes were on the mildy acting independently as they do when I have had maoi's or mushrooms in the distant past.",
  "It was unpleasant as I dont like this sort of space myself as I dont find it good for creativity. I was too stoned to move to be sick as I laid on the lounge like I had been poured like a buttery thick liquid from a jug. So I rode it out for close to two and a half hours.",
  "As I recovered the nausea faded with the other bodily discomforts.",
  "During all this my friend had the luxury of having to deal with a long distance phone call at the time and later mentioned that he was having so much trouble that he nearly had to end the call.",
  "Another friend in the room noted that he had not seen me in that sort of stoned space for well over ten years. Again... not a space I like to be in.",
  "Upon reflection, it is definitely NOT a good idea to high dose on this substance for myself and I will next time take the recommended dose."
