Also forgot to mention that I did a shot of straight gin about 30 minutes before the initial dosing. Considering going to sleep, school in the morning.</p><p>T + 0:40 - Feel very happy, not as tired. I'm putting a movie on and laying down. Typing is somewhat of a challange.</p><p>T + 1:00 -I seem to be coming down already, I'm still as tired as I was, but there is no more happyness or wavy feelings.</p><p>I think that Ambien could be a wonderful drug to experiment with, but I don't think my dose was quite high enough, or maybe the skullcap or alcholol interfeared with the effects.</p>",
