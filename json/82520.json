 "report": "<p>Recently, my friend introduced me to rolling tobacco which I have grown to love. He puts lavender or a dash of cinnamon into his rolled cigarettes. I decided to try it myself.</p><p>I would either put a stalk of it into the pouch for the smell to rub off onto the tobacco, or place a small amount of flowers directly into the pouch.</p><p>I don't notice a difference in the buzz, but I do notice a pleasent taste difference and slight sedative effects that may be placebo.</p><p>I do enjoy adding lavander flavor to my tobacco.</p>",
