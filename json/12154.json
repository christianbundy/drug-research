  "OK...I've been an opiate addict for a number of years and I finally decided to get some help.  After using suboxone to detox, I was put on 5mg of naltrexone.  10 minutes after taking it I go into a uncontrollable siezure-like spasm.  Since I wasn't really certain of what might happen I end up goin to the ER at 1am. ",
  "While laying on the bed in ICU, I am bending backward so far that my feet are touching the back of my head.  5 min later, which seemed like 5 hours, the nurse runs in and gives me a shot of ativan which knocks me out cold.  While asleep I was told that I was still convulsing, but I was happy I was asleep for a little of it.",
  "The nurses couldn't realy do anything else about it so I went home around 2am.  After arriving at my house, I took a serequil so I could sleep, which I soon did.  All of this lasted about 4 hours which seemed like would never end.  The next day I didn't get out of bed, didn't eat, and didn't talk to anyone.  Since I worked out muscles I didn't even know I had my body felt like it was falling apart.  It took me an entire week to become normal again.",
  "Now I will never touch another opiate."
