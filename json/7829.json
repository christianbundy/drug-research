  "<p>I am a North American living in Germany and every year around the end of October I well go on mushroom hunts. In past years these hunts have yielded edible mushrooms, something you can through in you salad but nothing like this year. On my first trip out into the woods, at the back of our house, I made a rather surprising and exciting discovery. On the edge of the forest was a row of tall, old pines and just in front of them in the moist field was a total count of 34 Amanita mushrooms. The caps ranged in size from 3 to 6 inches and stood at least 5 inches of the ground. I picked them all.",
  "This discovery inspired us to keep looking and after a few more days of peeking under pines and maples we had more than doubled our loot. However I had yet to try these red wonders. I was no stranger to magic mushrooms but had never had the pleasure of these. So once they were dried I took part of a large cap, about one gram, and let it steep in hot water for 10 or 15 minuets. Then drank all at once.",
  "The effects were slow, this was I believe a small dose but the effects did come. About 10 minutes after drinking the tea my stomach began to feel somewhat upset but this faded quickly. The about an hour later I noticed I began to feel euphoric and full of good vibrations this was accompanied by an excessive amount of saliva in my mouth it was the opposite of cotton mouth but not at all unpleasant. Music took on a new sound as with other magic mushrooms but I could tell that this dose would not induce a full-blown trip. I was enjoying the effects, however, and about 2 and a half hours after first drinking the tea I began to experience mild tracers and a even more prominent state of wellbeing. These effects lasted until I went to bed not a half an hour later. I am soon to try a much larger dose.</p>"
