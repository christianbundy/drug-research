 "report": "<p>I received an ounce of wild dagga flower tops. The orange peddles smoked great but reading other reports I choose not to smoke the leafs so I made a potent extract by doing the fallowing.</p><p>I soaked an oz of green and orange material in 151 for about an hour. Then added a bunch of water to the mix and boiled the brew for several more hours adding water as needed. When the leave lost much of there color I strained them and boiled off the water into a paste and then further into a powder. The result was about 2-3 grams of potent 'hash'. Can be smoked or used in a potent tea.</p><p>effects:</p><p>~gives a nice head buzz</p><p>~anti-anxiety</p><p>~anti-depressant</p><p>~stimulant</p><p>~opens access to latent memories</p><p>Almost the opposite experience of marijuana (both awesome in there own ways).</p>",
