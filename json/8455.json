  "I've only read negative reports about Seroquel and I don't think this drug is getting the credit it deserves. Obviously anti-psychotics aren't something you should take to get a good 'high'. So if that's what you're trying to do with Seroquel's then just stay away.",
  "I haven't taken any in over a year now, but when I was taking them I found that I got the best sleep I have ever had, like ever! I woke up refreshed, alert and I noticed that my attention to detail was improved. I've experimented with higher doses before, but I've found that for the best sleep I can get, a 50 mg Seroquel will do the trick nicely."
