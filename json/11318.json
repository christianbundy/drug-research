  "So I ingested one bottle of robitussin maximum strength cough the other day @ 3pm (354 mg of DXM) knowing I had a drug test the next day at 6pm. I've read alot of trip reports of people coming up positive for pcp and sometimes opiates when ingesting dxm. I know for a fact that this is possible because my friend took dxm along with a few other substances and ended up in the hospital, and what do ya know? He tested positive for pcp. I myself am on intensive probation and have taken many drug tests the day after taking dxm and have never failed once. I had an empty stomach during my last trip, walked around alot, and usually do, so maybe my body metabolizes the drug before the metabolites get a chance to cling to my system. I also drink a good amount of water before the test and went for an hour walk a few hours prior to the test to 'sweat out' anything that may have been left."
