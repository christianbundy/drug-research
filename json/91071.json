 "report": "<p>First experience with intriguing world of RCs, but caution called for. Aside from mushrooms last fall, I have been away from mind-altering chemicals for 10 years or more, though widely experienced in my youth. I thought this combination sounded interesting, found several reports, one positive stating a typical dosage of 200 mg each. I scaled mine back out of caution.</p><p>T=0 120 mg 4-FA from trusted source.</p><p>T+10 min  180 mg methylone</p><p>T+20 minutes very strong heart beating</p><p>T+30 acute headache, intense heart pounding (no bp monitor available) mild and pleasurable amphetamine like stimulation. Intense sweating for 15 minutes.</p><p>Next two hours alternating between pleasant stimulation, euphoria and fear I would stroke-out. Heart pulsing out of my chest. Pulse rate drops to 44 bpm (normally 72) At 2.5 hours I had come down enough to make trip to nearby drug store. Measured bp 169/95 (normal for me 115/70). Picked up some low-dose aspirin and took a few just in case.</p><p>t=3.5 hrs 60 mg 4-FA. Pleasant stimulation, no additional cardio issues.</p><p>t=5 hrs 80 mg methylone. Brought the bp back up, headache returned but not so bad. Stay away from methylone rest of the night.</p><p>t=8 hrs 60 mg 4-FA.</p><p>Maybe 1 hr sleep that night, disoriented but no speed crash next day.</p><p>Conclusion: Care needed with this combination, and the 200+200 report is probably for someone with tolerance.</p>",
