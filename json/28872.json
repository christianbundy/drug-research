  "<p>Having been interested in meditating for a while I was lucky enough to find a friend who had practised for years and was patient and willing enough to guide me in some simple techniques to help me start. My life till then had been more about escapism rather than trying to just feel , in that , I mean that I mostly got wasted, had a few interesting experiences and truly came to know that there is more to life than just what you see (or think you see).",
  "My first attempt at meditation found me sitting on a chair flat footed, my friend guiding me on how I should let go of conscious thought and try to give out love and take in peace. Keeping my breathing deep and steady helped me to ignore stray sounds , I then tried not to focus on what my eyes (more likely brain) was seeing. The main aim I had at this time was to see if I could actually achieve a state of 'non-thinking'.",
  "It is very hard to describe in writing what actually happens when your head is not full of the sidetrack thoughts of everyday life, but when it does happen one thing certain not to be missed (afterwards) is how time alters. Having perfected my breathing to be in,out and regular I thought I could see my friend sitting below me , just as I had seen him with my eyes open next to me.",
  "Being inexperienced I let my thought focus on this and I swear I was looking from out of my body, not far , but I was . It was like being a spectator of the room, a hidden camera watching two guys do NOTHING. My concentration came back just then and broke the thread.",
  "The strange and educating thing was that the whole experience ,for me , seemed to last about , maybe, ten to twenty minutes. Next thing I know is it is TWO and a half hours later . I did actually feel as if I had done something positive with my time, I felt more connected to whatever is around us and I felt happy for no apparent reason.",
  "My life since then has been a hectic mix of a relationship , a job and a social life, only now , living alone again do I realise what a powerful tool meditation could be!</p>"
