  "During a visit to the Grand Canary Islands (Spain), I enjoyed a story from my father about his experience with the Tree Datura in Brazil.  In a village he ate 1 whole large flower, tripped for 72 hours, naked...etc.  I found it interesting, he told me that he had one growing on the farm.  He also said you could smoke it for a smaller effect.  So the next flower to dry, I pulled out the pollen things, and smoked like a cigar.  At first no initial feelings...I thought it was bunk.  So I kept smoking in hopes of a good feeling.  After burning it all the way down, I felt real funny, similar to PCP.  I saw nice colors, and enjoyed a pleasant feeling, light headedness, with the ocassional trail, and the strangest colorful hallucinations.  I tried it again about 3 days later, but experienced a horrible headache, that made the enjoyable feelings unbearable.  But I have done it again more infrequently, and experienced better results.  I have heard that Datura is very toxic in the brain, and can be deadly if used improperly.  I don't recommend eating or in a tea form.  Smoking seemed safe enough to me..but be careful."
