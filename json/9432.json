 "report": "<p>I had stayed home from school that day and found about 1.5 grams of weed between my beds that I lost. Amazed I quickly went through half of it at 9:30 A.M, saving some for later. I was already lightly sick and figured it would help with some aches and an upset stomach. Through out the day I continued to smoke through the rest, occasionally cutting it with tobacco.</p><p>Near sunset (7:30 P.M) I have hit my tolerance level and my last joint gave me a slight buzz. I decided to go pick up some caffeine pills. Before I left though I made what would normally be for about 8 cups of coffee into one so as to have all my senses while I walked down my dark hill I lived on to 7-11.</p><p>I left around 8:00 P.M after chugging the cup of joe. As I walked down mid-way of the hill, I felt like I was stoned again and began to enjoy it. I was stumbling a lot more than usual which was odd. Then on the side of me where trees were I saw a deer jump out and stand in the center staring at me. As I walked closer it disappeared. I began down the final incline and saw one of my neighbors house. The house was custom made and looked like a castle. I began to hear the wind hitting the sheets like they were hitting my ear drums. I finally crossed the street and was on the path way to the store when extreme paranoia hit me. I began thinking that the cars that were driving by were going to stop and ask me what I was on, as I pictured my self stumbling on the streets. For the time to the store I would slow when a car came by and stare at it with terror until it passed. But by the time I reached the store it was gone and I felt safe again. I bought the caffeine (200 mg each, 16 tabs) and began home taking a different route this time because I was worried that people would suspect something.</p><p>Theres a detour way up the hill I took which was a bad idea. By now it was pitch black and I was non-stop shaking. As I went through the forest way to my house I would hear things in the background. They would arouse my imagination and I would falsely hear screams or shouts at me. I would reply, but no one would call back. I finally came home with scrapes all over my arms and legs from running in the forest. I stupidly forgot for some odd reason about the coffee I drank and how much it sucked during the walk and took three pills at about 8:30 P.M. Amounting 600mg+ about 800mg=1400mg (which I've taken before and had no problem). My parents arrived home about 9:00 P.M and I felt great like everything was in tune with me or vice-versa. I listened to my old Third Eye Blind CD and began to feel just like everything was good.</p><p>Unfortunately that night wasn't good because around 10:00 P.M all I could do was play my CD player, sleep, and have REALLY BAD DIARRHEA. I think it was worth that hour of serenity though. I'll probably try it again, but without coffee just the pills cause I think thats what caused the diarrhea.</p>",
