 "report": "<p>I've been reading about salvia splendens for awhile. This is my 1st contact with this substance.</p><p>I bought a plant and let it grow for a few days. It is flowering nicely now so I picked 5 flowers off the top of the plant. I let them dry in the window sill on a plate for 24 hours then placed them in my bowel and took the first hit. It was very smooth, a little weird taste but with the same taste as salvia divinorum.</p><p>After about 30 seconds my body felt very heavy and noticed a very small visuals, not alot just a very little. I smoked the next 2 hits and the bowel was cashed the heaviness gave me a high somewhere between salvia div and dxm. After 10 mins the heaviness lifted and I felt really really great just happy about everything. This lasted for about 2 hours. Afterwards there was no hangover and withdrawal. No side effects.</p>",
