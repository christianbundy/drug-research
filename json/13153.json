  "I took the mushrooms in some food. They are actually tasty, though they smell like human urine...",
  "Anyway, I had the same experience as a few others, of a kind of 'looping' thought pattern. I did have CEVs that went along with the looping, but they were completely uninteresting. The same thoughts would run through my head for hours... thoughts which seemed meaningless. I simply could not wait for it to end. Luckily, it only lasted about 3 hours, and then I could get up and do things again. I would never do this again. It seems that the experience really depends on the person, I guess."
