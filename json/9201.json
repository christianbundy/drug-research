  "I guess I should start that I am a diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenic.  I've been on Clozaril for several years which is the only med that helped the Hallucinations. I have social anxiety... when I'm around people I get nervous and an increase in Schizo stuff.",
  "I've been on Citalopram for a about 15 days. I must say... just taking this stuff as prescribed does wonders for my anxiety.  I get the feeling like it's a beautiful spring day all day every day. It makes me feel happy. I'm not sure how this drug can effect other people but it's quite soothing for me. If you are on more than one drug for mental illness I really dont advise mixing with street drugs."
