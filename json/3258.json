 "report": [
  "I have searched the net far and wide for more information on the Henbane plant, especially dosage information. I have found very little data on the subject.",
  "Some time ago, a friend of mine purchased some henbane seeds from an online vendor. I agreed to be a sitter while Tim tried smoking the seeds. I convinced him to start with a very low dose, about 3 seeds. I figured try smoking a few, wait an hour or so, then possibly smoke 3 more. The seeds are very small, and Tim was not certain that he got a hit. After an hour went by, there were no noticable effects, so he smoked 3 more seeds. Again, nothing of note. This concluded the experiment for the evening.",
  "On the next attempt, Tim smoked about 6 seeds at once. After about 45 minutes, he smoked about 8 more. He said there was a very slight 'woozy' effect, but nothing substantial. He quit for the evening.",
  "The last experiment was quite a bit more aggressive. He smoked about a dozen seeds at once. After about a half hour, he smoked roughly 20 more seeds. He claimed that the 'woozy' effect had returned, but he was nothing even close to a 'trip'. He ended up smoking well over 100 seeds that evening. In fact, he smoked all that was left. He did not have any significant reaction to the seeds.",
  "After reading up on Henbane, I am very surprised that this was not a sufficient dose. The seeds apparently are higher in alkaloid content than the leaves.",
  "I AM NOT SUBMITTING THIS REPORT TO SUGGEST THAT YOU START OFF WITH OVER 100 SEEDS. BEING THAT TROPANE ALKALOIDS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS, I SUGGEST THAT YOU USE THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH THAT WE DID TO FIND THE PROPER DOSAGE. I am hoping that there will be more information about this plant available in the future."
