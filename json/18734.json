 "report": [
  "I have taken doxepin on a number of occasions, usually in the 10-30mg range. It seems to be a relatively safe tricyclic antidepressant, compared to other TCA's, and wiki states that it has low abuse potential (citing 'polytoxicomania' as one of the only reasons for its abuse).",
  "I have found this to be somewhat true, as I may be a polytoxicomaniac by definition, but in that regard I view this as a very promising substance. It provides a slight sedation and feeling reminiscent of benzodiazepines, and I remember thinking that it would mix well with a benzo. I've yet to try this, so I can't recommend anyone else do so, but I thought I'd share my experience just in case."
