 "report": [
  "We have a Ginkgo tree in our front yard and I use it regularly by chewing up and swallowing as quick as possible one or two leaves with orange juice (or anything acidic). This herb is VERY bitter in its fresh state.",
  "I often find that it will slightly increase my mental alertness and concentration. I usually take it before school and it definitely improves my mathematics and chemistry, I can work solidly and uninterrupted focusing and gradually figuring out the problems. But",
  "I'd say that its most significant effect is noticed when taken with a stimulant.",
  "Ginkgo goes well with coffee amplifying the effects of the coffee significantly. It will also make 15mg of dexamphetamine feel like 30mg. I went to a new years celebration last night and after using Ginkgo with coffee this morning I feel almost completely normal and fresh."
