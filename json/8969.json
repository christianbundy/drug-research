 "report": [
  "I would consider myself decenty experienced and safe drug user. my friend C had a bunch of codeine from a prescription he got after surgery. I had had a concussion the day before and was feeling pretty out of it..... it was kind of a drunk/ouch/dumb feeling, but mostly ouch. I took 2 of the pills with some iced tea (MMMMM). The pills contained 30mg of codeine and 300mg of acetaminophen in each. My friend told me that  that was a dose that I probably wouldnt notice any euphoria on, just relief from my head pain.",
  "All it did was take away my head ache. The next day I took 3 pills, it felt pretty good, the next day I took 3, felt good and the next day I took 4 after I came down from coke (which was a great time to take them). For every single one of those 4 days I felt extremely un-horny. Which is weird cuz Im usually an animal. Getting boners was not impossible but it was a chore, I was even watching a good porno on the last day and still didnt really feel turned on, I read up on codeine and didnt see it say that this was a symptom. So there is my experience with codeine."
