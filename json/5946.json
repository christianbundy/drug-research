 "report": [
  "I live in Japan where it is very hard and expensive to find good drugs. Recently I decided to give legal drugs a try and ordered some hawaiian woodrose from the net. Now before I did this I read through these posts and people had all different types of experiences. Some people raved about the seeds and some people seem to think they are a hoax.",
  "Preparation",
  "I removed the coating off 10 seeds. This is very easy to do. I managed to get them clean with a spoon, I didn't even need a knife. I then grounded them up in a mini cuisinart. I then put the seeds in a bottle of mineral water and let them soak for 4 hours. I was concerned about the vomit effect everybody seems to have, so I then filtered the green water through a coffee filter to make sure there was no seed material in the water.",
  "Effects",
  "15 min after drinking - My mouth started to get a tingling sensation",
  "25 min - The trance music was really sounding good",
  "40 min - I started to get a huge energy boost. I was ready for the clubs. My eyes were fully dilated",
  "50 min - I stopped at a bar on the way to the club, but they were playing country music (yes even in Japan). I had too much energy to sit down anyway. This was also the first time I noticed that my sense of time was screwed up. i was in the bar for about 20 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours.",
  "2 hours",
  "I got to the club and was about to go in when I got a phone call from a girl I know. She said she wanted to try it also, and since I had prepared two portions for such an event I went to her apartment.",
  "3 hours",
  "She had drunk done her bottle and about 30 minutes had past. We were staring at a toy I bought at toys r us that lights up and moves around. We were getting nice trails off of it. It was just really pretty.",
  "4 hours",
  "I noticed that my body was feeling more sensitive, especially the bottoms of my feet. I think an hour before this I couldn't have sex if I wanted to, but now I could, so I did. I don't know if this was because of the seeds or not, but the sex was harder then usual and I couldn't cum. Once again time was messed up because we thought we were at it for 4 hours, but it had only been an hour and a half.",
  "5 1/2 hours",
  "I went home and on my way home I noticed how pretty all the lights looked. My night vision was great. I drive a motorcycle so I had a great time looking around and feeling the night.",
  "6 hours",
  "When I finally decided to lay down and go to sleep I was in for a surprise. I kept thinking that it wasn't anything like LSD, but I was too pumped up for it to notice. As soon as I closed my eyes and relaxed I was tripping big time. My limbs and body were shrinking and enlongating and doing all kinds of funky things.  Finally I fell asleep at 6 in the morning, 9 hours after drinking the seeds."
