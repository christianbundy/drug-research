  "I've had two great experiences with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose prior to this one. Both times I used a simple water extraction. I did not prepare myself at all for this experience. I was in the process of performing a slightly more complicated extraction, and was waiting for the water to evaporate. I grew impatient and decided to try a sublingual dose. I smashed 13 seeds into small chunks, after scraping off the coating, and put them under my tongue with some sugar. I was having a very difficult time keeping them under my tongue and decided to just swallow them, since I had experienced no nausea at all in my previous experiences. This was a very bad decision.",
  "About an hour or so later, I started to feel minor effects. I had to write a letter to a college honors program that I had been putting off, but in this state I thought very clearly and wrote it quickly and much better than I would have normally. When I was done, I went to my room to lie down. I was feeling generally happy at this point. I started a cd and lay down in my bed, waiting for the seeds to take full effect.",
  "At some point I fell asleep, I don't remember much before falling asleep, only that prior to sleeping I felt no nausea. This was certainly not true when I awoke later that night. I have no idea how long I slept. I lay there for a while, feeling the nausea increase with every movement. Finally I decided to go to the bathroom and attempt to throw up. As I stood, I felt the vertigo hit me, and dizzily made my way to the bathroom. I struggled for a bit trying to lift the toilet lid. After unsuccessfully trying to vomit for a few minutes, I returned to my room to try to sleep. When I got back to my room, I saw my alarm clock, unplugged and on the side of the bed opposite the wall. I have absolutely no memory of unplugging it.",
  "I lay down on my bed watched as my room bent and twisted. I felt like the room was spinning around me. I eventually closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but sleep would not come. I then entered the worst state of mind I have ever experienced. As I lay on the bed, endlessly tossing and turning, discovering that the room was spinning, finding out that my alarm clock was unplugged, I realized that I had experienced this before. I eventually went back to the bathroom to throw up, but it wouldn't happen. I would finally give up and go back to my room, rediscover the alarm clock, and start my cd over at song 12, because song 11 skipped.",
  "I repeated this cycle too many times to count. I though it would never end. I began to hate the visuals and wish for death, because I thought it was the only way out (I later discovered that at some point while I was writhing on my bed, wishing to die, Albert Hoffman actually did die, which creeped me out to no end. may he rest in peace). Eventually, I saw the sky outside lighten. I felt incredible joy and incredible terror at the same time. The sunrise meant that time was real, and I was going to get out of this. Until then, I had no sense of time because my alarm clock was unplugged. At the same time, I felt terror.",
  "The sunrise meant that my mom would be up soon, and I was still high. I heard her going into the bathroom by my room, which meant she would be waking me up soon. I decided to avoid that by quickly walking to the other bathroom and taking a shower, hoping that the shower would help me come down. When I got to the bathroom, I finally resolved to stick a finger down my throat and just get the poison out of me. I managed to vomit several times, which temporarily reduced the nausea, but didn't bring me back down at all. As I looked in the mirror, my eyes looked like giant black holes, barely rimmed by light blue (which is the absolute worst eye color for someone as fond of psychoactives as me). I was in the shower for something like 20 minutes. I still had no concept of time, but I seemed to be in there for a while, but the water was still hot, so 20 minutes is my best guess. I felt much more grounded as I emerged from the shower, but, to my horror, my pupils were still enormous, and I new I couldn't avoid my mom. When I ran into her I acted utterly exhausted and constantly rubbed my eyes so she wouldn't see my pupils, and told her I wasn't feeling well, which was true.",
  "I then discovered that it was only 6:00 and I didn't need to get up for another hour and a half, so I returned to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. When I awoke, I quickly made my way to the bathroom to look in the mirror, and my pupils were back to normal, but I still felt horribly sick. I spent the morning lying down, wrapped in a thick blanket. I tried to eat some bread in hopes that it would settle my stomach, but I could only manage a couple bites. I filled a giant mug with some cereal and headed to class (I couldn't stay home because I had a test). I was really worried about driving, but I had gotten to the point where my head was spinning and I was nauseous, but no longer inebriated. I surprised myself by driving very well, without any problems.",
  "I continued to feel nauseous throughout the day, and had some interesting closed-eye hallucinations, although they could easily have been connected to my lack of sleep rather than the seeds. As I was walking to class from the parking lot, I closed my eyes for a few seconds without realizing it. With my eyes closed, I continued to see what I had been seeing, but the world was ripping itself apart. Suddenly I opened my eyes, which is when I discovered I had closed them, and everything was normal again. This happened several other times throughout the morning.",
  "I finally got home about 1:30 and slept until 5:00. I awoke feeling much better, with the nausea having almost completely subsided. I learned a valuable lesson, that is, DO NOT EAT THE SEEDS PLAIN. I am very, very thankful it's over and I didn't cause any long term damage, or get caught. I was extremely lucky."
