 "report": "<p>I just got back from an amazing day of exploration with 2C-E of the phenethylamine family. This is the first time I have tried a phenethylamine other than MDMA. I approximately measured out 20mg by splitting the 100mg I had into five even piles. </p><p>About an hour after ingestion I vomited and could see that what little material I produced was pretty white with the substance, but apparently I still digested enough of it...  The tryp was amazing. Climbing up and down the wooded valley, it was impossible to tell where the facemelting patterns ended and nature began. Fungal growths on treebark were breathing, crawling, oozing with life. The tingly warm sensation of kundalini coursed through my veins, out my eyes and mouth (constantly agape with awe). It was like a 5 hour psychick orgasm. Staring up from the trunk of a mighty oak was breathtaking and rapturous (even more than usual that is...). Patterns crawled along every rock and through the pores of my flesh. I was engulfed, submerged, at the mercy of this advanced alchemy.</p>",
