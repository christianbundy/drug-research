 "report": "<p>This summer, after researching it, but with low expectations of effects, I ordered several ounces of Wild Dagga flowers from an online source.</p><p>Upon arrival: the flowers have a slight odor, but subtle...like, a really faint mix of earth and lemon.  They look very bright and fresh, and are quite fuzzy and prickly.</p><p>3 P.M.</p><p>Subject is a moderately heavy smoker (just under a pack a day), 3-5 time a week cannabis user, and weekend drinker, but fairly physically fit.   Subject had a full stomach, had consumed roughly 100 mg of caffeine about 3 hours before, and had smoked 3 cigarettes since awakening.</p><p>I proceeded to take a walk out in the woods (where I always go to try new herbs), and loaded up a clean, fresh pipe with no thc resin in it whatsoever.  I lit it and slowly drew in a heavy lungful.  The smoke is VERY thick, and smells like a bonfire, but for some reason, isn't too incredibly harsh on the throat. I end up smoking the entire bowl fairly quickly, and lighting up a cigarette.</p><p>T + 5 minutes- Starting to feel a little lightheaded, the same 'head space' cannabis gives me.  AND the euphoria of cannabis. But comparisons end there.  My mind is clear and grounded, and my thoughts are focused.  I feel very content and relaxed, but not 'impaired'. </p><p>T + 10 minutes- Walking back to my house,feeling a bit more tired now...much more potent than I had expected (remember, however, I had VERY low expectations...I was expecting an effect like I've gotten from blue and white lotuses, wild lettuce, damiana, kratom, etc....in other words, no effect at all.)</p><p>T+ 15 minutes-effects are gently dissipating, and I'm comfortable and relaxed laying in the hammock, reading in the sun. </p><p>Since this first time, I've come to use Wild Dagga pretty much daily.  I have anxiety problems, and dagga seems to calm my nerves, especially along with valerian root.  The only downsides to this wonderful plant, from what I can see, are</p><p>A: Smoking it is probably not very good for the body, and</p><p>B: Even though Wild Dagga tea is good and effective(lasts longer), in my experiences, it takes a significantly larger amound of Wild Dagga to make a tea that is potent enough.  For this reason, I intend on growing and harvesting some of my own plants next season, to cut down on costs (and, of course, to enjoy the fruits of my own labor).</p>",
