 "report": [
  "Since coming off the Pill, I had the most painful periods  - great big cramps. I have Valerian growing wild in my backyard, so I simply ate a small green leaf every two hours. The leaf took about an hour to take effect, and almost completely removed the cramps, and another leaf lightly chewed (tastes awful!) every two hours kept the cramps at bay for the next 8 hours. Side effects: made me a bit lethargic, and I went to bed early and slept very deeply.",
  "Verdict: worked just as well as conventional anti-inflammatories! Highly recommended, though probably best to avoid alcohol or driving while taking it."
