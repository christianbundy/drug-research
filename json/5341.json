 "report": "<p>MDMA Protocol</p><p>Night prior (8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg</p><p>Morning on waking: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. (Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or</p><p>Oyster Shell) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP</p><p>Ingestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets</p><p>Booster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP</p><p>4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg</p><p>Remarks:</p><p>Cal-Mg is best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate (Dolomite).</p><p>Total dose is about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also</p><p>note, that the Jaw is the primal expressive organ for all  chordates, and</p><p>serotonin very applicable. Full leeches given serotonin then double their</p><p>blood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessens jaw problems, part of psych</p><p>prep for new users (sez my foaf).</p><p>Prozac reduces tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies</p><p>the wiped out feeling for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs</p><p>such as Zoloft.</p><p>5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasts longer. Seems to</p><p>allow learning to be absorbed better.</p><p>Note that side effects curve is steep, try 20mg less and you may have much</p><p>less of them.</p><p>PS. This protocol is very effective and known to work well.</p>",
