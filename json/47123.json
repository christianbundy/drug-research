 "report": "<p>I've been searching everywhere for someone with a similar experience, but havn't found anything.  So here goes:</p><p>I was having a lonesome night, so I decided to smoke a small bowl and relax with a movie.  I would consider myself an 'experienced' smoker - smoked for about 5 yrs, regularly for about 2.  So this was no big deal.  I had a few drinks as well, but nothing over normal.  So I enjoyed the movie and everything was great.  By the time the movie was over, I noticed that I seemed unusally baked for how much I had smoked.  I didn't think anything of it, and decided I needed to pee and go to bed.  So made my way to the bathroom to pee.  When I was done, I must have stood up too fast, as my vision started to go as it sometimes does when anyone does this.  I steadied myself then realized that my legs weren't going to support me.  I feel to the floor, my vision and motor skills completly gone.  I started convulsing, but might not have even known it if it wasn't for my head which kept banging against the closed door.  I don't know if any/how much time passed after I stopped having this 'mini-seizure' or whatever.  At some point my vision came back and I stood up, very shaken but alright.</p><p>I had seen this happen to a guy in Amsterdamn - the woman working at the bar gave him sugar water.  Remembering this, I grabbed a coke and headed for bed.</p><p>I am wondering if anyone else had an experience like this, whether I did the right thing, or what should I do if this happens again.  (also, what causes it?  low blood sugar?)</p>",
