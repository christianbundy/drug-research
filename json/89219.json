  "<p>Purchased 1g pure JWH-018 to compare with mj as an economical alternative.",
  "Usual MJ use is once every other day, similar alcohol use, no other drugs used (except tobacco). MJ use is primarily for creative stimulation/mental buzz and comfortable body feel (body glow).",
  "Overall review:",
  "PROs -",
  "- a good mj alternative for the mental effects,",
  "- very manageable duration (1.5h),",
  "- fantastic economic advantage ($50/3 month daily use),",
  "- Still legal in many states",
  "CONs -",
  "- Dosage control, prone to unpleasant trip with excessive dose",
  "- Lacking mj's pleasant body effects",
  "- Headaches and possibly other blood pressure related effects",
  "Detailed experience:",
  "The pure jwh-018 arrived as a white grainy powder in a small Carmex-like jar. Other experience reports indicated 3-10mg as the dosage, and that it was easy to overshoot the dosage by many 10s of mg. So, a dosage calculation was needed. Handling the pure confirmed it was difficult to get a consistent amount using tools at hand (matchsticks, paper fold, etc.). Working with such small amounts also resulted in an unacceptable proportion lost to spillage/static bits. ",
  "First try, day 1, careful to deposit only a few grains (~3mg) on top of a bowl of sage, resulted in a weak experience. Nice mental buzz and activity, but low peak and short duration (~45 minutes noticeable). No noticeable body effects.",
  "Second try, day 3, turned out to be an overcompensation (~20+mg on top of bowl of sage), with an immediate rush that quickly became unpleasant. Strong mental wawa effect, with noticeably uncomfortable bodily reaction. A quick vomit 5 minutes in to the experience brought my body feel back into line for 5 minutes, another bout at 10 minutes as the intensity escalated. I held on by mediating as best I could and purging two more times until the trip peaked at about 45 minutes. Once it was no longer strengthening, I could relax and enjoy the rest of the trip. Mental buzz for another 1.5 hours, but mainly preoccupied with gauging my own reactions.",
  "Subsequent half dozen doses were more carefully measured and enjoyable. I finally decided to cut the bulk of it with sage to make it easier to use with a dugout. First used 1:10 (jwh-018 to sage), but found random variation produced some spots with an unpleasantly high dosage. Settled on 1:20 and mixed well.",
  "Consistent effects obtained at ~8mg, 1-2 minute onset, mental buzz and creative stimulation peaking at 45 minutes, little to no noticeable body effects during, total experience lasting for 1.5 hours.",
  "Continued to smoke for 1 week at every other day with no noticeable side effects. Clear mental buzz, but sadly lacking the comfortable body glow of mj.",
  "Increased frequency to test for side-effects. 2 weeks daily, I noticed occasional headaches, which I almost never have. 2 weeks three times daily, occasional headaches and occasional limb going to sleep. I was doing a fair amount of work with my hands at the time, where I have seen a similar limb effects. However, I still wonder what the effects are on blood pressure and circulation. Headaches were clearly a side-effect of jwh-018. Nothing more than an occasional nuisance that lasted for 2 minutes until noticed, but, as said, it is very unusual for me to get headaches.",
  "Resumed once a day morning usage for the remainder (2+ months!). Continued to have the occasional headaches. Limb numbness tailed off at the same time as I reduced working with my hands and finished remainder, so no clear relation.",
  "Overall, well worth the time, would do it again, but will not use more than once per day on a regular basis.</p>"
