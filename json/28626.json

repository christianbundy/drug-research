 "report": "<p>I had a long working week behind. I had planned to try iprocin for quite a while and this day I had the opportunity. Here is a short description of my first experience with iprocin.</p><p>16.28 5mg of 4-ho-dipt swallowed in a capsule. Went to grocery to buy some juice and headed to H's place soon after.</p><p>16.45 10mg more swallowed in a capsule.</p><p>17.03 The first alert is noted, some heightening of awareness. My neck is a big tight, otherwise fine.</p><p>17.30 The start was very smooth, nearly unnoticable. Not much visuals, the floor is flowing like a thick liquid and slight alteration of visual perception, but nothing to awe at. I am very lethargic, which might be due to lack of sleep previous night. E had woken up 3am and we couldn't get her back sleep until after 5am, then I woke up at 8am to go to work today. No physical push of any kind. Thoughts are in motion, atmosphere is soft and easy, similar to mellow mushroom trip. I try to lead the discussion to some philosophical questions, but I am too lethargic to keep up the discussion.</p><p>I mainly lay on the couch listening to music. After some time a few more friends appear. I notice that I am a lot less talkative than my friends smoking weed. I tend to just listen to their talking and think about some miscellaneous things flowing around my head. Less lack of sleep and this would propably be a lot more interesting experience. Also a few more milligrams wouldn't be bad either.</p><p>19.35 I head to the bus. Brisk weather wakes me up a little bit. While sitting in the bus I begin to see the depth of Iprocin. I arrive to town and while walking there, looking at the trees lining the H-street, I get some 'big thoughts' that seemed to come out of nowhere. Thoughts that I cannot express in words, but I will try anyway. I realized the trees and the urban enviroment create a large ecological system where people are part of it.</p><p>For some reason, trees have always been magnificent and very inspiring to look at when I am in an altered state of mind. I feel that this could be a profound substance on heavier dose. Everything seems visually normal in town yet I sense as if I was a different species of all other wanderers going by, yet sharing a lot of genes with many of them. Is this a psychedelic version of 'uniqueness' in society? Couldn't answer that. I wonder how many of those passers-by have seen this psychedelic light. How many of them are enlightened? Am I being a bit elitish here? Thinking those that have not seen this psychedelic 'light' are somehow less in my eyes. Are they?</p><p>This is a remarkable thing in my life. I think about my experiences through years. There are many important and very distinct things I have experienced in my life, eating, sleeping, hearing music, falling in love, getting angry, seeing different cultures and countries, having good friends, laughing, crying, being a father, having sex and .. experiencing psychedelia, altered state of consciousness. Alcohol does that too, yes, but that is like getting your field of vision shrinked and motorical coordination whacked. Many other things does that too, when I am sleepy or when I am having strong emotions. Coffee does that too. This is just something very  different. I wouldn't be the same man, I would be less, if I had never experienced psychedelic state of mind. This very thing I am feeling now. Uh, perhaps I had better go home. After half on hour walking in town, I take the train back home.</p><p>20.45 I can barely notice anything anymore.</p><p>21.30 Iprocin has definitely left the building.</p><p>Aftermath:</p><p>What to think? Clearly the dose was small, I was far from being 'wasted', but still ... deep thoughts and easily provoked to any direction by a little effort. This is clearly a mind expanding substance, by the very definition of the word. I have no doubt now that Iprocin wouldn't be a profound experience on higher amounts.</p>",
