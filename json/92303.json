 "report": "<p>Phenibut has the most confusing descriptions of its properties and effects of almost any drug. Some take it with alcohol, but their are warnings that it should not be. Strong hangovers result from this combination.</p><p>After taking too many the first day, I was sick in bed until 9 p.m. and threw up three times the next morning. Usually instructions are to take it at first in very small quantities in order to determine tolerance. This is a good idea as I took way too many at first, but less than the bottle label prescribed.</p><p>Now I take only one in the morning and one at night. It is supposed to be a muscle relaxant and good for anxiety. Maybe. But it definitely induces sleep very effectively - more so than melatonin or the many melatonin herbal concoctions on the market. It is often said not to take it more than two or three days in a row and then take a break. Or that it takes two weeks at a very low dosage to work best.</p><p>But who knows. All I know is that it is strong and you should not take as much as recommended on the label - especially not at first. Two pills at the most, one during the day and one at night.</p>",
