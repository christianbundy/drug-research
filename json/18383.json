 "report": [
  "Recently I was prescribed Lithium Carbonate, 300 mg per day, because the Lithium levels in my body are too low. Two nights ago my boyfriend and I took some LSD at about 10:30pm. Taking acid is a regualar activity for he and I. We each took about 3 doses of some really good LSD, and everything was great for me until about two hours in, when I started loosing ability to form words or talk, and I was extremely upset,erratic and had an unusual influx in emotions. This continued until about 5am, when I just became completely distraught and uncalmable. I suddenly went into a violent seizure for a minute and a half. My boyfriend called 911 and an ambulance came and brought me to the emergency room."
