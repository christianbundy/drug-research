 "report": "<p>We had what we thought was enough for 3 people. Luckily (for me) there were 4 of us.</p><p>Thinking that we were short a dose I decided to rack it into 4 piles [each 40mg (I think)] and snort the stuff.</p><p>less than 10 seconds later I was higher than I have ever been. The feeling was intense. Like a really, really good pill mixed with coke and a trip. But the intensity didn't stop. 20 seconds later I was throwing up. Sometime in the following 10 minutes I reached the point of no return... police and ambulance arrived. I stopped breathing once at the house and once in the ambulance. I wasn't expected to make it. My friends were in the police car behind the ambulance and heard over the radio that I probably wasn't going to make it... they were trapped in their own little hell. Me in mine. It was so intense that I tried to strangle myself with my IV line.</p><p>Luckily I found my way out of the nightmare and was discharged from hospital after the cops tested the substance and found nothing illegal in what we were taking.</p><p>The staff treated us like pure crap for being a waste on there resources.</p><p>The experience was wrong. Scary. I still loose sleep sometimes over the whole thing...</p>",
