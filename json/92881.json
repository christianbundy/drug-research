 "report": "<p>I had suffered from moderately severe depression for a couple of years. I had been drinking heavily during this time. I was obsessed with the idea of dying...I wanted to be dead and had researched the lethal dosage of a few drugs and taken a dosage higher than that which I had read about. After being prescribed five different SSRI's/SNRI's, as well as a couple of benzodiazepines...and my depression not responding to any of them...I decided to try something that would apparently instantly relieve my depression.</p><p>GBL (which converts to GHB in the body) really did instantly relieve my depression. It made me more sociable, destroyed my anxiety and actually made me get things done...for a while. I re-dosed constantly (after every 2-3 hours...and then after a few months I would re-dose once an hour). After a couple of months I decided I was taking too much because it was starting to have a very negative impact on my life. I was withdrawn, falling asleep all of the time and becoming hyper-sociable.</p><p>I STUPIDLY didn't realise that it was physically addictive and went to bed without taking ang GBL one night. I awoke about three hours later shaking, hallucinating and vomiting. I then read more online and realised I was physically addicted.</p><p>This went on for a further 6 months. I put my family though HELL supporting me through my addiction...relapsing...it being CONSTANTLY on my mind...stealing...getting more GBL...collapsing...being hospitalised...going to rehab.</p><p>I had been prescribed baclofen (an agonist of the GABAb receptors...just like GBL...and so stops the withdrawals) but had only been prescribed 30mg a day (3X10mg doses a day).</p><p>One day I was so sick of the neverending addiction (which was literally HELL) I decided to take my full 30mg allowance at once. It completely ERADICATED my psychological need for the drug.</p><p>I titrated my dose to between 80-100mg a day and for the first time in what seemed like forever, I had completely stopped thinking about GBL. I began functioning normally...like I was before my depression and addiction. I have also noticed a massive decrease in my desire for alcohol.</p><p>My family and friends re-found their trust in me. Everybody has commented on how much I seem normal again.</p><p>It was around this time that my depression, for the first time in years, felt suddenly lifted too. I am now of an apparent normal state of mind. All of my wonderfully strange personality remains...baclofen has taken nothing away from me and given me everything back.</p><p>I understand that stopping the use of baclofen can have horrible withdrawals...but in time I will slowly decrease my use of baclofen.</p><p>For anybody that is struggling with their GHB/GBL addiction (or alcohol addiction) then please consider baclofen. I have a few friends that were addicted to GBL, and after advising to them about baclofen...have also experienced the same amazing results.</p><p>Good luck, and stay educated and safe.</p>",
