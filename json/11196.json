 "report": [
  "Im a relatively experienced morning glory tripper, but after several recent bad trips (severe nausea for 5-6 hours after ingestion), I began to eat the seeds in low doses of less than a hundred separated by an hour to an hour and a half. Some nights, Id get down 50 or 60 before Id stop, and later decide against tripping in favor of going to bed.",
  "Im also an insomniac. On some nights, Ive been up as early as 4-5 in the morning when I have to be up at six. Morning glory seeds arent practical on weekdays, but a great way to make up sleep debt on the weekends without sleeping in; although psychoactive effects at such a low dose are hardly noticeable while awake (if at all), on a given morning glory night I have at least 10 dreams I can remember the following morning. Also, the dreams are unusually vivid, logical and long, with one or two of them being lucid dreams.",
  "Even though I wake up feeling heavy and physically tired, after 20 minutes or so of this I feel refreshed and energetic, a great way to prepare oneself right before a long and exhausting week."
