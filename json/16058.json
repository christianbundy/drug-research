 "report": [
  "I obtained Phenibut from an internet supplier that I was also obtaining other chemicals from, mainly just to try it out.",
  "At approximately 8pm I weighed out 2 doses of 2 grams each (a low-moderate dose), for myself and a friend. I mixed the doses in water, added some sugar, and drank the resulting (foul-tasting) mixture. I followed this up with a beer, on the advise of others that beer greatly enhanced the effects. I was in a generally good mood with no feelings of problems. The friend was somewhat stressed from having just moved and all that goes with a new house and unpacking.",
  "Within a half hour to 45 minutes, I started feeling subtle changes, mostly a feeling of being 'altered'. I had some slight vision changes, and began to feel relaxed, similar to vicodin. I sank into the chair and listened to music and chatted with some friends on the internet. The effects were very subtle at first, but become more pronounced over time. It was similar to taking a vicodin or two in effects. Increased sexual interest was also noted. I took another gram approximately 1.5 hours after initial ingestion but went to sleep before additional effects could be noted. I slept especially soundly.",
  "The next morning, I noted a 'hangover' consisting of slight lightheadedness and poor large motor control (I kept walking into things as thought I were drunk). I felt mentally fine, however.",
  "My friend, who was stressed, felt no initial effects that were separately from the beer we were drinking, but she noticed the same hangover I had the next morning. At this point, we aren't sure if the dosage was too small or if the stress levels were affecting her perceptions."
