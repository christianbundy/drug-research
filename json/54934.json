 "report": "<p>Before I had many experiences with western theraupetics so I reasonded that in my Ayahuasca experiences,I should use a reversible MAO inhibitor like moclobemide (Aurorix) to increase the effeciency of the brew.</p><p>SO that's what I did. On two seperate occasions, I brewed P.viridis and B.caapi mixture (50gr each) and took this mixture an hour after taking two seperate doses of 100mg moclobemide.</p><p>On these occasions, while waiting for the moclobemide to kick in before the brew, I felt that my hands and mouth drying and my back starting to stiffen.(Being a pyschonaut for sometime I try to be aware of these changes as much as I can).</p><p>Nevermind, when I drank the brew I found that moclobemide really dimmed the visuals and most interestingly increased the emotional tone of the experience in mostly in a negative way. I felt much more queasy, insecure and withdrawn from my surroundings. Also I physically trembled more.</p><p>I had a similiar experience with a serotonin reuptake ACCELERATOR (tianeptine) before. At that time as well I was almost shivering down to my bones. It is very striking that moclobemide effects serotonergic systems massively. [Nevertheless, I should add that, tianeptine should not be combined with any MAOI containing drug or herb.]</p><p>My other experiences with the same batch of herbs at the same dose interval were quite mind-opening and valuable even without addition of moclobemide. So far I have found moclobemide a bad admixture to the brew that dimms valuable emotional colors.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>",
