 "report": [
  "So the other night I came upon some cyclobenzaprine. I tried it by itself, and the effects were unnoticeable. The next night I decided to go all out and swallowed 4 metaxalone and 4 cyclobenzaprine. As I waited I smoked a bowl of some very kushy dro I got the other night. I was watching the latest Harry Potter movie and I noticed the effects of the pills settle in. I felt euphoric. Similar to an amphetamine high. Minor details became magical to me. Very, very pleasant high",
  "I woke up around 2pm the next day, and Im not sure when I actually fell asleep. But that day was very unpleasant. I was irritable, pissed off, angry...and I didnt know why. All day I just sat in my room very, very mad. It was tormenting being so angry for no apparent reason, and the only logical reason I can think of now is the drug-combo I had the other night.",
  "So in conclusion. I will never do this combo of muscle relaxers again. The next day is 100 times worse than the night before."
