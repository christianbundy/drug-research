 "report": [
  "Made tea from 5 grams of voacanga africana root. I let it steep for an hour. Smells like ginseng, tastes fiery, awful.",
  "1:00 - Finished drinking the tea.",
  "2:30 - Mild stimulant effect, similar to caffeine. Not much else as far as I can tell.",
  "5:00 - Still feel the effect. It's not a bad caffeine substitute if not for the flavour."
