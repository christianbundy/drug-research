 "report": [
  "I smoked a bowl of dried white sage about 10 mins ago, and I definetely have some sensations of the effects.",
  "My extremeties are tingling with a sort of vibrate-y feel, and I have some sensitivity to light (no pain, but a sense of wonder over it)",
  "No haziness, but sort of a cloudy feeling.",
  "Um, some weird rememberance of the scythians and burning entire plants of cannabis in a smokehouse.",
  "I loved the smoke, one of the smoothest, without any need to cough, (menthol content possibly having its effect?)",
  "Sense to the past, or of remembering. Impulsivity increased.",
  "Very interesting overall, and true to the sage name, there is an element of guidance to this herb. Will probably do again, in mixture with other herbs because of the ease of burning and smoke.",
  "oh yeah, the burn is perfect! did i mention that? it just LIGHTS UP, and then crackles with the pull through a pipe, and then goes out slow enough to pass along, but fast enough not to waste any plant matter...wonderful"
