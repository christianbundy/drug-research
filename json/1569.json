 "report": [
  "The night started out young. I was bored and home alone from 8pm till about 3:30am. What else was there to do? I had some untaken extra-strength Nodoz laying around in my room, so I thought 'ah, I might as well as finish this bottle out'. Big mistake.",
  "(8:15 pm)",
  "I take 5 extra strength pills (200mg/pill) in all of about 15 seconds. downed them all with a glass of water thinking 'this will be fun, I'll feel all energetic!' wrong.",
  "Sure, at first I started out all hyper and enthusiastic, but it didnt last long.",
  "(10:00 pm)",
  "By now, I'm all out sweating, trying desperately to catch my breath, my heart is pounding out of my chest, I could have sworn I was going to pass out at any moment and die. I could do nothing but pace my house, even though the walls seemed to sway from side to side while I attempted to walk back to the toilet for the maybe 15th time in 30 minutes.",
  "(12:00 AM)",
  "Just when I think that nothing could get any worse, The caffeine seems to jump to a higher level. Keep in mind that although 1000mg's isn't a fatal overdose, I'm a very VERY small person to have taken all of that in one swallow. So by now I can't walk around my house because things are getting too intense for me. The only thing I can remember thinking is 'I will never touch caffeine again.'",
  "(2:00 AM)",
  "I somehow manage to get to the phone in my kitchen and dial the operator to connect me to poison control. I get a hold of them and to my surprise they tell me that 'I'll be fine, my amount taken was not an overdose that needed Medical attention.' They told me I just needed to fair through it till it passed. Around 3:00 am I either passed out of fell asleep in my room.",
  "Right now its 9:45 AM, and I woke up still feeling like shit, my stomach is killing me, I can't believe this. I will never touch Caffeine again in my life."
