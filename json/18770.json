 "report": [
  "I am an 18 year old freshman attending a community college. I didn't start using drugs until a New Years party on December 31st 2010, so I have just over a years experience with drug use. Although I've only been using a year, I have explored a fair amount of substances and am familiar and fairly experienced with the effects of THC/Cannabis, Hydrocodone, MDMA, MDA, (Meth)amphetamine in the form of adulterants in ecstasy, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-C, 2C-E, 2C-I, Ketamine, Methoxetamine (MXE), and JWH-250. I also have had some experience with Salvia, Piperazine, 4-FA, 6-APB, 2C-P, 2C-T-2, 5-MeO-MiPT, and 25I-NBOMe.",
  "I'd ordered some 4-MEC from a trusted supplier, curious about its effects. I'd never tried a cathinone before that I'd known of. Now that I have, I suspect that a substituted cathinone was an adulterant in a recent ecstasy pill.",
  "1:30",
  "Waiting at the front of my neighborhood before school for the mailman. I'm expecting a priority mail package with my 4-MEC in it and I'd rather get it before school instead of my parents getting it and questioning it. I smoke a bowl while I wait.",
  "2:00",
  "Package finally comes and I weigh out 150mg of the transluscent crystal shards, put them in a gel capsule and swallow. Then drive to school. I know you shouldn't drive under the influence of drugs, but I expected to make it to school (about 35 minutes away) before I started to feel the effects of the drug. I wanted to get a feeling for the drug at this dose, since I'd never tried a cathinone before (besides maybe in some 'ecstasy' pills, but I can only guess that that is what it was) and I wanted to understand what a dose like this would do to someone before I attempted to dose my friends.",
  "2:45",
  "I make it to school and am sorta hungry, not really feeling many effects of the drug yet. I go to the on-campus Subway and get something to eat. Feeling a solid +.",
  "3:00",
  "I meet up with my ex girlfriend/english classmate to sit before my class started at 3:30. I'd promised to give her a sample dose of the 4-MEC earlier in the day. I finish my sandwich while she is asking if I'm feeling my dose yet. She claims that my eyes are slightly dilated and I feel giggly, talkative and happy. Right after I stop stuffing my face with the delicious sandwich, I'm pretty blazed still, I start to feel a lot higher than before. Over the next 15 or so minutes before class starts I feel like I'm getting higher and higher, like I'm starting to roll, but what's different is the tactile sensations (there are less than MDMA). I feel a little jaw tension, now at a nice ++.",
  "3:30",
  "Class starts and I peak in class. I also come down most of the way back to baseline in class. The peak was at about 4, and by the time class ended around 5 I was almost back to baseline. I never reached a +++, but felt incredible and a little distracted all through class.",
  "5:00",
  "I drive north to meet up with some friends on the way home and smoke a bowl in park with them, I leave around 6:15 because it gets dark and cold.",
  "7:00",
  "Got home, ate dinner. I have an appetite and enjoy the food.",
  "8:30",
  "Dropped a gel capsule with about 50mg of very pure MXE in it.",
  "10:00",
  "Not really feeling the MXE yet. I'm used to oral doses having set in by now and I've been eating/sniffing this batch for a while now. Strange.",
  "10:40",
  "Still no notable activity from the MXE. Sniff two lines [of 4-MEC] weighed about 28mg each.",
  "10:48",
  "Starting to feel tingles and a little bit of a rushing sensation in chest.",
  "10:55",
  "Feel really relaxed and happy. Content. Listening to music, it sounds GREAT, music appreciation is very present.",
  "10:57",
  "I feel like the sensation isn't going to progress much more so I get up to go weigh another dose, but when I get to the doorway and am standing I feel a lot more high than at the computer. The feeling continues to get more intense with more euphoria. I decide against dosing again for now.",
  "Wow, I feel fantastic, out of all the RC's I've experimented with, this by far gets me the closest I can to the sensation of 'Rolling'. It's almost like 4-FA but with a more intense body high and more euphoria, very relaxing though.",
  "11:00",
  "Lay back and start stretching, I feel good all over!",
  "I close my eyes and bob my head to the music, I'm really enjoying this so far, getting more and more into the music the more I bob and move around to it, I feel like this would be a great party drug.",
  "11:03",
  "Hook my laptop up to my speakers, WOW! Music sounds way better now! Channeling my high through the music, feel like it's peaked though, decide to do another line.",
  "11:08",
  "Sniff another 30mg in each nostril. Burn is a little more than before, but it's brief. Eyes water for a second, mild burn, then the mild pain fades over the next minute or two.",
  "Occasionally sniff back bits of 4-MEC and taste it, GROSS. Not a great taste, worse tasting than MXE, not as nasty as trypts or phens though.",
  "11:13",
  "Pour a small half glass of 7-Up to get the nasty taste out of my mouth and throat. Getting some jaw clenches, feeling like I'm coming up some more. I feel good, but the high is mild enough to be masked by the distraction of the 4-MEC in my nose.",
  "I'm sure once the easily-ignorable burn goes away, along with the gross drip, I'll be able to relax again and enjoy a step up!",
  "11:15",
  "Jaw is clenching pretty hard. Music sounds good still, no nausea or any negative effects from snorting it so far aside from the very mind burn compared to other drugs and gross tasting drip. So far railing seems like the way to go.",
  "I put on a sweatshirt to enjoy its fuzzy warmth. Starting to feel a lot more relaxed now like after the first line.",
  "11:20",
  "I feel really good. I'm super content just sitting here typing with a smile on my face. Really relaxed and blissful. Decide to troll SoundCloud for some new music. I'm making funny faces to the music, bobbing my head, squinting my eyes and sticking my tongue out to some dirty dubstep, making a fool of myself and having fun with it. At this point I could compare my experience to rolling. Just less so. Less bliss, less empathy and magical MDMA-ness. I've been looking for a legal replacement for MDMA but I don't think anything will ever compare. I feel like this chemical would mix well with molly or a bk-analogue of an MDxx to make a good combo. I take a mental note to try combining this with 4-FA and possibly Butylone or 6-APB in the future.",
  "I feel like I'm still coming up a tiny bit, or at least I've reached the part of my bell-curve high-ness chart where the slope of he line is getting near horizontal. Haven't peaked yet, or have I? I think I'm over-analyzing it. I'm gonna take a break from and enjoy the music and internet!",
  "11:30",
  "Just remembered that I'd eaten some MXE earlier. I can't quite remember how much I weighed out. I know for sure that it was a dose smaller than 60, and higher than 40. Because I remember thinking that I wanted to dose less than a previous time when I ate 75mg in a gel cap, remembering an experience with sniffing 20mg then 40mg more an hours later being great, I think I weighed about 50mg. 40-60mg is a possibility, wishing I had written it down, not being able to recall this memory slightly worries me, but is kinda expected. I'd read online that one expected negative effect was short term memory loss.",
  "11:35",
  "At this point I've peaked off my 2nd nasal dose of 4-MEC, the effects have seemed to stop building and have leveled out. The high isn't as dominant as MDMA but MUCH more dominating than say, 6-APB. A song I haven't heard before comes on in a mix and pretty much blows my mind, eargasm, it feels good to love the music!",
  "There are not many negative effects to speak of. No nasal burning, no uneasyness in the stomach, no nausea. perhaps a small amount of spacyness or short term memory troubele, but I expect that from nearly any drug.",
  "Wow, super relaxed feeling, I just wanna lay back into the couch and close my eyes, drift away with the music. My heard rate is elevated, but not so much that I am concerned.",
  "11:40",
  "I have the desire to re-dose but decide not to dose any more for the remainder of the night. I feel like anything more wont get me very far considering any tolerance I've built. I'll smoke a bowl of OG Kush instead.",
  "Leave to load a bowl, slight disorientation when standing and walking, but I'm high, kinda expected.",
  "11:45",
  "Grind up weed and load bowl, starting to feel a lot more dreamy and less coordinated, I think the MXE is slowly setting in",
  "11:50",
  "Get back from smoking a small personal bowl. This is interesting. I don't think I've ever experienced a feeling like this before. I'm stoned, but also slighty k'd and rolling. I have a good body high and feel great and happy, but am also trippy, numb, and dissociated similar to a low dose of MXE. As far as the effects of the MXE, feels like 15-20mg insufflated but with a clearer head, I feel more awake and 'here' a distinctly different feeling. I'm used to feeling slightly deep in my head on MXE, but this takes that dissociated feeling away, leaving the other effects of the MXE. I feel this, the Awake-MXE feeling mixed with the familiar THC, I'm used to the THC + MXE combo and its feelings, so this feels pretty familiar to me, I'm just missing that part of the MXE high, replaced by this happyness, appreciation of music and body high. I feel kinda heavy though. I feel adventurous, like I'm climbing a new mountain, I can feel this heading in a good direction, and I'm eager to see how it plays out.",
  "12am",
  "The euphoria and the effects of the MXE continue to build, but I'm still lacking the detached feeling of MXE. It's like the 4-MEC is latching my mind to my body, and only allowing the MXE to make me feel like spaghetti without making me feel like I'm dreaming. I feel very awake and in control. Short term memory loss is apparent; I frequently forget what I'm writing and am getting really distracted. Really enjoying myself right now.",
  "I feel like a boss, enjoying the crap out of my EDM music in the middle of the night at home, I feel like I could be raging at a rave right now, instead of on my couch, might as well be there though!",
  "12:05",
  "Start playing some Modern Warfare 3 on Xbox Live.",
  "12:10",
  "Quit because I was feeling more and more k'd. The MXE is taking over, but the effects of the 4-MEC are holding me back to Earth.",
  "12:15",
  "Bring my laptop to bed and lay down to chill out and listen to music before passing out. Put on a mix of Electro House and lay down.",
  "12:25",
  "Getting more and more k'd the effects of the 4-MEC are slowly diminishing, and the MXE is taking over. But in a unique way.",
  "12:30",
  "Effects of the 4-MEC are mostly faded away, I'm really stoned/K'd but still mostly here... strange.",
  "12:45",
  "Getting waves or rushes of euphoria with the music.",
  "Laying down and fell asleep before I could make another entry. Slept well, woke up once in the morning and fell back asleep, woke up again around 1:30pm and got up, irritated that I'd overslept, but feeling no hangover whatsoever and feeling rested.",
  "I probably won't try MXE with 4-MEC again, because I felt like it took away from the 4-MEC experience. I might try sniffing a bump of it, rather than swallowing a capsule.",
  "I was happily surprised with 4-MEC and will be doing further research. :)"
