 "report": [
  "I'm about to travel to a malaria heavy region, so I've been taking Mefloquine. Given its reputation of inducing psychosis and suicidal thoughts, I was a bit hesitant to mix with psychedelics.",
  "I had not had any problems with the Mefloquine, although my dreams have been very visually vivid and more memorable than usual. Given this relatively mild reaction, I decided to give 2C-B a try. I had tried 2C-B once before, but I'm not sure what the dose was. I believe it was quite a bit smaller than this time around.",
  "It was the last night of a small 3 day outdoor trance festival. I was surrounded by familiar and friendly faces, good music, lots of pretty lights, and colorful costumes. I had had a couple of drinks and joints over the course of the day, but I was relatively sober.",
  "I took the 2C-B in two capsules, equal doses, totalling roughly 27mg, separated by just over an hour. I began coming up about the same time I took the second capsule. There were three of us that were tripping 'together,' but we were all at different places: one was mixing MDMA with 2C-B, I was just doing 2C-B, and the third was taking the same dose of 2C-B but about an hour behind my schedule.",
  "The overwhelming feature of this trip was the strength of my visuals, particularly when my eyes were closed. I felt mostly lucid intellectually, but I found myself not wanting to do anything aside from lie on my back and stare at the beautiful images on the insides of my eyelids. Tried to dance for a while, but quickly gave up. People tried to converse with me, but I was not particularly interested. The lasers, stars, clouds, and moon were much more compelling to me than conversation. As I stared at the sky there were multiple points where I had no idea whether I was looking at clouds or just inventing the clouds myself. When I looked at the grass I saw an elaborate Persian rug.",
  "This tendency toward staying still and just looking at things is typical for me when it comes to psychedelics. As I came down I wandered around with my tripmates, until the urge to dance took precedence over my urge to look. I danced for a few hours until my legs were jelly, then laid down near the dance floor for another hour or so before going to bed.",
  "By the time I went to bed I thought I was back to sobriety, but my Closed Eye Visuals continued as I fell asleep.",
  "I would definitely repeat this experience, but I would recommend caution if you're not accustomed to strong visuals.",
  "Also, I would have done well to remember that Smart Trippers Shit First."
