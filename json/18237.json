  "Ok, I found some butorphanol that was prescribed for my sisters puppy. I became curious. I have used opiates in the past. Heroin is my substance of choice. But I recently moved to a new area and can't find anything. I'm making this report because I didn't find any other reports on shooting these pills.",
  "It was easy. I crushed the pill, added 5cc's of lemon juice, 50cc's of water and mixed it well. I used a cotton as a filter and put it in my arm. I felt it immediatly. There was no rush. But I felt a warmth in my stomach. I only had one pill. I would do it again if I had more. It hasn't made me nod but the opiate feel is there."
