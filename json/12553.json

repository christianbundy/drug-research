 "report": "<p>1/25/02 11:31 PM</p><p>I ingest 16 mg of 4-AcO-DET freebase on an empty stomach.  My principal reason is to assay the potency of this sample (it is older and a bit brown), and examine the effects of this material orally.  Both of my prior exposures to it were by smoking, and I found the results rather unpleasant and unrewarding.</p><p>11:46 PM</p><p>I do believe I have some sort of alert.  I feel a bit light headed and warm.</p><p>11:58 PM</p><p>I still cant quite define the changes occurring in me.  There is some minor visual activity and my body feels warm and relaxed.  The most noticeable effect is that I can not seem to get very far on a report of a different material I am working on.  Regardless all feels good so far.</p><p>12:17 AM</p><p>Not much more is happening.  For lack of a better thing to do, I log in to mIRC.  I find myself analyzing what I say type to people more closely.  No other mental effects.  Time for some marijuana.</p><p>12:29 AM</p><p>That kicked it up a notch.  I am defiantly a +1.  It has been at least 4 years since I have tried psilocybin, but from what I remember this seems a bit different.  Much clearer.  I really like it so far.</p><p>12:34 AM</p><p>There are mild trails and strong color enhancement.  A good +1</p><p>12:38 AM</p><p>I notice some mild anxiety that is similar to the anxiety I experience when I smoke the material.  I am starting to wonder if I just dont mix well with 4-AcO-DET.</p><p>12:54 AM</p><p>I no longer seem to be climbing.  I went through a lot of anxiety during the past twenty minutes or so that seemed to have no source or cause.  I listened to some music but really couldnt get into it.  I have a bad feeling I just somehow dont react well to this substance. </p><p>1:04 AM</p><p>Not really much more to comment on since nothing too interesting is happening.  I have a typical afterglow of a mild psychedelic journey.  My body feels good and alive and there is a warm, green tinge to everything.  Time for some tea and another bowl.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Well not much to say about this experience.  I have a bad feeling 4-AcO-DET is just not a substance I have any use for.  The anxiety I experienced during the peak was rather alarming, especially considering how mild the effects really were.  When it was previously smoked, I thought the anxiety was simply related to how quickly the effects were manifested, and I figured taking it orally would feel very different.  In fact, there really was not much of a difference at all between smoking the substance and eating it, other than the fact that I use less in a pipe.  All in all, there were no real rewarding qualities for me other than very pleasurable visual effects.  They were somewhat reminiscent of mild DMT visuals, yet they still had a unique look and feel to them.  One thing I did not mention in my notes was that 4-AcO-DET would make a fabulous substance for erotic enhancement, at least if I could get past the initial anxiety.  Once I got out of the peak, my body felt unbelievably alive and sensitive to sensations.  I also had no difficulty in getting to sleep,  which is usually a problem on other materials.  Perhaps one more try is in order before I write this material off completely.</p>",
