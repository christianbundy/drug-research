 "report": "<p>I write this, about 20 minutes after a terrible end,...</p><p>I got the Kratom on advice from the seller at the local SmartShop.</p><p>I asked for a relaxing tea, I had bought and tried Passionflower tea about 6 weeks earlier, but I just added hot water rather then boiling it, so it was just a very relaxing, but nasty tasting tea.</p><p>He said he didn't have anything really tea like, only brew things.</p><p>But, he said, he had something he uses himself when he needs a nice calm.</p><p>He showed me a 10 gram pack of Kratom, explaining that he takes 5 gram mixed with yoghurt in the evening.</p><p>I already read about Kratom, and knew it had nauseating side-effects, so I asked whether there were any bad or strange side effects, besides the calming down.</p><p>Where he replied there were none.</p><p>I trusted him, thinking 5 grams of a 10 gram, which should be the full dose, is a light dose and probably just relaxing, like the Passion Tea.</p><p>I got time to try it with yoghurt that friday evening.</p><p>But it totally failed, it tasted so bad I couldn't get in more then 3 small spoons of it.</p><p>The next week, now that is.</p><p>I decided to try it with some juice, as described on the website of the store, and other places.</p><p>T+0:00</p><p>I had put the remaining 5 grams in a large glass and filled it up with chocolate milk, at first the powder floated on top.</p><p>But after stirring a lot and waiting, it settled through the chocolate milk and became drinkable.</p><p>It had a bit of a bad taste but not super awful.</p><p>T+0:10</p><p>When I had finished drinking it up, I looked through some music and made a relaxing playlist to chill on.</p><p>T+0:30</p><p>I lay down in bed, my hands were cold from working behind my computer, so I warmed them up.</p><p>After my hands were warm, I relaxed, closed my eyes and felt sleepy, I was relaxed and tired, even without the Kratom.</p><p>All that comes now could as well 've been placebo,... very likely actually.</p><p>T+0:45</p><p>With my eyes closed, I was very able to visualize lots and lots of imaginative things, pictures, moving to the music.</p><p>I usually do this anyways, but it went extra good, seen I was very relaxed.</p><p>T+1:00</p><p>It got boring after a while, opened my eyes, looked at my video arcade cabinet and decided I wanted the music from there, as well as the winamp visuals displaying in the screen.</p><p>I got out of bed, a bit wobbly in my legs, probably placebo, I had this with Passion Flower tea too, but not with mushrooms.</p><p>Started opening the cabinet and working on it.</p><p>T+2:00</p><p>As I was messing with getting stuff installed, I felt a nausea coming up.</p><p>I sat down and I started moving my leg neurotically, it made the nauseous feel go away, but it didn't make me feel any better.</p><p>My mood wasn't really relaxed, my hands were shaking and I knew it was going kind of wrong.</p><p>Was just a matter of waiting till it went away, then go to bed or write this experience thing.</p><p>T+2:30</p><p>I was chatting with a friend in canada on msn, told him about the kratom and that I felt like shit.</p><p>I paused my typing and I knew I was gonna throw up, I looked around my room, to decide where to leave my stomach fillings.</p><p>The floor was the best place, my garbage bin was full, and I had linoleum, or well, easily cleanable floor covering, so no real problem.</p><p>I bended forward from my chair and waited till I actually had to puke, avoiding unnecessary moaning sounds.</p><p>After 3 throws I was done, I didn't feel nauseous anymore.</p><p>Cleaned up, and talked to the guy on msn again.</p><p>Floor is still smelly.</p><p>God this sucked, I didn't get any relaxier then the badly prepared Passion Flower tea, it tasted far worse, and I had to throw up.</p><p>Not for a retry!</p><p>It could've been miscellaneous things that contributed to the nausea, but it's mainly the kratom.</p><p>Because I barely throw up,... even if I'm VERY sick, nauseous, dizzy from a boat ride, or bustour that's taking ages, I just have a nasty feeling in my belly, and sit that out for as long as it takes.</p>",
