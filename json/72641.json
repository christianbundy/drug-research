 "report": "<p>Lately, I've been making a rather bad habit of staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning. I couldn't wake up early enough that I could make it through the day without passing out late afternoon. Waking up again around 11, and then staying up until early morning could not go on.</p><p>Went to the drug store, got the melatonin, tried it. Worked like a charm. Within a few days, I'd be in bed by about 12-1am and be up at about 8 or 9.</p><p>However, once sleeping pattern is re-organized, I should have discontinued use. I feel like a can't concentrate at all during the daytime. Dark circles under my eyes, just completely out of it.</p>"
