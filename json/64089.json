 "report": "<p>Little sally-D sits at the right of DMT 100 times old LSD </p><p>This is my 3rd experience report, and for me quite a surprise as I thought Id said and seen all there is to in the ways of Salvia reading back on my Hellraiser Leaf(57297) and My Sitter was a Rope(60167)Ohwhat humility we are shown in the face of our supposed comprehension with what is safe and familiar. I am writing this quickly, not having slept at all since yesterday. If nothing else, I am writing this for myself, for I fear that if  I wait until tomorrow, from past, regretful experience over half of it will not even be a memory, and this was one journey I never want to forget.\rBackground and Quick Summary:</p><p>I have two Masters Degrees and am a (fully Ordained) Rinzai Zen Buddhist, with over 20 years experience in various forms of Eastern and Vipassana meditation. Previous to Salvia, in my youth Ive had more than my share of LSD and Shrooms, and not enough of my share of DMT...</p><p>For almost the past year (seems like 10) I have had extensive, exclusive experience with every form and strength of Salvia divinorum, Tincture being my favorite. Apart from that for the last 2 months I have been a member and daily contributor to a very popular on-line salvia discussion forum. Through this forums continued raves, and at the behest of a good friend as to the special power of one particular brand of Salvia (25x strength), I decided to give it a go, it being so Amazing.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact I have already stockpiled over 27 grams of 5 and 10x, almost 15 ounces left of Hawaiian/Oaxacan/Bali leaf and 4 bottles of tincture (Do I really need more...he says I gotta try this so...) As you can all surmise, I am a true believer in piling up for the coming Schedulization.  \rMy Somewhat Unique Set and Setting:</p><p>Crazy as it all sounds, my ideal spot for partaking of smoked Salvia is in a secluded stretch of woods off a major Boston interstate. I am  believe it or not  only 15 yards from a connector road busy with runners and early morning traffic mergings. Behind and below me (past the chain-link fence I use to tie myself securely to) at a drop of about 50 yards lies the always deafening expressway - So noisy, in fact, that the fear of being heard by anyone if things turned sour never, ever crossed my mind as a matter of major concern.</p><p>Since my last post (My Sitter was a Rope) I have continued to tie myself up in this manner so as to keep my apprehensions at bay that I might black out and wander in and about traffic or bump into runners, early morning dog walkers and the like in the event of a major trip mishap. This has never happened, and at the end of every experience  amnesia or not  I had always been somewhat embarrassed and castigating toward myself. Nevertheless I am deathly afraid of losing control and walking around, breaking things and causing generalized mayhem with smoked Salvia, And hence I never smoke in my house (always, always populated with no peace whatsoever) and find myself confined to the woods (confined yes, that is the proper wording).</p><p>(You must be the only idiot who ever even thought to do this... no wonder Lady Salvia hasnt punished you demonstrating this continued, fearful disrespect- shes probably still laughing too hard at this entire dim-wit display).\rExpectant, but Somewhat Weary:</p><p>The day had arrived  yesterday  It was 95o in Boston already at 9:00 in the morning as I exited my car towards the woodland exit with my trusty SallyPack backpack: Deep Woods OFF mosquito spray, ice-twist bong, wind-proof torch lighter, a Gatorade bottle of (rapidly melting) ice slivers, wax earplugs (more about these later!), and last but never least the exact same yellow plastic rope Id first used in my mothers basement experience. It now had more than sentimental value, and whenever I had to cut it, rather than buy a new one I would just mend it with re-knots. (If there is ever a Salvia Museum, trust me, I will see that this item be framed and mounted in a glass case.)</p><p>There I was, entering the woods looking like any hiker stopping to take a discreet piss. 2 minutes later I am un-comfortably sitting against the chained fence, loosely but securely fastened with almost 20 rotations of rope around my midsection. I take out a large pinch of Bali plain leaf and burned it on a stack of 5 polished stones I had put together when I started coming here in early March  a personal offering to the spirit of the plant that I truly believe resides within its leaves, and whose power I now more than respect. (I have never smoked Bali Salvia  preferring to reserve its use solely as a respectful offering).</p><p>And I return...again and ever again, reverence and unadulterated awe far surpassing my ever-present apprehensions.</p><p>I am wearing a long-sleeved denim shirt (!?) so I dont get totally and unwearyingly eaten alive by mosquitoes. The downside? It is a fucking oven in here! Some bozo on **** was telling me how my core temperature during salvia was actually a degree or 2 colder which makes the external body think it needs to sweat and is hotter. This as there was a study done (who thinks of these studies!?) using rectal thermometers.</p><p>Well, baring the fact that there was no thermometer up my ass it is so fucking hot now Im sure to lose 15 lbs. or more of water weight by the time and if I ever reach it back to my car at all!</p><p>So there I was  pouring. My hands dripping so bad I was afraid Id wet the extract and it wouldnt burn properly. I shoved the wax disks into my ears having lots of trouble this time doing so. Did not want to stay in my left ear for some reason (popped out 3 times before finally getting it adjusted - or so I thought). I didnt want to spend a lot of time with what I mistakenly believed was a small detail as I would then grow increasingly anxious and make up some lame-ass excuse to once again leave and go home ever-the-Coward)</p><p>I adjust my bandanna, preferring (i.e., scared of) C.E.V. over O.E.Vs. ready to place it quickly over my eyes as soon as I hit the pipe and put it safely down to my left. I hunch forward, shifting into only a half-lotus position as I am constricted wearing jeans and need to stay as comfortable as possible  aside from the fact I am now melting into sludge.</p><p>I take out the last of a dropper of tincture and place just one drop under my tongue, more to mellow towards The LadyS rather than initiate any effect  for this is solely to (quote) discover the amazing power of the 25x incense.The tinctures burning doesnt even bother me at all anymore, I am so used to it  using it almost 5 days a week during morning meditational sits (I am the Tincture Master, yes I am..).</p><p>I wait for the familiar and now friendly humming and mild buzz, must have been 2 minutes when I reach over for the pre-packed bong.</p><p>(When I was preparing this at home... I took just 1 pinch.. I was told one pinch and put it ever so carefully on top of an 1/8 salvia leaf screen. Looked down at it...Man...theres nothing even there! so not wanting to waste a whole trip risking my life in this fucking heat I picked up one more good (but very tiny, believe me, my friends!) pinch of the extract using just a tweezers head and added it in). I looked down at the little 10 gram baggie: I was told There are about 350-500 trips in here... That is so unbelievable. That is, if you Dont Know Sally!\rAnd Why Arent You in School?:</p><p>Once last deep breath. I laugh out loud, not due to the tincture but I always picture the face of some poor vagrant stumbling across this whole image I momentarily present.</p><p>Or, God forbid some cop (Oh! Officer! This is very easy to explain).</p><p>One. Big. Lungfull.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Ohhh. Waiting</p><p>Errr. Nothing. I mean nothing at all.</p><p>Nada.</p><p>Waiting.  Boy I feel bad. Going to have to break this bad news to my buddy that</p><p>Ill take one more toke although Im sure I cleared it all but the bong is nowhere.</p><p>There is distinct crackling of branches ahead. Shit Im bagged. Finally bagged. Whowho other than me would think of coming in here! There isnt even a place to stop your car near here and with a police post stating No Stopping!</p><p>Hi Dad.</p><p>Its my youngest son, Chris. Hes walking toward me with this large thing under his arm and he seems ok. Hes 16, and already 61 tall but right now hes no bigger than maybe 3 feet and looks about 8 years old again but thats ok, I love him so much.</p><p>Dad?</p><p>Chris, hey son, whats going on! (what is he thinking, seeing me like this I gotta hide that bong where the fuck did it GO!)</p><p>Hey why arent you in school? Oh!...Vacation? Wheres you mother and brother.. Everything is getting spinney and I suddenly feel nauseous and Im getting scared for some reason I cant pinpoint aside from the fact hes gonna see that where-the-hell-did-it bong and think his Dear Old Dad is a closet drug addict..!</p><p>Dad dont yell</p><p>Im not yelling son, just really surpr glad youre hereSHIT!...</p><p>He holds up this big covering to me hed walked in with.</p><p>Ma said its ok if you say we can he starts to cry, at first softly</p><p>What?!  Im not yelling at you Chris. Whatwait I gotta thinkI cant seem to think God I cant take this heat, its blurring my vision I am in hell burning up in here!</p><p>Can I keep him? he pulls off this covering and its a black box, but translucent and I can see right through it and into Chriss shirt. There looks like a black bird or Raven lying there I cant tell if its alive it just lays there, not breathing and it sends chills down my spine to look at it.</p><p>Its so damned hot in here! Poor kid must be roasting that fucking bird looks evil Stop Crying!!! Everything is now spinning I want to just sit down I AM sitting I need to throwup.</p><p>Chris now starts to cry so loud he is screaming, and next hell have the cops in here!</p><p>(Secluded spot /tied up adult / small panicked preteen child/ drugs involved)</p><p> Man I can just see the police report as they cart my ass away forever and forever)</p><p>You said! She said you said!!</p><p>What?!? Chris! Damnit gimme a minute I gotta think what Chris stop! That bird your mother Jesus Buddha Anyone Help Me I dont feel good. I wanna just leave. What am I doing in this place? I start to cry with Chris I am in full white-knuckled panic he wants that fucking bird to come HOME with us (!?) but we</p><p>You said you said I dont love you anymore dad you promise!</p><p>Oh please. Please. I cover my face with my hands, pressing so hard my eyes feel like they are going into my brain and my fingers are all sticky, now melting to my cheek</p><p>Gotta get Chris home. Ill never do what again? What am I doing here!? Where is this place?\rHow Did It Get So Crowded in Here?:</p><p>Allll aboaaaarrddddd!!!</p><p>All aboard? I aint fucking looking up.</p><p>But this wish is hopeless as there has now gotta be hundreds of people suddenly all around us. I can hear millions of excited voices all seeming to come at once into the left side of my head. There must be some parade of people gathered to witness this crying kid and stare at his asshole father who wont let him take his sweet dead fucking devil-bird home</p><p>I know theyre there, my palms pressing tighter and tighter against my face. I want to curl up into a defensive fetal ball maybe they will go away but for some reason I cant move Please just go away There must be a myriad of a zillion people screaming and laughing in my left ear.</p><p>(Salvia Alert! : The earplug had fell out . Expressway traffic = World Order)</p><p>All aboard!!!  Last call and its you!  You there yes you!</p><p>I looked up.</p><p>Directly next to me, its massive rusted wheels shooting hot engine steam into my face is the most gargantuan locomotive I could ever have imagined.  How it got into this nice little green treed spot I cant imagine. Im trying to remember how I got here and Where Is Here but then remember Chris and Chris is nowhere to be found. He is gone (and so is that fucking bird).</p><p>All aboard! Last call.we cant wait all day!!</p><p>Hey! Where is my son! Did you see him?... Little kid with a package under his arm.</p><p>I look at him  this engineer  and why I know this in advance I dont know but he is: The Tabbyman.</p><p>Wheres my son!! What did you do with my son!!</p><p>Ho ho ho I am the Tabbyman yes I amand I can! I can!!</p><p>He towers even over the locomotive, leaning forward and down to give me a closer look. He has an alligators face, but his mouth is pushed in and he has no teeth. He would be petrifying if it wasnt for the utterly ridiculous white and red French beret on his head.</p><p>Wheres Chris! Is he on this.</p><p>I look at the train. It stretches on forever, past the tree line beyond that fence and onto eternity. In every window there are faceless people frantically waiving at me to quickly board (or stay away?). There all start banging on their windows and the windows start to bow outward., bending like stretched plastic. Some of the passengers are pressing their faces to the windows and blowing kisses at me through the glass with rubber faces.</p><p>Hey!! Behave back there!!!</p><p>The Tabbymans neck stretches out, turns and stretches back for miles disappears as he looks consecutively in each and every window until all the passengers are silenced.</p><p>When his head returns, he looks at me nose-to-nose, but speaks to his minions aboard:</p><p>You are a terrible father!</p><p>I can only stare. And then things are Salvia</p><p>A terrible father and you cant come with us!!</p><p>He puffs up his chest and laughs the most obscene, screeching laughter I have ever heard,. His voice resonated with a painful, high-pitched timbre. My left ear cannot take the whirlwind: as now all the passengers follow suite in one sudden screech of approval. It is as if every God/Devil/Person/Animal who had ever vocalized every sound through every millennium that ever existed was doing it all at once and siphoning it into my left ear.</p><p>Terrible father terrible father!</p><p>I look up and all the vacant flesh-faces are waiving and laughing And then there is my son Chris.  Hes in two places at once and thats the first time I stop and said: My thats bizarre. He is in a window all alone waving at me and still crying. But the Other Chris is holding hands with Mr. Engineer/ Tabbyman/ Crocodile face and hes also waiving but waiving that damned caged bird at me bouncing it up and down with brat-like defiance and now even the bird is alive and up and cawing And Chris screaming, Were going home now dad! The Tabbyman can the Tabbyman can the Tabbyman said we can we can we can!!!</p><p>The Tabbyman has started the train and as it pulls away gives me a final look back.</p><p>They wont wait for you forever you know! He bellows and waved.</p><p>Fuck this and fuck you! I start laughing hysterically. Salvia! I suddenly realize I am on Salvia! That was soooooo fucked! I have never! never! I cant take it I am laughing so hard I dont even mind that I am swimming  swimming in sweat</p><p>I must have untied myself unknowingly as I started to walk circles around my spot. My head still reeling and the locomotive passing on in the distance. They are off on their journey and I can still almost imagine I see the caboose pull away along with Tabbyman,  and all his Jacobs Ladder passengers and my son (and that cursed bird).</p><p>I cannot wait to tell my friend(s) online about this. Cause now that its finally over\rIts Never Over till The Fat Lady Sings:</p><p>Cause now that its finally over</p><p>I walked directly out from the tree line, not bothering about my backpack and just happy to be with myself. I stop. Need to go back, collect my shit and clean up like the responsible person I always prided myself on being.</p><p>Man is it dark! Must be close to midnight its so friggin black out! I have never surged for so long before and I got out here no later than, what? .. .9:00am!</p><p>I start to hurry downhill, toward my car as now Im starting to panic. I can come back tomorrow at 5:00 before work as now my wife and kids are probably climbing the walls with worry wondering where I have been all day and me with no cell. Damn!</p><p>Im half running half sprinting, trying to catch my breath and I gotta stop. Lean over. Splitting headache but thats happened before... when I rise it hits me:</p><p>What is wrong.</p><p>Not that its just dark out.</p><p>Theres Nothing out! No cars, sounds of traffic, no the trees. The trees are dead still. I mean still like they were plastic toys stuck in the ground. And I can barely see a yards distance in front of me. More so than this, I cant see the end of the street and by now I should be at a crosswalk, at a cul-de-sac of houses.. at my car!</p><p>Im starting to freak. Salvia never crossing my mind once as The Train Journey is long since past. I feel like Ive been tossed up and into the Twilight Zone.</p><p>Deep breath! One deep breath and I Yelp my panic making me chock and I start to hyperventilate as a new wave of sweat pours from my forehead into my eyes.</p><p>But then as soon as it started all is Ok!  There, coming toward me are a series of duel lights must be headlights from the backed-up traffic coming off the expressway. I just stand there looking. Waiting.</p><p>The cars come right at me and pass but there are no cars, just a series of perfectly coordinated lights that whoosh right by me with nothing at all trailing from behind. Before I even have time to wonder W.T.F. at this I hear what sounds like two bells ringing far above the top of the roadway. Two distinct tinklings from what I can now see clearly even in this blackness to be 2 bicyclists</p><p>HELLOOOoooooo.</p><p>HELLOOOoooooo.</p><p>A man and woman perfectly in sync, both waving as theyre about to descend.   </p><p>Hey!  hi! Can you tell me  What did I want them to tell me? (Where is my car? Where is anything?..)</p><p>HELLOOOoooo</p><p>HELLOOOoooo</p><p>And damned if I dont stop dead short as both are in period clothing, the woman with a flowered hat and the man in tails and stovetop, he shook trying to balance himself as both are on those old-time Bicycles with one massive wheel in front and what looks like only a training wheel in back.. The man looks like hes about to lose his balance completely, but the woman just looks at me with a huge smile and keeps waving with one hand while dinging her tin bell with the other, her bike seeming to balance itself</p><p>Ive seen this before., but cannot for the life of me place it (or them). </p><p>HELLOOOoooo</p><p>They pass. Never looking behind at me but never lowering their waving arms or stopping those weird Hellos.</p><p>All of a sudden sound! Sound has commenced. But I realize it is one sound and one sound only. The sound that I can only describe as being exactly like that of slowly tearing a piece of paper down its middle.</p><p>Over. And over. Now there are no lights/ no 1800s cyclists/ no traffic only this black ink sky with me and this ripping. I stumble, waves of vertigo wash through me and I feel forward for the curb so I can sit as I cant see a damned thing. I sit at the curb, pressing my palms over my ears to stop the cursed ripping and feel the dirt at my feet and I slide my feet back and forth off the curb. I look like some kid squatting to have himself a small tantrum.</p><p>Stop stop stop!</p><p>The curb (how can this be put into English?) now opens. It opens slowly in what looks like trembling waves. The curbstone would quiver and then be still, and then quiver again, each time growing thinner and thinner until parting like a flesh wound growing longer and wider with nothing beneath it but more blackness. And me sitting directly in its path.</p><p>Last call! I can and I can Im the Tabbyman! The voice boomed and came directly up at me from underneath the sutured sidewalk.</p><p>I did what anyone and everyone would doI did not look down. I jumped up: ran! I ran like hell.</p><p>I knew my little 25x-perience was long since over what was happening now was so real all I could rationalize was that it had somehow transposed my brain? Soul? Into a whole other dimension. She had finally decided: Ive had quite enough of this character hes done!</p><p>It made perfectly ridiculous sense to me to run back to where it all started, toward my once-favorite-now-feared spot Why I thought this would provide refuge?</p><p>I charged up the slope of the hill, but the faster I ran the slower I seemed to go. I felt like I was running through molasses. What is fucking wrong with me I used to be an Ultra-Runner and ran faster than this and I wasnt being chased by what(?!) back then!</p><p>HELLOOOoooo</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>HELLOOOooo</p><p>The Period Woman is standing  alone now and bike-less - at the very entrance to my little alcove. Standing tall and gaunt, both her hands are clasped to her chest in an attitude of prayer and she places then both to her lips before pointing into my tree-lined entrance.</p><p>I start to slow down slightly (how could I even go any slower!!) growing not fearful at meeting her face to face but</p><p>I can and I can Im the Tabbyman!</p><p>O.M.F.G.</p><p>HELLOOOoooo. Better hurry! She smiles. Oblivious. Serene. This regal woman has all the time in the world before her, and doesnt even seem to care about the cartooned fiend gaining behind us</p><p>Hurry now thaaaats it It will be fiiiinnnneHurry now</p><p>I can and I can Im</p><p>Not to worry Im coming Damnit!! I dont even stop to let the poor thing through ahead of me I am so petrified and as I burst through the trees there is her friend he too is not only now bike-less but is comfortably sitting in an overstuffed chair, reading a newspaper with his feet up on an ottoman smoking a curved pipe next to his fireplace, with his hat removed he looks grey and very old, exactly like that picture of the Old Fisherman that we have at home... </p><p>Home?  </p><p>Fireplace? Isnt it hot enough already in here but he seems so content</p><p>This.. none of this seems strange to me I just want Mr. Tabbyman gone!</p><p>I run toward my fence, crashing through the low hanging brush to my seat-in-the-dirt. Theres some guy ahead of me at the fence who looks like hes sleeping and hes tied up.</p><p>Move over fella! This was my spot!!</p><p>Shhhhhh Quiet now with barely a whisper Mr. Fireplace takes the pipe from his mouth and waves me down gently,  I am plainly disturbing him making too much racket.</p><p>I crash to the ground and Funny he was just here.. That guy in my seat has vanished and all are now gone.</p><p>All but me and Period Woman.</p><p>Well HELLOOOooo</p><p>Her hands. Her hands caress my face, fingers threading through my long, sweat-drenched hair, slowly moving to the back of my neck before moving up again rubbing across my face...</p><p>There. Safe at last</p><p>And the sky opened. Luminous sunlight the brightness of which is unimagined burst through the trees, the yellows changing to silver and white sheens of shimmering glass that seemed to fractionate over the trees and the trees! Like massive incandescent green fingers that reached up to the heavens with every slight breeze allowing me to bear witness   Theeerrrreeee. You can stay here with meforever.</p><p>Her face is touching mine, although I cant make it out through all the blinding light.</p><p>With surprising strength she tears my shirt completely open and rubs across my chest before again caressing my face and it is the most maternally warm feeling I have ever remembered ever having. I had come home.</p><p>We will always be here</p><p>I cant I cant I am so tired, I just want to sleep I want to but I cant.</p><p>Forever I will take care of you forever</p><p>I family I want to maybe just a little whilesleep</p><p>YesSleep</p><p>Sleep.\rThe Power of Incense:</p><p>Keeping the details of my cleanup short</p><p>What cleanup?</p><p>I woke finally and sat there staring into my lap for at least a good 15 minutes before raising \tmy head and still wondering if this time it was all finally over</p><p>Aside from being a walking swimming pool I am inebriated to the point of just crumbling up and crying in veneration and reverence to The Lady Leaf.</p><p>I have never had a more visually vivid trip on Her compared to this!</p><p>Literally throwing all my shit together I bolt off to my car. Crashing through the clearing of woods and unto the road my pack is half opened, my hair wild and I am covered in grass stains, leaves, and dirt. Cars slow as they pass (Mommy whats THAT!?) If a trooper pulled up he would definitely think of a question or two.</p><p>All I need for completion is a shopping cart and a few plastic garbage bags and I would be welcomed into the Legion of the Homeless with opened arms.</p><p>Spotting my car I start to jog toward it while patting myself down hurriedly, my favorite 90$ Bole sunglasses are gone, as is every button on my now flapped open shirt and I could give less of a shit I am ecstatic!</p><p>I am awash with a Salvia Afterglow the likes of which Ive never had in the past.</p><p>I am weightless, satiated with happiness and floating on Cloud 19!!</p><p>10:40am!</p><p>Finally at home I exit my car and look over at my concrete Garden Buddha:</p><p>All stone and sereneWhy cant I ever be more like him and just calm down. Im gonna just burn myself out one day. Spontaneous Physical Combustion</p><p>Through my basement entrance there is no Chris to be seenhe is usually immovable in front of his Xboxkilling street thugs by the thousands so we can all live safely.</p><p>Chris! Come give your Dad a big hug!!, but hes out. (Probably still on the train with Tabby).</p><p>And for once my house is deserted. A second miracle.</p><p>I went upstairs to the kitchen. It has started the shaking. The nervous excitement that I have to get this one down as I will not sleep till I do.  This numb exhilaration I feel like I just had 5Vicodin all at once. Starting the first of many pots of coffee and before my hands cant stop trembling I go into my safe to take out the baggie for just one more look before I finally sit down.</p><p>Twenty-five x. (Incense. not for consumption)</p><p>10 grams looks so little. I finger the tiny pieces of salvia through the plastic, noticing there is one, single, solitary piece stuck in the folds of the plastic zip-lock.</p><p>There that alone is probably a Level 4</p><p>Amazing!\rPOSTSCRIPT:</p><p>Being a day late sending this, I returned late yesterday afternoon for a proper cleanup and a quick sit-down (*with NO Salvia):</p><p>It dawned on me: This time there was no Take Off/ Gravity Menace With this 25x it was like the immediate action of hitting a light switchjust bang!</p><p>I never did find my damned glasses, and. At first, sitting there, I was unsure if I could ever come back again to this exact spot, that now I might have to search (weeks?) for another It might take hours of meditation beforehand knowing what had previously transpired to just calm down the apprehension and nervous excitement. But then, maybe Ill just do what should always be done: sit right down. Dont think. Dont think prepare quickly! And maybe next time do what Im told and Get On That Train.</p><p>They wont wait for you forever you know!</p><p>Peace and Safe Journeys. May the Goddess bless you All and keep you safe, Now and Forever.</p>",
