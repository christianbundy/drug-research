 "report": "<p>My boyfriend filled up the tip of a copper crack pipe with the orange jelly DMT substance.  Mind you this is the second time that I have smoked DMT, the first time didn't work at all for me.  We figured a large amount was what was needed to get me off.  He sat me down in the corner of the garage on a rocking chair.  Held the crack pipe to my mouth and told me to inhale slow, long, and hold for as long as I could.  I held it and held it and held it.  The world started to melt away. Everything became black, as soon as the full darkness hit color came out of no where. I opened my eyes and was standing next to my boyfriend, watching this girl on the garage floor freak out.  She was throwing up all over herself, ripping her rings off her fingers, screaming, and pulling out her hair.  It wasn't until I came fully out of the trip that I realized the girl on the floor was me.  Oddly enough the terrifying 4 minute episode left me energized, in a good way.</p>",
