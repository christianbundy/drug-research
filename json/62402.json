 "report": "<p>I had been taking celexa (citalopram) for some weeks and had just adjusted to the side effects as my body became used to it and so decided to try smoking pot as I could find no literature on interactions and little in the way of discouraging reports on the net. I went outside for a joint and before I even got back into the house I felt highly anxious and panic ensued. I called my best friend and asked him to come round as I was now experiencing physical symptoms including high heart rate, dilated pupils, dizziness, nausea, confusion and hot flushes down my arms. It was an hour or so before I could stand up and walk and my friend tells me I was in a real state to which I can also testify. It was a highly un-plesant experiance that took me some days to recover from.</p>",
