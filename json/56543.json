 "report": "<p>One fine night I took 20 mg of this substance and went to sleep.  I awoke at 7 am and went to work.  After work, when I got into the car, I found a red bull that I had purchased that morning at a gas station & a receipt with the time, 5 am.  I've no recollection of it.</p><p>Worst of all, when I went to check on the rest of the medication (10 other pills), they were gone, and I'm assumming, consumed.  I'll never take these again, and I've tried a lot of things!  Watch out!</p>",
