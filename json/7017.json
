 "report": "<p>\nI have been working in Ethiopia since 1994 and using Chat (also called Catha edulis, Khat, or Qat) every time I go.  It is a bastion of the culture there, and the intermittent anti-chat campaigns never gain too much steam.  80% of the population there uses it regularly and 40% or so do it daily.</p><p>Rather than go into the incredible fabric of ritual that surrounds the drug, which is really interesting in its own right, I will just describe its procurement and effects.</p><p>You can buy Chat on almosy every block of the capital, Addis Ababa.  It comes in 1-2 foot long, 4 inch diameter bundles of branches and leaves.  A one dose bundle costs about $1.00.  To use, one begins eating the leaves.  Because the leaves are tougher than most salads this requires quite a bit of chewing.  Experienced users keep the green cud of Chat in their mouth for some time before swallowing, presumably for the sublingual uptake route.</p><p>The definite stimulant effect occurs within 30 minutes, peaks in an hour and a half, and lasts about 4-5 hours.  Chewing for an hour produces, if you will pardon the oxymoron, a kind of scattered focus.  Concentration is acute, but holding together complex concepts difficult.  Conversation is augmented, but sometimes over-zealous.  Hangovers from Chat are depressing and really suck.</p><p>Chewing all night will produce an altered consciousness that can be likened to a mild, speed-derived hallucinogen.  No open eye visuals, but some closed eye ones after serious overindulgence.  Frequently, phantom movement will be detected out of the corner of your eye.</p><p>Small doses are good for working, large ones mess up your focus too much.</p><p>I think Chat is a fun, and relatively safe drug for the visiting traveller.  However, Chat does have some addiction potential if it is easily available, Ethiopia a case in point.  Nearly all addicts in Ethiopia are functional, but they gotta have their chat every day.</p>",
