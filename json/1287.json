  "Simple way to get off on kava: Take 15 pills of 110mg kava extract standardized to 55% kavalactones so that each pill is 60mg kavalactones OR 15 pills of 200mg extract standardized to 30% kavalactones so each pill is 60mg kavalactones.  Just be sure it all adds up to about 900mg kavalactones.",
  "In 30 minutes or less, you should feel something sort of like an alcohol buzz but more in the direction of codeine.  I find a hit or two of MJ works well with Kava too.  Alcohol, valerian and St. johns wort tend to make me fall asleep, but a good 10mg of melatonin gives it a sedated trippy feel."
