 "report": "<p>I like many others enjoy getting fucked up every now and then. And opiates are a sure fire way to do that. I am a newbie to the whole scene and have never done any hard drugs like heroin or Morphine IV or Oxycontin. I have smoked opium only once. My normal drug of choice is to crush up a 4 or 5 vicodin and snort them. That gets me pretty good feeling (excluding the constant itching). But as we all know, sometimes pills are hard to get hold of and we find ourselves trying new things. This was the case with me and Meprozine.</p><p>Meprozine is a branded pain killer that contains 50mg of Meperidine and 25mg of Promethazine. To keep this short and simple. The very first time I snorted the stuff my nose bled for a solid hour. I thought it was just a fluke and did the same thing again the next night. Now it has been over 2 weeks and I am still having nose bleeds. My sinuses are entirely fucked up.</p>",
