 "report": "<p>At age 16, I was prescribed Ritalin 20mg tablets, for an ADD condition and behavior. I have a long past of drug use, my doctor knew this, and felt it was self-meditation using amphetamines to concentrate, I was aware I can become addicted to this drug, if I misuse it.</p><p>Well I was the stupid one, as of this moment, 8:31am, I am under the influence of ritalin, as hearing I could snort this drug, I tried it, I woke up at 8am, crushed the tablet with a lighter, ground it down very powdery, took a dollar bill, took in the two big lines I got out of the pill. As I sat there, my nose began to burn, eyes started to water, felt a warm intense shock all in my chest and stomach, a quick 4second anxiety feeling, I knew to myself, Im hooked this stuff is great!</p><p>At about 8:05, I went downstairs onto my computer, turned some Rap music on, music was greater, I liked music more, I began to doze off into space (kind of like marijuana) but with stimulating effects as extreme happiness, like nothing bothered me, and it was all good, I loved talking to my friends online, I felt a connection with them, I almost told my teacher I liked her. This great buzz Im having, is almost identical to Cocaine, just a lighter buzz. I thought it as, wow I got my own cheap coke legally, Right now Im still buzzing, listening to music, enjoying it a lot, I am looking forward to doing this again.  As my buzz is decreasing, I feel irritable, a little anxiety, and a craving to snort some more lines.</p>",
