 "report": "<p>This experience was undertaken because I have fairly bad insomnia from time to time, and was out of Kava-Kava capsules, which normally put me out fairly fast and allow nice, normal sleep.  I was unable to sleep one night, and remembered that my roommate had a prescription for Haldol that he didn't take anymore, and had said I could have one if I ever had problems sleeping, so, down the hatch. </p><p>I was more or less expecting to be knocked out and asleep in 15 minutes or so, as he had warned me that I would not be able to stay awake on it.  This wasn't true at all.  I was awake for the next 2 hours maybe, still trying to sleep, but with a strange feeling of rubbery skin, and some pleasant muscle relaxation.  Mentally I seemed fairly unaffected by it.  When I finally did fall asleep, I slept for about my normal duration and with my usual lack of  remembered dreams, and woke up feeling perfectly normal the next day.  Odd for a drug that has a half life somewhere around 72 hours.  I can't really see how this would have sedated me if I took it in the middle of the day at all.</p>",
