 "report": [
  "I recently came across 4 pills of percocet from a neighbor.  Before I took the pills I got online and researched enough about to feel safe taking it.  I decided to take them during the first night of my five-day break from school.  I was in my room, which is my favorite place to be.  I designed my room solely for tripping purposes; I set up a nice 9 speaker sound system and had lights that pulsated to music on the wall.  On another wall I hang trippy art and drawings.  Outside my room is our basement with a pool table, air hockey, and pinball.  I was set for the night.  I had a hard time finding info on the proper dose.  I talked to a few users and they told me 15-20 is enough for a slightly dreamy high, 30-40mg is enough to get pretty high.  I dont want to call it tripping, because it is far from actual hallucinations, and I dont want to refer to it as getting fucked up, it is also far from that.  ",
  "9:34: one 7.5/325-percocet pill ingested, I will take one every 10-20 minutes. I plan on dosing 30mg of oxycodone.  This will be my first experience with oxy.  My previous experience with opiates has been from vicodin.",
  "9:46: 12 minutes later I ingested 1 more pill.  Total dosage up to 15mg now.",
  "9:58: One more pill taken, totals dose at 22.5mg now.  No effects yet except a slight feeling that something is different and something is about to happen.  Feeling kind of edgy.",
  "10:01: Last pill is ingested.  Total dose not at 30mg, if Im not mistaken, should nod me off for a good amount of time.  Only one thing left to do, wait.",
  "10:03:  A definite feeling of altered reality is felt.  The effects cannot be described, almost locked into a dreamy state. ",
  "10:08:  Reality is taking on a whole new dreamy state.  I fear I dosed too much for my first time.  The drug is supposed to take 30 minutes to kick in and I am already feeling pretty dreamy.  If each one takes 30 minutes to kick in, I am only feeling the dose of 2 pills.  15mg still left to take effect.  I am no longer worried but rather anxious to feel the effects of this wonderful opined. Just lit some opium incense, goes perfectly with tonights drug of choice.",
  "10:16 A little nausea but nothing to worry about",
  "10:30:  All I can say is wow.  Pretty intense high with a pleasant feeling of happiness.  Still building every second.  Nausea is a little worse but it's pretty much leveled off so I am feeling great.",
  "10:40:  It's hitting me pretty hard now.  The high is almost impossible to explain.  I was expecting more of euphoria feeling, but Im not complaining.  Best high Ive had in a while.  All feelings of nausea have vanished.",
  "10:49:  I thought the high has peaked, I thought wrong.  Kicking stronger than ever, and Id have to say this is one of my most pleasant experiences with drugs.  Nice feeling of all around happiness. ",
  "11:10:  Ive entered into a state of lucid dreaming.  The effects are lovely.  At this point I now smoked a bowl of high-grade weed and the effects of both drugs combined is producing a very intense beautiful trip.",
  "11:22:  My perception of time is getting all out of order.  What I think is 2 minutes is actually 12 minutes.  I black out and cant remember anything from the last 10 minutes.  The marijuana added an incredible kick to the oxycodone. I havent studied this drug much so I dont have an educated view on the dangers of oxycodone.  I did not do enough research to feel comfortable taking the drug.  I only knew what I believed to be a safe dose was beforehand when I took this drug.  ",
  "11:37:  I am starting to feel a little itchy.  Not terribly but enough to bother.  I read that this was one side effect of the drug.  I am surfing the web now and I feel kind of edgy.  I am moving really fast and enjoying these sudden bursts of speed.",
  "12:09:  Incredibly itchy. Not that I mind it that much, it feels good in a way.  This drug gave me a love for the dreamy high of opiates.",
  "1:33:  I stepped outside for a quick cig, I am not one to smoke but I find one every once in a while helps me relax and come down nicely from a high. Things are really intense.  My pupils are the smallest I have ever seen them.  I started to feel extremely sleepy but the cigarette perked me up a bit.",
  "1:40:  Most of the effects of the oxycodone are running out, however, the cannabis is still running strong.  This is a trip report for oxycodone so I am gonna stop here before the marijuana takes over. ",
  "Summary:  I found this to be a very pleasant lucid dreamy type high.  I remained very clear-headed during the journey.  I plan on taking some more percocet in one week or so.  I hope this gives me enough time for my tolerance to return to normal.  That will be my last tripping of percocet for a few months.  I have read to many stories of people getting addicted to opiates."
