 "report": [
  "So I just woke up after a rough night of robotripping.  About an hour and a half after I had taken 24 gel caps (each with 15 mg dxm) I started to notice a general slowing of my sensory response.  I put on some joy division and then a little justice and the steady beat of the music worked perfectly with my high and I could not stop dancing.",
  "As the trip progressed, I started to lose touch with my physical being.  I went upstairs and lay in bed and all of a sudden (this is maybe +2 hours after I had ingested the gelcaps, so it would be +1 for other methods of DXM administration) my scalp started to itch.  This spread across my entire torso and the next twenty minutes were, physically, the most excruciatingly uncomfortable thing I have ever experienced on a drug.  I tried rubbing some benadryl on my shoulders but the itching wouldn't stop.  I finally had to suck it up and ignore the itching, even though it was brutal and unrelenting, as any time I brushed any part of my skin it would flare up in pain.",
  "Other than the itching BS, I had fun but I don't really remember much besides some awesome CEV's and this shitty weird hangover I have right now.  I would NEVER do this again, but I guess I had to get it out of my system."
