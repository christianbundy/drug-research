  "I have practiced Transcendental Meditation for many years. I have varying experiences from deep inner peace to amazing spiritual journeys...",
  "At first when I started meditating it was like entering a dark cave with not much inside. Then after some years of practice my eyes began to adjust to the darkness and then I could start making out objects and seeing around the cave. Sometimes I see dazzling light and moving spiral waves of light that pass through my body into the universe. Other times I become really big - like the size of my room or even the size of my city! Then I also become tiny like a speck of dust. Occasionally I as if travel through the galaxies passing stars and other large cosmic bodies. These glimpses into enlightenment bring unbounded bliss and lasting fulfillment to my life.",
  "In activity outside of meditation I notice improvements with my relationships with people and I have a growing intuitive ability to know what people are thinking or what will happen next in my surroundings. I feel I am growing with efficiency and skill with what ever I do and my grades at school reflect this. I recommend meditation to anyone wanting more peace and happiness in their life. Transcendental Meditation is the most researched form of meditation on the market but there are many different types - I haven't tried any others because I am happy with TM.",
  "Best Wishes!",
