 "report": [
  "I am going to go to the doctor next week to get a higher dose.  I have major depression, bi-polar, anxiety, peri-menopause, and PTSD. I've been on high doses of anti-depressants for many years and different drugs like Xanax, etc.  I started taking Neurontin when my uncle was prescribed it.  It was a miracle.  It didn't make me depressed like Xanax did and it calms my nerves and blocks out all of my bad memories and it works with the Effexor Xr to make me less depressed and it makes me focus and gives me energy some how.  At first it made me tired and a little high, but after I got used to it, it works like a miracle.  I used to smoke pot for years to calm my nerves and it worked great.  This medicine works similar but I'm not really high. It's weird but it works great."
