  "15mg vaporization 4-HO-MPT (freebase)",
  "T 0:00:00 Substance vaporized in glass over steel wool.",
  "T 0:00:05 Initial effects noted, coming strongly",
  "T 0:00:10 Becoming saturated in the material, closing eyes and anticipating what more is to come",
  "T 0:00:20 Feeling a dissolving, breakthrough experience. OEV very apparent and with much movement.",
  "T 0:00:21-0:15:00 Time spent with eyes closed. Immersive fractal CEV fill the space, with an overlying presense of euphoria. A comfortable, lofty headspace occurs for this period in which one is away from reality",
  "T 0:15:01-0:30:00 A declining comedown follows with still some dissociative thoughts",
  "T 0:30:01-1:00:00 A decline towards baseline",
  "T 1:00:01-2:00:00 Slight alertness, reaching a baseline eventually",
  "Summary: Coming on very strong vaporized, such dosage provides breakthrough experiences. Calming and dissociative in its properties, supplying apparent CEV and OEV. It presents a tranquil escape from reality."
