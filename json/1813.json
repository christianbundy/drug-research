  "First my history: Ive done my fair share of drinking, smoking and a little nitrous.  I had my first experience with psychedelics about a week ago with morning glory.  It was an experience I definitely enjoyed. ",
  "After my morning glory experience, I thirsted for more of this new found world of psychedelics.  Two nights ago I was bored and decided to try nutmeg for lack of more interesting things to do.  Another friend in a different city, well call him M,  decided to do it also and I had a sober friend with me.   At 10:00pm I ingested about 1.5 tbsp of ground nutmeg mixed in some orange juice; it wasnt all that bad tasting.  M ate about 3 tablespoons at the same time. ",
  "I then decided to settle down, watch a movie and await my trip.  I felt nothing the whole rest of the night and neither did M.  I was disappointed, but had read somewhere that you may not feel the effects until the next morning.  So before I went to bed, at about 2am (T+4:00) I ate another big teaspoon of nutmeg.  I then went to sleep feeling completely normal. ",
  "I woke up at about 6:00am (T+8:00) to the world spinning around me.  I felt incredibly dizzy and I had the worst case of cotton mouth imaginable.  Altogether not even a slightly pleasurable experience.  After a bout an hour of struggling to go back to sleep I succeeded.",
  "I woke up at noon (T+14:00) and to my disappointment I still was very dizzy and had the same cotton mouth.  It felt like the stupids I get after I smoke a lot, times 10.  M said he was very disappointed that he felt nothing but some dry mouth.  I thought to myself, I wish I had it that easy.",
  "Eventually after some random naps during the day, I went to sleep for the night and woke up today completely normal.  Today I have felt very happy and content, almost euphoric, and I have found unusual amounts of concentration, focus and patience when doing school work.  I dont know if this is a coincidence, an affect of the nutmeg or just out of comparison with the day befores stupidity and miserableness."
