  "Tonight my brother and I went out and purchased an 8-ball and I'm not talking about billiards. This was our first time using cocaine (which from hence forth shall be referred to as the overrated shit), and without doubt will be our last. Let me preface this by saying that the stuff we got was quality which it should be for spending $160. A friend with copious drug experience felt that it was some of the best stuff he had ever had.",
  "Besides making my face numb that overrated shit does nothing but jack up my heart rate and leave me feeling hyper and restless. Do some users believe that cocaine is euphoric? Do some users also believe in the Tooth Fairy? Then again, considering how numb my teeth got it wouldn't surprise me if that shit flew in through my bedroom window and yanked out all my teeth as a punishment for blowing $160 when I make minimum wage shoveling horse shit at the county fair.",
  "It's currently 6:13am and my brother and I are on the internet instead of sleeping. How fucked up is that? In all seriousness, we both found cocaine to be highly overrated and highly over priced."
