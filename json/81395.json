He would completely zone out for about 20mins at a time.  Once, we was found drowned in his hot-tub after taking 5MeO while sitting in it.  He was revived, but it did not slow down his use at all.</p><p>One day, he completely lost his short-term memory.  Just like that.  'Woah!  Reality just shifted!' he said.  Thereafter, every 15mins, he forgot where he was and what he was doing.  He is the Memento Man.  After a few months, he lost his long-term memory too.  Friends became strangers.  It was like Alzheimers.</p><p>This is a warning to all.</p>",
