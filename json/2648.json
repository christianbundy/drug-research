  "<p>So now its thursday night.  Monday night I was up until 5 doing lines of Peruvian Flake, some incredible coke that a coworker of mine came across.  In fact it was the end of two weeks in which I used (that seems like such a rehab word) almost every day.",
  "I have been doing coke or E about 5 to 10 times a month for the last two years, but never really letting it affect my life.  Recently I have found myself doing more and more coke.  I have been doing it at stupid times which is what bothers me, tuesday nights alone in my apartment, or all day on a wednesday to go to the store and run errands.",
  "Well it has been three days and tonight especially I can't stop thinking about it.  Even in writing this, another person who I should call comes to mind.  But I won't, not tonight, its nearly 3.  Luckily most of my urges have been subtly masked by Heineken and cheap Cabernet.",
  "Addiction has never occured to me as a reality.  I am too strong of a person.  Im college educated, young, determined and just like to have a good time.  Whatever.</p>"
