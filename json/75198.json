 "report": "<p>I've tried effexor, wellbutrin, zoloft, and prozac and nardil is hands down the most effective anti-depressent on the market. It is an older drug and a lot of doctors don't like to prescribe it because of certain dietary restrictions. If your suffering from depression and you've tried other meds to no avail then beg, borrow, or steal some nardil.</p>",
