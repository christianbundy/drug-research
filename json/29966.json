 "report": "<p>NOTES ON THE EFFECTS:</p><p>I felt the first alerts within fifteen minutes which was somewhat unexpected.  These consisted of a cold feeling, and slight stomach upset.  Much of the discomfort was intensified by a slight anxiety from not being experienced with this chemical and being unaware of how bad the body load could become.  I began to gain a feeling of uncomfortable energy that lasted throughout the trip but became much more manageable once the trip got underway.  I felt as though I wanted to get up and move around, but at the same time was too lazy to move.  At about an hour the psychedelic effects began and I could say I was tripping.  Over the next two hours was a steady climb, followed by a 2-3 hour plateau.  The comedown was slow and seemed to come in stages.  At one point I announced that I was completely down, and then two minutes later seemed to be back at my peak again.  The body load consisted of muscle and jaw tension, as well as an uncomfortable feeling to my stomach.  Overall the body load was worse than LSD but not nearly as bad as mushrooms. </p><p>The mental state of 2C-T-21 was, in my opinion, odd.  Ive never done a phenethylamine other than MDMA and so can only compare my experience to that of mushrooms and LSD.  The effects are much more comparable to that of LSD, but with a clearer state of mind.  I was able to carry on conversations with people without becoming confused.  Whereas, with acid I would find it difficult to do this while tripping at about the same level.  I thought about trippy thoughts throughout the experience (what am I?  What does it mean to be alive?  What is my body and how is that me? etc.) but it lacked the intense confusion and anxiety that seems to come with my LSD and mushroom trips.  This was both good and bad.  It was nice to have a pleasant time thinking about these things, but because it lacked the urgency I felt that it was devoid of any real insight.  2C-T-21 opened me up emotionally much more than either LSD or mushrooms seem to.  I was on the verge of tears at some points because of incredible feelings of empathy for other people.  Because of this, I feel that 2C-T-21 could do very well as a therapeutic tool, especially since it allows for deep introspection with a clear mind. </p><p>As far as visuals, they seemed to be on par with a low dose of LSD.  Pleasant to look at, but mild and at times it was almost hard to discern what they were.  They consisted of blobs of floating color unlike the intricate patterning that I experience with LSD.  At one point I looked at the floor and saw intense breathing patterns which seemed much more intense than the effect that I get on LSD.  I believe that I will do this substance again, but probably at 10-11mg next time.  My only concern is that the body load will get worse.</p><p>TRIP REPORT:</p><p>I measured out 8.5mg of 2C-T-21 via the water method, and dosed at approximately 7:10 pm.  I decided to start lower on the dosage scale (PiHKAL recommends 8-12mg) as I have yet to take a phenethylamine (other than MDMA) and did not know how sensitive to the compound I may be.  In retrospect this was a wise decision as I tripped harder than expected.  I estimate that my effects were equal to about 10mg from the very few trip reports that Ive read. </p><p>The first effects began with just a body load in the first fifteen minutes.  For the next couple of hours I felt slight nausea accompanied with an extremely uncomfortable energy.  I was nervous that the body load would increase to full on nausea and other stomach problems, but it never exceeded past this point. </p><p>The trip began for me with the typical trippy thoughts running through my head.  This was a little from the norm for me since I usual notice visual distortions before anything else.  I was listening to Sigur Ros at the time, and the music sounded extremely beautiful.  It was a little too slow for my tastes, so I switched it to The Mars Volta which more suited the speedy feeling that I was experiencing. </p><p>After a couple hours my trip was strongly underway.  I was at my girlfriend's dorm room, and a few unexpected visitors showed up.  I found it very easy to converse with these people and lacked the anxiety that I wouldve experienced under LSD or mushrooms.  They had no idea that I was tripping.  On the plus side, 2C-T-21 made me very talkative, and it helped me to be less quiet and reclusive. </p><p>We began watching True Life: I have an eating disorder on MTV.  It was definitely not the greatest thing for me, but everyone else was enjoying it so my protests went largely unheard.  The music seemed very clear to me, and I was able to discern when different songs began and ended, which I found very impressive since they were meant to only be background noise to the program.  They played Sigur Ros, Portishead, Radiohead, and At the Drive-In and I was very pleased with their choice in music.  I was in a very emotionally opened state while watching this movie, and almost cried at several instances due to extreme feelings of empathy for the individuals.  I found this to be a good thing, since I have been working on feeling less hatred and anger towards other people. </p><p>Later we watched My Cousin Vinny.  Normally I can not watch a movie while on a psychedelic.  I tend to analyze every tiny detail to the point that I lose track of what is going on.  On 2C-T-21 this was not the case.  I found it very easy to follow along with the movie, and the drug added a depth to it.  I felt that I saw all the subtleties in the humor that I would have otherwise missed.  This clearness of my mind was very nice.  It was great to be able to expand my consciousness a little without having to deal with the intense anxiety and confusion that usual come with the territory. </p><p>I had a very pleasant evening overall, and people noted how I smiled and seemed to enjoy things much more than usual.  The aspects of this drug are very conducive for social situations.  Its ability to open someone up emotionally while still leaving them with a clear mindset also leads me to believe that this drug would be good in therapeutic situations. </p><p>The comedown was nice and gentle, and I was asleep within eight hours of ingesting.  I would definitely enjoy this substance again, but I think its real beauty will be found at higher dosages.  Next time I would probably take 10 or 11mg and see how that feels.  At this dose it was a nice solid ++ that at times seemed to voyage into +++ territory.</p>",
