 "report": [
  "I went to a hardware store in search of a plant that was psychedelic. Searching I came upon coleus blumei and purchased the plant.  Eagerly I cut off a stem and dried the leaves partially on a heater and packed a bowl in my pipe when the leaves were dry enough to smoke.  About 5 minutes after I took the first hit I could feel some effects.  I felt very euphoric and good about my self.  Fifteen minutes later it felt like a mild mushroom trip.  I sit here now watching my wall shake and feel like I'm spining in circles in my chair.  This experience is overall great and I will definitely try it again."
