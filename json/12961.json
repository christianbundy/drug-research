  "<p>Ive been taking melatonin for the past three nights to help my sleep. I normally travel a lot, and it has often helped my jet-lag, but ive noticed that when i take it i have extremely intense dreams. The past three days have been no exception. I take it 20 minutes before i go to bed, and i normally never remember my dreams. The dreams haven't been good or bad, but only extremely vivid and intense.",
  "I recommend trying it, although I do wake up once in the night but when i fall back to sleep (which is often quickly) thats when the dreams begin. Its pretty amazing, i quite look forward to it!!</p>"
