 "report": "<p>Having read some accounts of nausea on 2-CT-7, I decided to take some on a full stomach.  I ingested 25-30mg in a capsule about 1 1/2 hours after a substantial meal, 10pm.  The full effects did not really come on until about two hours later. I resisted the impulse to boost, and I was glad I didn't once it came on. </p><p>Initially I noticed some onset effects similar to mushrooms or LSD.  This was calmer than either and had a component to it that reminded me of ecstacy.  I would compare this most closely to a candyflip (ecstacy/acid combo), but a friend tells me this sounds a lot like 2CB.  Whatever, however, this is a lovely ride, calm and powerful, with plenty of closed-eye and open-eye visuals, and a strong connection to the here and now.  The trip lasted a solid 8 hours, with a long slow peak and descent.  Speaking of the visuals, I noticed that they had a different aesthetic than other compounds' visuals.  Whereas LSD is strongly kaleidoscopic, with overlaid patterns, and DMT is very pointy and elfin (no better terms come to mind), 2-CT-7 had a strong organic, morphy feel.  I saw (closed-eye) visions of alien living spaces, with silver skinned friendly people hanging out, glad to see me there.  They had impeccable taste.</p><p>I felt great until I fell asleep at 8am or so.  I was tired when I woke up, but not dissipated or stupid.</p><p>Overall, this was a VERY kind drug, and I will try it again.</p>",
