 "report": [
  "I was recently put on probation because of drug use and was looking for something to get me high and that would get out of my system with in a week. I dosed up at 9:30 and felt the effects at about 10:40. 300 mg is a heavy dose but since I consider myself pretty immune to analgesics.",
  "I pop 8 of these things with 37.5 mg each in them, the brand was Ultracet. I obtained these through my friend whose mom works at a Doctor's office and she had stole about 30 samples each containing two pills. She pops a lot of pain killer and is pretty cool about letting her son have some, except he has to be home when he is under the influence.",
  "Anyways when the effects kicked in I feel like I took about 30 mg of Hyrdrocodone. I become very itchy everywhere and my mouth is pretty dry, also my eyes fell like there sinking into my head. it was a pretty nice high. As I watch T.V. I find myself staring at one point on the T.V. instead of the whole T.V. itself. Eventually at the peak anything I tried to focus on would shake back and forth. I feel this when I take DXM so it wasnt really making me dizzy but I could see how it could make others.",
  "All in all the drug is pretty nice and I will be taking more in the future. I took it to see if I could use it as alternative to get high when I feel the need to alter my consciousness."
