 "report": "<p>I am a physician and also have bipolar disorder. I take the following meds: lexapro, oxycarbazepine, buproprion and buspirone. This mix keeps my mood stable, my anxiety under controll and keeps me from tumbling into deep depression and has worked well. </p><p>My psychiatrist gave me some modafanil samples to try because my meds cause sedation- sleepiness while driving, during meetings, ect.</p><p>I first took it at a medical conference (100mg), I also had a cup of coffee. I was awake and alert the entire day.  I also was able to process and analyze information more quickly and effectively. I felt as if I had just gained 10-20 IQ points. </p><p>The only problem is that I also started to feel a bit hypomanic- somewhat euphoric, talkative, ect. While that is quite pleasant for me, it can be difficult to deal with while working with patients. I tried it again without any coffee and the effect was simular but without the hypomania.</p><p>I now take it  for meetings, long trips in the car and if I wake up really groggy. It's a great drug but it has been reported to have some signs of addictive potiential but no cases of this reported yet also.</p>"
