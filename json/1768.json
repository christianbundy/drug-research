  "Well dear friends, I have a solid history using every drug known to man. However, when I decided to look for an opiate to use which doesn't cause an addiction from hell, Buprenex fell into my lap.",
  "I saw all the posts on the net about how Buprenex is used to treat Heroin and other opiate addiction.  In addition, I noticed that it was also a drug of abuse in Europe, especially France, BAM! I had an idea.",
  "After days of searching I finally found a Mexican dude who sold the stuff.  And better yet, it was the injectabe type.  I received my order a few days later.  Needless to say I was very excited.",
  "I shot the stuff into one of the few veins I have left, my leg.  All the other ones are gone due to years of abuse.",
  "I felt a mild tingly feeling, but nothing like the rush of shooting heroin or oxyontin.",
  "Then about 15 minutes later I had the most glorious mild opiate high I had ever experienced.  Not only was that pleasing but I felt all the anxiety and depression of my work and life stresses lifted.",
  "It was like a nice dose of vicodin and xanax all working together.",
  "I didn't feel the powerful nod, or extreme euphoria of heroin or morphine. Instead, this high was honest and pleasent lasting for hours.",
  "The next day I still felt very positive and upbeat.",
  "Buprenex withdrawals are the only opiate withdrawals anyone can tolerate.",
  "The only problem is the stuff is expensive $25 per vial and hard to get.",
  "Keeping it real up in da field arigh, RAHJEN BLACK RECOVERY GURU"
