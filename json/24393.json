 "report": "<p>I recently ordered several bottles of Tranquili-G, much to my disappointment. I started with the suggested dose of 1 teaspoon (1/6 ounce) with absolutely no effect after over an hour. I then took successively larger doses with no effect. At the point I had ingested 2.5 oz (out of a $45, 4-ounce bottle), I finally noticed an effect.</p><p>First off, this stuff tastes worse than gasoline. Eight ounces of juice is barely enough to disguise the flavor of one teaspoon of the stuff. The flavor is much worse than even concentrated GBL. Aside from the flavor, the high is terrible. The feeling is very sedated and sleepy, like taking too many muscle relaxes, and COMPLETELY devoid of any pleasure. This is not even vaguely like GHB, GBL, BDO, or any of the other precursors. I could honestly get a better high by taking Benadryl or holding my breath. After the lethargy wore off, I got very nauseous. I felt like I had been poisoned for about 2 hours after the 'high' wore off.</p><p>Even if you are curious, even if you just want to try it once, dont waste your time.</p>",
