 "bodyweight": "200 lb",
 "report": "<p>Mixture - 3 parts Caffeine powder, 1 part crushed up Zyban (bupropion)</p><p>I've snorted Bupe by itself, but it is kind of a drag and really messes with my nose. I was a habitual cocaine user, but have a real hard time finding it around my new stomping grounds, so I had to find something to help me problem. I have taken quite a liking it this combo and so have a few of my friends.</p><p>Experiences:</p><p>Nothing too dramatic I usually take this to help me stay up late and write. I have a more open imagination and mind on this. I find it real hard to sleep after a night snorting just like with cocaine. When combined with alcohol that problem is usually a little easier to get over. It helps keep me coherent while drinking.</p>",
