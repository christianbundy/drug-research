 "report": [
  "A little background first: I have tried 10mg DOM once before. The effects were very mild. This time around I was looking to have a very powerful experience. That is why the dosages are so high. They are not mistakes. I apparently have a very high tolerance. Times are also approximate. I was not attempting to keep exact track of time.",
  "(T+0:00) Took 20mg 2C-B and 15mg DOM upon getting to the party.",
  "(T+1:00) First effects, body buzz and feeling of energy. There was also strong nausea, I felt somewhat sick but did not vomit.",
  "(T+1:00) Took 15mg DOM. It is easy to get fixated on objects, people and conversations. Nausea is fading. [Erowid Note: 30 mgs of DOM is considered an extremely high dose, see DOM Dose Chart]",
  "(T+2:00) Nausea is gone, definite 'high' feeling but no hallucinations yet. Went out to get a hamburger in a sit-down restaurant. It seemed noisy and colors were pronounced.",
  "(T+3:30) Got back to the party, there was some psy-trance music playing and trip-art all over the walls.",
  "(T+5:00) It was very difficult for me to keep track of time, it seemed much later than it was.",
  "(T+7:00) Mental confusion, I would start walking some place and wonder why I was going there. Couldnt remember reason.",
  "(T+9:00) Sitting in chair listening to psy-trance and looking at trip art, it is very difficult for me to understand a conversation, although I apparently (according to my sitter) still gave reasonable responses to questions. Felt very disjointed.",
  "(T+10:00) Leave party, start to come down, any visuals I had go away.",
  "(T+11:00) Go to sleep, it is restless and I keep waking up.",
  "I woke up in the morning simply feeling slightly tired and a little stoned feeling.",
  "All in all, this was a good experience, however I probably wont repeat it considering the dosages I had to take. I would recommend this drug to people who like mushrooms and/or acid but want to try something different."
