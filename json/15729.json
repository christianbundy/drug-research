  "I have had a few dxm experiencs with DXM prior to this but hadnt really 'tripped'. So I decided I would take 14 triple c's in order to achieve this. I dosed on a sunday and had a great experience. I won't go into details, bcuz it is not the subject. But the next day I found out I was going to have a drug test (the standard one) and was worried because I had read that DXM can sometimes cause false positives for PCP and/or opiates. I have never done any of that, so having to explain why I tested positive for either one of those to my parents would not be an easy task. A few days passed and I got my results, everything was negative, and what a relief that was."
