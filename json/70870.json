 "report": "<p>Around noon today, on a mostly empty stomach, I ingested a capsule containing 100 mg of DiPT.  Effects were slow coming on; at T:45 I started to feel a heavy tryptamine body load, as well as some auditory effects, most notably, tinnitus and the lowering of pitch by one and a half steps. </p><p>At T+1:00 I began to see visual hallucinations (very acid-like) and began sweating profusely.  This began what was a three hour nightmare of nausea, sweating, shaking, and hallucinating.  After this, the body load dramatically decreased, though the auditory effects, as well as mild hallucinations contintued. </p><p>I was hoping to experiment listening to music and experimenting with different sounds, but this chemical left me too weak and ill to do much of that.  I was able, however, to listen to some Pink Floyd and Portishead, which sound waaaaaaaay distorted and crappy. But for the last nine hours I have been laying in my bed and hating my life.  Everytime I get up, I am met with a massive waves of nausea and muscle weakness.  At this point, I just want it all to stop.  I want to hear the sound of my own voice again, not the deep demon voice that I have been hearing for the last 9 hours.  Interesting drug, but I will never try this substance again.  I would rather eat five hits of bad acid than have to endure another trip like this.</p>",
