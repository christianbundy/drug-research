  "Its T + 14:20 and I managed to pull off a less than spectacular trip on 25mg of AMT.  How did I manage to not enjoy myself on a drug whose claim to fame is its guarantee of a good time?  I tried to control it, and it taught me a lesson.",
  "Dont get me wrong; I didnt have a bad trip.  Ive experienced what I would consider the worst kind of trip possible on a 9 gram dose of morning glory.  No, it was more like just a flat-out bad day.  Let me take you through my experience so that you dont make similar mistakes.",
  "Inspired by a few reports I read raving about the benefits of an early morning solo trip, I got it into my head yesterday that I would dose at 6AM this morning.  Its important to note that Ive taken AMT twice before and both times were at this same dosage.  Both of those times I had done it with friends and had an excellent time.",
  "Last night I had a calculus test at 8PM (Im a first year college student).  I was fatigued, and prior to the test I took a caffeine pill.  Im not a regular soda or coffee drinker and that kind of dose was enough to keep me up until 4AM.  Being the stubborn (stupid) kid I am, I decided against putting off the AMT trip until later in the week because I figured the speedy effect of the AMT would counteract my lack of sleep.  I woke up at 6AM, hopped out of bed and drank down the small amount of powder in a glass of OJ. ",
  "30 minutes later I was buzzing pretty hard and my eyes were dilated.  Some people refer to the come-up on AMT as a roll on X, but for me it seems like the onset of X.  I never get to that point of really rolling.",
  "I looked up on the web that the sunrise was at 7:10, and since Im usually not up at that time, I decided to walk  mile or so to my car (it was really cold out and I wanted the heat), which was sitting out in a parking lot.  This would give me a good view of the sunrise and an opportunity to smoke a cigarette, which I love to do on this substance.  At 7:20 I was sitting in my car and I noticed that it was pretty light outside already, but the sun was nowhere to be scene.  A couple seconds later something caught my eye in the rear view mirror.  It was the sun.  I had been looking out to the west and missed the sunrise.  I am truly a dumbass. ",
  "Well, that was depressing.  I listened to some tunes out in the car and noticed that I felt pretty epithetical but depressed.  I also began to feel some nausea at this point.  I got back to my room at around 8 and watched some TV, making sure to keep myself hydrated.  I then listened to some music until around 11, when the visual part of the trip kicked in. ",
  "I had some blurred vision, noticed that the carpet would roll in waves if I watched it long enough and had very very mild though shroom-like closed-eye visuals.  Probably the most fun I had all day was looking out of my window and letting the bright outdoors burn an image onto my eye.  Then, by closing my eyes very tight and then releasing the tension, the color of the afterimage change.  I dont know how to explain it but it was extremely beautiful.  I was also having periods of uncomfortable hot and cold sensations and my teeth felt odd in my mouth like they were extra-sensitive.  I started to feel very, very tired, something that never happens to me on AMT.  I went against every bit of good judgment I possess and took a caffeine pill.",
  "At 12:30, peaking, I decided that I was up for going to my only class of the day, which happened to be calculus.  I got my exam back to discover that I received a good grade, which normally would have made my day, but was indifferent to it.  I walked home and spent the rest of the afternoon chatting with friends on the net, uncomfortable, bored, nauseated, worn out and spacey.",
  "Why am I writing this now you ask?  Well, I supervise a computer lab on Tuesday nights.  Thats right  I didnt even consider how I would feel working an 8 to midnight shift, completely cracked out from no sleep and coming down from AMT with horrible jaw pain that just set in.  BLAH! ",
  "Things I learned:",
  "*Take AMT when I have 18 hours of free time open in my life.",
  "*Take AMT with my friends.",
  "*I shouldn't try to control the experience.  If its not the right time, its not the right time."
