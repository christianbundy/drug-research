 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: The doses reported below are not consistent. The lower dose mentioned is what is listed in the dose chart.]</p><p>My background:</p><p>I'm a 45 y.o. who's had much experience with most drugs, etc.  I was a poly drug abuser as an 18-20 y.o. & went through a 4 month drug rehab in 1977.  I then became a certified substance abuse counselor in 1988 & was a counselor for 10 yrs... I wanted to give something back for my years of abuse, etc.</p><p>I stopped using drugs in 1983 having had a 2 day/night spiritual experience... no need for details as GOD (Geometry Of your Divinity) makes these experiences unique for the individual & quite unexplainable in human terms, etc.! I can say that I came into direct contact with GOD's love for us & it is too powerfully amazing & overwhelming, loving, & compassionate to even try & put into human terms.</p><p>My quest for spiritual truth has been ongoing throughout my life.  I have beliefs in Western & Eastern teachings/philosophies reincarnation, karma, twin flames, charkas, etc., etc.!  I have been speaking to GOD on a daily basis for the past (almost) 20 yrs I talk to GOD just as Im talking to a friend & GOD has spoken back in so many amazing ways!  Ive had many, many spiritual experiences Ive experienced both good & evil (energy veil).  But there is no force out there that is more omniscient, omnipotent, or omnipresent than GOD (our real Father/Mother).</p><p>In the past 20 yrs. Ive smoked aprox. 10 joints of marijuana, along with a few beers/mixed drinks here & there.  Im not much of a drinker.</p><p>I came across some reference to Salvia on a message board & started researching it.  I spent hours & hours & hours researching Salvia with no interest in mushrooms, DMT, MDMA, MDA, cocaine, marijuana, or other psychedelics, (done that, been there) etc.  For mine is a spiritual journey of introspection only & I intuitively felt that all these other substances would not give me what I was looking for & when I follow my intuition Im always right!  I have since spent many nights up until 4:30am researching Salvia.  I was very intrigued due to the spiritual introspection aspect of Salvia. </p><p>I purchased 3 grams each 1 gr. 10x extract (if Im going to do this, then Im going all the way with a 10xer) from a popular vendor & 2 gr. 10x extract & a pipe from another that claims theirs is organic. I will say that both are very powerful, but I think the organic (a darker green) is just a little stronger.</p><p>My reason for using:  After all my research I felt I could come into direct contact with the Heartof our Father/Mother GOD & commune directly with GOD!  My only purpose was in s</p><p>piritual introspection, with no intent of using this divine substance to get high, etc.  Little did I know how divine this experience would be (all 7 to date)!  All 7 experiences were variations on the same theme but intensified with each subsequent one while still using the same dosage each time!</p><p>My Experience:  I took 1 gram & divided it into 14 sections & then gel capped them.  I then took 1 gel cap & dumped it out & then divided it into 2 equal sections.  I prayed extensively to GOD as to why I was doing this & called for protection, etc.  The room I used it in was my bedroom my bedroom is a very spiritual place for me I have an altar, many spiritual focuses Jesus, St. Germain, I Am Presence, Mother Mary, Sanat Kumara, Lady Master Venus, El Morya, Arch Angel Gabriel (and others), a huge amethyst stone, etc.  I was very comfortable & felt safe.  Since I was doing this by myself I also prayed/called for safe protection in that I would not leave my office chair (because I was doing this by myself), etc. (which I never did in my 7 experiences to date).  I played mellow spiritual music with cordless headphones & had the lights only slightly dimmed.  I put the dose of half a cap (1 fourteenth of a gram of 10x extract) into my pipe, lit it & inhaled deeply & held it for probably 30 seconds.  I was using a stopwatch & at aprox. 20-25 seconds I could feel a melting into my chair feeling then nothingness for 7 to 8 minutes as Im coming into a conscious state of awareness I feel the presence of GOD I dont think its GOD; I know within all my being that it is GOD.  I feel & see the room wrapping/rolling over upon itself as if this reality (as we know it) is going to disappear as a speck of dust and Im going to enter into the being of GOD but I kept pulling back saying not yet, not yet!  WOW exactly 10 minutes of an unparalleled experience nothing, nothing, nothing can compare!  After 10 minutes everything was fairly normal; no hang over, heavy head, etc. feeling, I felt fine, but boy did I have questions!</p><p>One question I had was Why did it take until the end of the experience for me to become consciously aware?  Well, I thought that the next time I use Salvia I will tape record myself and thats where it all begins!</p><p>2cnd through 7th experiences Well I used 1/14 (thats all, one fourteenth) of a gram each time & the same bedroom scenario was the same, only on the 3rd time I did not use any music at all.  Each experience lasted exactly 10 min., and each time it felt as if I was becoming consciously aware at the 7-8 min. mark.  I could sense that I was almost touching the very being of GOD & again I didnt want to go all the way because I didnt feel that I would come back to my body, that I would remain in the spiritual, etheric realm. </p><p>I then listened to the tape recording of my experience & thats where I was hearing myself talking out loud to beings I couldnt remember seeing.  I was asking why was all this (the universe) created they were telling me that they were waiting for me and I would tell them that they couldnt start without me (start what? I dont know).  I felt like I was at the hem of the garment of GODs being & that I was reaching up to touch the very being of GOD, but if I did I wouldnt be coming back to my physical body, but that I would remain there with GOD!</p><p>Whew!  You talk about something like this and no one can understand unless theyve been there!  Well I can say this much the beauty, wonder, power & most of all a warm, warm gentle, but so powerfully compassionate love that our creator has for us is AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME I was feeling like I was just ready to enter in to GODs heart when all of a sudden I became aware of my physical self & was feeling bad because my loved ones wouldnt know what happened to me if they were to find my body dead in my chair, even though I knew I wouldnt be dead!  I felt that I needed to really think about what has happened to me through these experiences. </p><p>Ive had many, many spiritual experiences, but nothing this phenomenal, etc.  Since using Salvia I have had a new, conscious awareness of GOD as never before as Ive said earlier I had a very powerful spiritual experience in 1983 & since then Ive developed an almost daily communion with GOD that has been very loving & enlightening!</p><p>There were many other statements, comments that I had made to my unknown/unseen friends-brothers/sisters (that is what they seemed like) while under the influence of Salvia.  My 1st use of the Salvia was on July 17, 02 & my last use was on Aug., 4, 02 and I intend to use again sometime on Sunday 8-11-02 or during that week.  Ill keep in touch.</p><p>A Brother on the Path that only leads back to the Heart of our Father/Mother GOD!</p><p>Father/Mother GOD I am grateful for the DEEPER understanding/contact Im having with your presence and I will only use Salvia for my own spiritual introspection.  I am yours and I am also grateful to begin to know what it means to be  LOVE.  For we are hear on this earth to learn how to love and to be that love in action forevermore!</p><p>Your child becoming your Son.</p><p>Thank You Father/Mother GOD!</p>",
