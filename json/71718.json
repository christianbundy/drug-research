 "report": "<p>I tried Lyrica to help with neuropathic leg pain. Starting dose was 50 mg at bedtime, titrated up to 150mg.</p><p>Definitely no euphoria. It seemed to help with the pain after about 2 weeks, but left me spaced out and greatly affected my ability to concentrate in the daytime.</p><p>I stopped taking it after about 5 weeks, and the concentration issues cleared up after a few days. I wouldn't try it again. Definitely not the magic bullet I had hoped for......</p>",
