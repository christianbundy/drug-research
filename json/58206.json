 "report": "</p>Ok so I tried smoking, I had read how it gave an overall warm feeling, etc. I also read of some reports mentioning slight nauseau and dizzyness. I didn't know this meant that for the next hour I would be in misery. I went outside, smoked one all the way through while I walked my dog, and after which I was so dizzy I needed to sit down.</p><p>Then there was this overwhelming urge to puke, after which there was projectile vomiting, I mean literally I have never thrown up that bad in my life, I saw stars, and after all of this I didn't feel anything except for sick, my tongue tasted like I licked out an ashcan, and my hands and clothing smelled like shit, well like tobacco but when I am in the midst of being horribly ill it smelt like shit.</p>",
