  "<p>I was a big pothed but this time I smoked a lil bit more than usual. By the time I finished and walked inside my house my heart began racing at the speed of light, I am not sure exactly how fast, but fast. I was getting really scared and just started to freak out. I started screaming  (I was home alone) and yelling. I really thought I was gonna die. Every step I took I questioned. Like I wanted to go outside and run away, but then I thought running wood raise my heart more and decided not to. I then went on line and went o this site to look at what I should do. There was no information on what to do in my situation! As the high went down so did my fears and heart rate. Ever since then I fear doing weed but I have done it once or twice since then but I am still scared every time I do it. \r[Erowid Note: The Psychedelic Crisis FAQ has information applicable to such a situation.]</p>"
