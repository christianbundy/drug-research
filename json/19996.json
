 "report": "<p>Methcathinone and Darvocet (100 mg propoxyphene + 650 mg acetaminophen).</p><p>I have experience with a wide range of stimulants, and this was one I had not tried. The Darvocet I am very familar with, as I take it occasionally for pain.</p><p>9:30 pm -- I take one Darvocet (for moderate pelvic pain). I don't feel much effect from this.</p><p>10:45 -- I snorted a line about ~50 mg. The drug appears as a fluffy white powder, and smells slightly sweet. The shit burns! Not as much as meth, but a fair deal. The subsequent drip is pretty awful, too.</p><p>11:00 -- I can feel effects, though mild. Slight stimulation (coke-like), jitteriness.</p><p>11:30 -- I decide to try taking some orally, because I've found that stimulants tend to be alot smoother when adminstered that way. I swallow ~65 mg in a capsule.</p><p>11:45 -- I'm starting to feel quite fucked up...it's a unique kind of stimulation. Not strong like meth, and it doesn't really give me that 'alert' feeling. Neither does it make me social or talkative.</p><p>The effects continue increasing, but overall, I'm feeling neutral about the drug; even amounts of bad and good effects. I'm feeling antisocial, jittery, anxious. Somewhat lightheaded and 'dumb' (can't think clearly, trouble concentrating, bad memory). My heart is beating quickly (very unusual for me, I've never felt this on any stimulant, I have a very low pulse naturally), and my chest feels generally tight, which I think contributes to my mild anxiety.</p><p>But, I do feel some pleasant effects, and a mild body high.</p><p>12:15 -- I feel some mild euphoria; my state is now positive as opposed to neutral. It's not a STRONG positive but quite tangible. My head feels good. I wonder if the Darvocet (which takes a while to kick in, and always gives me mild-moderate headaches) is responsible for me feeling only 'neutral' earlier. Thus, maybe I'm feeling better because the Darvocet is wearing off a bit...</p><p>12:30-1:30 -- I continue feeling pretty nice, mild surface-of-the-skin body high.</p><p>1:45 -- I'm feeling fewer effects, anxious/crash-like feelings returning...</p><p>I go for a walk in the rain.</p><p>2:00 -- I take another 60 mg orally, it is like I am 'fiending' a bit (very rare for me).</p><p>The high isn't great but it is pleasant, and I don't feel like being sober right now.</p><p>2:15 -- I take another Darvocet, because my pelvic pain is returning (I guess the Darvocet is wearing off substantially). Then I eat an english muffin in order to prevent opioid-nausea.</p><p>2:45 -- I'm really feel effects, very nice tingly body high, nice tingly sensation in the head (though not as strong as with amphetamines), mild euphoria returns.</p><p>3:00 -- The effects at this point are at their highest for the night. There definitely seems to be some synergy between the methcat and darvocet resulting in the aforementioned body high. I'm feeling quite warm (pleasantly so, as I'm usually cold).</p><p>4:00 -- I start feeling shitty/anxious/antisocial again; guess I'm coming down.</p><p>5:00 -- I'm still feeling warm, and some body high. I've developed headache from the Darvocet. Though I'm still kinda stimmed/fucked up, I'm also feeling tired. The body warmth is strongest on my skin, which feels almost unpleasantly tingly/stimulated at this point. It's almost like a cross between really mild sunburn and pins&needles. VERY similar to the physical effects I get on amphetamine (dex, adderall) comedowns.</p><p>SUMMARY</p><p>This is not the worst stimulant I've done. I found it to be closest in effects to coke (which, I might add, has never made me talkative or social), although it resembled bzp in its body high and head-tingling effects.</p><p>It was an overall pleasant experience, but nothing amazing, and quite frankly I'd rather do meth any day.</p>",
