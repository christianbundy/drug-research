  "<p>My friend and I did some Salvia last night and had a wonderful experience, we both entered what we thought was a new world, and we loved it. To try to understand this new world more we just did it again... I load a nice bowl of 5x into my bubbler and let him hit it, our intention is to hit it/load it until we're both in this new world, he holds it in, I load a nice hit of 5x for myself and hit it, this is what I realized -",
  "If your a 2d character in a book, if you separated your head from the book and looked at it, everything would look flat, and at a weird angle. We are the 3d characters who've separated our heads and looked out our world from the fourth dimension. Everything looks so flat and boring compared to the expanse of this dimension. Just like a 2d character would see the third.",
  "Our world is just a fairytale, sitting on a table in a dimension infinitely larger than ours. Not a dimension like another place, but an actual fourth dimension, heighth, width, depth, and ?. I honestly believe that salvia can allow my mind to separate itself from the page, and see the fourth dimension.</p>"
