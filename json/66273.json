  "<p>I take 200mgs of Provigil a day for ADHD and sleepiness.  As I'm in college, those personal drawbacks(?) are significant but provigil has been more successful than other drugs I've taken - adderall, focalin, strattera, effexor, concerta. It is a wonderful drug, providing a gentle boost to my brain that enables me to compete and produce in this world where production and a factory-line efficiency are what measures the worth of a person. ",
  "In any case, I've found that when Provigil and caffeine are combined the effects of both drugs are exacerbated, often to an unpleasant extent.  I have always had a very high tolerance for caffeine, pre-modafinil I drank 7 to 10 cups a day with minimal negative side effects.  Now, if I take my 200mgs modafinil in the morning and then drink a single cup of coffee I am totally wired - complete with excessive jitters, racing thoughts, profusive sweating and a deep-set restless and anxious feeling.  I would imagine if someone with a caffeine sensitivity combined these two drugs the consequences would be more than a bit unpleasant.</p>"
