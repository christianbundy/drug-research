 "report": "<p>I had been taking Depakote (a mood stabilizer), Effexor (a SSRI) and Risperdal (an atypical antipsychotic) daily for about a year and a half when I decided to take MDMA.  The 2 pills I ingested were tested and according to a few of my friends (also seasoned psychonauts) who had taken them before, pure.  I should also mention that I had taken MDMA around a dozen times or so over a three year time span when I was not yet taking any medications daily, so I knew what my typical response is on about 2 pills.</p><p>To return to my story, I took the pills at a rave so I had fun, but I never felt any of the empathic/stimulated feelings that I normally get from the e.  In fact, I felt a sleepiness fit for the time of day (4 in the morning!).  I did get some of the 'physical' effects from the e-- I noticed my body's usual inability to stay warm and my pupils were the size of my irises.  I was pretty disappointed but I was not really too surprised by the outcome, considering the meds I'm on.  After that night, I was curious to see whether smoking weed right after taking e would potentiate my roll.  So a few months later, still taking my daily meds, I took two of the same pills and smoked a nice fat joint to wash them down. </p><p>I'm a scientist and I felt compelled to keep all of the conditions the same except for the addition of the weed, so that's what I did.  I went to the same venue to roll with the same friends; there was a similar crowd, DJs, and vibe.  So, the results were: unfortunately, not too different from the first experience.  I did feel a little speedier and more energized (seperate from being stoned), but I definitely was not 'rolling.'  Again, I couldn't keep warm without a jacket and my pupils were ridiculous.  I looked like a glass-eyed fish.  As for the hangover, I didn't get one on either of my two trials.  I've never experienced a hangover from e (ever!)-- if anything before I started taking meds, I would get very manic and euphoric for the week after I took it.  If you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder or mania and you're not on meds, be careful!  E really tends to set manic episodes in full swing.  Overall, I'd say if you're taking mood stabilizers and an SSRI, there's little benefit to taking MDMA.</p>",
