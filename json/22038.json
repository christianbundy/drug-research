 "report": "<p>I was both desperate and a little unsure about adding DHEA to my regular rotations of vitamins and minerals. I'm an 'older hippie' type who still enjoys recreationals and is in early menopause. By the way, I am convinced that smoking pot makes my hot flashes worse, but that's another topic. I got the DHEA, 'pharmaceutical quality' from a website which was recommended in a book I was reading about menopause. The cost was $10. inc. shipping for 100 tabs. I got the 5 mg tabs about two months ago and have taken them every day, once a day.</p><p>I like this stuff. It  was recommended as a drug which could help balance hormones and although I still have symptoms, I have felt much better generally. The literature says it's a mood stabilizer for us girls and it seems to have that effect. My body has changed, although I weigh the same I don't look as chubby. I have more physical energy, am more willing to park my car a little further away and walk, simple things like that. This dose is much lower than the recommended, which is anywhere from 25 mg a day and up, but it seems to work just fine and of course quality matters. I recommend trying it for this purpose.</p>",
