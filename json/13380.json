  "Well to start off Im an addict an any addict who is not in denial will be able to tell you that once an addict always addict. That doesnt mean I am still using just means I have no self control. My drug of choice was Meth, Terrible drug, sucks you in and by the time you realize and the drug goes all loco on you its to late.",
  "I quit with such ease it was rather mind blowing to some, but what they didnt realize is I had researched all the withdrawal symptoms and then what Meds would cancel out each. I then went to a Psychiatrist and played all the plays I had to get what I needed. Long story short, this is what I am now taking daily, No abuse, only as prescribed: 600mg Seroquel, 150mg Venlor, 100mg Zoloft, 90mg Concentra",
  "50mg Seroquel Morning and Lunch",
  "150mg Venlor Morning",
  "100mg Zoloft Morning",
  "90mg Concentra Morning",
  "500mg Seroquel Before Bed",
  "This combination allowed me to have zero Meth withdrawal. Its the ultimate combo for getting clean, I went from smoking 2 Grams of meth daily to zero the next day. I'm living proof That there is a legal combo out there."
