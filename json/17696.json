 "substance": "Belladonna (berries)",
 "bodyweight": "180 lb",
 "report": "<p>I've harvested my first batch of berries, my plant is in its 3rd season.  It's a gorgeous plant that didn't go without some problems, potato beetles found it quite delicious and I was made to spray it with Trounce once every two weeks during the peak of the bug's season (the berries were well washed/rinsed before ingesting).  The berries matured quite nicely, varying sizes and I still have many more coming.</p><p>Being in the medical profession I know exactly what belladonna does and how we use it in both emergency situations and more often in ophthalmology to dilate the pupil for surgical and diagnostic procedures.</p><p>I ingested a small berry, blueberry size.  Quite bitter, nasty aftertaste.  I took the second, one about the size of a dime in diameter and quite plump about a half hour later.  Again, horribly bitter. </p><p>The heightened sense of awareness fazed in slowly within 10 to 15 minutes.  Some tachycardia, no worse than my near lightening hit, max about 150bpm for about 5 minutes at its worse. </p><p>It was much later, about an hour when I noticed the dry mouth, insatiable thirst, and hardly quenchable (my bladder is nice and flushed).  Still experiencing the awareness, everything was brilliantly clear and the auras were resonating.</p><p>I began to be bothered by what my eyes might look like.  I had a heightened awareness of them being in my sockets.  I began to experience some photophobia, yet my pupils were dilated to a max 3 or 4 (and I was in a light muted room).</p><p>The rest of the evening fades since I fell asleep during a rather wicked storm, but the effects on my eyes lasted for a about 36 hours. </p><p>KW</p>",
