 "report": [
  "<p>I found a twenty milligram extended release pill of Opana. I had done Oxymorphone once before, but the last time really takes the cake. Me and my friend split a twenty mg. that was split into two, had the coating removed, then took a bump up each nostril each. It was felt within minutes, and peaked within an hour or so.",
  "I have a problem where when I take hard drugs like this, I can't sit or stand still. I was sweaty and got heat flashes, while my friend nodded off occasionally. Huge head rush, extreme body high. For me, the best part was coming down after about two and a half hours, it felt better than the initial high...smooth clean, ultra relaxed. The wierd thing is, I couldn't sleep afterwards, just lie in bed and fell good.",
  "Overall, I'd say It has a huge potential for me to get addicted to, personally, so I probabaly won't be doing it that often.</p>"
