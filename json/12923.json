  "Understandably, many people may feel uncomfortable with the idea of sticking a drug up one's ass. I, however, enjoy this route of administration for certain substances. I usually feel less of a toxic load, less stomach upset, and a smoother ramp up. Why people find it ok to shoot up and taboo to talk about rectal administration is completely mysterious to me.",
  "Anyway, for the experience in question. First time trying MDMA rectally. 100mg was dissolved in sterile water, put in a dropper syringe, and inserted rectally. Within 20 minutes, I found that my headspace and significantly altered: I was suddenly, yet smoothly pulled to the peak experience that usually happens to me about 1 hour after oral administration. The ramp up, unlike with the oral ingestion, was completely smooth: a clean transition, with none of the usual bumpiness I often associate with MDMA coming on. I also seemed to come down much faster, but again, quite smoothly, and I found the the ecstatic rush was over within an hour and a half or so, even though I had an afterglow that lasted for a few hours.",
  "In concluding, I could differentiate the rectal route from the oral one by comparing it with the difference between travelling on a prop engine plane, as opposed to a private jet: the former choice offers a bumpy, yet longer ride, while the latter, a smoother, yet shorter one."
