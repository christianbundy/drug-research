 "report": "<p>Just wanted to share a couple of brief descriptions of Bromo-DragonFLY experiences.</p><p>BDF was received as a mistake, the vendor was selling 2C-B-FLY but instead had BDF, he subsequently died of an 18mg dose. However I had received mine prior to this event. A lab test performed by others who had this same batch confirmed it to be BDF.</p><p>I dosed accurately 250ug the first time. First 3 hours went with no effects. At T+3 there was a marked increase in energy. Still no major visual elements.</p><p>T+6 noted a more mental shift, being slightly dulled and focused. The overall energy buzz was still there.</p><p>By T+8 visual effects had greatly increased. Effects lasted hours, but I benzo'd myself to sleep before reaching the natural end of the trip.</p><p>Same goes with the 200ug experience, only less visual.</p>",
