 "report": "<p>Let me start off by saying that I'm now a 22yr old heathy male because of the wonder drug Tramadol. before I took tramadol I was addicted to oxys real bad (5 80's a day) from 01'-06'. I went thru the methadone program and got off of that bull shit, the withdrawal from dones make oxys look like happy meal treats.</p><p>I was first prescribed Tramadol in 50mg tablets for an off label use: to treat the hunger for opiates I had after going through withdrawal and come back to reality which is really shitty. I took 150mg twice a day take with a small fatty snack and caffeine for quicker absorbtion. A little vitamin c helps in a pinch too.</p><p>It doesnt have the bad properties pain pills have while giving me damn close to what I desire. ie positive outlook, overall happiness, and at night (nods) thats right nods. I've been on it for 3 months and havent craved oxy or marijuana in that time. Its not oxy but it blocks the pain I feel for 12-18 months after coming off oxys or hydros. It saved my life...</p>",
