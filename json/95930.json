  "<p>Well thought I'd give this stuff a whirl. Lots of experiance with drugs mainly illegal. Took this stuff by bombing it and had some off a key up the nose. Took about two hours for it kick in.",
  "It just felt wierd would be the best way to describe it, nothing special.  Then four hours into it suddenly felt really wierd lots of anxiety not horrible but not good. Chest was sore when I moved, fine sitting still, sleep was a struggle due to the sore chest.",
  "Finally got off to sleep but only had about 4 hours. Felt very spaced out during the day and just didnt feel right. All in all i will not be touching this stuff ever again.  I do not understand what it is actually supposed to do.  Complete waste of money.  The worst drug I have ever done and will be flushing the rest down the toilet. Steer clear of this crap.",
  "Oh, and I bought a gram of the crystals (sparkle).</p>"
