 "report": "<p>T+00 I injested 2 ambien 10mg pills and snorted one 10mg pill.             </p><p>T+0015 begininng to feel slightly euphoric so I decide its time to light up a smoke as well as injest 1 cup of coffee. The tobacco smoked cleaner than usual in my inebriated state.</p><p>T+0030 I'm beginning to feel a bit light headed and seem to be dragging ass so I injest a second cup of my colombian brew only to bring myself back to the euphoric state.</p><p>T+0045 I have the irresistable urge to take the Cosby kids down to the river the act was more explosive then most of my past trials.</p><p>T+0130 I'm begginng to notice the walls breathing and things going on in my periphrael I decide to try to sleep.</p><p>I woke up at 5am with to recollection how I made it upstairs to bed probably the amnesia affects. In short I find out that ambien really doesn't do a whole lot for me though I will still routinely take this amount in hopes of something interesting happening</p>",
