  "I'm on probation. I get drug tested regularly and was nervous when it came to DXM because I have heard it can cause false positives. One night I personally ingested around 200 mg of DXM to catch a buzz. Little did I know I was to be drug tested the very next MORNING!!! The result of 100% clean surprised me, and I was very pleased."
