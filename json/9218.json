 "report": [
  "This report isn't so much to describe the effects of tramadol, but to describe one of its uses besides pain killing. Even though it wasn't until I had discovered it on my own, I noticed a few people had mentioned that they had taken tramadol and noticed they didn't feel any withdrawal from their opiates. So on with the story.",
  "Basically I had come into a huge supply of oxycodone and morphine. I had never done any other drug (including marijuana), so to me the effects of any drug were new and amazing. I was a regular user for about 9 months. I would take large doses on the weekend for fun and then trail off during the week. I did this hoping it would slow down my tolerance levels, which with experimenting, I truly think it did. When I neared the end of my opiate supply I was taking nearly 150mg in a sitting just to get the desired opiate high I was looking for. Sometimes I would take 500mg in a day.",
  "As my supply dwindled I became greatly afraid of running out and going into withdrawal (I had quit cold once before and did not enjoy it). It wasn't so much that I minded getting sick, but what affected me the most was the back pain that came with the opiate withdrawal. I already had back pain from before, which I had forgotten about since I was so heavily medicated. I always knew when the opiates were leaving my body because my back would hurt with intense pain, so much I could barely even walk. A day later with no opiates I would start to get flu like symptoms. Headaches, vomiting, insomnia, pretty much just generally unhappy.",
  "As my supply was running out, I still had never taken my side supply of tramadol. I didn't know what it was or what it did. After I took my last oxycodone I started to panic. I went online and quickly researched tramadol. It seemed to be safe so I took it in a small dose. I didn't get a high, but I didn't feel uncomfortable either.",
  "After about 24 hours with no opiates, but with 50mg of Tramadol every 3 hours or so, I was feeling just fine. After further experimenting I discovered that the best dosage for me was 150mg of tramadol every 12 hours or so. I was very impressed with how fast the tramadol would take effect and with how long it would last. I stayed on Tramadol for 2 weeks straight in fear that my opiate withdrawal would not be over. Yet during those two weeks the only withdrawal symptoms I felt were some slight hot and cold flashes. I just want to be very clear that I felt no back pain, no sickness, absolutely nothing besides the hot and cold flashes while going through withdrawal from opiates while taking the tramadol.",
  "I know all people react differently to drugs, but I would have to say that for me, tramadol has become a miracle drug to me. I now have a prescription for tramadol for my back pain. It kicks in quickly and has no noticeable withdrawal symptoms.",
  "I will never forget how lucky I was to have the tramadol on hand for my withdrawal."
