  "<p>I had read about an archeological dig that uncovered San Pedro 'roaches' indicating it was a common practice to smoke San Pedro 5,000 years ago.  Most tea recipes seek to make San Pedro milder in effect. This is because the nature of the shamanistic specialist is to heal more than invoke visionary states in many cases.",
  "So after figuring a way with no tools you can take a large piece of San Pedro and peel a perfect blunt skin. Me and my associates puffed this large blunt and at first the effect of the crippling purple indica with it's sweet, fruity flavor hit us than after playing some tunes an hour went by and then the intensity of the colors and clearness of vision took over and a mellow mescaline trip had begun. It continued for several hours and remarkably it seemed to increase my endurance and my physical skills on the drum sharper but before I knew it 5 hours had passed and we were so high we forgot to smoke again. Smoking With St. Peter is the way to go.</p>"
