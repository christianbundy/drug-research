 "report": "<p>I have only been using ketamine for half a year now. I used to hate it before, and barf or k hole off 200 mg doses. Now I am a pro, and it takes me 0.5 grams just to get hit. But my body is dying. My stomach feels as if it is on fire, and when I urinate the pain I feel is devastating. Sometimes there is blood in my urine, or I urinate a thick liquid, similar to jell-o.</p><p>I hope to quit soon. I do not know why ketamine causes these problems, nor do I know what I can do to stop it. I have tried antacids, and pepto bismol, neither have prevailed. I hope that one day the pains go away, for I can not take this any longer.</p>",
