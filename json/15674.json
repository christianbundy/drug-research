 "report": "<p>I felt I must say something to those who have tried the poppy tea and felt nothing.  To do it right, you must buy at least 300 grams of poppy seeds (300g-500g).  Put all the seeds in a large container and add enough concentrated lemon juice to make it a thick soupy mixture.  Let it sit for about 20 minutes while stirring it every 5 minutes.  Once 20 minutes have passed, then filter out all the seeds and keep the juice.  Lots of sugar can be added to the juice and it will taste close to lemonade and then the all of it drunk.</p><p>After about 30 minutes, I feel extreme euphoric effects begin.  I have tried percocet and oxycontin and this is much better.  The effects will last for about 24 hours and I feel extremely relaxed, mellow, and overall just plain good.  This stuff does work, must people just don't know the correct meathod or dosage.</p>",
