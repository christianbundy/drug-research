 "report": "<p>Always had trouble sleeping, so used to drink a beer or 2 to help me sleep. Then, after realising I`d piled weight on, looked for a substitute, got into legal stims, which doubled the insomnia problem. Tried 1ml of Gbl the first time, loved it, and had a nice relaxed sleep. Only 4 weeks later, I`ve realised, that not only can I not sleep at all with out it, if I try to do with out it, I`m getting strange, not too pleasant visions, like sinister moving shadows etc. This can build to a terrifying situation. Also now what  used to get results with 1ml, now takes 4 ml. Just to add, I am 47 yrs old, and NEVER thought I`d get in this situation.</p>"
