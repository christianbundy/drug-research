 "report": [
  "For some time I had not been remembering my dreams or even remambering that I had had dreams. I had heard online before that taking a combination of valerian, B-6, and melatonin helps with dreaming, whether regular or lucid.",
  "My first time trying I took 8 100 mg pills of valerian, 10 50mg pills of B-6, and 2 3mg pills of melatonin at about 2 or 3 in the morning right before I went to sleep. Didn't notice much difference in my dreaming.",
  "The next time I upped the valerian dose to 900mg. Slightly more difference than 800mg. After that I upped the dose to 1000mg (1g). That night I got crazy dreams that were extremely vivid and bright, but come morning I could remember very little if any of the dreams. I did remember that I had dreamed the previous night though.",
  "If you're into this type of thing, do it. If not, don't. But either way you should be careful when using any substance. Everyone reacts differently to different substances, so know your body."
