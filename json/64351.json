All I had ever done was habitually smoke pot and upon trying Coricidin approx. 4-6 pills I felt good eventually building an immunity. Having increase the dosage with each use I eventually got up 15 pills for the effects and by then I had grown sick of this disgusting high so I quit taking them. My friend on the other hand wasnt as apt to being sober as I was and continued taking them, quickly building an immunity till he had to take at least 30+ to feel the effects.</p><p>He suffered severe heart damage and now requires medication to correct the effects of the damage. Now at six years later I was stupid enough to try it again due to no available pot or pills and much to my dismay i took 10 pills and felt like I was a tweeker my jaw muscules went haywire flexing erradically and I was senseless for about 6 hours. Finally it wore off and I went to sleep then for the following month and a half I felt retarted with slower motor skills inability to think straight or for a long period of time and when I smoked weed these effect seemed to amplify finally after about 35 - 40 days later I was back to normal. This is a caution to any one thinking that coricidin is worth taking for a trip....it most sertianly is not.... No trip is worth your life or your health</p>",
