 "report": [
  "Two individuals smoked various quantities of dried amanita muscaria (up to 4 grams) on subsequent days. The amanitas were found in Oregon and in the SF Bay area and had been dried at 200F and powdered in a coffee grinder. Both noted the same phenomena: not much of a noticeable effect (no visuals to speak of) but the morning after smoking (that is, from 8 to twelve hours after ingestion) there was a distinct feeling of well-being, calmness, even happiness. The happy effect suggested that a cure for all of life's problems had been found.",
  "The following several evenings a similar amount was smoked but there was no noticeable effects at the time of ingestion nor the following morning. Our observation is that there is an astonishing amount of smoke produced when firing dried amanitas-it fills the room with a cloud. Amanitas burn nicely however without the need for added materials. But we wonder what happened to the euphoric state experienced that first morning after?"
