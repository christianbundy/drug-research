 "report": [
  "<p>I ordered my nuts online, which came pre-crushed. I wrapped about 2 grams in a paper towel, for lack of anything better. My nuts had a consistency of kitty litter so I wanted something that would keep them together. Hesitantly, I put my nuts into my mouth and began to suck on them (seriously people). Within about ten minutes I began to feel the effects.",
  "It was a very mild feeling, not so much as a buzz as just a general feeling of well-being and contentedness. Very pleasant. I take prescription amphetamines for ADD so I am generally unaffected by coffee/tea/soda, and I would say what I experienced was pretty mild compared to what I had researched.",
  "One very interesting (but not surprising) thing happened though. I had been sick with a sinus infection for a couple days when I took them, and afterwards I felt great!! Within about two minutes of taking them I didnt feel run down anymore, my throat and sinus ceased to hurt and I felt discontent laying around my house.",
  "Overall the experience was pretty good. Not too strong.</p>"
