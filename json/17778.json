  "I took this herb to improve my mental processes and the effects were marginal. It made things more 'clear' but this can be misleading since I don't think the effect was very strong to be an advantage (at 150-250 mg). Taking a larger dose of 500mg made me feel buzzed.",
  "I have to take it for about 1 week to notice the difference. But again the difference for me was marginal. Kind of the same difference as having half a cup of coffee. For others it may be different."
