 "report": "<p>I have been using damiana for several years now, and I have discovered that in me it brings out what's there. If I am slightly happy, it makes be very happy. I haven't discovered any negative sensations as yet.</p><p>I generally smoke one or 2 rollups a week. It relaxes me most of the time, I find that the pure damiana can be a bit harsh, and hard to roll, so I added some tobacco, and it was smooth. I do a ratio of 1 tobacco to 4 damiana. Some days, I get a buzz, other days it focuses my mind, so it's not the same for me every time, and it's not the same for others I have tried it with.</p><p>It seems to bring out what's there.</p>",
