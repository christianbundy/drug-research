  "OK, I have snorted Buspar a few times and can tell you it's one of those drugs where you just keep asking yourself when is this gonna be over. Even though it is classified as a minor tranquilizer it does not in any way resemble barbs or benzodiazepines at all.",
  "Bbout 10 minutes after administration I felt very bodily intoxicated.  Walking was impaired, I felt horrible and just wanted to go to sleep.  It is the only drug of its class I haven't enjoyed.  It's just like uhhh being sick and wanting the sickness to go away then you go to sleep to relieve the sickness you wake up and feel funny but relieved that its over.  A few of my friends have had nearly identical experiences with the drug. I was so disgusted with this drug i never botherd mixing it with other drugs. I've also been unable to find any information about the combination of Buspar and any other drugs except for metylphenidate (Ritalin)."
