 "report": "<p>\nHi!</p><p>I had this experience last saturday, that i HAVE to share with everyone. I have tried 2CB severeal times before, and though fun, it has never intrigued me, like stronger psychactives such as LSD. That is, untill last saturday.</p><p>My companions and me had planned on a hard night og drinking, and never expected to have the time of our lives. We had been drinking since 6 o'clock in the evening, and was quite drunk, when i located a couple of 200 mg capsules og BZP in my drawer. We where four persons drinking in my cellar(I have a really nice cellar for tripping), and three of us dosed with the BZP. After about one hour or so, we where all quite stimulated, and where really silly. It was about 11.30 in the night at this point. We decided a small amount of 2CB, would be just the thing to get us in the right mood. All three of us(the last friend, dont do any psychoactives) put 25 mg 2CB (hydrobromide salt=20 mg 2CB hydrochloride form) in a capsule. We immediately went to a bar and smoked some skunk on the way. We arrived around 12.30 and where all feeling the 2CB alot. We could not hide the fact, that we where REALLY affected by drugs, as we where talking QUITE loud. </p><p>The paintings on the walls, started coming alive, and turden into the most beautifull visuals ever(not strongest, but most beautifull). We had a couple of drinks and where extremely ecstatic. We just sat there, like a couple of MDMA heads and looked at all the beauty of the bar. After one hour we went to the nearby club. We peaked of the 2CB at this point. The line, before we got in, was SO amusing. We all just stood there and looked at the shifting, liquid and extremely vivid hallucinations. The body was so pleasantly stimulated, that it aws impossible to describe. It was like a 10x MDMA buzz. </p><p>When we got in, the light and sound simply took over my soul. I started dancing(i usually hate dancing) by myself and was carried away. We just stood in the hallway, between the two areas, and grooved to the beats. It was the most ecstatic feeling i have ever experienced at this point. I was so happy and i just loved my friends etc. We went upstairs to a chillout area and has a lot of gingerale-vodka drinks, which where nice. We just sat there talking to everyone while having the time of our lives. Now and then, when a groovy song was being played, we went dancing. Every time the sound and light took over and we became one, with the whole dance scene. The visuals where very nice throughout the evening. Never to intense, and never boring. Simply perfect at all times!! I went home around 4.30 in the morning and had i very nice walk home. It was a 30 min walk home, but the time just flew by, as i reflected over the experience i had had. I slept quite good when i got home(which i account to the large amounts of alcohol and some marihuana).</p><p>All in all: I cannot begin to desribe how much i enjoy the BZP-2CB combo. It has a very special synergy, that cannot be described as a mix of the effects, but more like its very own. The BZP enhances the psychedelic effects of the 2CB(with 40 mg pure 2CB i did not have this strong visuals), and the 2CB brings out the emphatogenic effects of BZP. The body load was minor, but i had a body buzz, that resembled that of opiates. I will try this combinations again VERY soon!!</p><p>Regards</p><p>Voorhees</p>"
