 "report": "<p>The other night I decided to IV aproximetly 4 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT. Let me start off with that if you like needles, this is a highly preferable way to take 'foxy'.  The peak was instant, and lasting around 2-4 hours. It seemed very similar to a 15-20 mg oral trip. However somehow it felt more 'clean'. It didn't seem so *mind* intensive but more mellow, laid back. Colors looked really bright, some bending/morphing, and obviously all the erotic senses brought out. The very main thing I liked about this method, was unlike my past experiences of high doses oral, the comedown was very sharp and clean, leaving no lingering after effects. This is nice if you want to sleep without getting closed eye visuals that will distract you. So if you don't have the fear of needles many seem to have, this is a very good way to take 'foxy'</p><p>        -Deus121</p><p>[erowid note: taking chemicals by IV involves much higher risks than any other route of administration.]</p>",
