 "report": "<p>I've read a number of reports giving elaborate extraction methods for Syrian rue.  After some experimentation, I discovered that simply boiling the whole seeds in plain water for 30 minutes gives a perfectly good yield.  I don't think there's any point doing anything fancy to get that last little bit out -- the seeds are legal and cheap.  3 grams extracted this way gives me enough MAOI activity for ayahuasca use.  It may even be possible to shorten the boiling.</p><p>My exact procedure is:</p><p>1.  Measure out 3 grams of Syrian rue seeds.</p><p>2.  Put them in a pot.</p><p>3.  Put 300-400 mls of water in the pot.</p><p>4.  Cover the pot, place on stove, and turn stove on.</p><p>5.  Bring to boil.</p><p>6.  Simmer 30 minutes.</p><p>7.  Strain.</p><p>8.  Drink.</p><p>Don't believe it'll work?  Try it!</p><p>One can easily assess the quality of the extraction by using a UV light.  Harmaline glows under UV, a very beautiful colour that seems both bluish and yellow at once.  The brightness of this glow indicates the concentration.  If you put some seeds in a glass of cold tap water, you will soon see little glowing trails emerging.  It doesn't take much to get it out.</p><p>Hope this saves someone time and trouble.</p>",
