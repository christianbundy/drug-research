 "report": "<p>I'd like to describe the effects I experienced on MDMA after I had been taking the SSRI Escitalopram for over three weeks at 10mg a day for depression.  I am an occasional MDMA user, and I had hoped this dose of MDMA would be sufficient despite the possible SSRI interaction.  However I was disappointed to find the positive effects of MDMA were completely lacking, both physically (tactile and body sensations) and psychologically (euphoria and empathy).  I actually felt a bit depressed, and quite lethargic, despite being in a party environment at the time.  The only effects I recognised were general stimulant side effects, jaw tension/teeth grinding, difficulty sleeping etc.  So I conclude, since the MDMA was reliable, that the Escitalopram effectively blocked the empathogenic / euphoriant effects of the MDMA whilst the stimulant properties remained more or less unaffected. I am curious to know whether the effects of hallucinogens such as LSD/psilocybin would also be reduced by such a degree.</p>",
