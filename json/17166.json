 "report": [
  "I had read that passion flower increases the potency of mushrooms.  I recognized the flower from pictures as one I had seen growing around my area.  Mushrooms are my favorite so I was keen to try them with the flower.  Recently I went out looking and found one mushroom (I think the species is psilocybe cubensis) and a passion flower vine.  I picked two flowers.  By the way these flowers are very beautiful!",
  "I tore the flowers up and left them to soak in 2 cups of water for a couple of hours, waiting for evening.  Then I boiled the mixture for several minutes, added more water and boiled a little more.  Then I added a tea bag to the mixture, Lipton.  Because there was only about 2 cups of water I only soaked the bag for 2 minutes.  I drank the tea, flowers and all, and waited about 40 minutes before ate the mushroom.  The tea tasted normal.  I forgot to weigh the mushroom but I guess it to have weighed 15 or 20 grams.",
  "The onset was normal for mushrooms.  An hour after eating it I was quite high.  I stayed high for 7 or 8 hours.  Id say the effects of the mushroom were roughly doubled in intensity, but it was different than normal, I didnt like it.  It made me hyper but at the same time I didnt want to do anything.  The high had a sharp, uncomfortable edge I didnt like, and it was the same from beginning to end.  I don't think I'll ever take passion flower with mushrooms again."
