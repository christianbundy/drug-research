  "Wow this is a fun fun drug......while the high lasts.  I am doing it for the 5th time, but its the first time i bought it and am doing it alone.  I was really just sick of every other drug and i said Peter  'go get a ball' so i did.  Its not that i need to do drugs alot i just need them when i am really stresed.  This is my first drug use in like 3 months and its fun, but damn it, damn it, damn it, all you want is some more.  The stuff i bought isnt the best but then again it was pretty cheap. It feels like there is speed in it so its working pretty well.",
  "i just really really needed to write that i cant be doing this again for a good 3 months, cause its way to expensive and my nose is killing me.  I just want to be able to read this when i am fiending tomorrow when i run out.  For all the people out there that cant stop, i see your pain, this stuff is nuts, but just try to make it out alive."
