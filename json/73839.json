 "report": "<p>Trial One:</p><p>Prep. - 3grams, boiled in vodka for a few minutes. More vodka added and boiled a second time. Filtered and drank.</p><p>T 0:30 - Mild, pleasant affect. Warmth and relaxation. Began drinking alcohol and effects subsided quickly.</p><p>Trial Two:</p><p>Prep. - 6 grams, boiled in 2 cups water for 10 minutes. Another 1 cup water added, boiled for 15 minutes. Drank</p><p>T 0:30 - Dazed, sounds and lights seem brighter, intrusive.</p><p>T 0:45 - Waves of nausea, legs feeling week, body feels hot, deep waves of pleasure</p><p>T 0:1:00 - Difficulty walking and sitting straight. Eyes can barely stay open. Strong nausea. Body feels numb. Difficulty speaking. All I want is a large, comfortable couch, dark lighting and quiet. The world seems cruelly unappreciative of my state.</p><p>T 0:1:30 - No longer able to stay out in the social scene, retire to my home and lay on the couch. Eyes closed. Waves of pleasure.</p><p>T 0:3:00 - Nausea until I vomit. Slight headache.</p><p>Conclusions: Tea extraction is most effective. Doseage of 3-5grams is best. Setting should be one of sedentary comfort. Will try again at a lower dose. Maybe a tea party with one or two close friends.</p>",
