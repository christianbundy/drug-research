  "I've noticed there are only two reports on GABA in the experience vault, so I thought I'd share some of what my girlfriend uses it for.",
  "She suffers from OCD, generalized anxiety disorder triggered by PTSD and many phobias. She goes into full blown fight or flight mode when confronted with her catalysts; live fish, spiders, certain people,and marijuana and other illicit drugs.",
  "When she goes into this panic mode, she'll take one or two (depending on the severity) 250mg capsules of GABA. The effects will calm her down, disassociate her from the source of the attack, and completely remove the fear for the trigger that caused the anxiety. The anti anxiety effects last for about a half hour, and then she'll feel totally exhausted and sleepy, and she'll usually fall asleep for about fifteen minutes or whenever she's woken up.",
  "This isn't placebo, as we have tried other supplements to help her anxiety (St. John's wort, black cohosh, kava kava, Marijuana) but nothing works as effectively and as quickly as GABA does."
