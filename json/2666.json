 "report": [
  "I tried salvia with a good friend of mine in October. We bought a gram of 5x extract from a reputable company. They suggested 2 hits is all one would need to get high. My friend packed the bong, which was also recommended along with a butane 'torch', and lit it up. After the second hit he immediately started laughing uncontrollably and could not stand up. I quickly wrestled the bong from him and took my shot. After the second hit I did not really feel anything. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. It started with a slight tingle on the bottom side of my arms and legs. I soon realized i could not stop laughing and was very confused about what I was doing. It was like when you stand up to fast and get the headrush only this lasted for a good 5 mins, and was much more intense. A lot of people say they have had full blown 'trips' with Salvia. This was not the case with me or any of the 6 other people I subsequently smoked it with. I could describe as a super-intense nitrous hit. I later tried it with pot and found the results to last a bit longer. Overall not a bad time. We ended up paying twenty bucks for that gram and later saved a bunch of money by making our own extract from the raw leaf."
