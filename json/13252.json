 "report": [
  "I have been a tramadol junkie for many years ( about 7 ).  Just a few weeks ago I was prescribed Gabapentin for nerve pain.",
  "One evening around 5 pm I decided to take a couple.  After approximately 1 1/2 hours I noticed...nothing. So I angrily took another 4 capsules ( each were 300 mg ).",
  "Then it hit me like a ton of bricks, about 2 hours later. I felt dizzy. It was hard to talk. I tried to walk but stumbled. It was the strangest high I've ever had. I felt totally drunk. Slurred speech, marked euphoria, and total relaxation.",
  "I fell asleep easily that evening, and in the morning I still felt some of the after-effects. I felt buzzed until lunch the following day. Unlike alcohol, there was no hangover effect at all. I felt wonderful.",
  "I also noticed after a few more doses of Gabapentin that I no longer craved tramadol. So now I am using it to taper off that drug. My warning to anyone: this drug takes a full 2-3 hours to peak, so don't gobble pills. Give them time to take effect."
