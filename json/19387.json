  "MJ Brownie Experiment",
  "What are the effects of eating pot?",
  "Start Time is 9:15 p.m.  (7/12/03)",
  "Control:",
  "I weigh ~135 Pounds (60.25 kg)",
  "No THC in my system for at least a year!",
  "No drugs in my system in the last week (caffeine, DXM, aspirin, etc.)",
  "I have a completely empty stomach!  I ate last at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon.",
  "I will list my feelings every fifteen minutes until I really feel heavy effects (if I",
  "do)",
  "I know the diazepam is against the rules to control this experiment, but this is for",
  "my own good and I can distinguish the different effect of the two drugs/highs",
  "My recipe for an identical experiment is as follows",
  "Stuff you need:",
  "\t1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped",
  "\t4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, softened",
  "\t Cup sugar",
  "\t1 egg",
  "\t Cup all-purpose flour",
  "\t Teaspoon of vanilla extract (for taste)",
  "\tAround  oz of herb, depending on the strength you want",
  "    your brownies.",
  "Process:",
  "1.)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a   cupcake pan",
  " that makes 4-6 cupcakes (depending on how large you",
  " want the brownie.",
  "2.)  Combine the herb and butter in a small saucepan over",
  "low heat, stirring frequently.  When the butter and bud have heated up for awhile (just a few minutes) add your",
  "chocolate and let that melt and continue stirring.  After",
  "everything is blended remove the mixture from the heat.",
  "3.)  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the sugar.",
  "Than beat in the egg.  Gently stir in the flour, salt, and",
  "vanilla.  Pour and scrape the mixture into the cupcake",
  "pan about 2/3 full on each one.  Put the brownies in the",
  "oven for 20-25 minutes and check periodically to see if",
  "the middle of the brownies is set with a toothpick.  Let",
  "them cool on a rack, outside, in the refrigerator, etc.",
  "They stay good a few days and make about 4 brownies.",
  "4.)  The brownies will take about 30 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach.  Eat one every 30 minutes and you should be out for the night within 3 hours!",
  "NOTE:  The smell of bud shouldn't flow out of the oven, but it smells pretty bad in the oven, but not anything you'd expect from pot.  I actually though I got a contact buzz while cooking it, but really it turned into a headache.  (not pleasant)",
  "9:15 p.m. -  I ate one Brownie Cake that contain ~1/9 oz of commercial bud.",
  "9:30 - I took 10 mg of Diazepam to control my anxiety while stoned.  (I seem to have a problem with paranoia)  Also, my parents are up stairs, so in case I get super baked I wont get scared! Believe it or not, I actually feel a buzz coming on from the magic brownie!  It is nothing like the coming up while smoking, it seem to affect how my body feels (in a good way!).",
  "9:45 - Nothing much different, It seems that I am totally normal around my parents because Im not flying to the peak as you do while smoking.  This is a real benefit to a person in a social setting, but I still dont know for",
  "sure how high I will reach tonight.",
  "10:00 - Still not much has changed; I think I feel different (you get the point).  I am eating another brownie that contains ~1/9 an oz of bud.  I also consumed another 5 mg Valium pill.",
  "10:15 - Im starting to feel like Im moving up fast, my first brownie must be kicking in. I feel baked already, I cant believe that it hit me so hard in just 15 minutes between 10:00 and 10:15.  I noticed that there is a weird body high that I dont normally experience while smoking.  I feel heavy and feel stuck to my chair I dont even want to move right now.  Walking feels weird, kind of like the Robo walk from a DXM trip.  I feel mentally clear, and this doesnt happen by smoking either!  I am excited of what is next!",
  "10:30 -\tI am toasted right know I had to lead my friend through the process to log on the internet, and I didnt ever care that I was baked (I believe this is mainly the diazepam that eliminated my paranoia.)  I feel like I am stoned in a more calm way, so you can easily control your self in situations that normal smoking would leave you unprepared.  My mind is a little cloudier and find myself getting off task easily, and looking around a lot.  Typing is harder now, it seems that when if I think about what I am trying to write than it seems harder, so I just let my thoughts flow.",
  "Nothing below is proof read for errors to show my intoxication level.",
  "10:45 -\tThe normal Marijuana smoking effects are beginning to show up.  These include the munchies, and cotton mouth.  A real intoxicating body high is present.  I feel like I am pulling my legs along, that is similar to being drunk.  I think the THC and Valium are a synergistic mixture.  I feel so relaxed, and kind of like passing out.  I used the delete key about 50 times during this paragraph, and I skipped a lot of words that belong in the sentence in the way I thought it out.  It is now 10:50 after I completed this journal entry.",
  "11:00 -\tI am blown out of my mind, I feel all the normal effects with smoking herb, but with eating it acting normal is hard, you just need to go with the flow!  I feel baked, but I still have half stash to eat, so I hope it is cool.  I forgot to mention that trip properties of bud are now beginning to show, I am too fucked up to go in front of my parents without any trouble.",
  "11:15 -\tI am stuck in the chair in front of my computer.  I tried to get up, but I felt like my but was glued down to it.  I walked around and my vision is blurry like the beginning of a 2nd plateau DXM trip, but I fell like I am swaying around.  A lot of the movements I make seem to be done without thinking they flow together.  Typing is easy if you dont have to think about what you are writing, or I always screw up my wording.",
  "11:18 -\tI feel like passing out for awhile.  Totally blown, not like the time I smoked  oz last year.  (It took me over 6 minutes to right this sentence!)",
  "12:00 - Im having closed eye visuals, ones that you dont get from",
  "smoking, I really enjoy eating the buds more because of the high, and I hate the feeling in your mouth while you smoke.",
  "Sunday 9:00 a.m.",
  "I still feel different; I have the same feeling of when I began to feel the brownies last night.  I remembered that while I was sleeping I felt a buzzing sensation throughout my entire body.  My vision was buzzing/blinking slightly also.  It was a slight trip while I was laying on my bed, nothing intense enough to scare anyone, but I never finished the entire  oz, only a .  I saved the rest for my DXM trip tonight.  I kind of regret taking too much diazepam because I passed out before the peak of the experience, but even before my peak the experience was very intense and nothing like smoking pot! I feel like moving around a lot when I smoke pot, but while eating it I just want to chill in one spot and not do anything!",
  "11:30 -\tI feel like I have a little hangover, or maybe because I need to eat.  It was from the 15 mg of Valium I should have stayed with five or ten.  (I only weigh 135)  I was actually planning on doing 600 mg of DXM tonight, but I might not be able to if this headache lasts all day.  Just smelling my last two brownies makes me want to puke!"
