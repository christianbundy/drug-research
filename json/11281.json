 "report": "<p>Was feeling edgy and agitated the past few weeks, so decided to give valerian a try. I picked up a bottle of nature's resource 100 MG Softgels standardized to 0.8 MG Valernic Acid. I figured I would start by taking 5. An hour later, another 5. no really noticeable effects so far. proceeded to take another 2 every half hour till I had finally taken 20 of them in a 5 hour period, the first 10 within an hour. Im not quite sure but I think I was slightly more relaxed. After all this, all I can say as that either was it extremely subtle or there was nothing but a slight placebo effect. Didn't really seem to be active at all. A few days later, I more or less repeated this once again. Same results.</p>",
