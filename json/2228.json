  "<p>I was prescribed Flexeril for muscle pain. The bottle stated that I was to only take 1 pill, 2xPer-day. After taking 1, 10mg pill, orally, and not seeing much effect, I decided to take 2. The effect was partial numbness in my lower body. I then took 3mg of Melatonin on top of the 20mg of Flexeril, and I felt so fuckin lazy.",
  "I have also tried snorting one 10mg Flexeril tablet, and found that it BURNS LIKE HELL. It numbed my nose a slight amount, but it also made my sinuses flare up. After waiting about 15 minutes, almost all the burning was gone. I had to blow my nose and drink soda to help get rid of the burning. I wouldn't recommend snorting the pills, it works better if it is taken orally.</p>"
