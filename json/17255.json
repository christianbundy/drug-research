 "report": "<p>Jack Stoennd received four Marinol capsules from a reliable pharmaceutical source one day in exchange for P. Cubensis mushrooms. Being reasonably curious, Jack decided to try one after school.  At 2:15, Jack Stoennd took one Marinol capsule containing ten milligrams of dronabinol, the main psychoactive cannibinoid present in marijuana.  Jack Stoennd had had little to eat that day.  By 3:00, Jack began to feel a bit high, a bit restless.  By the end of the next hour, he felt a level of intoxication approximately equal to that provided by a gram of good potency cannabis when eaten.  Jack was unable to concentrate clearly on his homework.  His perception of music was enhanced, and his appetite was largely increased.  Around 7:00, Jack's high began to fade.  By 8:00, he was nearly back to baseline.</p>",
