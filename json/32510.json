 "report": "<p>[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</p><p>I tried gasoline huffing. It was one of the worst things Ive ever done. I was in my garage, and I tried it because I heard people saw hallucinations and vibrant colors and so forth. I went to my garage, took the gas can, put my hand over the nozzle, and put my mouth on my hand, and started to inhale. As I took my first few inhalations, I got a little lightheaded and went inside.</p><p>I wasnt satisfied, so I went back took about 20 more hits. As I was kneeling, this plastic sandwich bag turned blue and purple, and I could feel my brain throbbing, and I went in my house and everything I heard had like a crackly echo to it and started to make me panic and paranoid, and I could barely think . My motor skills were severely affected and could barely think for what seemed forever, which was only 5 minutes. I felt like a living vegetable and my experience was horrible and I truly regret it. My experience made me feel as if I was melting my brain.</p>",
