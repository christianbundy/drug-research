 "report": [
  "Modafanil is advertised for alertness and from my experience seemed selective. No jitters, no palpatations, and most interestingly, did not significantly act on sleep receptors. This creates a peculiar dynamic though when tired, as sleepiness combined with alertness gives a headache-y tension.",
  "Onset is also fairly slow, taking a few hours to really set in. This can be shortened by crushing the pills. The effect lasts a surprisingly long time, around 12 hours or so on 300mg, and there seems a build-up effect after a few days. After 3 days I can even skip a day and still feel somewhat influenced. I used modafanil for about a week, and over time there are more noticable effects on sleepiness and sleep.",
  "I didn't find Modafanil to have direct appetite or psychomimetic effects like amphetamines, although the highened focus of the drug resulted in eating less and a little mental instability. As anyone knows, even sleep deprivation can cause psychosis, and the stimulating effect of modafanil seems to bring the whispers from beyond a little closer. I'm surprised actually that people can take this drug for long periods without more untoward effects.",
  "For me, it was useful for the intense focus I required at the time. Its not anything I'd want to take for long periods. There isn't any euphoria."
