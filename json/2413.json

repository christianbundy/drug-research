 "report": "<p>\nI took X for many years, mostly on weekends.  It got to a point where I needed 2-3 pills just to get high.  On Monday's after I came down my head would be vacant and I could not concentrate.  By Tuesday I was so depressed that I would cry for no specific reason.  Usually by Thursday I would be ok again, but I would go right back into the same routine on Friday.  Eventually, I was diagnosed as clinically depressed.  I have been on anit-depressants for about a year. </p><p>I was not physically addicted but I am sure that I was emotionally addicted to X.  I think the mood lifting effect was needed to escape my depression, but the ultimate result was that I became more depressed.  I have not used the drug for over a year and sometimes I have nastalgic memories of the 'good' times, but overall I am much happier now and it is a real happiness!</p>",
