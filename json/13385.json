  "<p>My first couple of Salvia experiences gave me little or no results, so when the Salvia Divinorum 10x extract arrived in the mail I a bit skeptical but still quite anxious. I filled the bowl with a bit of tobacco and then sprinkled a signifigant amount of the powdery extract over the top.",
  "The first hit absolutly blew me away. I felt as though my body was launched into space, kinda like the feeling you get on a roller coaster only in the oposite direction. I feel as though I may have left my body breifly (and I mean very breifly). All of what seemed like ten seconds later I felt quite grounded yet by no means 'sober'. The after effect lasted about five to ten minutes later. I felt a strong sense of well being like all the emotional baggage that I had been carrying over the last couple months had all been dropped. I think that in the right setting with the right dose Salvia could very well produce a strong out of body type experience. I am quite anxious to try Salvia again possibly this time with a water bong to get bigger and less harsh hits allowing me to absorbe larger amounts of Salvinorin A.</p>"
