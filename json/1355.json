  "There have been many claims that the unripe berries and green shoots are hallucinogenic. I consumed 30 unripe mulberries with very little psychoactive effects. There was an edgy, speedy, irritated feeling. Also I felt minor stomach discomfort. I am uncertain what the chemical make up of this plant is and why only unripe berries are hallucinogenic. Possibly when the berry ripens the hallucinogenic chemicals metabolise into a non-psychoactive substance. It may also simply be a myth."
