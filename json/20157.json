  "I had read a wide variety of reports about the effects of Kanna (which were reportedly positive for the most part) and decided to give it whirl.  I was working in my kitchen at the time listing to some music and took about 1/3 to 1/2 gram of the dried flowers orally.  I let them sit in my mouth for a few minutes until they disintegrated and proceeded to swallow.  This was at about 11 am.  Over the next hour my energy level started to tank and a strong headache soon followed.  The music eventually became unbearable as it made the headache worse.  I forgot that I had even taken the Kanna but around 4:30 pm, I remembered when I finally put two and two together and recalled that I had read somewhere that Kanna can cause headaches.  No positive effects were noticed at all.  Needless to say, I won't be taking Kanna ever again."
