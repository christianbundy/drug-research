 "report": [
  "Ok, so I had a four hour exam that I had to take and I knew I was going to fail, so I decided to pop some pills beforehand to make the time go by faster.",
  "I got 20mg (four pills) of Hydrocodone (Vidodin) and swallowed them all at once. After 15 minutes, I felt GREAT! I was gliding across the floor, floating. This effect only lasted for about 20 minutes.",
  "Next, the high went away and I became horribly hot. I was sweating like crazy! I felt HORRIBLE. My fever just kept escalating and then the nasea set in. It was the WORST nasea of my life and I just knew I was going to throw up everywhere. I layed my head down and tried to sleep, but it was no use. I was restless with nasea. I wanted to kill myself!",
  "The horrible nasea lasted for 5 HOURS!!! Then, I could finally sleep. I slept for 5 hours and woke up with only a little nasea. I was SO GLAD it was over. I will NEVER do hydrocodone again!"
