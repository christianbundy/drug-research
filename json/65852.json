 "report": "<p>I will never try it again. Really didnt feel anything good or get a buzz from it but after like 10 mins. of chewing the leaf and tucking the wad of betel leaf, nut and the lime concoction my mouth started to burn a little and I just thought it was the betel experience being soaked into my mouth. But I didnt feel anything from it and I spit it all out. Well then the area the betel was in my mouth such as my gums and the side of my tongue started to feel a very bad burning sensation and ended up swelling and felt and looked like I burnt the inside of my mouth. Its still store the next day and hurts pretty bad. Anyways I wont be doing it anymore and really wouldnt suggest it to anyone else at all either.</p>",
