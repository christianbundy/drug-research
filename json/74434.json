  "<p>My experience with GBL use started about a year ago. Started off as recreational, but had other health issues which I used GBL to counteract. Soon it turned into round the clock use, taking in excess of 2ml every one and a half hours to the point where I was wracked with anxiety and depression both on and when trying to withdraw.  I feel like I'm on the brink of a nervouse breakdown.  All my internal organs ache.  I think I'm poisoning myself.  Have tried to seek help but nobody knows what I'm talking about. Have found similar reports of usage on the net, but they're all abroad.</p>"
