  "___Notes___:",
  "0530 - Ah, what a beautiful taste - so familiar from the liquid extract I tried before.  I'm afraid to swallow my saliva, as the Salvinorin-A dissolves in the stomach before getting a chance in the blood stream. Sigh, I really hope this works.  If not, then I'll have to smoke it.  Let's get some nice music going - while reminiscing, I might as well bring out the Infected Mushroom & Shpongle.",
  "0540 - It reminds me of plant food - or fish food - or both.  Whatever, it's just slightly annoyingly bitter.",
  "0545 - Swallow - Fifteen minutes of sitting and swishing should be plenty.",
  "0548 - I swear!  I'm immune to Salvia!  It must have been one of the endless shots given in the military that did it.  Ha!  Just kidding.  Really though, wtf mate?",
  "I love my Infected Mushroom though.  I'm just in the mood for it.",
  "0552 - Just keep listening to music.  I don't expect anything at all to happen - not even the slight visual effects I had before.",
  "1732 - I fell asleep, and felt no effects whatsoever.  Oh well.  There went about ten bucks worth.</p>"
