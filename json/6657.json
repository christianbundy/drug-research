  "I learned to chew on a slice of raw ginger root when I have a sore throat.  It is very strong, but I have seen it help my throat many times.  The first time I tried Ginger for a cold, I was supposed to go camping with friends the next morning, and I could tell that I was starting to get sick.  Listening to the advice of my wife, I made around 3 liters of strong tea using about 8 to 10 inches of ginger root, and drank half of it that night, the rest the next morning.  By the time I had finished the tea, I was completely better.  I didn't put anything in the tea but the ginger, although honey and lemon are good additions.  In East Asian philosophy, ginger is a warming herb, and it works well on winter colds especially (as they are often caused by an excess of cold in the body), although I have used it in the summer with good effect as well.",
  "For sore throats,  I now usually chew on the root itself, since the juice runs down my throat slowly over the course of several hours.  I highly recommend this for pot smokers, since the ginger soothes the throat's irritation from the smoke. ",
  "Not for people with weak stomachs, and since having a cold can be trying on some people's stomachs, be careful."
