 "report": "<p>I started taking painkillers and opiates about 9 months ago. I was in a car accident and got facial reconstruction and severe back problems. I was prescribed lots of opiates and really enjoyed them. Opiates are really nice but the dose to take gets increasingly high for a good feeling. I now take soma for my back pains and taking two to four brings quite a nice feeling. I don't have to increase the dose to feel good. I'm on four 350mg pills right now and typing feels like I could go on for ever and ever. It gives me releif and a great feeling. The only drawback with soma is walking on to high a dose and sex if I am on it is almost impossible. I have been taking pills for a long time now due to my accident and this has done a hole lot for me.</p>",
