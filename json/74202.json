 "report": "<p>I started out by buying a glass pipe.  I went home and put a drop of fentanyl into the pipe that I got from a patch.  I tried to smoke it but didn't get much feeling, like I had from chewing the patches or eating the gel.  I decided to add some weed and then go to bed.  When I woke up, I was in the hospital.  Apparently, I had od'd.  When I was sleeping, I had almost stopped breathing.  My mom found me the the next morning and called the paramedics.  They took me to the hospital where I spent a week and earned a $20,000 medical bill.  Fentanyl has been an okay experience in the past but nothing fantastic.  I had overdosed on this before where I had barfed all night and felt like crap the next day, but this time was different.  I had been bleeding from the mouth, got a huge stain on the bed to prove it.</p>",
