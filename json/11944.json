  "I tried a new method of experiencing kava today. I took 1 cup of medium-ground kava root powder and a 1/4 cup of powdered cinnamon plus 4 cups of water and liquified the mixture for 2 minutes-But BEFORE i started, I dropped 3 gel tablets(1200mg each) of lecithin orally. After mixing it, I strained the contents of the blender through a straining bag and squeezed 6 times to make a frothy, pleasant smelling dark brown tea.",
  "Drinking 2 cups in a row--Within 10 minutes my mouth and face went into a semi-numb feeling. I finished the rest after this and then experienced a euphoric, meditative and very relaxed state. I nearly lost my balance getting up from my chair too fast. my legs felt like they had weights on them and my walking was unsteady as if i were drunk on beer. After 2 hours i drifted off to a deep sleep.",
  "My theory is this: The lecithin gels i took emulsified with my gastric juices so when the kava tea came in the fat-souble kavalactones hit me almost at once (a catalyst effect?) boosting my kava experience. This is the 2nd time i did it this way---So the process is Repeatable."
