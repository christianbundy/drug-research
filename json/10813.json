  "I have been smoking a moderate amount of cannabis every evening for many years and started to take Fluvoxamine 100mg for anxiety and to improve sleep. This turned out to be a nightmare. Every time I smoked even a very small amount of cannabis after 30-60 minutes I went on a bad trip of very severe anxiety and nausea. I couldnt do anything than wait for hours for the bad trip to go, tortured by an extremely restless body and mind.",
  "This started the second day that I was on Fluvoxamine. I am an experienced cannabis smoker, I never start flipping on cannabis even with high dosage. Also without cannabis I felt drowsy and uninspired on Fluvoxamine. After three weeks I stopped taking Fluvoxamine and waited one day before smoking cannabis. The bad trip symptoms had completely disappeared. My conclusion is that cannabis and Fluvoxamine are enemies."
