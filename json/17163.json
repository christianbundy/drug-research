  "I had just heard of Melatonin helping people get to sleep, so I went out to the grocery store and bought some.",
  "T=10:45 - Took 3 mg Melatonin with a glass of water",
  "T+0:15 - Very heavy tired feeling, craving sleep.  I decided to get ready for bed and lie down.",
  "T+0:20 - Heart rate feels like it is increasing, I am very tired but I cannot close my eyes.",
  "T+0:30 - I feel like I am having a panic attack, I am not.  Harder to breathe, difficult to form positive thoughts.",
  "T+0:35 - Seems like I am heading back to baseline, except with a slight headache.  Still a little difficult to breathe, and my left eye hurts.",
  "T+0:37 - I try using my muscles but it seems like they are too weak to do anything.   Still trying to fall asleep, but can't.",
  "T+0:40 - Still trying to sleep.",
  "That was the last entry in the journal, no vivid dreams, sleep came harder than usual, and it was a horrid time."
