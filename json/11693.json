  "Its a little odd as to how I've stumbled upon this plant. It grows in some patches near my home. I did a lot more research before I actually tried Yarrow, just so I didn't get into something id regret. The first day I decided experiment was an aftermath of a crazy experience the previous night (lucy, mary, and sally were all there). I didn't need to peer pressure my open minded friends due to their curiosity.",
  "So of course, insomnia blues ensued that morning. After a 20 minute boil with about a gallon and a half made, we prepped. Smoked a few bowls while we waited, finally done. I really didn't do much to make it. Water, a few yarrow stalks, honey/sugar, heat, done. Any who, after sipping to the bottom of the cup, my friend and I glanced at each other, thinking the same. Am I feeling anything? I sat back in the chair, easing off of every muscle. Suddenly I settled into a sense of calming euphoria. I breathed slowly trying to sense anything. I felt very clear minded and confident, I seemed to feel at one with everything.",
  "There isn't anything nuts or visual about yarrow. A good way to put it (after trying it several times sober, or to cure myself), is that it puts me into a very zen state of mind, same as I feel after a bowl pack. I felt almost uplifted and clean, the warmth totally blew away the hangover. After 3 more glasses, my friend and I began talking about how we felt. I could feel the narcotic running through my body, everything was great. Honestly, I felt entirely relaxed and steady. It felt as if I ripped the bong a few times (without vibrating visuals).",
  "When coming down from an acid trip, I feel so verbally frustrated, that I cannot explain my logic to people. After my test runs with the yarrow, I felt as if I was able to clearly let my thoughts flow through my head and out my mouth.",
  "All in All: Yarrow is definitely something that my body and mind could really use. I've now had about 7 friends try this tea out. It is now somewhat communal amongst my friends and I."
