  "Two good friends and I decided to take a weekend and trip on DOB.  My",
  "initial expectations were of a trip very much like 2C-B, but spanning",
  "sixteen to twenty hours and fueled by the presence of amphetamine.",
  "What occurred was something not entirely different, but not something",
  "I'd been anticipating.",
  "[T+0h] Saturday noon.  After I munched on a breafast of bacon and eggs,",
  "we three wanderers each ingest 2.5mg DOB dissolved in distilled water.",
  "Mixed with orange juice; taste imperceptible.  Here goes.",
  "[T+0:30] First twinges of a psychedelic drug in my system.",
  "[T+0:45] The psychedelic is clearly taking over my brain.  Interacting",
  "with the world around me is difficult.  If I know nothing else, it's",
  "that I'd better get the hell outta public view.",
  "[T+1h] Two of the three of us arrive at a Safe location.  We have a",
  "friend who'd volunteered to drive us around that weekend, and so we",
  "wait for him to get ready to take us home.  We step inside (out of the",
  "sunlight) and immediately my field of vision explodes into",
  "characteristically 2C-B visuals.  I notice as well a wave of",
  "amphetamine crash over my body, and I am soon feeling like the",
  "strongest man alive.  I help my chauffeur lug some very heavy cargo to",
  "the van -- effortless.  This shit is SPEEDY.  I am smoking pot because",
  "I am compulsed towards it; it seems like a good idea to head off any",
  "GI discomfort at the pass.",
  "[T+1:30] We two arrive at home and meet the third, who's been coming",
  "up on the same schedule.  At this point, when I am in a darkened area,",
  "I am completely unable to distinguish visual effects from real",
  "objects.  Amphetamine high is still CRUISING. ",
  "[T+2h] I am so amped, I could gnaw the head off a puppy.  Fortunately,",
  "the fact that my entire perspective is moving, breathing, pulsating,",
  "billowing, and crawling keeps me from doing anything useful.  More",
  "smoking, and it is noticeably hard to keep it together long enough to",
  "pack a bowl.  I am floored.",
  "[T+2:30] I am thanking my lucky stars that I am going to have to",
  "interact only with people I know very well for the next 20 hours.  I",
  "am quite sure that I am having a good time, though -- still feels like",
  "2C-B, but HARDER.",
  "[T+3h] I would trade a kidney for a pack of Bazooka gum.  I have been",
  "becoming more and more disoriented with my surroundings throughout the",
  "whole three hours, and it is here that I would call myself 'lost' in",
  "my own house.",
  "[T+4h] A delightful, non-tripping-his-eyeballs-out friend shows up,",
  "and we three enjoy talking to him.  I think it is at this point that",
  "the trip begins its second leg; the 2C-B visuals start to fade (very",
  "slightly, at this point) and get the hell out of the way, and a very",
  "profound, intellectual DOB experience begins.",
  "[T+4:20] I pack a bowl.  'See you in 12 hours, guys.'  *rrrrrrrip*",
  "[T+5h] I can feel a slight tension lifted from my body as I",
  "simultaneously feel my brain kick into high gear.  I eat something",
  "because I can somehow tell I need to. ",
  "[T+6h] Over T+5-6h, I am able to clear the visuals out of the way",
  "(although they're still _very_ strong) and think, think, think.  I",
  "suddenly questioned every fact about reality I'd taken for granted. ",
  "[T+7h] The amphetamine din has settled into a dull roar, and I am",
  "leading my appreciative brain through an odyssey of metaphysically-",
  "deep insights into the real and perceived worldview I call 'Reality',",
  "leaving open at every corner the chance for anything to be possible.",
  "The three of us are happily and hungrily announcing and discussing our",
  "current thoughts.  We are settling down into a dark room in the middle",
  "of our house, almost like a cocoon, each person in turn putting on the",
  "music he believed to be perfect for the situation.",
  "[T+9h] We are devouring any knowledge we can, eager to share our",
  "amazing experiences and contemplations.  We eat when we need food,",
  "drink when we need water, smoke when it feels right.  I feel as though",
  "I'm overseeing my body at a higher level than I ever have; I have a",
  "good and innate sense of how to take care of myself (food, water,",
  "pot, music) without dwelling on the individual feelings and pains in",
  "my body.  It is apparent that the 'peak' (T+1-8h) has passed and the",
  "effects are beginning a very slow, gradual taper.  Three non-tripping",
  "friends appear, and it is very comforting to see faces from the",
  "outside world.  We talk and enjoy each other.",
  "[T+12h] Less visual, more brainy!  DOB thoughts are leaving me",
  "dumbfounded.  I am anxious to wrap my brain around any scenario I can",
  "conceive.  I have a correct and instinctual understanding of",
  "electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, organic",
  "chemistry, algorithmic mathematics in such a way that I can simply",
  "'feel' in what trend a particular system will act.  By possessing this",
  "deep understanding of physics and mathematics, the rules of my",
  "universe, I can detect patterns shared among wildly different systems",
  "(the ties that bind between social, chemical, and physical",
  "interactions).  I cook pasta for the six of us, and as it is",
  "well-received I ponder the satisfaction of crafting something for my",
  "friends and having it appreciated. ",
  "It's interesting to note that this experience was more what I would",
  "call 'Ecstasy' than MDMA is.  My past drug experiences were",
  "embarrassed and belittled by the DOB's gravity, its unique",
  "characteristic of allowing me to invent a constant stream of Heavy",
  "Shit for my mind to happily plow through.  I felt like I'd never",
  "thought about anything so important; my most fundamental concepts of",
  "reality were shaken to the core for the first time, and in comparison",
  "it makes the visceral high of a 'quality' MDMA or mushroom trip seem",
  "positively rude.  Whereas MDMA might allow me to reach a comfortable",
  "synergy with the people around me, DOB provided a glimpse of what it",
  "might be like to achieve Nirvana, to exist as pure thought.  When it",
  "comes right down to it, this is why I ingest psychedelics.  This is",
  "what it's all about.",
  "I had some very momentous insights into heritage and family ties, from",
  "my relationship with my dad to my kinship with the creatures from",
  "which I evolved.  I was given a chance to grasp the infinity of the",
  "universe; understanding its specifics was clearly out of reach, but I",
  "understood why it was acting how it was acting, on the whole.  DOB is",
  "completely orthogonal to the emotional realm; it does not alter my",
  "mood at all, and only allows me to enjoy it because I enjoy thinking. ",
  "[T+14h] 2am Sunday, and it is here that things really begin to screech",
  "to a halt.  Our conversation becomes less frequent, and I become more",
  "introspective.  It's time to let the music take over.",
  "[T+16:20] 4:20am and I'm keeping true to the previous afternoon's",
  "promise.  We are content to keep ourselves warm, hydrated and fed, and",
  "bathed in music.  Very faint visuals.  Coming down, no question about it.",
  "[T+20h] It is around this point in time when each of us three dozes",
  "off in turn; we're right on the tail end of the DOB's effects.",
  "[T+22h] At 10am Sunday, I declared the DOB's mental effects 'over'.",
  "[T+33h] After a full day of doing stuff and feeling generally ok, it's",
  "sleepytime. :)",
  "DOB tore me a new asshole.  I cannot describe it without its power",
  "making itself apparent in my speech; DOB will forever hold a special",
  "place in my heart, a place earned as a Truly Psychedelic Drug.  If",
  "treated with respect, I believe DOB can show us how awesome the",
  "human condition can be."
