      "My friend had some experience with X and had told me about it.  One day, she said she had come across some really good stuff (chocolate chips from Amsterdam), and asked if I was interested.  I had done acid once before, and was a seasoned pot smoker.  I was ready for it.  We got the tabs, and prepared ourselves by getting some comfortable clothes, a video (alice in Wonderland), and generally psyching ourselves up for the event.",
      "Upon taking the drug, I was somewhat anxious for the fun to begin.  After watching TV for a while, I noticed K acting funny.  She is significantly smaller than me, so I guess it hit her faster.  I wasn't feeling anything.  Then, I decided to stand up.  WHOAH!  COLD FLOOR ON BARE FEET!  It was like ice.  It was so cold it tickled.  Happy happy happy.  I began to dance around.  I could almost hear music in my head.  I settled down and we proceeded to massage one another with a mentholyptus rub (half a jar in all:  the smell was in my room for 3 days).  Masturbating was never this good.  I was shuddering from the waves of pure, unadulterated delight that were just sweeping over me like a rising tide.  I honestly heard some heavenly choir singing. ",
      "I received a couple of random phone calls from some people I hadn't heard from in a while, some of whom later came over.  Hearing those voices was like a reunion of some long-estranged family or something.  Utter elation.  I could NOT hold anyone close enough to me.  I wanted to keep squeezing until I had totally absorbed them into myself.  The drug is aptly named.  If you are ever looking for that total mind/body massage and spiritual connection with another person, this is the way to go.  We finished the night wrapped tightly in a fuzzy blanket listening to some beautiful violin music.  I was so happy and at peace that I almost wept."

      "It's now 7:20pm. it appears as though it's been 3 hours. Mild visuals. good tracers. hard to concentrate on spelling. have snorted about another 10mg. its all good. Very pleasant happy body high.",
      "It's 2:55pm(next day) - woke up at about 1:45 this afternoon. Had a very good time last night. At about 3:30am I went to bed and lay there contemplating my existence and realizing my perma-fry insanity caused by salvia. Realized that 'it's all good' is a reality anchor that I use to re-focus my existence. I always say this and never really understood why it makes me feel good. Last night AMT helped me realize that I have programmed myself to believe that 'it' - being my subjective reality at that moment which is always changing now - really is 'all good.' A",
      "Finally fell asleep around 8am. Throughout the night I took 220mg of DXM as well as another 10mg-ish line of AMT. I noticed that the AMT masked the effects of DXM and just made for a pleasant night. I would describe this drug as 'slightly psychedelic, very happy happy happy, functional, empathic, speedy but mellow calm acid.' I would also describe it as 'emotionally hallucinogenic.' The visuals were great in the dark or with my eyes closed however they were mellow enough in the light with my eyes open that I could still easily function in society.",
      "I believe that as that entire afternoon and evening was beautifully gleeful. Smiles and great conversation as well as admiring visuals filled my night. The conversation was at great as meth conversation but not as sporadic and unfocused or tweeked. Anyway overall experience was superb. This was my second experience with AMT. Looking around I am still noticing very very mellow tracers and auras around lights."

      "'Such Beauty. Fuck.' These three words were all I could conjure to explain what I was experiencing with the new and yet-to-be fully understood 2C-I-NBOME aka 25-I. Those three words do not even present the tip of the iceberg that is this wonderful experience from such an interesting and inspiring molecule.",
      "First off I will 'qualify' my understanding of the psychedelic (and otherwise intoxicated) headspace. I have used a variety of psychedelics including the classics LSD, mushrooms, MDMA and also a few of the Shulgin line - 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, DPT, 2C-I, 2C-E. I am a regular cannabis user, and have experienced a wide variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, and dissociatives.",
      "At the time of this experience I was as sober as I could be considering I am tapering off both Suboxone (buprenorphine & naloxone) and clonazepam. These substances were taken at small maintenance doses over 24hrs prior to ingesting the 25-I blotters to ensure they would not lessen or otherwise change the trip but to keep my body in a state of relative homeostasis. I was admittedly breaking a few of my own rules - tripping on a whim with no real plan at home with some family who I knew I would probably end up avoiding as the effects took hold. Keep in mind I have tried 25-I in previous sessions at similar dosages - the first was 900mcg taken foolishly with a large amount of clonazepam and buprenorphine still active in my system and the second a few days after 1.2mg IV. The 25-I experience itself I now know is very malleable - much more so than LSD and even mushrooms. The one startling aspect of this chemical is its overwhelming euphoria and positivity. I have never felt this feeling other than small glimpses during orgasm or the rush of a strong intraveneous opiate. MDMA experiences were not even close - I personally find MDMA a useless and very superficial experience. The absolute pleasure from 25-I is not only felt and understood but multiplied by its exploration/understanding and is almost controllable. The headspace differs entirely in that it has 3 out of 3 times been positive, euphoric, and almost relaxing. It seems to have everything I am looking for - it is wildly visual and euphoric while leaving the minds logic systems mostly intact - this is the only chemical in which I have experienced such intense feelings of euphoria and both open and closed-eye visuals without wondering 'what is going on?' and losing touch - the loss of ego. I suspect higher doses will be needed to yield this kind of reality-shattering. That is my summary of 25-I but now on to last night:",
      "T 0:00 - 2 blotters are placed between the gums and cheek, one on top and one on the bottom lip. This is not complexed but since it is the hydrochloride salt of 25-I, it is well absorbed if proper buccal technique is observed. I personally recommend keeping the blotters in contact with the gums/cheeks in various positions even as the drugs effects come on.",
      "T+0:30 - Although many say this is a slow-to-develop experience, I have noticed the familiar shimmer and intensifying of colors while also feeling a building energy - some friends have noted this come up as 'frightening' in intensity but compared to the 2C line it is just a small buildup of energy.",
      "T+1:00 - I decide it is time to prepare a shower as I find the effects building and building. My pupils are already dilating at this point and I can feel fluctuations in body temperature much more. There is a bubbling in the stomach that I would not call nausea by any means - just something I noted. In fact food/hunger is not only perfectly normal but strangely enjoyable tripping on 25-I, whereas with LSD and most other psychedelics I find any unnatural foods bizarre and unappealing. As I shower I also note the physical pleasure of this chemical coming on - I can imagine it would be a potent aphrodisiac used in the right setting.",
      "T+2:00 - I decide to take a night time bike ride with headphones - great idea! I am feeling the euphoria kicking in full force now and combined with the small but noticeable 2C-x energy I venture deep into the woods. At this point I can not fully see because the visuals are multiplying rapidly. I stop and smoke a cigarette and contemplate how hard it is for an American to find secluded nature anymore. I feel apologetic for paving over natural landscapes and natural beauty with our suburban and urban centers. At this point I note my euphoria is stronger than anything I have felt in my life previously (possibly due to the extreme affinity for this molecule to certain receptors).",
      "T+3:00 - Time dilation has begun and the entire world is awash in patterns and tracers. A note about pattern recognition. Visually, at least, this chemical seems to play tricks with the brains system of 'filling in' periphery. Usually when I focus on a point the brain fills in the rest of my vision with memory and logical assumptions - while on 25-I this trick of the mind is exposed. I focus on a point and it becomes almost 4-D in clarity as the entire periphery flows with reccurring patterns the mind inserts to fill in the lack of visual stimuli. These are not like any other visuals I have seen which are usually purely geometrical - they are also MC Escher-esque in repetition - rows and rows of horses marching into shadows of other rows of horses - tree branches interconnecting and exploding out in ways that defy physics, etc.",
      "T+4:00 - At this point time becomes of no concern. I walk around the street with my dogs and feel extreme empathy and understanding towards them. It is as if we are linked. Conversation with some friends at this point is very fun as I can interact with an almost unnoticeable amount of confusion - as we all know other psychedelics that produce such profound effects also seem to profoundly affect communication and thought. 25-I, at moderate-strong dosages seems to leave my sanity and social abilities intact which still rewarding the user with incredible physical/mental euphoria and inexplicably beautiful visuals.",
      "It is yet to be seen what large doses would do to the mental facilities as I have only heard of increasing confusion with the already overwhelming euphoria and visual experience. I spent a few hours listening to music, drinking beer, and talking with friends over cigarettes and cannabis. This psychedelic agrees with cannabis more than any other. It does not illicit the instant intense paranoia that may be precipitated if one smokes, for example, during the peak of a strong LSD trip. It will increase visuals and euphoria but leave the mind in a positive and relaxed state. I'd venture to say this stuff is almost sedating at points - especially with cannabis thrown in. I could sit still and feel my head getting heavy almost like the nod you would get from a strong opiate.",
      "To sum up a long and convoluted, quickly-written report: this is my new favorite psychedelic. After enough intense trips I had sworn off LSD entirely and most research chemicals due to either bad trips or just dirty, crummy physical feelings. This chemical does everything I want and more. A very unexpected surprise that I feel should continue to be explored as safely as possible. I would recommend this to any beginner because of the guaranteed positive, enjoyable, and very entertaining quality of the experience but would also dissuade them because of the relative newness of the molecule and widely varied experiences among individuals/dosages. 2 other friends have used this chemical at similar doses (2 blotters totaling 1.2mg) and at first expressed fright during the come up. I attributed this to them having only experience with LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA but none of the weird electrical energy during a 2C-x come-up. Later they said much of the same - all positive thoughts and euphoric feelings both physically and mentally coupled with amazing visuals and an ease at thinking/socializing with sober individuals.",
      "One last note. The first trip ended pretty abruptly probably due to the amount of benzodiazepines in my circulation and my taking more to purposefully get to sleep once I had satisfied my psychedelic urges. Last night, after a full 9hrs past ingestion and 1hr after ingesting 5mg clonazepam, 3mg buprenorphine, 50mg diphenhydramine, a few beers, a few joints of high-grade west-coast bud (Master Kush and Berry White), and a large meal, I felt tired but was unable to sleep and could still, with barely any focus, experience incredible visual patterning and Escher-esque repetitions. Such beauty.",

      "Morning Glory Seeds (Clarke's Heavenly Blue)",
      "I took five 1.6g sachets of Plantation Products untreated Clarke's Heavenly Blue (8grams of total seeds)  and with my coffee grinder, ground the seeds into a powder. I had a container full of capsules of St. John's Wort that I never used, so I pulled those apart, dispensed the wort and refilled with the ground seeds.",
      "It was tedious, but when I finished, I had about 30 gelcaps filled with ground morning glory seeds and the residue of the St. John's Wort powder that was originally inside them. It's important to mention the St. John's Wort because hyperforin (chemical in the Wort) is a reuptake inhibitor for all kinds of neurotransmitters, and there may have been enough residue in the gelcaps to have had an effect.",
      "At approximately 1245, I began swallowing gelcaps, three at a time, with a chaser of strong ginger ale. (This is just regular commercial ginger ale that I've added a couple grams of ground ginger to.) Getting all those caps down took some time, and a lot of burping.",
      "Effects became noticeable within twenty to thirty minutes. Very much bloated feeling. Lethargic. Tired. A little antsy. Not so much nauseated as just really heavy abdomen. I became aware of a flickering in the periphery of vision. I finished my last gelcap as these early effects were coming on. Yes, it took about half an hour to swallow all those caps.",
      "Not knowing, really, what to expect, and both excited and a little apprehensive  I enjoy both the recreational and also introspective visionary aspects of psychedelics, but I've also heard the stories of terrible vomiting, muscle cramping, bruising, vasoconstriction, and generally undesirable effects  I smiled to myself and just let it come on.",
      "Thirty minutes later and I'd stripped down to my boxers because I couldn't stand any more pressure around my waist. My eyes were beginning to dilate. My right eye for some reason always dilates noticeably more than my left, always. This was starting to feel a lot like the come up of 6-APB.",
      "I let myself fall forward onto my bed, like collapsing into a dream, and the physical euphoria was coming on strong. Any thoughts I had were followed by a tangible echo of that same thought, kind of like how after you throw a rock in a pond the waves ripple out like an echo of that first action. I'd lift the blankets above me, and bring them down, and that physical action followed and repeated itself two or three times. Very much like being extremely inebriated on alcohol and everything spins or moves back and forth repeatedly.",
      "By now tactile sensations were feeling really good. I was swimming on my bed like I do with other serotonergic chemicals. My fingertips on my skin felt like it was someone else touching me and not my own hand.",
      "I was also feeling a little physically distressed. I hadn't had any nausea, per se, no dry heaving or anything like that, but the load had been increasing, and my joints were starting to hurt, especially in my hands. My knuckles were swelling up a little. Strangely, I decided to eat a slice of pizza that had been in my refrigerator. I chewed every mouthful of pizza into a superfine gel  I didn't want to upset my GI system any more, but I did want to nourish my starving body. Soon after eating this slice, the colors around me took on depth and hue, especially greens. (The ginger ale cans around the room were practically glowing like an alien metal.)",
      "At this stage, and I was only about an hour and a half into it, I was feeling mentally stimmed out. My body was under seriously heavy load, though, and physically, tactile sensations were really euphoric. Naturally, I pleasured myself. (It happens.) Explosively. I had filled the bathtub with water for a soak, which I enjoy with most trips. But after I put my feet in the water, the defraction of light from the bathroom window made my feet, when I looked at them submerged in the water, look pallid and graycolorless and corpselike. I got this weird premonition that I'd end up dead if I took that bath. I got out, pulled the plug on the tub, and jumped back into my bed.",
      "I'd been listening to Emerson Lake and Palmer's Tarkus and Van der Graaf Generator's Godbluff. But after a while the music was just too loud, too present, too in my face, and I needed a little silence to collect myself.",
      "But as soon as I turned off the sound system, my ears picked up on the sound of the air blowing through the ductwork, and could still hear the fizzing of escaped carbon dioxide in the several cans of ginger ale strewn about my workstation. The walls were pulsing with bubbles of some transparent energy causing every surface to ripple and melt. Fractal patterns became very obvious.",
      "At this point I was coming up strong and with a fear of how powerful this was going to get I found myself wondering if I'd peaked or if I hadn't even arrived yet and that this trip was a still a long way from over.",
      "I started to connect with BL personalities I've known and others I thought could teach me something. Admittedly, I was a little bit nervous. I wrote to my pal fools gold, and just about shared my name, just in case something really bad happened, but held on to reason enough to resist that impulse. (Anonymity is too important.)",
      "I could hardly type. I could hardly keep myself focused on the screen. I was correcting typos left and right. I sent a message to jesusgreen, who, in my opinion, is a genuine philosopher, sharing that this morning glory experience was redefining what bodyload meant to me, sharing with him that I was trembling like a Parkinson's victim. I decided to watch my copy of Moonrise Kingdom, which I hadn't seen yet, and this movie has since topped my list of favorites, along with American Beauty, Donnie Darko, and a few others. I sent a message to Morninggloryseed, who I had just reached out to for advice I made a few posts in different forums. I shared that I feel like limbs could fall off. He suggested I listen to a particular Bwiti initiation music from Gabon for Iboga shamanic journeying.",
      "I stopped the movie and listened. I noticed the animals who share my home reacted quite energetically to the music. They seemed slightly afraid, and I immediately responded by calming them. This action helped me relax, and sure enough, I felt good again. I connected with what I'm going to call an animal spirit that is present in this home. I feel that my daughter has a dog totem, but I have always had a strong affinity for felines. I became aware that I am very animalistic, and this interferes with my theological direction. That is a conundrum to solve another day. Right now it seems like I'm trying to walk a path perpendicular to my nature.",
      "This, to steal from Morninggloryseed, ended the Mental Stage, and I was about to proceed into the Visionary Stage. One particular fractal pattern overlay everything I saw, eyes open, eyes closed. In fact it got to the point where I thought some kinetic energy had rearranged certain low-mass objects throughout my house to form the same fractal pattern (the dog hair on the carpets, for example).",
      "Four hours later, and a meal of bread, cheese, and cottage cheese, after having finally finished Moonrise Kingdom (again, fantastic movie), I found myself going outside for frequent tobacco breaks. I was in a situation where the fractal patterning was apparent everywhere I looked. I wondered if it would be permanently etched to the back of my eyelids. I wasn't scared of that. I am a poor illustrator, but I attempted to draw the fractal shapes that I saw. I mentioned to Morninggloryseed that the concept I drew was...this shape, and it was readily apparent that it goes on outward for infinity.",
      "But when I looks into the center, which at first appeared to be an empty white square, or rectangle, or triangle, or whatever polygon it was, then, if I let myself understand that it is inward that infinity goes and not outward and that to look into it is to look into myself... That is the lesson I learned. I'll ponder it further, especially after this coming weekend when I enjoy 450ug of AL-LAD I have acquired.",
      "All in all, I have to share that this has been a worthwhile experience. I won't be doing this again for a long time, though. The bodyload is so very taxing, but this next day, I have no hangover. I'm not depressed by any means. But I don't have the motivation to do anything but think about yesterday's events.",
      "Enjoy the report, friends."

Now, it went from being completely unheard of to one of the most popular party substances, and myself, the casual observer, should note some effects on dosage, as Ive witnessed massive overdoses that turned out fine and normal doses that went whack.",

      "We had gathered at Kyle's house, after leaving Kelly's house, nearly 1:00 am. Jon was still going on about his new 'legal' mushrooms, as he had been for the past few hours. Eventually, Kyle started to get interested in trying them, and urged me to try them with him.",
      "I had no reasons to be skeptical of these interesting little mushroom caps, so I took the first dosage Jon gave us (3 caps of roughly 1g each), and ground it up in a grinder, then mixed the little crumbs with some peanut butter. It tasted a little bad, but not intolerable.",
      "After sitting around for about 10 minutes, Kyle appeared to be getting antsy, and wanted more for a sure, full on trip. He ground us another 3g each, and we made it into a little game by competing to find who could eat the pile of ground up mushroom first. We pinched a bit, and chewed. It tasted really dry and gross, but we chased it with lemonade.",
      "Kyle still wasn't satisfied (although our initial consumption had been only 30 min before), and he wanted to straight shot it, by just mixing another 2g each in water. This concoction tasted awfully peculiar. I didn't mind it, but I didn't care for it either. (Note: after regular usage of a fair amount of Amanitas in this form, separataed by about 4 days each in concurrence with one another, it slowly started becoming more intolerable, to the point that the mere sight of a mushroom-water mix makes me sick to my stomach.)",
      "I sat down in Kyle's black leatherman, and zoned out to the music. I was a little dissapointed with the effects. I felt good, but it wasn't anything too different than a Cannabis high (which we had been consistently smoking at various times). The room was dimly lit from Kyle's kitchen table chandelier. I listened to the music, and stared intently at the visualizer on Kyle's computer. I watched the same patterns I had always seen on any given visualizer, not seeing anything unordinary or exciting.",
      "I had been staring at that uncaptivating visualizer for 20 min before I realized I was staring. I shook my head, and looked around the room.",
      "'Gasp!' ZANG! 'Whoah...'    Anybody who's tripped before, can testify that those three words are exactly what goes on the second you realize you're tripping.",
      "The room had been vitalized. Everything pulsed with its own energy and significance. Everything was...new. This lead Kyle and I to explode into a an excited frenzy of exploring his captivating apartment. I looked a roll of paper towels, with cartoonish looking cats on them. I remarked that the paper towels were 'weird,' which confused a sober member of the group. He asked me what it looked like, thinking I was seeing it change shape or something that one would expect from LSD(which I have never experienced). I replied that they look like paper towels, but they just had a 'weird' aura, like the 'same kind of weirdness surrounding hardcore computer geek.' I remarked (no offense). I'm not sure if he got what I was saying. I can remember full well the feelings the paper towels alone conveyed in me.",
      "I turned around, and faced Kyle's entertainment center, which was the anchor for his chain of christmas lights strung along the wall of this room. They appeared to be writhing like a snake. This sight was similar to optical illusions on paper: if you stared hard, it would stop, but if I just casually stared at them weakly, they appeared to writhe along the wall.",
      "I called out to Kyle to come see this. His reaction was misleading at first, as he stared at the lights encompassing the room: hm. that's great. they're moving!",
      "This startled me, that he was seeing the same thing I was. It was a weird mental experience, to know that he felt and was experiencing the same sensations I was with this drug.",
      "The rest of the night was spent appraising every object in eyesight, as everything had its own 'feeling' that it emitted. These 'feelings' weren't our run-of-the-mill emotions. I'm talking about new and uplifting, and fully unique 'feelings' were emitted from each object.",
      "I woke to Kyle getting ready for work, with Jon asleep on the floor. Apparently, I had only been asleep for 3.5 hours. When I got up and walked home, I felt at peace.",
      "Those poisonous little mushrooms had changed me. I saw the world a little differently that day, as everything seemed to work in harmony with everything. I was no longer the center of my own universe. I was no longer the main component of my own life. I seemed to play a mere roll, and the energy of the world took over, and played its part in my life concurrently with the rest of time and space.",
      "I got inside my house, dropped all my things, and began laughing hysterically. I didn't know why, and immediately afer realizing I was laughing (which seemed to eminate from nothing, and lasted a solid 2 or 3 min), I stopped abruptly. I gathered my things, and went to bed for the first time in what was at this point 67 hours. My dreams comforted me, and I continued on with my life after waking up."

I had been told that this kind of X was very stong and knowing that brought on a little apprehension but more curiosity than anything. But the thing was that that night I was short on cash, so being at a rave and all meant water cost an arm and a leg and I was dead broke after E and the door fee. This also brought on a sort of eerie feeling knowing that the only reported deaths on E were from over dehydration and heat exhaustion.",
      "I took the small red triangular shaped pill at about 9:30pm, feeling the euphoric effects about 30 minutes later. It was pretty much the same as before except I was only 5 minutes into the trip and already feeling the effects stronger that the peak of the pill I took before. What happend next is very hard to describe but I'll try my best. All of a sudden I noticed my heart was about to beat out of my chest and I found myself drenched in a hot sweat. Soon I found my mind running with intese thoughts that sent me into a panic I could feel throughout my whole body. Kind of a sharp warm feeling that wasn't pleasant at all. I thought if I stopped dancing and sat down it would go away. I was wrong. My mind was totally out of control, so I got up and headed to the bathroom to splash some water on my face. When I got up I felt a sort of extremely drunk sensation as I tried to walk (oh, and I forgot to add that during this whole time I had extreme jitters and I lost the feeling of what I was touching).",
      "But, somehow I made to the bathroom where I splashed water on my face, then I went back to sit down with my friends who had all consumed the same pill and seemed to be having a great time dancing. Soon this panic passed after lots and lots of deep breaths and self talk, and after I felt drained of all energy and plopped down next to a wall. The feelings that followed weren't exactly unpleasant, but I seemed to keep that state throughout the whole night.",
      "I think E is a great drug, but I'm afraid to do it again because of the bad effects it put me through."

About 3 hours in, I was having panic attacks so bad I swear I was going to die (as it turns out, sever paranoia and panic attacks are symptoms of a caffeine OD). I felt sick, my chest felt tight, and it seemed like it was never going to end. 5 hours in, the symptoms where still very strong, at the end of the peak. It was only at about 8 hours in when I had come down to a state of mind where I could clearly think, and I was no longer shaking. However, it took about 13-15 hours before the effects totally ceased. Needless to say, I will never be doing that again. It is not fun."

Recklessly unheeding my own advice until finally  re-experiencing the most unforgettable reminiscences.",

For over 2 years I also worked as a Hospice volunteer, which resulted in numerous nights of 5-8 hour sits with the (Buddhist) dying  those of a fortitude requiring not so much a consoling ear as a brief sharing of one-on-one explorations and atonements, to the extent that that is even possible. The Buddhist group I belong to were NOT happy when without too much difficulty they discovered my infatuation with the Diviners Leaf Nevertheless, I am still scheduled for further Ordination later this year. As I tirelessly explained it is my profound respect for the plant, its meditational gifts and Shamantic introspective that drove me almost weekly into her arms.",

The first 2 proving to be among the most horrific experiences of my life, the very first so outlandishly nightmarish that I still at times pause and find myself wondering how my sleeping hours are not chronically plagued with unrelenting psychotic reminisces.",
      "My other 11 attempts have either been uneventful, purely gravity-driven, or I simply came to with shortness of breath, intense sweating and 90% amnesia. All told I feel I have a real brain-affinity for The Leaf, and find it strange that these amnesiac episodes occurred with smaller extract amounts, and not with the first two that contained Lv5-6 dosages.",

After tortured deliberation I was willing to once again throw myself at her feet in the hopes of finally having a spiritually experience- and though never expecting profound at least a moderately pleasant one. I felt from my first two voyages I had more than deserved at least that. I had more than paid my dues.",

She was to answer my prayers - in a rather sardonic manner at first  for it seemed in retrospect she still believed I had some humility to acquire in accessing her kingdom. We may all, in the course of our lives, eventually get what we wish for but with Salvia as you will very soon see it is hardly ever the way you expect it, and in most cases probably deserve.",

      "I did not have the extravagance of the Zen Hermitage his time out, and my faithful Buddhist friend and sitter Richard is in NY doing botany research. So I chose my mothers cold, dark, stone-layered basement, creepy as hell but nonetheless an ideal place - I had spent almost every day of my late adolescence bodybuilding among my fathers scattered tools and massive workbenches so for me it was a very familiar and comfortable setting. It also served as my old music studio during the mid-late 80s where I did most of my Goth/Industrial soundwork so for all intensive purposes the place was like my second home.",
      "Reassessing my dosages from my first attempt months back, I would start with 4 droppers of Emerald Essence tincture, this time once again undiluted. Burns like a mother, but I just cannot be bothered with the hot water measuring, dual eyedroppers, etc. etc. Its all I can do to try to hold the shit in my mouth, smoke, and get the whole rest of the process somewhat accurate while all the time dealing with the ever-present extreme nervous tension. I would follow this by (hopefully) clearing an entire 0.2 gm cone of 10x in one try through my favorite ice-twist bong on top of a half-leaf of Hawaiian Premium. I knew a second attempted hit after this would be extremely doubtful, but just in case, I always had my wooden 2-chambered pipe as a backup and some extract, although what I packed here should be PLENTY and I had no real intention at the time of using anything more the first attempt out. Richard would say I was more than ready. I couldnt wait to call him when this little adventure was over as long as it went as planned.",
      "So I would have an entire morning until late afternoon totally alone in my mother's shadowy basement, where not only did she live alone, but was visiting my Aunt who lived over an hours drive away. It was 9:00am, the basement was practically soundproof  and the neighborhood quiet. All in the nearby vicinity were either at work, in school or just gone. Perfect.",
      "Lacking the luxury of Richard-The-Worriers presence with me this time out, I reached into my trusty salvia-knapsack and pull out the Home Depot bag where my new sitter lie patiently waiting: 75 feet of newly purchased 3ml.thick yellow plastic rope.",
      "I would wrap myself securely around the steel main beam in the basements center  consecutively looping the rope around twice and then tying 5 loose knots continuously until I reached the end. Id make the rope loose enough so that I could sit somewhat comfortably in a half-lotus position  even on a cement floor, but secure enough where I was going NOWHERE fast except to be able to swivel around to reach my knapsack if needed. With the poor lighting down here this tedious process would take a good 10 minutes at least to undo in a lucid state never mind in a churning, salvia mind-swirl, and that way in case I happened to completely freak out and TRIED to untie myself the experience would be over long before I managed to break free and create rambunctious havoc roaming around my mothers house. Doubtlessly totally unnecessary, as I figured I'd probably be close to comatose anyway.",
      "This time I also decided to once again wear only my black Zen robe and sit on a thick throw cushion I happened across in an upstairs bedroom folded up snug against the mainbeam. Did I actually think utilizing religious overtones and gowning up would have made a difference?",
      "Finally situated and comfortably sitting in place I went through the usual tincture-torture, bringing along my little timer to count off 4 minutes before swallowing. And so with only a 100 watt fluorescent bulb far behind me as the only external light source I hit the torch, whose dim glow dances at the walls with an almost conjuring effect, the immanent, beckoning realm at once and always frightening and exhilarating .",
      "My hand-my whole fucking arm- is quivering, and it's like this every single time with no exceptions - all week long I've anticipated the moment -then upon its arrival I open the torch and hold the flame right at the cone and I hesitate DAMN if this isn't the one drug that always scares the living shit outta me every time we meet. This is the one given that will never change.",
      "Brief visions of carneys and clowns and rusted old rides",
      "I always hated carnivals. As a child I found them somewhat foreboding, and clowns always conferred a sense of dread. Amusement parks and their ilk have a distinctive, depressive aura all their own, always seemingly aged and dirt-ridden. For me they are the landscapes of sadness and vanished reverie. Ive long associated the thought of carneys with Loss.",
      "And here I am: looking over and down at another dreaded Ferris wheel, but within the confines of a rollercoaster approaching its end accent.",
      "The coaster is packed full, my fellow passengers collectively silent and sitting stoically upright, with none of the usual hand waving or hoops of excitement. All are faceless, in that they have faces but no features whatsoever, just empty canvases of blank flesh.",
      "All are wearing the exact same fleeting, long grey gauze sheeting that rips through the air, billowing upward and back as if I'm riding the ripples of some darkened cloud on a midnight sky - and yet there is no wind or even a light breeze of any type. The air is dead. In fact there is no sound whatsoever except the creaking of the coasters wheels wheezing upward although the park below is packed full and vibrant.",
      "I look at the passenger next to me, who is in turn looking at me silently and without expression like she is expecting me to say something. I say she as it has breasts plainly visible beneath the gauze. The coaster slows at the very top, and I am now hesitant, never having enjoyed coasters all that much and - more importantly  right now I am still conscious of being under salvias influence and in turn know this will be anything but your run-of the-mill rollercoaster descent.",
      "As the coaster starts to slow I notice my feet, legs, and hands have started to liquefy into the cracked vinyl fabric of the seat. I am TURNING INTO THE COASTER and instead of briefly halting at the very top it continues upward, smoothly and completely disengaging itself from the track and rising on into space. I look around - forgetting all about salvia as this is so real and look to my partner for aid but she is silent, her attention now fully forward.",
      "I open my mouth to scream as the coaster suddenly tips and accelerates then flips straight back, completing a counterclockwise circle where I am seized fast to the seat but my mouth and lower jar are held back, elongating my eyes and face, thinning me out like stretched taffy as my whole face cant keep up with the rest of my body as it flips and plummets straight downward. From all around me there is now the muffled chorus of a thousand singing Ooohs and aahhhs. The last thing I am aware of is the Ferris wheels deep, repetitive laughter as I smash below into a thousand pieces of disembodied consciousness and all is a sheet of white.",
      "GREETINGS FROM OLD MEXICO",
      "Im staring straight into an expansive sky of white porcelain. Naked, and stumbling forward in the middle of a jungle road  deep grey piney knots of gnarled foliage to either side of me and its all so very familiar. The overgrowth so thick I couldnt venture past a foot of it without ripping myself open on bent, sharpened branches poking out like grey ribs. Its like this all over the Yucatan jungles.",
      "Then it hits me. Our last 2 summers family vacations. The road Im on heads towards the Mayan ruins of Tulum. And suddenly Im surrounded by people, thongs of people everywhere, a materialized column of thousands sauntering and stumbling forward and past me in this blistering heat with seemingly grim determination. Most are fanning themselves with what looks like large rolled up leaves.",
      "In their resolve they hardly give Mr. Naked a glance.",
      "I look around. Its gotta be at least 11:00 and I am pouring sweat but my attention is momentarily riveted to the trees on either side of me. There is a distinct sense of someone, a Presence distinct from the others, of something IN there. Something in the trees studying me, and its more than an uncomfortable feeling. What the fu..?",
      "Kids have gathered all around me  grabbing my hands and pulling me forward. Unlike many of the others theyre running all around with animated enthusiasm. A few point at my crotch and giggle. Rather than embarrassment I dont give this a second thought, my only objective trying to keep up with them but this HEAT is sapping my energy! Im exhausted like I was walking in this oven for days on end.",
      "Vamanos Papa! , two little Mexican boys laugh good naturedly.",
      "PAPA???",
      "Ven! Ven aca Hombre!",
      "Two ancient women, squat and dressed entirely in black rush up and accost me, pushing the kids aside, grabbing my arms from each side and propelling me forward with surprising strength as we are literally soaring vertically inches off the ground past the innumerable single couples, tour groups and packs of solitary native children. And there are 'Others' cartoon-like figures resembling huge, plastic parade floats hovering flaccidly or bobbing up and down, heads above the rest of this moving wall of humanity, grinning stupidly at me as I fly by. Amongst the many packs of children they remind me of dejected dolls being tossed about in the air before discarded to some dusty playrooms corner.",
      "One character with a head like a carrot and dressed in a long yellow tailcoat with an oversized bowler hat stops as I pass by, tips his hat to me while bowing from the waist to the very ground. Upon raising he replaces the hat with an exaggerated, dandied flourish and points past me, redirecting my attention to whatever the collective goal is that lies ahead.",
      "And then SHE appeared from beyond the imposingly thick tree-line. Vast and ancient, in only a tattered green-gold shawl, she is androgynous with skin glistening black as night. Arms pressed tightly to her sides her hands are empty and bent arthritically upward at the wrists, resembling long talons curling into half circles. Her hair was set straight up into a broad, twisting coiffure. And with her head thrown back she stares down over the crowed, scanning them like some inpatient Goddess. Regal and omnipotent among her minions, she looked like a midnight, polarized version of Queen Neffertiti. She was well over 8 feet tall yet so stick thin she couldnt have weighed more than 90 lbs, but this woman, this creature, could easily rend me to shreds and hand the strips back piecemeal. I must be out of my fucking mind, not being able to tear my eyes from her. To say she was a vision of abject fright would be the ultimate understatement, although she stood stock still in a totally non-threatening manner. She seemed almost bored as she perused the crowd, not bothering to give me even a cursory glance.",
      "We have reached a clearing, my two guides immaterializing from my side, which causes me to drop unceremoniously to the ground in the center of a large tree-studded clearing. If there is any further doubt as to where I am it disappears as I rise and am once again facing the pyramid ruins of Chichan-itza.",
      "Chichan-Itza...",
      "No way am I getting near that again. Never having ever suffered vertigo in my life until last summer as when I climbed to the top. I was overwhelmed by a mental terror I never dreamed experiencing. Luckily there was a fist-thick man-made rope on its eastern side for the benefit of petrified tourists like myself. I went down all 91 steps sliding on my ass and thanking Buddha for delivering me to solid ground, my bones and brain spared a likely flesh-crushing tumble down the awkward, crumbling 10 high stone steps, snowballing all that would have lain in my path.",
      "Looking around and straight ahead, I had to keep reminding myself I was on a drug. And salvia or no salvia, Chichan-itza lies before me once again. So damned real and overwhelming that after awhile reminding myself of anything was making no difference whatsoever, threatening me once again with its prehistoric, colossal height. Timeless and inviting.",
      "No fucking way.",
      "Stopping RIGHT HERE and whatever happens, happens!",
      "The crowd has now converged, and we are encircled by what must be a thousand separate black-cloaked antediluvian beings, both male and female and all chanting the same mantra that resembles the TM Om intonation but in this case sounds more like a guttural version of Weeee. Chorused in grand unison in a cadence so low it makes the very Earth rumble. If I ever witnessed the physical definition of crowd-induced Ritual, this is it.",
      "And SHE has returned, this harsh Queen oblivious somehow to all eyes but mine, and this time she stares and points directly at me, her face a mask of loath impatience. The Weees are growing in volume and now the entire crowd has joined in synch. All are standing stock-still in place as the Queen advances toward me with hardened, dour resolve, muttering something with machine-gun rapidity, her outstretched right arm rising toward the sky, toward the top of the pyramid. Her animated rant feels like a spell, becomes more guttural, from deep within until it rises to a wailed screech, and now shes no longer just pointing but jabbing, stabbing her finger simultaneously at me and the Pyramids summit while flying towards me.  I am overwhelmed, personalizing her as the embodiment of every daunting, wrathful incarnation I have ever feared.",
      "As shes almost on me all I can do is supplicate and fall to my knees in cowed dread, hoping against hope that she has some inkling of the age-old custom of Mercy. I huddled myself as best I could into a ball and covered my head exactly like some terrified child who at night thinks if they keep the blanket pulled up over their heads the Boogeyman will remain at bay. Not since my first salvia trip have I been so shitlessly petrified.",
      "MEET YOU INMOROCCO?",
      "Ah Booleh Booleh! Ah Booleh Booleh!",
      "Peeking upward She is now nowhere in sight but WHAT.",
      "This loud, piercing gibberish is accompanied by a succession of sharp, searing pains in my left ear, which feels wet and burns with heat. Looking up I find myself staring directly into the face of a butt ugly, curd-chewing camel who appraises me with a somewhat curious interest. And sitting high on the camel is what looks like a Tuareg nomad, swaddled from head to toe entirely in blue robes, with only sun-blackened forearms and creased face exposed. He peers upon my naked form, and leaning down starts furiously hitting at me with a long wooden switch on my face and head. Raising my arm against the glaring sky and frontal assault only seems to infuriate him all the more. He keeps switching at my head... looking up and struggling to escape I can only move slow-motion through deepening sand that sucks at my feet.",
      "Ah Booleh Booleh! Ah Booleh Boo!",
      "He is now screaming and I don't have time to think past 'WTF' as I notice I am directly in front of a large, dome-like structure of comparable size but looks more like a gargantuan stone egg than a Pyramid -for Chican-itza is nowhere in sight and the only people about are a small group of the bobbing, cartoon-characters from my earlier road pilgrimage (including other versions of my carrot friend in the bowler hat) that seem to be working in twos  or should I say slaving - on the Egg carrying stone blocks around its base. Theres the distinct sound of gnashing gears although there is no machinery of any type anywhere.",
      "All stop and drop their loads when they hear my Buddy-on-High screaming. Collectively they start jumping up and down, giggle and point, which only infuriates the Tuareg further who rises up to a standing position from the now bored camel and raises both arms toward the heavens and screaming I-dont-know-what before wailing on me with renewed vigor. I must have done SOMETHING to piss this guy off but what I havent a clue - but what is far worse than that is that as I go to speak it hits me that I cant remember who the hell 'I' am. Remembering Chichan-itza and The Queen I nonetheless cant connect with Jonathan. I had no name and no conception of what tripping was or what had happened to cause this, but am now only connected somehow with my being an (?American) (with no money) (and no clothes!) and no idea HOW I arrived in this increasingly unnerving situation.",
      "Asshole persists with the switch screaming this Booleh-Booleh shit and all I do is stand there like a frightened idiot as now a small cluster of about five or six other riders in turn are approaching from my left, waiving, shouting and gesturing at the infidel who upset their companion so. Not looking good at all. Having always obsessed on visiting Northern Africa, Caro, the Sphinx and great Pyramids of Giza, this was not exactly how I envisioned my longed-for pilgrimages.",
      "I feel another hot wave across my skin as I start to run toward the stone egg structure. A futile endeavor. Where the hell do I think Im going! Im looking for, what?...refuge?",
      "The other Tuaregs had met up with my tormentor and all are now playing their own desert version of Cat & Mouse, riding to either side of me while cross-crossing my path - their camels closing in as they direct my course of escape while continually kicking at me as I stumbled pointlessly forward. I have never felt such heat in my entire life, sweating so much Im sure if my luck holds out Ill melt into nothing before my tormentors grow bored and think up some new game at my expense. Each step sinking deeper into sand that looks more fluorescent than golden brown, like running in a dream where the faster you go the less headway you seem to make.",
      "The sudden absence of nomadic laughter coincides with the grounds starting to violently tremble as I fall over. The old boys behind me must have halted to observe the Eggs center - now abruptly starting to shine and throb along its vertical axis revealing itself not as a stone structure but more a pulsing, wet grey wound.",
      "Salvia",
      "Jonathan",
      "Both tying in to the now burgeoning comprehension of my coming down from salvias peak, for just as quickly as it all started everything collapsed in a sudden halt, an abrupt awakening from my self-induced transitory flight.",
      "The grey plasma-like Monolith in turn reveals itself to be in fact just the protruding stone wall of my mothers basement as the old boys behind me have indeed disappeared, replaced once again by my awe-inspiring Cancun Queen - the last thing standing directly between myself and mornings lucidity - no longer threatening but seemingly radiant with matronly understanding and a look now of empty, profound sadness. I had felt a strong presence once before, but this was the first physical manifestation of a being that seemed somehow to be the key presence in these absurd realms.",
      "And rather than relief my mind wells with emptiness finally grasping the obvious. I suddenly feel so stupid, like I should have some life-affirming question at the ready for this rapidly fading representation before me which was simply my own subconscious rendering of the human condition in the Face of the Infinite... Lady Salvia.",
      "WAIT! the scream in my head comes out as incoherent, mumbled garbage.",
      "My eyes explode with red floaters, my blood pressure must be sky high and I think Im about to pass out, so afraid that if I take the second to squeeze my eyes close for relief when I release them she will be long gone.",
      "And then worse than any faded withdrawal  she purposely just turned away, as if I was not worthy of whatever it was I was meant to confirm or understand from the very beginning.",
      "And along with her broken, ephemeral image  along with all that I had just recalled in moderately vivid detail - I knew there was so much morebut whatever these other images would have been were all fleeting at best, and I should be happy with what I had, as within 10 minutes I might not even have that.",
      "WITH REGARDS TO SECOND CHANCES",
      "Im slumped over staring into the cellar floor, robe wide open, stomach and left hand sticky with saliva and tincture slime, made worse by the fact that it is now quite cold down here, and I realize that I have drifted off either to sleep or just passed out. Two minutes? Two hours? I cant even make out the timer thats just a yard away and in my present mental state for all I know it could even be evening by now.",
      "And pain. A lot of pain and thats a first! Man do I feel like shit",
      "My left ear is burning something fierce, and reaching up my fingers come away dark and wet. I must have wrenched down hard on my two loop earrings and now theres only one, the other probably somewhere at my feet.  Nice. Good going.",
      "There are also dull tingly pains all around my upper chest and sides. Putting that plastic rope around my semi-bare midsection was a real dumbass idea as Im sure to develop a nice set of rope burns which will turn into real nice welts and I cant begin to imagine how I will somehow explain it all to my wife when she sees this mess. I must have jerked around something fierce.",
      "Im growing more and more disheartened as Im once again seemingly unable to break into anything mystical or exceptionally positive although I feel in my heart that some closing brink is so, so within reach.",
      "Brink to what? (I try not to ask myself) What the hell am I talking about?",
      "Reality check: Half naked. Filthy, pissed off and in pain.",
      "Unpleasant.",
      "Im about to call it a day, unwrap myself and leave disgusted when I turn and spy the fresh backup pipe right behind me, packed tight and ready for firing. I had to go it again AND NOW, in haste and with no breaks before I changed my mind or the habitual coward in me will out. I foolishly thought that if lucky I might possibly end up back to exactly where I left off . Before reason takes hold I put the pipe on my lap, reach over to the tincture bottle on its side and quickly squirt 2 (? 3 the bottle was near empty) droppers-full into my mouth.",
      "I squint into the bowl as I mentally with minimal success attempt to tick off 5 minutes in my head before squeezing my eyes tight against the gag reflex and swallowing the tincture at the same time clicking the torch-lighter. And the familiar arises, telling myself to exhale but the lungs arent listening until I almost choke through the exhale. And as I try to catch my breath the familiar increasingly loud ear humming and immediate sweating starts. Never in my life would I ever have believed the body could sweat in such an instantaneous manner before experiencing salvia. It is just so uncanny.",
      "I could now give a shit. This new ringing in my ears is so ever pleasant, so womblike. It lends me a feeling of such complacency that Im no longer worried as I usually get that its my blood pressure rushing to an exceedingly dangerous point.",
      "Not even considering it all strange that there was now a grotesquely fat elderly man playing a childs toy piano in the far right-hand corner by the stairwell, his obesity matched only by his excessively long, accentuated neck. I found it far stranger that there were no sounds emanating from the little piano considering that the notes were plainly visible rising from its keys.",
      "This fat Giraffe-man is singing. I guess youd call it singing but its more like a drawn out, softly pensive lament.",
      "aaahhhh Looooo Loooooaaahhhh Looooo.",
      "HEY! Yes you! Who the hell let you in here!",
      "I catch myself  maybe he is a guest who is staying over. I dont want to anger the guy or worse hurt his feelings and suddenly hate myself for swearing at him. I can be such an asshole, Damnit.",
      "HEY! Did you come for Mary? Are you a friend of my moms?",
      "I feel really bad that I keep yelling but this swooshing rush in my ears is growing louder by the minute and my long string of frustrated shouts continued unanswered and ignored. He just keeps up this weeping, wailing cry-song and weaving his head back and forth.",
      "And then THEY appeared",
      "THE SALVIA LAUNCH LIKE NO OTHER",
      "There were four of them.",
      "Aaaaaahhhh RINK! a dink a dink... a rink a dink... a dink a doooooo",
      "Ohhhh RINK!... a rink-a-dink. a dinka doooo...",
      "The facing wall came alive with an emerging, pale white spotlight illuminating a string of 'dancers' standing dead still until bursting out in unison with that ridiculous Jimmy Durant jingle. Their ludicrous choiring seemed to rise up and engulf my mind, churning my thoughts and growing so loud I threw both palms over my ears but their siren whaling only grew to a pitch so volumous I feared my head would explode.",
      "They were lined up in flawless unison, not like four dancers would line up as one in perfect sync, but more like those scissor and paper cut-out dolls kids make, all accordioned out in the exact same manner as their mirrored counterpart. They sported black-tailed dinner jackets with matching stovetop hats and white gloves and shirts with sharpened collars. Each swung walking sticks as they tapped back and forth and side to side - inching their way slowly toward my tied up prostrated form. They would have looked like four comical versions of 'Mr.Peanut' except none had features, only blackness between hat and collar, in fact anything that would have registered as human flesh took on a deeper hue than invisibility, as I could not see the cement wall behind them through there empty 'faces'.",
      "As they closed in they stopped singing and started collectively humming the same aaahhhh Loooo, aaahhhh Looooo exactly like my mothers fat guest in the corner but who was now nowhere in sight.",
      "Comical Stupid utterly Ludicrous...",
      "Words I said out loud to reassure myself were empty, for there was something malevolently unnerving about them. Their leisurely, unhurried approach promised nothing rewarding in the least. All I could think of was I had landed in the middle of some black cabaret - a burlesque act right out of a Joel-Peter Witkin photography nightmare.",
      "And then I was suddenly jarred and bounced upward right from were I was sitting, literally straight up off the whole cushion and a soft voice mellowed in my ear from the left but came across like a loud scream.",
      "HEEEYYYYY. LOOK . AT..eeeeYOOUUUU.....",
      "In the floor at my side, head thrown back and half beneath the surface with only its throat exposed lies an upper torso and two arms that lean back from the elbows in a reclining position, securing my sitting frame with two propped knees bent and supporting my body firm to its center. Materializing upward the face stretched forth and took on the hue of the concrete, as if it were emerging straight up from the grey flooring looking exactly like a face would if it were pressed flat into a stretched balloon.",
      "Rising, it was naked and nondescript, save for sagged breasts over lean, emaciated ribs and eyes that when opened stared blankly not with pupils but with darker, pooled grey centers neither benevolent nor threatening. And it shined like it was wet. A statuesque, gaunt manikin, come to life rising up from directly below the cellars surface.",
      "With neither knees nor arm movement she  this phantasm - started to 'bounce' me up and down on her lap, not violently with the intention of discharging me off and onto the floor - just a simple but steady rhythmic up and down, like a parent might 'roughly' tease and bounce a child in play.",
      "And then she reached up and around, grabbing the right side of my forehead and back of my neck and gently but with surprising force tugged downward while inching upward, her lips brushing against my left ear as I started to bend over at a physically impossible, sideward angle. In laws of normal physics my hip joints from either side should have snapped as I descended ever downward. Pulling her face up to reach my bent left ear and not externally but from the very center of my subconscious came the softest voice  so unlike the face it originated from  whisper/screaming in my ear but feeling more from my minds center:",
      "'DOOOOOONT BE AFRAID THIS WONT HURT A BIT...'",
      "Then the tap-dancers were upon me",
      "Upon me and INSIDE me, all four with their gloved hands exploring my face and hair  at first rubbing vigorously in swirling motion and then using their fingers to probe into my face, eyes, nose and mouth. The room started to vortex inward as I could no longer see clearly or in any way grasp my bearings, their voices now steadily humming louder and louder with fingers from four pairs of hands in turn vibrating inward, past my skins surface to the center of my brain, the very absence of any sense of pain creating an experience all the more horrifying.",
      "I was at the point of being totally bent sideways in half - with my head and upper body now completely encircled - forced into and through the flesh and bone of my left hip. The rink-a-dinks had desisted from my facial rape, replaced now with 'her' working my entire head ever inwards. I'd taken the street expression becoming intimate with my own ass to a whole new level. If I had previously  my first time out  experienced the depth of mental hell then this was its physical, mirror equivalent. The very cellar where I had spent over 40 years had now become my own private Hieronymus Boche World.",
      "I was gagging and gurgling, struggling to breath through my nose and all that came out was snorts. I thought my eyes were exploding and starting to run down my face unto the floor while all the time she cooed in the most soothing voice making it all the more appalling. And the very last thing I remember hearing before my entire head melted into my hip, I turned into a literal Human Doughnut, and the world went mercifully black, was her now gentile, calming, almost inaudible whisper",

      "The Butterfly counts not days but moments, and has time enough.",
      "- Zen proverb",
      "And with no memory whatsoever:",
      "Im centered in some immense antechamber, a darkened hallway where each of the walls support great, oval portraits, each with its own set of candles on either side that offer the only source of illumination. Expanding out endlessly as far as my eye could see, each portrait is identical, covered over completely in black curtains, the only sound a soft rippling, similar to a breeze passing through plastic tarpaulin.",
      "A vast museum of infinite ambiguity.",
      "The endless hall is filled with hundreds of small children quietly sitting at small kindergarten-type desks silently intent on some kind of test before them. I too am squeezed tightly into a tiny seat constructed for someone 1/3 my stature. Glancing down my entire body is enwrapped, clothed only in white sheeting. Held fast, it never crosses my mind that I should be in any way apprehensive, only that I need to get up and proceed down into that vast corridor and quickly",
      "PEPOTA!, my voice a booming echo though no one seems to notice or care, my cry only adding to the accentuated silence",
      "She was our live-in maid from very early childhood, when I lived in Northern Spain up until the age of seven. She who was as close to the family as if she was a blood relative and practically a second mother to me, someone whos loving memory hasnt passed through my mind in well over? Why would that name blurt out suddenly after all these years?",

      "HOLA NINO!",
      "HOLA SENORA ROSARIA! I yell back and attempt to waive but cannot.",
      "I know this woman, who has suddenly appeared across the squared, inner courtyard and is hanging wash from her opened kitchen window. The entire apartment alcove is suddenly alive with animated conversations as more and more women have appeared, likewise hanging wash, or simply hanging out their respective windows, elbows rested on ledges in anticipation to long mid-morning bouts of gossip.",
      "I go to waive again at Rosaria, not giving where I am a second thought but can only swivel my head as my hand and arm seem fixed in a forward leaning position. I am held fast, and looking down see nothing but the courtyards three story drop.",
      "From what I could tell I was part of the window ledge, but crazy as it sounds - and completely unaware of being under a drugs influence - the memorable, nostalgic sights around me kept any and all feelings of terror and panic well at bay. For I was momentarily stunned at my minds sudden clarity to these surroundings and unable to fully believe I could actually be back where I have once again found myself in Spain.",
      "My childhood Spain as it was  over 40 years earlier.",
      "'Here you go sweetie'",

      "So very young.",
      "And I am invisible to them. So frozen in shock and disbelief I can only observe, not daring to cry out or interrupt in any way in case this moment is broken, feeling waves of sentiment long buried in a far distant past long forgotten by years of selfish misunderstandings and veiled remorse.",
      "And then...'I' entered...",
      "I am watching an exact replica of myself at about age 5 enter the room from the corner entryway: Everything was exactly as I had known it probably 40-plus years hence! I am mesmerized. Actually WATCHING MYSELF AS A CHILD move through this slice of pre-adolescent life-at-a-glace.",
      "'Myself' moves towards my father's small table and is swept up into his arms, head buried in his shoulder. I am able to sense his lined face as it nuzzles my neck and I laugh into his collar. The look on my fathers face stops me dead. I feel so hot I could pass out. The moment is at once heart rendering and totally implausible.",
      "'I' then ran from the room, and I was tormented at my inability to follow myself and stay, mesmerized by my mother and fathers now youthful features. For all I had for memories up until this point (when I rarely cared to rouse them at all) was his pain-wracked body dying for two long months in a hospital ward, waiting in coma's embrace for the bone cancer to finally take him. I wanted to grab hold of this kid (myself!), warn him of his immanent future before it was once again too late, to make alternative decisions - to speak those words never spoken.",
      "DAMMIT I never wanted to leave. I no longer cared HOW or WHY or HOW LONG or WHAT any of this was or when I would wake up but my tenuous desperation at grasping the moment was more painful than having to suffer any past physical agony and less painful than my inability to move and participate in these evolved proceedings.",
      "DAD! MA! My call is thousands of miles away as he just went back to his paper, accompanied by my mothers hum at the dishwashing shed started. The womens voices outside made me turn and I closed my eyes, squeezing them shut so tight thinking for some reason that if I kept them closed the moment would prove eternal.",
      "Fade out...",
      "When I opened then I was in a spinning vortex of jumbled thoughts - no longer in Spain but I had no time for lament. I witnessed snippets of a history gone forever, fresh and vibrant as they ragged past me: My father golfing with me by his side -tired and uninterested yet happy just to be his son and included in his treasured pastime.",
      "My Father: valid memories started hastening by at a speed comparable to a rapidly shuffling deck of cards, so many at once and at such a rapid onslaught I couldnt even stop any longer to.",
      "'HOWS MY LITTLE MAN!'",
      "Now it was my Grandfather shouting down at me. That loud, bellowing voice behind his massive jowls broken into smiles as he patted my head so hard I saw stars. I could have cried. It was the one solid hero of my boyhood. My best friend, My 'Grampie' and before THIS were just memories of months of his Alzheimers malicious descent. 'My Little Man', his favorite pet name and one I adored. I haven't had the heart to utter those words aloud in later years as the pain was too great. Better (I thought) to let it stay buried, as what I refused to acknowledged might never come back to hurt me.",
      "Looking around and NOW I was once again sitting at some kids birthday party (?mine) at Hickory Lodge, a place and time where once there were countless adult males all around, were childhood life was for me what it is in storybooks -innocent and joyous, with no lack of affection and guidance. I am now the last immediate remaining 'elder, late 40's but with no males in my family older than myself.",
      "Fading...fading.... my ear was burning and I looked around there must be 50 people in this room all talking to me at once. Im trying to see but everything is growing hazy and my mind is unclear. I see a floor and walls and so, so many people, people who are now leaving in droves and I hear 'Chose to stay' somewhere What the fuck is that and where is Grampie. Where is Dad.",
      "'DAD!'",
      "Not me...",
      "There are 2 very small boys sitting huddled up to each other in the corner of some basement I am in, looking anxious and afraid. They dont say anything else but I can tell they want me to come with them and I feel hurt and sad and alarmed that they will now disappear for I know somehow that they are my own sons but I WANT TO STAY! I WANT WHAT HAS GONE FAR PAST. 'Grampie!!!' was all I responded, the scream in my head answered with only their hurt stares.",
      "Dad I am so sorry for not being the son I could have been. Too late. Too late. I want to stay.",
      "Fade in",
      "And OVER.",
      "I WOULD MAKE A MOST INEPT CRIMINAL",
      "Wanting nothing more than to just bolt home I spent all of maybe 30 minutes cleaning up after myself with such mechanical incompetence that I would definitely have to go over every inch of this house again early tomorrow before my mothers return. So muddled, saddened and confused I must have left enough evidence to my being here I wouldnt make it past her most superficial scrutiny. Everything seemed in place.",
      "I looked over one last time at my mothers house, the house I had grown up in off and on since birth. I thought of the many family ghosts who had so very long ago wandered its quarters  from my uncle who literally built it to the two key male influences who had lived my life, loving me irregardless and hoping to make a difference.",
      "And suddenly Im laughing my ass off, out loud and so hard I cannot stop.",
      "Peace.  And safe journeys to you all."

      "I first learned of LSA many years ago after reading articles about morning glory seeds (Ipomea species). Unfortunately, these were difficult to obtain except as chemically treated seeds and I was not interested in being poisoned for my own protection by paternalistic corporations.",
      "In the late 1970s I bought a little book called Legal Highs at a headshop and discovered Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose contained LSA. I was interested but also apprehensive about trying these. After all, LSA is a precursor to LSD and it was used ceremonially in the form ololiuqui by Native Mexicans and others from that part of the world to induce powerful visionary experiences. What if I took these seeds into my body and had a terrifying vision? Would I have to go to the hospital? Would the police be involved and then what?",
      "I decided to try the HBWR seeds anyway and purchased a little baggie with 24 seeds from the same headshop. I read the instructions and proceeded to clean the fuzzy coating off nine of the seeds using a single edge razor blade. That was tedious work but worth it to minimize potential toxicity (and I was worried about eating the poison treated morning glory seeds!). Next, I crushed 9-12 seeds with a hammer, mixed them in water and drank the whole mess. The taste was horrible like a mix of raw green peppers and coffee. The taste was so bad I wanted to vomit but held it down anyway.",
      "Within an hour I began to notice the first effects. These were changes in my vision and a warm pleasant feeling. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that my pupils were extremely dilated and the whites looked yellow but then everything had a yellowish cast. I was grinning from ear to ear. I do not remember very much of this first trip (way back in 1979) except that it was pleasant with time, space, and size distortions. There was no panic, no fear, no horrible visions, and no physical sickness. I smoked a little reefer during the night and some cigarettes. The trip lasted some eight hours. The next morning I was sleepy, probably a combination of the HBWR alkaloids and staying up until 3 in the morning.",
      "I began eating HBWR seeds fairly often over the next 20 years and never felt sick or had a bad experience. After my first experience, instead of drinking them in a glass of water I ground them to a powder in a pepper grinder and put that into gelatin capsules. \t\t\t",
      "I believe setting is important when taking psychedelics like HBWR. I always made sure that there was nothing urgent to do, that I had fasted for at least six hours (no cheeses or other aged/fermented foods or other MAO inhibitors), kept the lights low, listened to ambient types of music, had a cup of tea nearby, some high quality sticky marijuana and a few cigarettes (Camel straights). Good company was also helpful even if they were not taking HBWR."

      "Several months ago I started to smoke cannabis on a regular basis, something I had done several years before, but had to quit to save money. Anyway, one of my first times back on the pipe was actually with a Volcano Vaporizer. I had made a few new friends in a new town, and I was invited to a little smoking powwow at a guys house whose name was Mario. Now, normally I would preserve his anonymity by not providing his name, but it does come into play later.",
      "The party was a really chill sort of event. None of the people were party smokers, they were artists. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a lack of pipes, bongs, joints any of that stuff. I was thinking 'What are we to smoke with?'. Well, Mario had brought this heavy, electric cone which was a volcano vaporizer. I had never used a vaporizer, and thus didn't know anything about them. When he packed the first chamber and filled the bag, I thought that this was some kind of joke. When I took my first hit, all I could think about was a memory from when I was a kid, and I hung out in the grocery store getting stoned off the nitrous in easy cheese cans.",
      "The initial effects were odd, I wasn't really baked, but I was getting a sort of fuzzy headache. I did at least five, or six more hits before I felt baked. At this point I was questioning the credibility of the people who swore by vaporizers as the best way to smoke. I can't quite remember the total of hits I took in the end, but Mario kept filling the chamber, and I kept hitting the bag long after people dropped off. Eventually it was just Mario and me, and I noticed he looked like hell. He looked totally fried. That's when it hit me just how stoned I was. I didn't feel like I was getting high because it didn't have the usual harshness of a normal pipe, it was just like breathing air. I tried to stand up and walk to the bathroom, but I had to crawl. I was way past my comfort level, and I was far from the peak of my experience.",
      "In the bathroom I looked at my eyes, which were a pleasant shade of light pink. The red eye wasn't what made me look high though, it was my sunken eyes, and blank stare. I then did some light meditation in the bathroom (kinda strange, but the quietest part of the house). I turned my psyche into two parts, one that was on the trip and the other that was guiding my movements so I could function. When I walked out I took off my shoes and socks so I could feel the tacky shag carpet squish between my toes. Pure ecstasy. I was inspired to lay back on the carpet and take it in. As I did, a dozen little gnomes jumped out of their huts somewhere in my body and reupholstered my insides with the velvet they have on pool tables.",
      "To truely experience pleasure, one must also experience pain. I've never been much of a masochist, but I was feeling somewhat philosphical, so I put on a kettle to make some yerba mate tea. (WARNING: The following is a VERY bad idea) When the kettle started to steam, it turned first into a fire breathing dragon, and then into a Dalek from Doctor Who (I didn't actually see them, I was thinking about what the kettle looked like, and as a result I thought I saw them). I picked the kettle up by the sides, the pain was excruciating, and poured four cups of mate before I decided to put the kettle down. About two seconds afterward the pain was replaced by a rush of relief that never went away the rest of the night.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "Several minutes later I decided to go back to my dorm. Mario offered me a ride, my first instinct was to say 'No you idiot, you're high!'. Somehow I ended up in the back of his Isuzu Trooper II with one of my good friends, L. I totally forgot that she was the one who introduced me to Mario, and the reason she hasn't been mentioned up to this point is because I have no recollection of her being with me at the party. I remember the ride as the most terrifying experience of my life, not because of the drive itself, but because L kept poking me in the stomach, being a ticklish person normally, combined with the turns of the car which I perceived as violent fish tailing and swerves, it was a horrible experience. All I wanted to do was get out of the car, and at one point I tried to open the door and bail out, but being a dumb stoner I couldn't figure out the lock.",
      "When we got back to the dorm, I was almost instantly back in my room. Where I picked up a rubber frog, a mountain dew, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Anyway, L, who doesn't smoke, and doesn't know what it's like to trip out, called me and forced me to watch the movie 'Saw' with her. I had seen the film before and thought it was a little scary, and now that I was baked, I dreaded watching it. Anyway, to cut a long story short the movie felt like it took forever, and at the end I realized that the movie wasn't scary at all. After that I was sitting in L's room, and I was reading Ovid - which was actually more scary than Saw because the words were tough to read baked - when I dropped into a trance, and went catatonic for a few minutes. It was completely unexpected, and I think it might have been a result of the techno that L habitually listens to. The trance itself is completely impossible to articulate, and half forgotten because L started to shake me because she thought I had passed out. This wasn't cool, I jumped to me feet, turned around, chucked the rubber frog at her and dove out of the room. I ran down the hall laughing, I felt like I'd just dished out justice. She disturbed me when I was in one of the most awesome experiences of my life, so I punished her by throwing a rubber frog at her.",
      "At the end of the hall I sat on a bench and decided to lay on my back. A few minutes passed when an RA came by and saw me. I would normally have freaked out, but this particular RA was a notorious stoner, and I had even sold him some weed once. I was laying there looking at him, all of the bizarre cerebral things were gone. I was coming down, but still pretty stoned. I looked at him, waiting for him to speak. He then said 'Are you blazed?' to which I replied in a sarcastic tone 'Nooooo...' he asked 'Who'd you smoked with.' I told him the truth, and it couldn't have sounded more ridiculous 'Mario'. He laughed at that, he was thinking Super Mario, the iconic video game character. This threw me through a loop, I felt like a bad dog for no reason. I had actually smoked with a guy named Mario, and I could in no way express it without sounding baked. I had down right limed my own feathers to paraphrase Chaucer. I then went to bed dejected. I had no dreams, but I felt like I was in bed for forever, and that the sun had exploded or something because the night was days long.",
      "When I woke up, my hands were excruciatingly painful. I went to the doctor, and lied about what I'd done. They treated my hands of second degree burns, and I had them wrapped in bandages for the next week and a half. He said I was lucky not to get third degree burns and lose all sensation in my hands.",
      "All in all, I'd say the trip was ambiguous. Mentally it was good, but the lasting pain made it kind of not worth it. I still wouldn't trade the experience for the world. It was a valuable experience. I now know not to underestimate the vaporizer."

      "I first started using MDMA during the summer between my sophomore and junior years of high school. It started at a party were I was given a pressed pill. The feeling of warmth and empathy were amazing. Before this experience I was starting to get depressed about nothing it seemed like my life just seemed hard and terrifying. So MDMA was like a godsend a little gift pressed by god herself.",
      "I started to roll every few days that summer. I was self-medicating depression with MDMA. I didnt pay attention to the side effects but my family noticed. My mom thought I was drinking a lot because I was always tired and pissed off when sober.",
      "Lets skip forward to the summer before college. My use had escalated to the point of me rolling every day for about a year and a half I think (my memory is shot I cant remember if I ate or not or what I did a few hours earlier in any detail). During this summer I started to get chest pains. I didnt pay any attention to these pains and attributed it to smoking cigarettes. I was rolling every day this summer on about .3-.5g of MDMA powder. At the end of the summer I could barley walk up stairs with getting winded, my heart racing and nearly blacking out.",
      "I stopped rolling after an overdose the following New Years where I consumed about 1g of MDMA and a handful of various benzos and painkillers (mostly valium and oxycontin). The depression I fell into following this experience made me have uncontrollable crying fits take over me were I would lay in my bed and cry for hours on bad days. The slightest problem in my life was immense in my eyes and my only solution was to break down and cry like a child. The depression got to the point were I attempted suicide the following week (this being the weekend of my overdose I had only been sober for under seven days and the emotional pain was crippling not to mention the terrible state my organs were in I had intense chest pains, spots in my vision, severe HPPD and probable liver damage). I purchased about ten 5mg Valium, fifteen 7.5/500 Lortabs of hydrocodone and one 40mg Oxycontin oh and a bottle of Wild Turkey 101. I took all the pills at once with half the bottle of wild turkey at a friends house (he was throwing a party because he parents were out of town). I was planning on dieing alone in his garage. From what my friends tell me I collapsed before I got to his garage about 30 minutes after ingesting the pills and booze. They tell me I collapsed and vomited on myself mostly whiskey and various white and blue pill shards. They called an ambulance and my stomach was pumped. The doctors in the ER told me I was very lucky for having thrown up before they got there because had I digested all the pills fully I would have been DOA.",
      "Following this experience I am now two weeks sober and hating my life. I can barley think, my vision is terrible( I cant read the letters change color and move around, I have constant color spots in my field of vision, things in the corner of my vision move violently), not to mention the pain I fell deep in my chest and around the area of my stomach were the liver and kidneys are. I find myself looking at people on campus and feel incredible sadness at my own life for not being one of them. I feel alone most of the time even when surrounded by friends. People tell me I look better and dont look like a drug addict anymore but I feel worthless. I still find myself crying uncontrollably sometimes. But there is a small glimmer of hope after hitting rock bottom. Every sober day my mind slowly grows more normal and my memory is coming back to me. Not long term but new memories are starting to stay and the crippling emotional pain is still there but I am now in counseling and in a NA like support group. My life is still wrecked with pain both physicall and emotional my body and mind still crave the warm blanket of MDMA. But a part of me is saying that if I go back down that road it will end with more damage and finally death. I am desperately trying to remain sober. And I know my chances are getting better each day I remain sober.",
      "This isnt a warning about MDMA or drug addictions merely my story about a sad 16 year old who fell in love with getting high. And who turned into a 19 year old who fells like hes body is 80 with the mental faculties of a child. Im told the mental difficulties will improve with time and that will be my saving grace. That and the love I now feel from friends and family who Ive turned to for help. Drugs are no longer holding the leash on my emotions."

    "report": [
      "Last night, my friend M and I had some excess powder sitting about, and we decided to try the infamous combination of dope and coke, a.k.a. 'Speedballing'.  M and I had recently come across a source of cheap, very good quality heroin.  I hadn't done any dope in about 4 days, but I'd been doing coke most of the weekend.  At about 9:30 pm, we each insufflated one large line of cocaine, and one small line of heroin, about the size of our normal dose.  We proceeded outside to smoke cigarettes out on the bench in front of our dorm, as we normally do.  Heroin gives a warm, heavy, slightly itchy feeling of contentedness, while cocaine produces a jittery, euphoric, wide-awake high.  The combination is a mix of these two states...warm, drowsy, and content, yet somehow fully aware of what is going on and talkative and slightly jittery.",
      "We smoked cigarettes and walked around until the cocaine high wore off.  Still slightly wired at this point, however, the heroin mostly took over and I actually nodded out a couple of times.  We shot a few games of pool, and did one more line of cocaine to bring us back up.  We smoked more cigarettes, and M and I drank a beer to top things off.  After about an hour, my friend R offered to smoke a blunt of kb (cannabis) with us.  We proceeded to the usual spot, by now feeling more or less back to normal.",
      "After I took a few large hits from the blunt, 10 minutes later I had to sit down, suddenly overcome by the strength of the speedball.  My only guess is that the cannabis must have kicked in both the heroin and the cocaine all over again, and this time it was much stronger than it had been before.  It was about 1am by now, and I was able to make my way back to the dorm and up to my room.  I was feeling very ill and my heart was beating very quickly and erratically.  I sat for a while, unable to move but still very very fucked up.  I vomited a few times, and I felt better.  My heart continued to behave erratically, speeding along much faster than it should have.  Abruptly, it would slow down to somewhere near normal, but still not at a steady rhythmic pace.  It sped up and slowed down to its own accord for the next couple of hours.",
      "Physically, I was not in good shape.  I was pale and trembling, with a slight headache and cold, clammy hands.  Mentally, it was a beautiful feeling.  For a while I felt as if I was very close to dying, but at the same time I was consumed by beauty all around me.  I believed myself to be in a higher state of consciousness, at one with the universe or in sync with a unifying force, or something.  Interpret that however you want.  I slept through all of my classes the next day (today), and I've been rather 'out of it' and exhausted both physically and mentally.",
      "This experience is an unforgettable one, however it is very dangerous and I suggest that anyone planning to try this should know their reactions to both cocaine and heroin before combining the two.  Drinking any amount of alcohol with this combination was a very very stupid thing to do.  Luckily we only had one beer left to split, If I'd had more, I would've drank it, and I would probably be dead or hospitalized today.",
      "Note: I hadn't smoked cannabis for about a week prior to the experience, so that may have something to do with it's heavily magnifying effects on me."

      "Setting: Vacation hotel room with my partner. Evening after a good meal.",
      "Set: Very relaxed. We were both looking forward to an MDMA session together.",
      "6pm: we each dropped one tab of MDMA, and watched tv for about 20 minutes, waiting for the effects to come on. Not wanting to waste our precious vacation time tripping in front of the tube, we then decided to walk out to the beach and enjoy the coming on process with surf and gentle ocean breeze in the background.",
      "7pm: the MDMA hit, while sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean, talking, sharing, bonding. We don't do MDMA more than a few times a year, and had been looking forward to this trip and setting for many months, so every moment of it was enjoyed.",
      "8pm: back to the hotel room. cuddling lead to a randy mood, which was taken advantage of fully.",
      "9pm: we dropped another half an MDMA tablet, thereby extending the trip a bit",
      "11pm: I decided that I would experiment with a low dose of 2c-t-2: 8mg dissolved in water. My partner declined. The MDMA had begun to wear off, but we were still affected by it.",
      "12am: The 2c-t-2 effortlessly glided in with a mild increase in the waning euphoria and speedy feeling, and brighter colors.",
      "1am(ish): the visual cornucopia began! This was interesting, as I usually don't get significant visuals at the 8mg level. However, I had also never done this substance at the tail end of an MDMA experience, either. The visuals were mostly closed eyed, and I could definitively ignore them if I chose to. However, lying down, with eyes close, a whole world of fractal patterns opened up. Very very beautiful.",
      "I soon noticed that the swirling patterns were affected by whatever thought I had in my head, and for a while I played with altering the visual experience by holding certain thoughts. For example, the simple idea of triangles flooded my visual field with triangular prismatic rainbows... while the idea of turtles induced layers of interlocking primitive Polynesian turtle motifs morphing into complex anatomical imagery. I eventually got bored with these mind games, and just continued to let the experience unfold without interference on my part...",
      "Then, on cue, the experience took off into another direction. I was shown very interesting and complex imagery: Hindu gods and eyes of Horus patterns like peacock feathers swirling ad infinitum. My forehead felt like it was opening. When realized that I was thinking about the nature of this substance, 2c-t-2, a name suddenly popped into my head with insistence: Shiva. Flames and eyes everywhere. Wow!",
      "Throughout this experience, I felt together enough to tell my partner what was going on. At one point I got up to fill a glass of water, and noticed how clear and coordinated I was. The moment I would lie back down, however, the trip would resume. I very much enjoyed having the choice of taking breaks from it all, and I suspect that it was because I was on a low dose, a dose that somehow had been made more visually potent by the earlier MDMA trip.",
      "4am: still tripping, though things seemed to have calmed down a bit.",
      "5am: over a 20 minute period, I returned to baseline, and was able to fall asleep without any problems."

      "The happiness increased, but still isnt anywhere near in full force. My typing speed and accuracy have both increased. My sense of time is just beginning to become slightly inaccurate.",
      "8:00",
      "I am feeling slightly tingly. Laughter doesnt come natural anymore, and I am able to suppress it now. I can feel vibrations and movements ripple through my body. I feel slightly light-headed, and I feel as if my skin is shrinking, and I am aware of my skin against my skull.",
      "8:15",
      "Im feeling wonderful. I feel like everyone loves me. Im so happy that I want to cry. I cant help but feel kindness and compassion towards everyone, even people I dont like. I have a slight pain in my back, but I think its because of the fact that Ive been moving around a lot. The pain is going away quickly. Even when it was there, it wasnt bad. It was hardly noticeable in fact. I feel more in tune with my body. My hands are slightly cold. They feel like machines. My typing accuracy is way up. I havent used the backspace key at all while typing this. I am developing a slight pressure in my head and left ear. Im not sure, but I think this may be the beginning of a small sinus headache. I dont think its drug related though. Off and on, a region of my head, at the top, in the middle, and slightly to the left, I feel a tingling alternating with a slight pain. My arms feel like one or two small needles are poking them. Oddly, the feeling is not unpleasant.",
      "8:30",
      "The general high is starting to subside. I can still feel it though. My face is tingling slightly. My right ear is starting to throb a little too. It feels about equivalent to an ear infection, only without the discharge and not NEAR as painful. In fact, pain really isnt so bad, and its easy to ignore. I still feel the occasional pressure near the sinus area. My stomach is slightly upset, but I barely notice it. I am still typing like mad, and accurately. The rippling is getting slightly more intense.",
      "9:00",
      "The intensity has subsided slightly, but the tingling is spreading. It keeps wavering as to its intensity. My hands are still cold, and while Im still typing faster and more accurately, Im not typing quite as fast.",
      "10:00",
      "My hearing is a bit muffled, and there is a slight echo effect, as I have had in the past. Its not at all unpleasant. Im also feeling a little hot. Im still feeling active, but I dont feel the urge to move my legs. Typing seems to calm me, because it releases my built up energy. My arms are starting to feel a little tired from all the typing. My cottonmouth is getting bad, but its not all that unpleasant. The tingling is coming back, this time in full force. The cycle continues: tingle, pressure, and then nothing.",
      "10:30",
      "My sight is starting to fade, and gets slightly blurry when I look at lights for a few seconds. Normally, it would only affect a part of my vision. Now, when I look at bright lights, it affects the whole of my vision. Its very odd. I dont notice it phase in and out, but somehow I know it does. Im getting the light-headedness again. Someone is playing music that, under normal circumstances, I would hate with a bloody passion. I dont mind it so much. Id like it, if I didnt know any better. Its five minutes later, and my vision is much better, but its still tinted orange-ish yellow. Im not sure if its the lighting, or just me. Im starting to lose my ability to discern normalcy from the extraordinary. It seems so natural. Normally, when Im active during the nighttime, I get a little warm. I feel that way now, only it seems natural, and almost preferable. Im beginning to feel a general good-naturedness towards everything. People who, under normal circumstances, I would fear, are now warm and friendly.",
      "11:00",
      "Im regaining my sense of humor slightly. I laughed (unforcefully) for the first time in quite a while. I havent laughed much all day, actually. Im feeling a little less hot than I was a half an hour ago. Im still feeling pretty restless, and now my typing has slowed. Due to my restlessness, I tend to have more errors. Every once in awhile, I still feel a wave of wonderful emotion flow over me. I still experience the same good-naturedness that Ive been experiencing for some time. This music is getting better and better, even though I know in my mind that its horrible. I feel as if I need to get up and jump up and down or something. My movements are starting to feel more fluid than usual. I feel groovy. Sometimes, I feel the urge to move my head from side to side, slowly, and Im moving it along with the rhythm of my typing. Ive been experiencing a few other unexplainable synchronicities as well. If I dont get up, I think Ill burst into flame!",
      "11:30",
      "When I put any significant weight on my legs, they almost act as if they are falling asleep. My typing speed is up a little, but my accuracy isnt up by much. Im having trouble typing this, because my leg is bouncing uncontrollably. This is the fist time that Ive been uncomfortable with any of the side-effects. I think that if I concentrate hard enough, I can make it stop. I may have to stop talking for a while. Apparently, it worked. I can control the shaking, but I have to concentrate very hard. Once it starts, its hard to stop. Im very sure that I can stop it from coming on in the first place. Im going to go crazy if I dont move soon. Its hard to type when Im so restless. My brain is going a mile a minute. My eyesight, which had gotten better, is now looking the way it did.",
      "Ive figured out that the orange and yellow tint is actually the natural colors of the light. It appears that I just seem to notice it more. My vision is still about the same as looking into a large area-encompassing light. For some reason, it seems to clear up when I look at things that appear to be at a distance, and oddly enough the same thing happens when I look at something thats moving. Moving things seem to pop out of the scenery ever so slightly. I seem to be doing all sorts of strange things with my hands when Im thinking about what to type. Ive developed some odd habits, such as running my fingers down the keyboard, and lightly tapping the keyboard with no intention of actually typing something. Its getting increasingly harder to refrain from bouncing my leg. I have to stop now, and stand up for awhile before this gets too out of hand.",
      "1:30",
      "A very annoying person has been pestering me for the past 2 hours. Thanks to this substance, Ive been able to tolerate it. I havent been able to type anything. Thankfully, nothing much has happened in the last two hours. Its been pretty much just more of the same.",
      "2:30",
      "The effects are really starting to take hold. I have slowed down significantly, and Im no longer shaking. In spite of this, I seem to be extremely cautious. Every time I see my shadow out of the corner of my eye, I jump, thinking that its a person. I looked at a window, and I saw a man peering in at me. I soon discovered that the voyeur was, in fact, my own reflection. Im not feeling nearly as much of the goodwill towards mankind kind of feelings, but Im not going to say that its entirely gone. Now I have shifted to paranoia. Im being extremely cautious in everything I do. Im even aware of the sound of my keyboard as I type. It seems loud, as if it could be heard throughout the whole house.",
      "The tingling has stopped for now. I have that headache that I felt coming on hours ago. Its not very bad, but its different from my normal sinus headaches. My eyes are just beginning to get sore from staring at the computer screen off and on for these past hours. My sense of time is more distorted than its ever been. Fifteen minutes have passed in what seemed like only one. At the same time, it feels like time is going by very slowly. I have no real comprehension of time. All that I know is numbers. I know that its 2:30 in the morning, but I dont feel that its 2:30 in the morning. My breathing seems to be rather choppy. Im not sure if it is, or if its an illusion. I have absolutely now way of telling now.",
      "3:30",
      "Im having many minor auditory hallucinations. I keep thinking that I see something out of the corner of my eye. I have to think really hard to remind myself that its just the drugs. Im going up and down constantly. Im beginning to become a little disassociated. Im having some major troubles thinking. My mind is thinking so fast, but never about what I want it to. Im having troubles finishing sentences. I have to use every ounce of strength that I possess to finish this. The paranoia is beginning to fade slightly. I feel a strong urge to move my head in a fluid, circular manner. I just made a remark about a triangle, so I am told. Im not sure its true. Im feeling the urge to move random body parts, but always in a circular manner. Im not even sure if its circular, but I can sense that there is some pattern to it. I have become happier than ever before. This is definitely the peak.",
      "4:00-4:30",
      "I was completely wrong about the peak. If this isnt it, I cant wait to see what happens next. I have lost all since of time. Im so happy that I want to cry. Ive just had a few visual hallucinations, along with the auditory. So far, Ive heard a dog howling in the night, Ive seen a pig walk through the door after snorting loudly from upstairs, and Ive heard sheep in the distance. I looked at myself in the mirror, and I saw my fathers face staring back at me. My muscular coordination is waxing and waning. I can direct my general movements, but it seems that I cant refine my movements. The fluidity is gone. I stop, and stare into space while my entire body tingles.",
      "I can no longer fully control it. I have given over to the power of suggestion. There is a slight burning in my throat. For some reason, I like it. I associate the basic outline of various objects and figures with numbers and letters. I am constantly trying to decipher these messages. They are trying to tell me something, but I just cant put my finger on it. The doorway just spelled hello. I cant help but think about everything. Memories are rushing back in waves. I recall the days events. How long has it been since I started this entry. I cannot tell. It could have been a year.",
      "5:00",
      "By now, all of the effects have subsided. I am completely exhausted, and I got to bed."

I told the Dr. about this multiple times and they (multiple different dr's) said that I was making this symptom up. This was by far the most lingering of the symptoms that I still feel  today after 3 years without it. THEY DO GET BETTER JUST GIVE IT TIME.",

I tried to quit at least 5 times. 3 of which I tried weaning and going to different drugs (Zoloft, Welbutrin, Devacote, Risperdal, Prozac, Seroquel all of which had their own little quirks but nothing like Effexor). None worked. The way that I finally quit was to just let my boss know that I wasnt coming in for a week and laid in bed screaming at the top of my lungs until I could move again.",
      "Cannabis helped me. It seemed to be the only thing that made it more subtle and bearable until my body could actually rid itself of this poison.",
      "It is now 2007 and I am completely free of all pharm. drugs. I smoke cannabis on a daily basis to help with the bipolar ups and downs. It keeps me at baseline far better than all of the other drugs that Dr.'s gave me. I still feel the shocks about twice a month. I have just gotten used to them now.",
      "Be careful everyone. I would never want anyone to go through anything like this because a Dr. thinks that it is what they need. Everyone is different, and I do believe that some of these drugs help some people.  Judge for yourself, do your research,  and stay as natural as possible. God gave us ways to heal ourselves naturally, and I know that I didnt pick Effexor from the ground."

I took 23g (nearly an ounce) of dried flowers, and mixed them in a food processor with a little bit of white wine. When it turned into a thick mush, I put it on a bottle, and poured the rest of the wine over. I let it stand for 24 hours, shaking often. After 24 hours, I strained it, and squeezed all the wine out of the flowers. I was left with a very nasty looking brownish wine.  I have read that the taste is rather bitter, but mine tastes quite good. It hardly tastes anything at all, actually. I used a white wine 'for beginners', with a very mild taste, so that might be why.",

      "Hello my name is Parsalus, Ive been a psyconaugt since my first Cannabis experiment back in 1999 when I was in 8th grade. My curiosity for Psychotropic drugs peaked when I first experimented with Dextromethorphan DXM in November of 2001 and from there on I experimented with multiple psychotropic drugs all the way up until 2007. Mescaline is one drug I will never forget about, it is one mean, tough, animal that you must be prepared for both mentally and physically.",
      "Sometime in June of 2006 I ordered 125grams of Peruvian Torch Cactus Incense which contained Mescaline and a few other alkaloids that wouldnt alter the effects in any odd way. The Peruvian Torch cactus has much less of the other alkaloids than the San Pedro cactus and a lot less than the Peyote cactus so this incense is the closes thing I could do to pure synthetic Mescaline which is impossible to find.",
      "I was working nightshift at McDonalds and my shift ended at 12:00AM at midnight. Approximately 2 hours before my shift ended at about 10:15PM I ingested 35 grams of the incense orally and washed it down with orange juice and stayed hydrated. I was planning on walking home. 12:00PM came around and I was finished work and I sat outside and waited for the effects to take hold. I noticed the first effects come on at 12:30AM two and a half hours after I ingested the substance, so yes Mescaline does take a while to go into affect.",
      "At 12:30 as I was sitting outside at a table in front of McDonaldss I felt what I could only describe a coming up on a nice clean roll of MDMA Ecstasy like a feeling of taking 3 beans. There was a bit more physical discomfort and this MDMA like high had a spiritual edge like Tryptamines. I started thinking about goodness, kindness, charity, and humility.",
      "I was having spiritual thoughts like I could be poor no money or nothing but it wouldnt matter because my spiritual contentment is so high that I know God will take care of me and I would just help others and that is better than any materialistic thing in the would because what I was feeling was real and it was pure and so many people are lost and dont know better. In the midst of these realizations I was rethinking my idea of walking home and this is what was going through my head. If I walk home Lucifer knows that I am enlightened and he will trick me by jumping into a police officers spirit body just so he can pull me over and harass me and say that Im on drugs so they can persecute me for these divine and pure thoughts I now understand. So I waited for a girl I knew to get out a 1:00AM and asked if her mom can give me a ride.",
      "This girl got out of work and started talking to me about her farther dying and how she misses him so much and I talked with her and tried to make her feel better about her situation, it was really odd because I was tripping. I was also seeing OEV of spider web and honeycomb like patterns forming on McDonalds tile ceilings. The girls mother came and we had a quite ride to my house where they dropped me off and this is when the real tripping began. I went inside and put on some Jim Morrison and the Doors just for the mood and I smoked 1 bowl of Cannabis and the Psychedelic Effects hit me and hit me hard, suddenly there was no more spiritual MDMA like high it completely did a 180 on me.",
      "My body load increased 10 fold to the point I didnt want to move and beautiful visuals just flooded everywhere multicolored patters just cascaded covering, morphing, changing shape and color. I closed my eyes and saw beautiful women doing James Bond introduction movie style scenes. I closed my eyes and saw pretty girls I worked with dressed up in wonderful sexy dresses just spinning, and turning. I also saw wondrous landscapes of lights, sounds, and colors forming in front of my with a lucidity I can only describe a liquid formation. I didnt however see any Aztec or Mayan type designs which I was expecting.",
      "During the peak of the trip at about around 3:00PM I couldnt move because my body felt poisoned by this crazy cactus poison but I felt like I was on Amphetamines and tripping at the same time. The visuals just kept on coming and coming to the point I wasnt even paying attention to them anymore and all my personal problems were being thrown in my face by the spirit of Mescaline that came to me in the form of a wild man who kept telling me Hehe, you kids found me, Im not mushrooms boy I am a whole nether animal not to be reckoned with and I am younger in spirit than all you kids, BOY!! As it revved up the high to visuals just flooding my everything. The spirit said to me or at least this conversation was going on in my psyche, you picked the wrong man to mess with. I am laying in bed fucking poisoned, and tripping balls, meth style but couldnt move having the spirit of Mescaline throwing all my issues like I have to get my license and to stop abusing opiates , ect in my fucking face, complete ego death I was noting and Mescaline was like my wise uncle slapping me into shape. I went through deep and difficult introspection.",
      "8:00AM in the morning Im coming down and I am shaken. I also see spiders that I normally kill and I would not kill them at all under the influence of this cactus. I had bad diarrhea because of the cactus incense and basically reflected upon the experience. I can honestly say Mescaline gives me a taste of spiritual bliss than rips me from it and makes me work for my spiritual bliss as in it kicks my ass, slaps me, beats me down, picks me up cleans me off and kicks my ass right out the door, thats the best I can describe it.",
      "I didnt sleep until the next night."

      "I had researched morning glory seeds extensively, and became very interested in taking them. After finding a legitimate shop to order from, i.e., a cultivator who did not treat their seeds with chemicals, I ordered about 500 seeds. I had decided to take them by myself, although someone I trusted was there to look out for me in case of a bad trip, etc.",
      "I counted out 250 seeds and ground them up with a coffee grinder. I did not know the best way to ingest them, so I placed the powder in a glass of water and tried to chug it down. Bad idea: the seed powder clumped at the bottom of the glass, despite mixing it around with a spoon. Well, I had to spoon out the watery mess and eat it like that. To be honest, it wasn't that bad, although my last two attempts have resulted in me vomiting from the taste.",
      "Having successfully gotten the seed powder down, I anxiously waited the onset of my trip. I tried not to move much, so I sat down in a chair for a while. The nausea was coming on, but I was fighting it. I decided to take a shower to take my mind off of getting sick. The nausea got stronger, but never to the point of vomiting. I ended up on the couch watching some television, and feeling quite disappointed. I had waited nearly two hours and nothing had happened. However, about 20 minutes later I started to notice it was hard to concentrate on the television. I couldn't follow what was happening very well, was it starting to work? I got up to go to the bathroom, and BAM, a shooting pain went through my right knee. It wore off by the time I got back from the toilet, and then it hit me, I was starting to get a very pleasant body high. My skin felt numb and warm, and I went outside to enjoy the sunset.",
      "The next two hours were spent listening to music, walking around, generally just contemplating and exploring my high. At 4 hours after ingestion, I started to get closed-eyes visuals: colorful, swirling geometric patters that seemed to play out the vibrations of my mind. This lasted for a solid 2 hours.",
      "I should mention here that my body temperature was very high. My sense of hot and cold were completely distorted, but my girlfriend could not stand to be hugged up against me for any longer than a minute, I have a theory about this I will explain later. In addition to this temperature distortion, I also felt like I had super-strength, like I could flip over a car by myself. There was something very primal about this part of the experience, like some hidden strength was unlocked and I felt completely connected with all life.",
      "After peaking, I still retained the body high for another 3 to 4 hours, with less intense closed-eye visuals. My attention span was definitely still hampered, as I tried to sit down and watch a movie and could not pay attention at all. Worth noting was that the film I was watching relied heavily on visual effects, and I felt like I could see right through the artificial aspects of the movie. It was like because of my sensitivity to light and the rapid pace of my thoughts, the effects were too slow to fool my brain.",
      "The night was wearing down, and I had not eaten anything at all since taking the seeds, probably 7-8 hours. I decided to eat a pear, and it was absolutely wonderful. I did not feel very hungry, even when I ate the pear, so I did not eat anything else. I decided to go to bed, which now I realize is not possible when taking psychedelics. I lay in bed for a while, and then the sickness returned with a vengeance. I got to the bathroom and hung out by the toilet for a while, but I did not vomit. The sickness was very intense, but I was able to get to sleep after about 2 hours of it.",
      "The next morning I had a sort of 'hangover,' my body ferociously hungry and having cold sweats. It seems my body was trying to relearn how to correctly feel the temperature, because I was wearing a sweatshirt and simultaneously sticking my head in the freezer, all in the heat of summer. I felt cold and hot all at once. Also, when I closed my eyes, I could still see traces of those lovely geometric patterns from the night before. After I ate some food, I felt much better, and spent the most of the day regaining soberness.",
      "Now on to the good stuff! Throughout the trip, I felt like every molecule in my body was brimming with life. Everything my body is made up of was a conscious being and positively alive. This made me feel extremely peaceful, and understand the cycle of life and death completely. I knew that when my body dies, all of these molecules, still containing energy and life, would simply transfer to a new place. One could compare it to a sense of reincarnation. In my own words at the time, 'I feel like the boundary between life and death has been eradicated.' I felt like I had died but came to realized it was the same as life. No words will ever be exact enough to replicate the feeling, but this is the best way to describe it.",
      "As to the feeling of super-strength, I will now explain my theory. I am not a subscriber to any religion, although I find truth and wisdom in all of them. In short, I believe in energy, specifically the internal energy we all possess known as chi, or qi. Having practiced martial arts for some time, I have developed--that is, learned how to focus--my chi over the years. Taking the morning glory seeds seemed to unleash my chi energy so that it was intensely focused for the whole trip, without having to do it consciously. It was at a level I have never experienced before. The increased body heat, the increased strength and numbness, were all comparable of what the focus of chi does. While some would explain it differently, this was my truth that I gained out of the whole experience. I believe the morning glory seeds show you the potential of yourself, and show you a higher consciousness and awareness of the universe. Actually living this potential is something, I believe, one can only reach when sober. I believe the seeds are a useful tool in showing you the path to get to that potential.",
      "This experience with morning glory was overwhelmingly positive, and I have since tried to take them 2 more times. I was not successful in keeping them down, however, and did not have nearly the experience I had the first time. In the future, I will try to perform an LSA extraction rather than ingest the seed powder. I have read this cuts down on the nausea, and also reduces the time it takes to feel the trip."

      "I've taken LSA+2C-E once before and it was a great trip, but this second trip was far more intense and infinitely more satisfying. Since LSA has such a long come-up, I dosed in the sequence shown below hoping to get the two peaks to coincide.",
      "T+0:00  5-HTP 200mg (oral),  LSA 210mg (~12.5 seeds) (oral)",
      "T+1:45  2C-E 20mg, LSA 90mg (~5 seeds)",
      "On my previous LSA+2C-E experience, I came to terms with the fact that I pursue psychedelic states hoping to achieve something spiritually fulfilling and not merely entertaining.  Though I've had many very revealing trips before, there has never been that great ecstatic and blissful moment of epiphany and understanding I have so longed after.  After this experience, I realized, perhaps the whole of my life experience, encompassing all sober and psychedelic states, may have been the Universe conspiring and preparing me for this particular inward journey-- a perfect moment in time.",
      "The night began around 8pm, when two very good friends arrived at the house, one of whom would be partaking in what I can only hope was a similar journey.  The other, my roommate, chose to remain sober on the occasion, but hopes to replicate a similar trip soon.",
      "As we waited for the first dose to begin to come on, we listened to music, sat around, and soaked in the last bit of sobriety we thought we would have over the next several hours.  To both of our surprise, the sober character of our minds remained minimally altered throughout our trip, only adding to the beauty and complexity of our experiences. ",
      "Up to the point that we took our second dosing (T+1:45), we had both failed to experience the visuals normally associated with these types of psychoactives, however, we were both in agreement that we were experiencing a strong, but not super natural, euphoria and an intense freedom of both thought and experience.  Communication among all three of us was surprisingly fluid, uninterrupted, and uninhibited.  We were also struck with those general feelings of beauty, and were basking in the intense awe that only Life inspires.",
      "Within 20 minutes of our second dosing, we noticed a very intense and speedy climb to the plateau we would soon enjoy for several hours.  The words I've found most worthy to describe this climatic plateau of my life is Spiritual Ecstasy.  I don't consider myself an overly spiritual guy, but I can think of no other words to fit the infinite ecstasy that followed.",
      "We had just gotten back from a short walk around the block where we had smoked several cigarettes while enjoying the fresh air, if you'll forgive such an obvious paradox.  While we were out in cold, my sober friend had apparently also been conspiring with the Universe to make the Perfect musical selection for our return.  We came back into the warmth to be greeted by the sonic vibrations of 'Souvlaki Space Station' by Slowdrive.  (An album and song that I now must insist you buy, borrow, or steal.)",
      "Nearly as soon as I had taken off my coat, scarf, and hat, I found my self writhing on the carpeted floor as wave after wave of ecstatic joy, love, and human experience washed over me.  With eyes open or closed, I saw the tapestries of human experience and emotion unfurl and expand over every element of my consciousness, every ugly and beautiful thing, and every perfect thing in between.  All internal resistance had been dissolved, my mind had become a superconductor, a master conduit, to all of  existence.  If I have ever lived an enlightened moment, this was surely it.",
      "This state continued for several hours before beginning to wane.  I was at a moment concerned to lose this moment of continuous beauty and perfection, but soon realized that the knowledge and memory of  it's existence alone would persist for a life time. ",
      "It is possible that this experience was unique to this  moment in space and time, but even so, I will remain forever grateful to have at once quelled the currents of life, peered across the great blue divide, and seen even a glimpse of the golden shore that one can only hope awaits us all."

      "Background:",
      "I'm sixteen years old, female, about 120lb, and hadn't had much prior experience with psychedelics. Prior to this experience I had tripped on shrooms once a few months ago, however the alleged half eighth was quite obviously shorted. Ive also tripped on salvia a few times and used to smoke a lot of weed (I dont as much anymore since that mushroom trip).",
      "My friends and I ordered the 4-HO-MiPT over the internet and it came in on a Monday. I had been planning to wait until the weekend to try it with a group of friends but ended up doing it by myself Wednesday night right after work, not preparing at all like I had planned to. Even though I knew I wasnt in an ideal state of mind to trip (Id had a bad day at work and some conflict with a friend), I wasnt worried about having a bad trip because when I tripped on mushrooms it was a positive experience and from what Id read this was a very similar chemical. Also my friends had all tripped on this the day before and liked it a lot. I took somewhere between 8 and 12 mg (there was some uncertainty because the scale I used wasnt very accurate) dissolved in a bottle of water. My stomach was still pretty full from a huge meal I ate about five hours before dosing. My intention for this trip was to get a new perspective on certain areas of my life and to try to get unstuck from a sort of dull mindset Id been in recently.",
      "9:30pm: I drank the bottle of water quickly over the course of about five minutes. I was alone in my room the whole time. After about twenty minutes I started to feel a little anxious and cold and I was shivering. I got in bed to warm up and listened to a hypnosis cd to relax. I started to relax and to see beautiful, intricate patterns when I closed my eyes.",
      "10:00pm: After about thirty minutes I was definitely tripping and I felt like I had on mushrooms. The trip was building in waves, coming on strong for a few moments and then letting up so I would forget I was tripping. It quickly got much more intense than it had been on mushrooms. At this point I wrote: Right now all systems are void. When I reach for them I find nothing. My soul is exposed. There is no limit to what I now can teach you. And then a wave would hit where the trip was so strong I physically couldnt write. When it came down again I wrote: Now I see what happened last time. Everything happens too fast to write down. Now I am just writing. Its hard to simultaneously write on the paper about how well you know the paper wI cant think anymore. I will write when I am back.",
      "Time seemed to be incredibly drawn out. I would look at the time, an eternity would go by, then I would look at it again to see that it hadnt changed. It felt like my heart was beating fast, but when I took my pulse it was only 75. I tried to take my pulse again later but it felt like my hand was melting into my neck and I couldnt distinguish my pulse from the air pulsating around me, so I dont know what it actually was. Nothing serious, I wasnt that worried about it. But it was definitely not a good idea to trip alone, especially since Id never done this before. The whole time I really wished I had someone to talk to about everything I was thinking.",
      "A lot of the insights I had about my life had to do with the way I relate to other people. I realized that I get too caught up in my own thoughts, and that reality lies in the collective human consciousness. To realize that and not have someone there to connect to was really frustrating. I wrote a note to one of my friends explaining what I was going through because it related to a conversation wed had that day. That was some relief to know that I would give her the note the next day and my message would  get across, but it was no substitute for face-to-face communication.",
      "For the first part of the trip I was listening to my ipod on shuffle, but I realized that songs with lyrics were too much for me to handle, so I put on Bach. That was a good choice--Orchestral Suite #3 in D and some other soothing orchestral pieces. The music I was listening to was pretty much what determined my emotional state throughout the trip, so switching to classical music was a major upgrade. Words freaked me out, silence was too silent, but classical was perfect.",
      "1:30am: I started to come down now, and for the next two hours I did a lot of writing and reflecting. I still had lots of sensory distortion and couldnt go to sleep yet, but my mind felt very clear. This was the best part of the trip. I was relieved to feel like I was back in my body again and felt very at peace with everything Id learned from the experience. This lasted about an hour and a half, and I fell asleep a little after 3am.",
      "Overall Id say this was a beneficial experience even though it wasnt fun the whole time. I went back and forth a lot between euphoria, fear, and intense self-analysis the whole time. This is a drug that should be treated with caution and respect, definitely not a party drug, for me anyways. Based on this experience I would highly recommend preparing mentally beforehand and being in a comfortable setting with a friend and some soft, relaxing music. Its quite a journey."

They could not find the culprit of my problems. I was having panic attacks due to post-traumatic stress disorder. I was given heavy doses of Zoloft, the Paxil, then Effexor, until I was saved by Xanax.",

I am happier than I ever was on any other drug. The feeling of warmth and happiness is a hard one to grasp in this world of evil. I have found the one light in this darkness to see through the veil. How could I ever leave this?",
      "I only can speak highly of alprazolam, but I must stress that it must be taken wisely and ALONE to appreciate what it really does, and not mixed with alcohol, or any others drugs. I have watched many people have bad reactions to these combinations. People who say they have lost memory or felt like time was stolen from them, usually are combiners who drink alcohol or mix another drug with alprazolam.

      "Recently, upon stumbling into the 'Ask Erowid' section, I found a question that had greatly concerned me last June up until recently.  Does LSD and/or MDMA affect an unborn fetus?",
      "I suppose this could be listed under experiences or generally anywhere the question is concerned.",
      "In my conclusion, LSD and MDMA has not harmed my son in any way.  Here is the story/description of what we discovered.",
      "We live in a mid sized city with just about nothing to do other than get drunk or experiment with friends....clubs are boring here and raves are horrible.  My no fiance and I had rolled together for our first time the first weekend of February 2000 at a house party.  We decided we wanted to the next weekend, but just the 2 of us together.  That night turned into the first night we slept together and the start of that type of relationship.  About a month later, we decided to do it again....just for the hell of it.  Time goes on.....a week or so later, more X.  It comes to the end of the month and I am informed that she has not had her period for the end of March.  We were concerned thinking she might be pregnant and halted all drug activity.  We waited 2 weeks and bought 2 different pregnancy tests....both came out negative.  We were relieved.  We go about our old ways again rolling now every weekend in April.  the way we consumed it though, 5 apiece throughout the course of the night.  2 to start, 1 hour or so later....snorted 1...and based 1 in a bong or joint etc....Come mid april, we come across some acid.  We have a night of just tripping....along with the following night.  The next weekend, we decided to candyflip.",
      "Over the next week, I decided I was going to get set up as a dealer since we could get good cid in large quantities. I started with 10 100 hit viles per week.  I always kept 1 for my personal use and sold out the remaining 9 in vile or on candy.  Every weekend for the next 6 weeks, we were doing anywhere for 10-75 hits each.  I would make 50 sweet tarts and take a fresh vile with me when we would trip.  We would start out just squeezing sweet breath into our mouths and leave hardly anything in the bottom of the tube.....as normal nights would progress, we would eat sweet-tart after sweet tart until there were only 5-10 left in the baggy....on many nights.....we would eat our usual 5 hits of x each.....and on almost every night of the activities, a quarter ounce would be reduced to a nickel.",
      "What turned us after a while:",
      "We went on a vacation to Orlando....fun for about 5 days.  On the last night there, we decided to go to Epcot while we rolled and tripped.  We at about 10 sweet tarts each and started with the usual 2 rolls each....after firework and laser shows died down, we headed back to the room to smoke and finish the rolls. We crushed up 2 of them, snorted half of one each.  We decided to go ahead and eat the other half.  Old girl was afraid though...she started to say she had not been feeling well, but decided to push on anyway.  She 'BC-powdered' the remaining half.  Immediately upon swallowing it, she vomited profusely. we had never, ever vomited on a roll or cid before.  this was our first sign of concern.",
      "On our drive back home, we didn't talk much about what happened the night before.  By the time we got back to our town...we were ready to rest.  We talked later in the evening and revealed that we were scared that she might actually be pregnant now....both of us in disbelief, but there wasn't much to it....we had the same rolls the week before....they were awesome.",
      "We tested the following saturday night. The results were positive on 2 tests.",
      "What more can we say....you think for the worst.",
      "We went to see a doctor specializing in high risk pregnancies.  The first ultrasound was done.  We had a boy....he was 13 weeks and 4 days old....active....healthy....and right on track.",
      "We decided against abortion despite all the risks.  the months that ensued were wonderful.  the due date, December 8, 2000.",
      "The night of November 26, 2000...labor begins....2 weeks early.  We had not done any recreational drug together since the first ill fated night.",
      "Labor ensued for what seemed like weeks.  Finally, at 2:30pm on November 27, 2000....we had our son, as healthy as could be.",
      "Now, he is 4 months old and 1 week....today on april 3, 2001.  He is developing at an above normal rate.  He has no health problems of any kind and he is the happiest baby we have ever seen....he can be crying for hunger, but as soon as he sees your face or hears your voice, he stops and smiles.",
      "I am NOT saying it is ok to do these activities during any stage of pregnancy.  I am merely putting out a story telling all that our son was 100% healthy.  PLEASE, don't abort any baby just because you may have rolled a couple times during the first trimester or tripped a time or two in the first few weeks.  We probably had 70 hits of X and over 300 hits of cid in a few month period and we have a perfectly normal, if not above normal, healthy beautiful son.  Also, neither of us are mentally insane from that much acid.  Neither of us have experienced a flashback either.",
      "We have rolled 3 or 4 times now that the pregnancy is over and I have tripped once.  We are much more conservative now and can appreciate life to the fullest.",

      "I've always wanted to try shrooms, so when the opportunity came up, I had to jump on it. I live in an area where it's pretty hard to get shrooms- they only come around every few months. So I bought a bunch and got together with my girlfriend and two friends. We were at my house, so the location was comfortable. I read that this was very important. I also read that a good positive attitude was important. So we all did our best to stay happy the few days before d-day.",
      "D-day came. We measured out around 1.5g for each of us. I wish I had used a better scale, because I think that I might have gotten more (like 2-2.5.)",
      "After smoking a few bowls to chill out and get the munchies, we were ready to shroom!",
      "We put them on a peanut butter sandwich with honey and chowed down. The honey was a big help. I was told that they taste and smell like shit, but this was from a person who hated NORMAL fungi. They were so dry that they didn't really smell like anything, let alone taste bad. All I knew was that the pot wanted me to eat the yummy honey and peanut butter sandwich.",
      "I've read a lot of bad things about these types of drugs, and plenty of stories (on this site even) about people going nuts from one trip. So needless to say I was DAMN nervous, despite my positive mood.",
      "It only took 20 minutes for me to start feeling it. The drapes started to flow. I pointed this out to my companions, and they just laughed. I started describing everything that was happening, and they told me to be quiet.",
      "(Note: most of this is but a very vague memory. I have trouble remembering dreams, and most of this felt like a dream.)",
      "For whatever reason, tears started to come out. Just as I was starting to peak, my friends felt their onset.",
      "I got pretty upset and my girlfriend led me to my room. I lay on the bed and started salivating on myself. I couldn't even talk -- all that would come out is moans. I remember simply wanting it all to go away.",
      "It was like each and every part of my brain was thinking in overdrive. Every aspect of life was being processed at once. I thought of myself as millions of atoms. I looked up at my clock and couldn't understand the concept of counting. Nothing made sense.. it was horrible. I called my girlfriend in and she lay down with me. She turned the lights out.",
      "Big fucking mistake. My brain was going 1000mph and demanded things to process. So what happened when we took away all the cool shit to look at?",
      "All kinds of crazy thoughts. GF summed it up when after 20 minutes she sat up and said 'I think I just went to another dimension.'",
      "After that everything was fine. We joined my friend and concluded that 'you make your own reality. we should be celebrating!'",
      "Life couldn't have been better- we all were in some sort of europhoric happy-ville. Things looked neat. I remember looking at some art book and loving it, but that's about it. The rest of what I remember is very small fragments -- My dog looking like a painting, the TV being in 3d, the walls flowing and breathing. Lots of cool visuals!",
      "But that's about it. I don't even remember having sex. :(",
      "I think the first half of my trip was bad because I was the first one in. Nobody there had ever done it before, so they really didn't know what to say to me when I was freaking out. The peak was REALLY overwhelming..information overload. I had definitely lost all control to the trip and sat in the back of the bus. 6 hours went by after my peak and I only remember maybe a collective minute of it.",
      "We DID smoke some more, though. I do remember that. I forget a lot when I'm stoned, so I'm betting that's what did it. (That's something to consider when thinking about having a first trip. I definitely recommend NOT doing any other drugs.)"

      "Though this may sound like a rediculous and iresponsible combination of substances, it was over a period of 12 hours and at a student party with friends and strangers and I have regretted it since.",
      "18:00 - Arrived at the house and rolled a (moderately sized) joint to be smoke communally between my friends and I.",
      "The high feeling that comes from this set in shortly after/during and I was still able to legibly converse with my companions.  My mood was elevated.",
      "19:00(ish) - Another Joint.",
      "The high feeling that had been had sunken into the distance and we decided to have a topup.",
      "The evening went on with one or two more, and I began drinking at around 21:00 as the music was on and people were arriving.",
      "22:00 - I began feeling very lethargic and decided that a few lines of coke would pick me up, and it did seem to counteract the down pull of the cannabis.",
      "I finished the bottle of cider and continued drinking as the night went on, and aquired a bag of base (speed? was what he refered to it as) from somone we knew.  I couldnt really taste it but remember the feeling of dabbing and swallowing it being very close to that of a very fine dust, like chalk.",
      "1:00(ish) - I could feel a very big buzz from the base and alcohol, and decided it was time to drop the first of my two pills to wake me up a bit.  I felt the familiar rush from the drug and it was disorienting but pleasant, empathising with the fast electronic music at the party and feeling a need to dance.",
      "7:00(ish) - The music was still on but the party was coming to an end, I had consumed the second of my pills at some point but there are big blank patches in my memory.  Music still felt like it was everything to me, and talking to people took on a very meaningful tone though I am not sure i could really understand alot of what was going on around me.  Sleep was the furthest thing from my mind, dispite the time.",
      "8:30 - we had aided in the evacuation of most attendees of the party and i noted having trouble with keeping still and the alcohol had mostly worn off, leaving no noticable residue of after-effects yet.  As the sun was up i noticed my vision wasnt right, i couldnt make out lighting properly as everything seemed to be too vibrant and with a darker colour than normal.  Around this time we relaxed to talk about the night and had a few more joints.  I Halucinated mildly, seeing patterns and movement (pulsating?) textures on my skin and peoples faces but i was comfortable with it and i laughed about it with people.",
      "I couldnt sleep dispite how physically tired i began feeling, the overexertion from the pills being more pronounced in my legs than anywhere else.  The lapses in my memory were making me paranoid and worried about my actions in that intoxicated state, and even after I had slept I was very irritable with a very strong comedown that lasted around two days.  My appetite had completely gone and i didnt eat the following day.",
      "Overall i had a good experience but the come down was so incredibly soul destroying I will not be doing it again, though it did give me time to think of how much damage i could be doing to myself (and more specifically, my mind) and i haven't felt the need to touch the latter three substances since.",
      "For those looking for substances to aid the party atmosphere or to highten awareness, I hope you have found this useful though I would not reccomend mixing drugs unless you really know what you are taking and have good company to watch over you.  Individually, I have found these substances to be very effective and pleasant around large groups of people and music, making the social experience very rewarding."

      "On snorting the full 160mg of K last night I got the biggest head rush of my life. With every pound of my heart I could feel blood rushing through the vessels and reaching every part of my body. My chest began to buzz, my blood seemed warm and seemed to transfer the buzz to my fingers, toes and nose.",
      "The first thing that happened was everything became pixelated, my friends faces became much more like those old computer games where the characters are made of squares. Our voices seemed to be coming out of each other we breathed in unit and spoke over each other and didn't say the same things but completely responded to each other. I felt like I was melting into the floor and this moment and my heart began to feel like it was compressing. Swallowing became such a chore, my breathing caused my heart to beat faster and I could feel every alveoli in my lungs filling with air. I thought I was going to die but my hallucinations were too strong to react to this thought. My body melted onto the floor and I tried lifting up my right hand but found that my skin had melted onto the floor and looked like stringy cheese attached to the floor.",
      "My mind felt like it was left on the blanket and everything went black, the walls of the room were no longer there, it was just me, and my 2 friends lying on a blanket in the middle of darkness. I felt then that I was falling onto my body from above slowly floating down in a circular pattern. When I landed on my body I began to shiver and my jaw wouldnt stop shaking, I seemed to shiver to the beat of the traditional Japanese music we were listening to. We had a weird dialogue were my friend said I am Mark and me and my other friend repeated the exact same thing in the exact same tone and voice but carried the --rk in Mark on for what seemed like hours. I began to feel like I was falling and was getting quite distressed, one of my friends took my hand, which seemed to stop the sensation.",
      "I whole body started to shiver and I began to feel cold. Colours were flashing around me. By this time me and my friends where comprised of just our heads, there were no noticeable body shapes. The eyes were the most striking feature of the face, they looked completely 2D i.e. both on the same side of the face. They were outlined in thick black lines and every blink seemed to change the actual colour of their eyes. The coldness began to take over and I felt like I was getting wet, I straightened my head to look up, even though my head felt like it weighed a ton and a massive wave of water washed us away. I could feel the movement caused by the wave I felt like I was moving away from where we were before it hit us. Next thing I remember we were lying on grainy gold sand and as I turned my head towards my friends they started to take on a more 2D shape and began to look like those hieroglyphs you often see in books.",
      "My friend got up and went to sit on the couch, I was not aware of the couch existing until my friend sat on it and made it light up. I began to ask where I was, my voice pounded in my head, and my mouth would move and speak the words but the time between the 2 seemed so distant. My body didn't feel like it was mine, I had to fight with it to do everything, swallowing would cause me to grab my throat and massage it to make the spit go down. I felt like I was trying to swallow my tongue. I now began to feel warm and comfortable, I kept saying come with me on a journey through time and space which is a line from one of my fave tv programs. I began to see stars and felt like I was floating in space. I invited my friends to come with me to the sun.",
      "I floated, not aware of whether my friends were there or not, towards a bright white light. As I got closer it took on more of a circular shape and the warmth was growing. I began to feel uncomfortable with the heat and began to float away saying to my friends now come with me to Jupiter. I remember passing the Earth on my trip and suddenly felt like as I moved away from the earth towards Jupiter I left tiny particles behind so by the time I reached Jupiter all that was left was my thoughts, I didnt look like me I was just a collection of thoughts.",
      "I don't really remember much after that the next thing I know Im reciting equations in a really monotone voice and the room begins to take more shape. I become aware of the music and can see notes flying from my computer to the ceiling and making the ceiling bounce like the skin of a drum. I am now aware of the lamp shade and can carry out a simple conversation in a monotone voice. My speech seemed slurred but what I was saying seemed to make sense.",
      "The ceiling kept changing shapes. My head still seemed like it was separated from my body and I tried standing up to go to toilet. Walking felt so incredibly strange I couldn't understand how I was causing my legs to move. On the come down I felt like I didn't have control over my body and felt really tired. I lay down on my side and woke up this morning feeling completely normal until I had my first spliff.",
      "I would definitely do this again. I remember feeling so scared at times because I wasnt sure what was going to happen and how long for. The whole trip lasted about 3 hours and was completely surreal. Having done it once I think I would not be so scared the next time as Id know more what to expect. The visual hallucinations seemed to occur in separate stages i.e blocky, then 2D, then out of body etc. After each hallucinatory experience I expected to come down and when I didn't I began to panic a bit but that soon disappeared and I was left calm to enjoy the experience."

      "I've been curious about herbs for the past several weeks after reading about Salvia. I ordered a bunch of different things online, including Blue or Sacred Lotus, that is, Nelumbo nucifera and NOT Blue Lily i.e. Nymphaea Caerulea, the two of which seem to get mixed up by almost every online vendor I visited.",
      "First I tried smoking Blue Lotus - I smoked about 2 grams in a water pipe and didn't feel anything that I could really distinguish from baseline. Did the same in blends with Dagga flowers and Salvia. I kept it hot and held it in for 15 to 20 seconds - nothing. So I'll wait for my extract resin to arrive and try smoking that instead to figure if I can get a buzz from Nuciferin.",
      "On another day I discovered something that I thought was remarkable. I placed a few crumbs and stems of cannabis below a small bowl full of Blue Lotus (~ 1/2 gram). The Cannabis was what a friend had left behind after rolling a joint the night before - It was the kind of thing I'd just brush into the trash. It was nothing. Maybe three small (3-4 mm) stem pieces and a few measly specks. Not even fit for a rasta mouse. I smoked the combo and felt HIGH. It was a slightly different high - I was being silly, and I experienced a heightened visual sensation and a slowing of time. There was also no paranoia.",
      "All of this is remarkable because I usually have a day's worth of pretty well established tolerance to cannabis after smoking a lot of it the night before. So it seemed to me the Lotus had some synergy with the Cannabis (given that I had smoked about as much pot as I could fit under my thumbnail), which was fortunate. Now I just need to get my hands on some more Cannabis.  ",
      "That day I placed 5 grams of dried Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera - don't forget) in a small bottle together with 2 oz of 190 proof Everclear and heated it in a pot of boiling water on the stove top for five minutes. I then let the herbal extraction sit for a full 24 hours. When shaken the extract had a milky look to it. When I let it settle I could see globules of insoluble extracted material floating around in the alcohol (like oil in water, but not exactly). I took this to mean that it was a good, strong extraction. I mixed 1 oz of this with a small glass of orange juice and drank it down a few minutes before a friend came to pick me up for a poker game. I had already eaten so my stomach was full.",
      "Within 20 minutes a feeling of calm washed over me. I remember sitting in the passenger seat very loosely, and everything seemed kind of quiet, like driving around downtown at 4 AM - the surroundings are associated with activity and general 'noise', but there is an eerie calm because no-one's around. We weren't driving downtown but that's the feeling I got - no bother from external stimulus. This is despite the fact that my notoriously longwinded friend was STILL talking. That didn't bother me either. I felt good and had a strong suspicion that it was the Lotus extract (and not the Everclear as I drank it on a full stomach).",
      "The other thing I noticed was that I 'was on'. When we arrived at the poker game we meet a large group of card players (co-workers) I didn't feel as aloof as usual. I felt good about the impression I was making. In a genuine sense - I was relaxed enough to start a conversation with anyone, or cajole the entire group and managed to hold my own. I know now, this was a result of having my mood lifted, which I attribute to the Lotus.",
      "The Lotus didn't do anything for my poker game though. I would have to say that the noticeable effects of drinking the herbal extract lasted about 90 minutes. Then I concentrated on not losing so badly.",
      "Of course I could be dead wrong - maybe the reason I felt high when I smoked Blue Lotus with weed is because I smoked it with weed, and maybe the reason I felt good after drinking an Everclear extraction was because I drank Everclear. Still, I thought I'd provide my experiences here and let you judge for yourselves. Seems there wasn't much reported on Nelumbo nucifera."

      "It didn't take long for me to find my bed. I could feel something coming on but concurrently I was relaxed and wanted to lay down. I feel asleep very shortly and awoke. I was enjoying my environment a little better and thats when I started looking at the glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. They began moving distaces of a few feet or so, moving in all directions. As hour 1 was approaching I didn't know what to expect since some of the things I saw were pretty intense for this short amount of time. Another half hour passed and I took to the outdoors. It was a cool breezy night with fast, dark moving clouds that caught my attention. I felt completely at peace with everything around me. I observed beauty in everything I saw and felt exhilerated by having the wind blow through my soul. I knew I belonged in this beauty as an intrical part of the surrounding environment. I danced with the wind, although I as a rule of thumb don't dance. I am not particularily religious but I felt God speaking to me telling me that everything was alright. I was the pupil in this mental conversation as God showed me the beauty in everything and how that was for me and everybody to experience. I wept at this beauty that now surrounded me. I wished everybody could remove themselves from the meaningless stress that they endure and join me in seeing what life was really like.",
      "As the 4th hour encroached I put a headset on. I played Hendrix and could feel electric energy shoot through my entire body on every note. The wind complemented the music, adding it's own value to this mind-blowing experience. Soon I wasn't sure if the wind was influencing the music, or the music comanding the wind...it was all so interconnected and it all moved through my body. I felt love, and grasped everything at a higher plane than I'd ever perceived on any other psychadelic experience. Even when dealing with things like death that may be scarey on acid, now it was a part of life that was beautiful in its own respect. I stayed outside all night, watching the natural splendor that surrouded me. Everything contained beauty and so watching things was to observe and feel the beauty of these objects for the first time.",
      "LSD and DXM both come to a peak when I use them but here it came in waves all night long. For a half hour I would experience intense hallucination and then 45 minutes later I would feel it again. This experience lasted 18+ hours.",
      "I did look like I was on some heavy drugs while doing this and it appeared that even the most naive person could pick up on what I was doing if I were out in public.",
      "My experience that evening has had a profound impact on me. I have retained great insight on what is really important in life and try to live my life in accordance with this. I don't think I'll ever forget what happened that evening."

      "I write this to inform you that the socalled 'elves' described by numerous DMT trippers can also play tricks on you.",
      "I'd used DMT, which I extracted myself, several times before, with varying degrees of success but all generally positive. This was my first negative experience.",
      "My girlfriend had just left and was due to return in an hour or so, I told her that i'd be doing some DMT while she was gone.",
      "So I sat on my bed, arranged some cushions and packed the pipe up. I decided that this time i'd smoke up without any music - to see if I could hear any alien music, (Im a musician, and thought that this might be valuable).",
      "As I smoked, the experience felt different. I knew it wasn't going to be too good as I smoked it up. Instead of a colorful, kalidoscopic interplay of happy elves, what I got can only be described as a self-folding freaky forest of infinity...",
      "I could see alien trees and canopy, gnarled and ominous (though i'd hesitate to say evil) and certainly freaky, but not terror inducing. Scary. unsettling.",
      "The forest folded itself over and over, in several dimensions I can't possibly describe. all the while I could hear the elves communicating to me 'were the happy little elves... happy... happy... HAPPY little elves!!!'",
      "I got the impression that they loved me, as usual, but were communicating to me that DMT wasn't a toy to be played with as I pleased. It was a useful tool, and should only be done with plenty of time to spare and a prepared setting.",
      "Later that night, we went out and had some red wine with friends, which was enjoyable. I told them about my negative elf experience, which ulthough frightening, had left me with a more accurate outlook on the DMT experience. It is a learning mechanism, not a toy...",
      "Much later that night, after the red wine, I woke up in my bed to see a wall lamp (with a sumbraero that i'd put on it) transfigured, It looked as a hideous corpse head with putrid white skin stretched over its boney face. I vomited a little in my mouth. And then, Snap. no vomit. I tried to roll left or right in an effort to make the hideous face go away... It stared at me unblinking. horrible. And then, after what felt like an age, the face was gone. I looked around for the vomit, there was none.",
      "Very odd. I rolled over and went to sleep.",
      "Later again that night, I heard the front door open. My flatmate must have returned. Then, at my bedroom door there was a knock. It was my flatmate, he poked his head in, and came into the room. 'its too late, its really late' I slurred, sleepy and still slightly drunk. 'I just need this for work' he said, proceeding to take something from my desk.",
      "In the morning, I woke up, and wondered what he had taken. I went to the toilet and found his room empty. He must have left, I thought. Later that night, he returned. I questioned him on the late night disturbance, to which he replied that he hadn't returned home yet. 'very weird' I said to him...",
      "There was also nothing valuable in the area of my desk that he apparently took something from."

      "The Year 1999 was the year of my very first 'astro-plane' LSD experience. I became what many call an 'adventurer of the unknown', a 'cliff-rider', 'ledge-walker'. I had experienced perception-shifted inducers before, in small doses, but not to this extent with LSD. Mushrooms, sure, but not with LSD.",
      "I knew this girl, who was already graduated, had a kid, but also had a nasty habit with needles. This nasty habit was so strong that it consumed her life. One night she informed me that she had received some interested LSD with pyramids on it. I, as I had been fascinated with perception shifting 'alterations' for a few years now, was enthralled to aquire these from her. When I asked what it would cost, she said 'Just come out with me tonight on this run, and you can have it for free'. Well, how was I to turn that down? A visceral, mystical experience that would be 'given' to me for a little bit of my time?",
      "Well, needless to say, where she took me was a stomach-turning affair. Lets just say that needle-fiends, or even worse, needle-fiends that peddle their wares don't make for a fun companion, even if it was for only a few hours. It was at about midnight when she finally dropped me off at home. I was very disgusted with her, but kept it to myself, after all I could relate with her (her being a human being and me understanding the lure that freedom, ease of pain and thirst for ultimate knowledge). In my pocket, four hits of LSD wrapped in tin foil. I eagerly raced to my basement bedroom and unwrapped the foil. Four, cleanly cut squares lay before me, each revealing either a full or partial dark blue/black pyramid that bore an eye in the center. Intrigued, I prepared myself for a long journey. Closing my door, getting comfortable and dimming the lights, I put on some ambient music and dosed.",
      "Amazing LSD, that is not in droplet form, takes a while to begin. At least in me it does. Of course, the initial muscle weirdness and odd taste begins almost instantly, mostly from the anticipation I believe. I laid in bed and stared up at my popcorn-like ceiling. I had four candles lit, two on the left side of my room, and two on the right side. I had Aphex Twin's 'Ambient' playing softly in the background. At this point, I would like to mention that I still lived with my parents. I was in high school after all. One of the odd things about living at home and having a deep interest in perception-altering things, is that I never knew when my parents might come to check up on me, which is what my father did.",
      "It had been about one hour since I dosed, I was starting to feel the initial effects, when my father opened my door. He wanted to see how I was, he wanted to talk. So we talked. He had no idea what was about to transpire in my bedroom. During our friendly little chat, I could feel a welling deep inside me, pulsating and dancing to the music I had playing in the background. I was staring at the ceiling as I was talking to my father, and I started to notice the odd fractal and flower petal patterns that I always see on LSD. It was beginning. My stomach got the usual 'empty' feeling I get when the experience kicks off. Its like there is a hole in me, a huge one. But not in a bad way. Maybe it was the feeling of becoming very light, of becoming light itself. This is where I faked being tired so that I could be alone. I knew that in a few minutes, I would not even be able to look into my fathers eyes, I would be in another world.",
      "My room was only lit by candlelight, and my body felt like it was racing faster than sound. The fractal patterns and flower petal shapes spilled onto my breathing walls and my swirling carpet, swaying and slithering around like snakes. I loved this part of the experience. I giggled with glee.  The candles flames danced and created the most wonderful, yet frightful shapes all over my room. I grew antsy and could not lie down any longer, I had to pace around. As I got out of my bed, I felt like I immersed myself in water, in a huge ocean. It was very thick, yet smooth. I could feel pressure on my chest, like waves crashing onto me, and my arms and legs had much difficulty moving around. My whole body tingled and pulsated. I started swaying and sort of dancing in a trance to the ambient music, which turned into shapes inside me. I must have danced like that for a long time, yet only a half an hour had passed.",
      "I then decided that I wanted the dark. I blew out the candles, which spilt wax all over the place, and basked in the oddly smelling candle smoke that seemed to fill the darkness. The stereo lights were the only source of illumination, and with it I could see the smoke, as if it was plastic, heavily moving through the air. Once I was immersed in the darkness, I was thrust into another world. A world almost like my bedroom, but vastly different. I got the urge to speak, and I spoke. But every time I said something, it echoed repeatedly, over and over again, like a cycle. I remember feeling that this was very interesting. I must have spoken every word I could muster, just so I could hear it cycle around my room. It was in this precise moment, that I realized that words have power. They are tangible and really heavy things. I watched as my words bounced off of my breathing walls. My words were never harsh, so they bounced lightly and floated through the air.",
      "At this time, the epiphanies and out-of-this-world Deja-vus began. Those realizations of the world, everything in it and my life. My choices, what I needed to do, what I needed to accomplish. Feelings, my feelings, alien feelings surged through me. Visions rattled in front of me. I lost my body and became no-thing, maybe a source of dark light. I floated around my room, which became a grid-like cube. I watched as everything in our known rational world, and everything outside of our rational world was placed somewhere on this grid. I could see it all. I danced around the planets and stars, played with every animal I had ever seen, and bathed in an endless ocean of energy that envigorated me.",
      "The next thing I remember was that I was in/on my bed. I couldn't tell because my body was gone still. Something caught my attention, the grid-like world dissolved and I saw a mirror. My bedroom mirror. In its reflection, I could see this teddy bear that a girl had given me, it danced around and spoke to itself. It even made angry, almost menacing faces/gestures at me. I got scared, which made me laugh to myself, and I stuck my tongue out at it and made raspberry sounds. Then, I got this sudden urge to push my face up against my mirror. I wanted to touch this mirror, smell it, pass through it. In its reflection I could see what looked like my bedroom, but it was somehow different. I wanted so badly to stick my arm inside the mirror, but I was taken aback by an image that began to materialize. I saw towering sky scrapers, those found in big cities, toppling, crumbling and being destroyed. I could literally see this right before me, in the mirror. I remember feeling that the world was ending. That humanity was to pay for our disgressions and our harm to all living things that we feel are 'inferior'. 'This was it' I felt. It turned around and behind me more building were crumbling, as if massive giants brought to their knees.",
      "I saw flying beings swooping down from the blackened sky, doing things I could not see, or things that were so far beyond that I had never seen them before. These were not angels, but dragon-lizard like beings. They looked at me and told me, without words, that they were ancient and far older than anything humans had ever known of. They were not dinosaurs or anything like that. I asked them where they were from, not in words, yet they would not tell me. I sensed that they were deeply linked to Earth somehow. They were not like the dragons from story books, more ancient, and more 'real'. Terrifying. I thought they wanted to hurt me and I felt massive fear. It was then that my body came back. I felt it weigh me down and slump me onto my bed. The fear welled up so great that I cowered on my bed.",
      "I noticed then that the music had changed, I could hear clanging industrial music playing, that of a Nine Inch Nails remix song. I saw the world ending to the beat of this song. Buildings turned to rubble, massive holes punched into the cities, people dying everywhere. Massive pits of dead bodies and skeletons.",
      "I could not remember what had happened after that, but my bedroom was back, and I did not feel the fear anymore. I way laying on my stomach, staring at the darkness. The images were still in my head, and I really wanted to know who those lizard-dragon type beings were and what relation they had to earth. Yet, everything dissolved and I was on a new train of feelings. I had discovered my physical body again and began exploring the sensation of my body. I rolled and squirmed around on the carpet, and played with my hands, my hair. I watched the wonderful fractal patterns dance around my room, and in my eyelids.",
      "I could tell that the LSD was taking its course. The peaks were done, all that was left was the coming down.",
      "And this is the part that I dread the most, especially with LSD that is 'dirty'. Don't get me wrong, this was great LSD, but in terms of purity, it felt like the 'bottom barrel' left-overs. Strycnine heaven! My body ached, like it had been turned inside out and back in again. My head reeled from twisting visions and flower petal designs that over took my room. This is when I glanced at my alarm clock, which I had forgotten existed (I forgot about time itself), and noticed that I would have to go to school in about 4 hours! I panicked, but then realized that I would come down before then.",
      "The last hours of my experience were of a calm and resting nature. Pretty soon I was tired, worn out, like I had experienced too much in one night. Its a usual feeling after an intense trip. Like I have traversed many worlds in the span of a moment. When the sun was shining and it was about 7am, I got ready for school and tried to eat some cereal. I stared into my bowl, watching the milk and thinking about what I had seen on my journey. I felt like I knew a forbidden secret (a feeling that is most prevalent during my perception-shifting experiences), some hidden knowledge or wisdom that the rest of the world did not. Thats when I realized that those who take perception shifters are walking the path of the shaman. It is the shamans task to explore the unknown, learn the vast secrets of the universe and bring them back to our dimension.",
      "This turned out to be my very first 'intense' LSD experience, but it would not be the most intense, or my last."

      "I just wanted to share my usage with the Herb Kratom with other users and people that are interested with the Mitragyna speciosa tree.  To date of this writing I have used Kratom approx. 200 times within the last year, and daily for the last 4 months.   ",
      "I got cancer (hodgkins) in the fall of 2003 and with chemotherapy it went away nicely and still today (2007) there has been no reoccurrence.  Unfortunately the chemo has left my body to a lot of aching and bone and muscle pain.  Also I work outside daily and walk approx. 6 miles a day so this doesnt add to my pain.",
      "Anyhow back to Kratom.  I first used it about 1 year ago to find out what its effects are due to curiosity.  Now one year later I am thanking Kratom deeply.  When one is using Kratom they are what I call 'Kratomized' lol.",
      "I make a tea out of Kratom grinding 6 grams of leaf and adding a splash of concentrated lemon juice and eight ounces of water.  I boil down to 4 ounces, strain, and drink the liquid.  Its amazing how something taken orally can create affects so quickly in the body hence within 10 minutes I feel 'all' body pain to disperse.  Kratom also has a slightly 'mood elevating' properties though I can continue to go about daily chores without any problems, ie. driving.  Lastly the third property I use Kratom for is its stimulating effects.  I used cocaine a few times when I was in my early 20s and the speedy feelings along with the mood elevating effects are very similar to using a small amount of cocaine minus the racing heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. ",
      "Also there is no 'crash' with Kratom.  Its effects last for approx. 6 hours and only very gradually diminish.  I usually drink my tea in the morning before work and its properties really help me work harder, smarter, and get my work done faster.  I also have to have a lot of bloodwork done at the Dr. office regularly.  Never have I had elevated liver or kidney levels with brings me to believe that Kratom 'doesnt' wreak havoc on the liver or kidneys (since being consumed orally I would most worry about these organs being hurt or damaged).  Ived heard that people who smoke opium or use a high dose of pharm. opiates develop a 'itch'.  I sometimes, not much anymore, get this itch from Kratom use mostly on my chest.  Actually I enjoy it and its most pleasing to have for me oddly enough. ",
      "The only downside is that sometimes Kratom can cause a slight upset stomach.  I make sure to eat a good amount (my breakfast) after Kratom ingesting and this helps %90 percent of the time.",
      "I know from reading online forums a lot of people say Kratom is addicting and no better than a Vicodin addiction.  Id have to disagree as Kratom leaves me with no withdrawals physically and as far as mentally anything that helps pain, makes me feel slightly better mentally, and gives me plenty of energy. ",
      "There are things in life, and I feel Kratom is one of them that are a sort of 'Eden' and can be used often and have continuing positive results.  My body has never developed a tolerance to Kratom ( I use 6 grams daily).  I do find though that abstaining from Kratom and then using it makes the herb work slightly better."

      "To anyone who likes to take pharms for their highs...Seroquel is not for them, lol, it'll knock them on their ass, that is, unless they like the drowsy, lightheaded-until-you-pass-out, antipsychotic that it is.",
      "Anyways, I used to have lots of problems...I was a serial monogamist, err, meaning I hooked up a lot and then dumped them shortly after getting what I wanted, which was pretty much only sex. Man I was so smooth too, lol. My parents owned a few businesses so I had plenty of cash to spend, so I could pretty much get whoever I wanted. I remember being called an 'asshole,' I guess that pretty much described me at the time.",
      "After talking to a psychiatrist about some depression I was going through she Dx'd me with a personality disorder plus major depression and we started going through all kinds of drugs trying to find the right one. After a few months we started on Seroquel, first at a low dose like the manufacturer and USP says to, and then going up to around 250-350mg a day with about 1/3 of it taken during the day and 2/3 of it at night. This drug absolutely saved my life, with all the self destructive behavior I was going through and the endless abyss of depression I had, I'd be dead by now, if not for the drug.",
      "Yeah it did kinda fuck with my head the first few weeks, but after a few months it wore off -- I took it it all the time -- and you felt pretty damned good...not in a manic way, but a good way, kinda like I was Jesus Jones...except I condemn religion in my apartment lol. But yeah, anyone out there who is really depressed like I was/am, might want to talk to their doctor about getting on Seroquel, plus an anti-depressant for good measure like effexor or duloxetene.",
      "Anyways right now, I haven't hooked up in six months or more because well really I don't feel the need to go and use someone just for a night and then ruin their feelings like I used to love doing. Plus I'm comfortable about myself enough to start taking over my families business. I'd call myself a success on Seroquel.",
      "Oh, big plus: At least for me, it seems Seroquel gives a big plus to my sex life... makes it, uh, more fun, heh. Anyways, for me.",

      " I was in my room (which was in the basement of my house) by myself listening to some Manson. I heard you could catch a 'buzz' off of inhalers. I smoked pot once and tried wall hits before but never had a powerful drug experience. I attached my arrow chamber (a tube that connects to inhaler to ensure you get all the medicine) to my inhaler and took 10-15 sprays. I then grabbed my neck with my hands to cut off the circulation and past out in front of my waterbed. I did this 2 more times, and when I woke up after passing out the 3rd time, I remember thinking, 'This isnt so bad.' I looked in the mirror on my waterbed and saw white dots fly horizontally across vision. I laughed a few times then everything seemed to go wrong.",
      " I had a huge rush fly through my body, and heart rate picked up rapidly. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were extremely red. This led me to think I was some sort of devil. I stood up quickly and my vision became very distorted and choppy. My vision became so choppy, it seemed I had a frame rate of 1 frame per 5 seconds. The next thing I remember, I was standing on the other side my waterbed freaking out. I kept leaving my body over and over. It felt like I was being ripped out of my body and thrown back in every second, but the seconds felt like a lifetime. I could here the Manson song in the background, a very repetitive song that kept chanting, 'No salvation, hah hah, no forgiveness.' Those were the only words said for several minutes, and it made me feel like my life was a broken record for eternity.",
      "Finally I stopped leaving my body and began to panic and run around my room trying to cry, but I couldnt seem to shed a tear. My nose and lungs felt like they were freezing, and I was breathing very hard but wasnt getting much oxygen. I ran to my CD player and turned it off. The music being gone felt like a relief somewhat but I was still very horrified. I sat back in my blow up chair. I could feel my heart beat very hard and it felt like I was rocking back and forth.",
      "This truly was the worst experience I have ever had. Everything I looked at would move in a circular rotation, like it was floating, even 4-5 months after the experience. Stairs I walked up would jump around left to right. I had flashbacks several times a week at first, which gradually decreased to none 1 1/2 years later. I also had severe depression and phobias such as agoraphobia and paranoia. I thought people were poisoning me and putting acid in my food. This paranoia lasted 3 years, and so did the panic attacks I had every day!!! I definitely do not recommend doing inhalants, they ruined my high school years and maybe some future years to come."

      "I was able to obtain a chuspa, 140g of dried leaves and a small ball of llipta from Peru for a relatively low price. ",
      "On the night of my initial test, I had been suffering flu-like symptoms including respiratory difficulty and an upset stomach. I had read how the coca leaf can be beneficial with both symptoms. ",
      "I made a quid of around 15-20 medium sized leaves and smeared about 1/4' round ball of llipta inside it and placed it in my cheek.  It took a minute for the leaves to rehydrate from my saliva before I slowly started chewing.  I would chew a few times then let it sit in my cheek for a minute or two until my mouth was full of an astringent and numbing saliva.  I continued this process for about an hour, swallowing a little of the juices but harboring most in my mouth and cheeks.  I've read reports that say both to swallow and not to - but I believe that swallowing some of the juices helped strengthen the effect.",
      "After the hour the leaves were mostly pulverized and I finally spit them out.  The effect that had been generated was a rather noticeable energy w/ an underlying twinge of paranoia.  For the greater part I was at ease and alert.   I did notice that it was considerably easier to breath and that my stomach was feeling better.  The effect gradually faded over the course of an hour after chewing them.",
      "The experience was not that of drugs, but of a medicinal herbal nature.  Coca leaves make an excellent and nutritious alternative to coffee whether chewed or drank in tea.  They can aid in minor illnesses such as upset stomach and work as a bronchial dilator.  I have added coca leaves to my outdoor supplies as I spend a lot of time in the mountains over 9,000ft.  They will come in handy for hiking - allowing me to breathe better in high altitude/stressful situations and to ease or prevent altitude sickness."

      "Last night was my second time trying Salvia Divinorum and I was not trying to get as high as my first time trying it, but was trying it out for medicinal use since I have had a cold lately, so I loaded up a small bowl into my 14 inch bong and cleared the bowl in 1 hit, held the hit approximately 15 seconds then coughed it out since its harder for me to hold it in while sick, this produced a ringing noise in my ears and tingling sensation in my back, after about 3 minutes I loaded another (larger) bowl into the bong and cleared it in 1 hit as well, this time I was able to count to 30 and exhale, upon exhaling the typical trip started to set in, and I had mild visuals and the gravitational effects.",
      "After about 5 minutes these subsided and I just had a euphoric feeling and realized that my nose was no longer clogged, I no longer had a headache and I did not feel like I had a fever, I actually felt quite well, better than I usually do on normal days. After about 35-40 minutes the cold symptoms gradually came back however so this does not seem like a practical remedy for symptoms unless you take it just before bed so that you can fall asleep in peace. I am contemplating mixing Salvia Divinorum with tobacco and rolling it in a cigarette for possible symptom relief without hallucinogenic results when I am at work."

      "I am not a user of these substances.  However, my partner of one year is (was) an ex-junkie.  He had been clean for the last fourteen months.  I use the term 'had' because, unfortunately, he 'used' again and it resulted in his death from an overdose, which caused a fatal brain aneurysm.  I did not know about these substances until I came to this Erowid Web Site.  I am now much more informed than ever before and can recognize many of the symptoms described by other 'users' and their experiences.  I am not telling this story to condone or dissuade anyone from living their own lives in any manner in which they choose.  I just want to share this as an example (warning) of what is possible. ",
      "My darling partner, unbeknownst to me, had earlier in the morning injected himself with approx. 50cc of Meth, (this info was verified by a friend who had been involved). Later that evening, we journeyed out of town to visit some of his friends.  I am assuming that he 'connected' while gone to the grocery store for cigarettes and when he returned, we left to go out to grab a bite to eat. While awaiting the arrival of our meal, my darling and one of his friends went into the restroom and 'fixed' approx. 30cc of Heroin. I do not know how much of this mixture was water and how much of it was Heroin...I only know that a second syringe was found containing 30cc of mixture later in his boot while we were at the ER.",
      "About 5 minutes after returning to our table in the restaurant, my honey looked at me, winked one eye, smiled and then proceeded to 'nod' out over the table.  I was panic stricken and when I raised his head up off of the table, I noticed that his lips were blue!!  I immediately wanted to call 911, but his friend refused to do so or allow me to do so.  I, in the meantime, was busy blowing breathe into my sweetheart's mouth with all of my strength, trying to get him to start breathing in a regular pattern.  I had felt for a heartbeat, and thank God he had a strong one at that point in time.  His friend then dragged my darling out into the car that we had arrived in and his friend began to vomit all over the place. ",
      "At that point, I knew something was definitely not right and begged my friends to PLEASE call an ambulance or someone.  They again refused and I know that it was because illegal drugs had been involved and they were all afraid.  For several miles while driving down the highway, I continued to check my partner's breathing and heartbeat patterns for signs of change.  We had traveled perhaps 10 miles when I noticed that his breathing had ceased and his heartbeat was very weak and erratic.  I screamed for his friends to STOP the car and that was it - I was going to call 911 whether they liked it or not!!  I kicked open the back door of the car and pulled my sweetheart out into the parking lot of a gas station (which was not an easy thing to do considering I weigh only 120lbs) and proceeded to strip off his shirt and boots so that I could begin CPR more properly. ",
      "On and off during the procedure, my partner kept vomiting and so I kept having to stop the CPR to roll him over onto his side so that the did not aspirate any of the vomitus.  It was an agonizing time while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance - I kept alternating between screaming out to God to save him and trying desperately to perform CPR correctly.  By the time they did arrive, my darling was not breathing on his own and his lips and hands were turning the most frightening color of pale blue! The trip to the hospital was sheer agony for me, knowing that things were not going very well at all in the back of that ambulance. ",
      "By the time we arrived at the ER, my darling was still not breathing on his own (btw - the paramedics had administered two doses of Narcan to reverse the 'OD' of the Heroin - always be honest with the medical personnel at this point - it could save a loved one's life) and it did not look like he was going to make it out of that ER alive!  45 minutes after arriving at the ER, the doctor had the unfortunate task of informing me that my loved one had in fact suffered a fatal brain aneurysm from the drug overdose and was too damaged to undergo any kind of corrective surgery.  In addition, after a CAT scan and MRI were performed, I was told that there was no brain activity left at all.  My darling sweetheart was transferred to a CCU bed and kept on life-support and medications throughout the night.  It was the worst experience of my life!  He had no other bodily functions except for a heartbeat.  His brain began to swell as a result of the aneurysm and body fluids began to leak out from every orifice.  It was a losing battle to keep the fluids wiped/suctioned up from his precious body. ",
      "By ten o'clock the next morning, we knew that it was time to make a decision.  One that will haunt me for the rest of my life - the love of my life, my soul mate, essentially was gone from me...only a weak heartbeat remained. The ventilators and tubes were all removed from him and I was allowed to hold him in my arms until his heart stopped beating.  I continued to hold him until his body grew cold and his face and hands turned stiff and dusky blue.  We had only begun a new life together and now he was gone, forever!!  All of our plans and dreams were gone without warning - I didn't even get a chance to tell him goodbye or that I loved him because he never regained consciousness after he first 'nodded' out at the restaurant.  It has only been two weeks since my soul mate departed this world and this is the first time I have told this story to anyone. ",
      "All I can say is PLEASE be careful if you are 'using' and think of those persons around you who love and care for you.  My darling lost his battle with addiction in the most horrible of ways...and I am left alone in the darkness without my shining light!!"

      "Hello, I am writing about an herb I discovered at a local headshop.  I have read about another herb called 'blue lotus', and I was very interested in trying it out.  To this day, as I write this, I have yet to try blue lotus, and I wanted to try a legal herb to take my mind off of marijuana and such.",
      "I can say I am quite experienced in the pot-smoking business, and am no stranger to the 'high', so when I smoke I am very responsible and still quite intelligent whereas my friends... well they were friends, just couldn't function as people normally under it.",
      "So I'd like to get to the point.  So I went to my local headshop with my dad (I'm under 18, and my dad is very cool with my potsmoking, but still sort-of discourages it) but they did not have any blue lotus there.  However, he still emerged with a bag of 'buddha's blend'.  So he bought an ounce (28 grams) for only $5.95.  Not bad!  And it came with 33 rolling papers as well.  So my dad rolls up a big beautiful joint (he was a HEAVY smoker in the 70's, and I've never seen such a marvelous joint before!) and we smoke it.  Well, the hits were quite rough.  The high did not hit me until 5-10 minutes after.  Very strange and slow onset for smoke, but when it finally hit me colors appeared... different.  Colors were not brighter or beautiful or awe-inspiring, but they were... different.  Hard to explain.  It was also, without any shadow of a doubt, a subtle body high.  I was very giggly and couldn't seem to sit still.",
      "As I say though, the high was very subtle.  But my dad kept claiming that he was 'totally fucked up'.  I found this rather strange, for I was not nearly 'tripping' as hard as he was.  It wasn't like a weed-high for him, but high enough for him to be 'fucked up'.  So I had my best friend, Allie, come over and we experimented with this herb.  We are both experienced pot-smokers.  So we loaded a large bowl in a 'water-pipe' and we ripped away.  The hits were incredibly harsh.  At first, according to her, she felt a subtle high as well, but like me her high came down in less than 30 minutes.  We reached the conclusion that if you were a pot smoker, we had an astounding tolerance to 'buddha's blend'.",
      "Another thing I'd like to point out was that I could only catch the BUZZ once a day, lasting 30-40 minutes, but no matter how much I smoked I couldn't seem to ever catch a buzz again until the next day.  The color effects and a very distinct lack of coordination strengthened with every bowl and joint- but only to a degree.  I felt pretty annoyed by this, having a 'pre-tolerance' to this stuff.  The buzz tolerance is shortlived, but builds up like a motherfucker.  I had gone through five bowls and three joints with Allie (about 10 grams) and just could not get a high.",
      "Overall, I think this is some pretty strange stuff.  It's relaxing, and for six bucks an ounce I can't say it's a substitution for Marijuana but if I am waiting on a prick-of-a-dealer, this herb will definetly help me occupy my time.  I still look forward to trying Blue Lotus, and I hear its not super or anything, that it just 'mellows you out' (according to my brother), but mellowing is just fine by me.  Afterall, I smoke weed to mellow out :)"

      "Firstly, I'd like to go over a few things about myself. I find myself as an intelligent, strong minded individual. I have been experimenting with acid recently, and love the way that I use my mind while i am on it. Up to this point, I have never had a bad experience with drugs, save getting a little paranoid after smoking. This experience was my first bad one, and I feel that it's worth it for you guys to know.",
      "This is my tale of DOB and cocaine.",
      "I had just gotten off of work. My friends had apparently gotten a hold of some AWESOME ACID. We found out 2 days later that it was actually DOB. I dropped the 2 hits of DOB and got prepared for the ride of my life.",
      "We hung out for a while, watched a skate video called 'Yeah Right!', which was actually pretty decent, and smoked a little maryjane. I only took a couple of hits, not even really enough to get a buzz. For the next few hours I kinda just walked around my backyard, waiting for the normal perception and headchange that I was used to from acid.",
      "2 1/2 to 3 hours after injesting the DOB I started to feel the effects. I had a slight euphoric feeling and everything became much more vibrant and colorful than it normally was. People seemed distant, their eyes wide and paranoid. A friend of mine, who had happened onto some free cocaine, gave me a gram and told me to have a nice night. I took 2 semi-large lines off of the top of an old television and rubbed some around the inside of my mouth.",
      "At this point I could hardly feel myself at all. I felt that I was living through my eyes only and that I was actually watching myself exist rather than existing.",
      "One of my friends began to panic about some girl that he felt very strongly for and disappeared without saying a word. Myself being a kindhearted person got very worried about him and began looking everywhere for him. I found him sitting on top of an AC unit at my neighbor's house, and talked to him for a few minutes about his problem.",
      "After talking, we went into my house and sat in the dark in a large room in the back of my house. I fell to my knees and began to pray. I felt that I had done something wrong that needed repentance, and started to freak out just a little bit. As I stared into my couch, I began to see staircases scrolling downward in the back of my couch. The entire room was lit up with a glowing blue light, even though the lights had been off for quite a long time. I began to get very paranoid, feeling that I had ruined my life and that, up to this point, I had been lying to myself about many things.",
      "I grabbed a sketchpad and began to draw. My hand was shaking violently, and I heard multiple voices in my head. As I would think, these voices would contradict me, and then each other. I tried to silence the voices and clear my mind, but there was no stopping them. I was almost positive that I had gone completely insane, and really began to freak out.",
      "I noticed at this point that my friend who was worried about his girl had left, and went outside to find him. I felt nothing in my body. My perception was strewed, and everything felt as if it were not real. My entire plane of vision tilted from left to right as I walked. I looked up at the sky and searched for some answer, but could find none.",
      "I walked back into the back, hoping that maybe my friend had gone there. Unfortunately he had not. I was really freaking out by this time, and no one could really understand that. It was at this point I realized that this couldn't have been acid. I saw patterns and visual swirls, but didn't feel a headchange or the other normal things that I feel on an acid trip.",
      "For the next 6 or 7 hours I freaked out, eventually winding up drawing again on my couch. My mom awoke and told me that I could go to sleep in her room, seeing as I had work at 5pm that day [it was around 9 or 10am at this point.] As I laid there, all I could think about was my life and the kind of person that I had become. I started crying, which I don't do very often, and could not stop. for the next 6 hours I cried, rehashing what was important to me, what I wanted to do with my life, and what I needed to be truly happy.",
      "I went and talked to my mother, who sent me into another tyrade of tears. After talking to her for a few hours, I had to go to work. I had gotten this job one day before this experience and hadn't been to sleep since the last time I had been in. Every color stood out, every direction was strewed. I couldn't think straight, but somehow I managed my way through the night.",
      "When I arrived back home after work, I felt no urge to sleep, and almost felt that I would never be able to sleep again. After an hour or two of laying down watching my friend play WoW, I drifted off into a peaceful sleep. When I awoke the next day, everything was back to normal.",
      "All I can really say about this experience is that it changed my life. After being completely insane for 2 days, it was nice to wake up from it unharmed."

      "For such a nasty, cheap street drug, heroin has held a glamour about itself, or maybe in my own mind.  My favorite singer Janis Joplin died on the stuff.  Maybe because I so idolized her, thats why I developed the rock star mentality concerning illicit substances.  Of course, I always connected Heroin with needles, so if anyone asked me to try, I was quite prudish in my decision to say no.  Very condescending, having no respect for anyone playing with this AIDS drug.  I was the D.A.R.E poster child when it came to this.  That would all change one night though.  For a drug I connected to viral and staph infections, later I would soon be begging to molest my senses.  Never in a month of decades would I have ever thought Id exchange this set of values, just to know what Joplin experienced in the last few hours of her life.  ",
      "At the time, I was a dabbler.  I had only smoked weed and snorted Cocaine.  I was green broke at best, but heroin is in a class by itself.  I heard one Junkie say, You have to need heroin.  And hes probably right.  In my experience, boys love The boy.  And this morphine bastard has a greater appeal to the opposite sex.  Being a girl, I naturally loved Coke, and stimulants.  But the picture heroin users portrayed at the house I was at the first night I tried heroin made me abandon my preconceived notions about this drug.",
      "Unlike cokeheads, there was no impatient twitching, apparent paranoia and suspicion.  I always felt uncomfortable doing cocaine with people I didnt know.  But at the heroin house, it looked like everyone had the greatest beer of their life.  So much so, I didnt think they were on anything except some really dank weed.  By all accounts, thats what I thought it was.  I inquired quite excitedly, Can I smoke some of that shit?  One Junkie, a girl and her crooked dope dealing boyfriend looked at each other lazily, in that weepy-eyed junkie nod and let out a small mutual laugh.  I was quite embarrassed, feeling condescended by the two experienced users.  I was not in the know.  I was even offended.  God, I didnt need their weed, fine.",
      "I saw my new boyfriend disappear with my fifty bucks into the bathroom.  He said we were going half in on a gram of powder.  Except Id soon find out he was cashing it all in on a few stamp bags of heroin.  Were not together today if youre curious.  Being ignorant, not understanding the junkie/bathroom connection, I was baffled when I saw the dealer escort him in and the doors close.  I didnt move as suddenly I was getting a little smart about the whole thing.  My concern was apparently showing as I stared at the black door, hearing feet shuffling around and almost mute conversation.  It looked like lazy gay sex to me, though the dealers girlfriend didnt see anything out of the ordinary.  I was frozen, and I started to remember those lifetime original movies about drug-users and their clans.  Dear God!  I didnt want to walk in and have my fears validated by the reality taking place.  I was in a junkie house!",
      "Another Junkie I had met a week prior, around the time I had met my new love, cued me in.  Hes not getting powder you know, hes robbing you!  The girl junkie and the boy junkie did that same mutual laugh.  Glad they found it funny, I didnt.  I could have cared less whose house I was in at that point.  Let them shoot me, I was pissed.  From the other side of the door, I was screaming.  You effin Junkie, Ill kill you.  The two junkies floppin on the couch could care less, finding it amusing.  The crooked dealer came out.  Its ok girl, youll get yours.  Here comes the DARE poster child, ready and poised as I was.  Oh no, I dont mess with needles.  Screw that shit!  Giving me little attention, he brought out a bag of China White, which is I guess, snort-able heroin.  You can snort this shit, you know, he said.  Oh!  Suddenly my temper was hampered by the prospects of experimenting with what had killed my favorite singer.  I had always wanted to know what this Rock Star murder weapon was like, and I had a desire to feel as good as them.",
      "Now, I should have took my friends advice, Never let a dope head cut your dope.  But in the excitement of dousing my senses with this guarded, mystical drug, I wasnt thinking about anything else, except my handy-dandy coke straw.  I switched on to a new mood like a young kid with a few dollars to spare at a Toy Store.  Yeah!  I want to try!  Cut me some of that stuff.  I was smart enough to let him know that I had never done this stuff, and my drug use to date was sporadic.  I didnt have enough tolerance to hold two beers, let alone heroin.  And either this guy was so doped he didnt know how big that line was, or he was just a smart ass.  Later I learned the latter was true.  He liked cutting huge lines for new users in the spirit of fun.  Its a wonder nobody died on his account.  In the back of my mind, I thought the line was pretty big.  But what the hell did I know about heroin.  It looked like dirty snow to me.  It had a brownish color, and the crystals, which didnt look much like crystals, seemed bigger.  Not like the fish-scale fine powdered coke I was typically getting.  It looked like a line of sand from a beach.  I shuffled around for my coke straw, while he rolled up that fifty dollar bill my boyfriend had given him moments before.  Cool!  I was itching to try. Pardon my pun, you know what I mean if youve ever tried this stuff. ",
      "Well, I snorted the line.  The effects were slow.  I sat down on the couch, impatient.  Whens it going to hit? I kept asking.  Like cocaine, I got the drip in the back of my throat what seemed like fifteen minutes afterwards.  It wasnt like the cocaine drip where it has the metallic taste, kind of bloody almost.  It was weird, like a dude shot a load off in my mouth.  It was warm like, though I cant really describe it by words, and my memories a bit fuzzy.  I didnt like it though, and that I do remember.  I kept swallowing back, like my tongue was trying to wash away the drip. ",
      "Then that heavy feeling washed over me.  Thats how I describe it, heavy.  But its pleasant.  I felt weighed down like.  Time hits a stand-still.  Every thing that mattered, my anger, my fear, my impatience, kind of just disappeared.  There was an overwhelming sense of peace and tranquility.  I felt in tune with the whole room, and on the same playing field as every junkie there.  It felt like they were all my best friends, as if I had known them all my life.  I was surprised to note that the high lasted hours.  Though it doesnt seem all that long when I start to sober up.  It probably had more to do with my zero tolerance and that gargantuan line that ass of a dealer cut.  Though I have no regrets. ",
      "For a while, I was nodding off, and insulting my boyfriend.  Im done with you, I said in a pleasant proclamation of freedom.  Thats nice, he replied, both of us on the nod.  To an outsider, they might have thought we were exchanging vows for all they knew.  Even if I was angry, everything seemed OK.  This is a cure-all for people full of piss and vinegar.  I liked this stuff, or so I thought. ",
      "Then I started to get sick.  At first I thought I wasnt going to blow chunks, but a knot was balling up in my stomach.  I felt like my intestines were swimming.  I had chili before I came.  I was trying to unlock the door to the house which had what seemed to be about four locks.  I called the dealer over.  Im going to vomit all over your place if you dont open this up.  He complied.",
      "Out in the yard, I was making a mess.  My stomach was emptying itself violently.  The dealer made me go inside to the bathroom to throw, and I wasnt going to argue.  There were floaties in the toilet, because for some reasons, junkies toilets never work.  The plumbings always backed up or some shit. Maybe they throw needles in there, I dont know.  So I was just vomiting bile into the sink, cleaning up the chunky stuff with toilet paper and throwing that into the trash.  With all the vomiting, I was starting to sober up.  Still high, and weighty, but not as high.  I swear if I weighed fifteen pounds less, Id have died.  Lucky I was 145 or so at the time.  It was going on three hours, and I was still too high to drive.  My then boyfriend, drove us home.  I was nervous.  I thought he was as high as I was, which wasnt the case since he had the tolerance of an opiate fiend.  I couldnt go home, so I crashed at his place forgetting that I had given him the shaft hours before.  I couldnt sleep even though I felt tired and weak.  He gave me a breath mint, and I vomited that up.  One tiny mint swimming in a puddle of vile.  I thought it was funny for some reason.",
      "Then the high started to leave me.  I dont know if it was power of suggestion, but he started itching himself crazily.  And I started helping him out, itching his back and beard.  Then I started getting itchy all over.  My legs, my belly, everything.  And hed itch me, Id itch him.  And we threw the covers off the bed because they were itchy.  Then I was real hot, sweating like a pig.  I knew heroin had withdrawals, but I never thought they were so apparent for a first time user.  The palms of my hands were itchy, beads of sweat rolling down my body, and my armpits.  Then I got cold, then hot, throwing the covers on and off.  That whole night, we would both wake up and go back to sleep, fighting over covers or itching ourselves.  We were loud too, so the people above us probably thought we were doing something kinky, though he, nor I, had any desire to have sex.  Even though I noticed he was really hard down there, neither of us initiated the act.  It was all heroin at that point. ",
      "The morning after, I drove home.  I felt washed out.  So I slept for sixteen hours.  He had the audacity to call me back, though I never returned the calls.  For some reason, probably due to the withdrawals, I had no desire to pursue heroin, especially not with him.  On the plus side, heroin has a lasting effect, a much longer high, mostly for those with low tolerance.  I wouldnt consider it fun, but like hard narcotics, its a feel good drug.  Theres a certain quality a bout it though you cant get from speed.  Its that opiate quality of course, and I liked the high.  Weighed against the withdrawals, which mine probably pale in comparison to hard-core junkies, I just didnt feel like trying it again.  I played around with the idea of managing it.  Due to the long-lasting effects, its incredibly cheap.  A twenty dollar line kept me high for a couple of hours.  Twenty bucks worth of coke couldnt keep me high for fifteen minutes.  Thats where heroin seems worthwhile in the face of disease and social taboos.  Im even apt to say I like the heroin crowd better than the coke tweak-geek coke crowd.  But I never stayed long enough in both groups to draw comparison and make notes.  I suppose one isnt better than the other.",
      "After trying heroin, I realize coke is pure robbery in the sense of longevity.  Then again, its like comparing apples to oranges.  Two totally different highs, and I like speed. Due to addiction and withdrawal, I cant champion it by my own experience since I dont possibly understand the whole Heroin paradigm that exists with adaptation and tolerance.  But I can see where level-headed individuals learn to balance the drug within their own life, like a pop of aspirin for a nasty headache.  I do have in some way, respect for the drug that I cant shake because I liked the peace, calm and the sedation of all my fears and anger, that coke only exasperated.  It calmed a beast within me, and I cant say coke ever did that."

      "I have had several encounters with HBWR, usually amounting to a pleasant, albeit subtle, LSD-like activation. The dosage for these experiences varies, but most often was between 15-30 seeds. I figure that those batches were pretty weak. This particular batch of seeds, however was claimed to be 'super-potent.' They were still covered with the brown fuzz, which I did my best to scrape off while trying to keep my eyes from crossing. What a pain in the rear it was, but I tried to make a meditation out of it. Next I washed them off with hot water and started to chew them very thoroughly. Eleven seeds were finished within ten minutes and washed down with a glass of water.",
      "I had eaten chicken earlier. That was a mistake, I decided as I was sweating back waves of nausea. I was certainly intoxicated. I was feeling pretty sedated lying on the cool bathroom floor, wanting to nap. But then I had to bust a gut, the pressure suddenly rising in my stomach. My mind grew chaotic, bizarre thoughts forming and unforming in a haze of nausea, where am I? Blargh. Blargh. Whew. A little more blarghing. Brown froth punctuated by bits o' chicken filled the toilet. I can see the little masticated seed husks floating in the toilet. But man do I feel on the other side of the coin! I am energized at this point. I feel as if everything has a positive blue tinge overlaying it (even the brown puke is covered by the glow). MJ smoked at this point completely wipes away lingering nausea, and boosted me to a +++. Tracers a' plenty, breathing walls, swirling eddies of psychedelic geometry.",
      "I hid in the basement and played guitar, watching the sun set through a tiny, shoe box sized window. It reminded me of a diorama. A tiny world view. I leave the spider webs in there, even though spiders freak me out. I am feeling too much empathy to squash anything right now. I have never really experienced anything I would call synesthaesia, but I swore that the sunlight falling across my face was dictating the melody I was noodling with on the guitar. I felt like a rock god, Queztoguitahro. I rode this wave length for about 7 hours, playing guitar and drums, until I was back to baseline. Drank some GBL, 4 ml mixed in juice for sleep. No hangover next day. I feel somewhat lighter, with less of a burden on my mind. Puking usually flushes out my spirit...blargh."

      "I do have ADHD, but I was diagnosed at such a late age that my parents thought that getting me any kind of medication was pointless and a waste of money because I had lived with it for so many years. I take no medications at all. I have tried everything from salvia to meth, but I prefer psychedelics over anything. Two years ago, I started high school in a very demanding prep school (I no longer go there). At that time I was a very strong athlete and had no experience or knowledge of drugs (boy has that changed). After having continuing trouble with the work load a friend, who was also having trouble, brought me some blue pills and gave them to me, and hence I discovered adderall. After taking the drug in pill form for a while, I discovered that it was much more effective to insufflate the crushed beads inside the pill. Since then I have taken the drug at least 40 times.",
      "So I was sitting around in my room with a corner bag of 40mg adderall burning a hole in my pocket so I decided to go ahead and get wired for a couple hours. I had also purchased several weeks earlier a bottle of caffeine pills because I was experimenting with diphenhydramine and kept falling asleep after about 2 hours, and with an onset of one hour that wasnt enough trip time for me. So I took one of the pills which was 200mg of caffeine and crushed and cut it evenly into the adderall. I had previously crushed and chopped the adderall but to make sure everything was nice and tiny, I mushed and crushed the pile with my Zippo several times and then began to chop everything very carefully with a new razor blade for about 10min.",
      "Through experience I have learned that it pays to make sure that everything is cut very fine. Adderall is especially hard to crush because it is many little beads. I find that by using a small Petri dish to contain the beads, because they tend to jump when you crush them, and using a beer bottle with a top on it works very well. You can also place them in a zip lock and use anything with a rounded end to mush them. Trust me, it sucks sucking something up your nose that still has a uniform shape. But in case you do I find that by putting a very small drop of water on the end of my finger and sucking it in relieves some of the pain.",
      "I had a small pile which I began to cut into roughly 3inch lines about a centimeter wide. There were 16 lines. I snorted about half of the yellow, orange'ish mixture (the orange being the adderall the caffeine was yellow). I only took half because I wanted more for later in the night. It was 11:30 on the dot.",
      "T+20min - Not really being tired before taking the mixture (Im gonna call it speed for short, BUT it is a mixture) I started noticing everything was much more intense and vivid but not in the way a psychedelic would amplify color and shape, it was more like everything became sharper and clearer. The effects started picking up about 3 min after the first line. I sometimes describe Amphetamine and speed in general as having a sneaky onset. It was not at all an 'in your face' pickup. The effects were very suttle. I couldnt sit still at all and I felt like I had to do something so I turned on my Xbox.  I was drawn into the racing game I was playing to the point where I was turning my entire body with the turn of the car. My heart rate sitting is about 65(Bpm) (beats per minute) and after checking it I was at 97(Bpm).",
      "T+1hour - I became enraged and frustrated after losing to the game and after having several cursing bouts with my T.V I decided that it was better to do something else. I turned on some chili peppers, low, and put family guy on. Then began what I call 'The popping'. Every time I take any kind of stimulate that brigs me up (meth, adderall, large volumes of caffeine) I involuntary, and usually unknowingly pop air from underneath my tongue. It makes kind of a farting sound and is very annoying because I cant stop it. Im not sure if this happens to many other people, but it will not go away. My jaw continually locks and unlocks so I get some gum to try and help it. I cant sit still and my hands are tremoring. Heart rate 109(Bpm)",
      "T+1 1/2hours - There is something definitely different about this experience than that I have had with just taking normal adderall. Generally when I take the adderall by its self I become very focused at one task at a time, but now I am very flighty with my every action. I cant decide what to do and as soon as I pick something up I move onto something else. I am able to type but I tend to double or even triple hit the keys. I had a conversation with a friend and after talking to me for about 3min asked me if I had taken something. She stated that I was talking very rapidly and when I wasnt, she noticed the popping of my tongue. After listing to myself talk, I concerned that my speech was very rapid. I was also jumping from one subject to another, paying no real attention to anything she had to say. Heart rate 102(Bpm)",
      "T+3hrs 50min - I just dosed the other half of the speed. I am having slight feelings of paranoia. I have checked my window about 5 times in the last 15 min. I keep looking out into the dark and seeing shadows moving. I know that there is nothing there but I cant shake the feeling that someone is watching me. I distract myself with more music. I had to turn on the light in my room because my eyes kept trying to re-adjust themselves every time I would look away from the computer. My eyes trying to readjust may be why I keep seeing the shadows move. This feels very similar to meth but without any hint of euphoria. Heart rate 113(Bpm)",
      "T+4hrs 20min - I had to get up and walk around because my muscles where cramping. I still feel kinda paranoid but not near as bad as I was 30 min ago. My hands are still very twitchy and kinda clammy. I am wide awake and feeling really jumpy. Every noise I hear makes me jump and immediately start looking around. My muscles in my legs and low back are kinda sore but nothing a good stretch couldnt fix. Heart rate 102(Bpm)",
      "All in all I believe adderall is a good drug but I think its practical uses, for studying and holding a longer concentration, out way its uses as a recreational drug. It is fun to an extent but it can be a very powerful tool to help get through all night projects and shit loads of homework."

      "The Introduction - January 12",
      "My interest in psychoactive (especially psychedelic) substances was sparked when a T.V. news report on the use of oxycodone among young adults when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I was instantly intrigued by the fact of altering your own mind with a chemical compound.",
      "Fast forward a few years. I am in the 7th grade, 12 years old, and I stumble upon something intriguing - Erowid. I began to quickly learn the 'truth' of these substances, and not the D.A.R.E. propaganda distributed to us in flyers at assemblies. LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline were the first few psychoactives I researched. My learning moved onto the more obscure chemicals and plants - eventually to the 'research chemicals'. My interests grew as I read the dozens and hundreds of trip reports at Erowid and the Lycaeum on psychedelics.",
      "I stumbled upon a website called Bluelight in mid-2004. While Erowid only had a limited amount of information at the time, I realized this forum community was full of people from all over the world with a common goal. I began to learn as much as I could, to educate myself, before I would be ready to begin a psychedelic experience.",
      "While my journey of education, I quickly learned that peers and parents would be of no use. Both parties had already been brainwashed by D.A.R.E. propaganda, LSD caused you to see demons 99% of the time, resulting in genocide. My peers viewed LSD as something only 'insane' people would dose themselves with (which is slightly ironic, because it [should be] quite the opposite). Marijuana began being used by the masses by late 8th, early 9th grade.",
      "Many people my age are trying to get their hands on anything they can to experience visuals. I know a few people who have spent months of their lives dedicated to dosing themselves with DXM strictly for the visuals. Don't get me wrong - I didn't think of psychedelics being a 'tool' from the start, but after my large amount of reading/research, I have realized that these substances allow people to better themselves. Psychedelics definitely have a legitimate purpose in life - whether that is with psychiatry, meditation, or simply for giving yourself the ability to 'free your mind'. It would be incredible to see decriminalization in my lifetime.",
      "My goal with psychedelics is to expand my mindset and learn the truth about society and life. I've had dreams where the 'walls of reality' break down and allow me to see things for what they are. Imagine the world being on a 2D plane - there are boundaries, truths in front of hiding lies. Then imagine that you are able to pan up away from the 2D environment, and you are now on the 3D 'zone'. You may now look at things for what they are. To my understanding, I will experience this when I take my first psychedelic journey.",
      "I have experienced lucid dreams in the past, but only on three or four occasions. Every single time was incredible - controlling my brain with ease was pleasurable and something unforgettable to me.",
      "I attend an extremely conservative all-boys boarding school. My drug history is minimal. Sporadic marijuana usage and a couple of rare cases with prescription medication (Codeine 120mg once with minimal effects, just an overall good feeling and general numbness of extremities) is all I have under my belt. I hope this will be beneficial to my first psychedelic journey. It should be well documented, and I hope to capture my emotions and ideas on paper or audio/video.",

      "The digital campus bell rang out. My clock read 9:00am.",
      "My thoughts began racing - today was the day. Just last night, my eyes scanned a bag with a quarter ounce (7 grams) of Psilocybe Cubensis. 4 mushroom heads and about two dozen stems made my mouth salivate. These 7 grams were to be split three ways, which would amount to roughly 2.33 grams for everyone. B had experience with marijuana, and a single extremely low dose (.25-.5 grams) on mushrooms. C had experienced two Salvia divinorum trips, two mushroom trips, and marijuana usage.",
      "Myself? I personally had minimal, sporadic marijuana usage (less than a dozen times). Besides lucid dreaming, I was definitely an extreme beginner to the altered states of mind. I was a little cautious of the dose I was taking. I knew I was a small guy, and I knew this wasn't a toy.",
      "[ 10:20pm - T+0:00 ]",
      "It is now 10:20AM. Two of us just finished off the mushrooms with a health drink. B is still finishing his up with difficulty.",
      "We all take a walk to pass time and discover nature until we start coming up. I feel as if my inhibitions are leaving me. By 10:50, I'm definitely feeling high. Patterns start looking suspicious as I eye them up. Back in C's room, we play some video games as the mushrooms digest in our bodies. Massive amounts of giggling begin to erupt - we are soon laughing because we are laughing.",
      "[ 11:40pm - T+1:20 ]",
      "Everything begins to become wavy. Patterns begin to shift, dots in the ceiling begin to 'dance' as I concentrate. Everyone is gathered in the long hallway when B points out something astounding. By simply looking at the carpet, it begins to grow. Up and sideways - it's as if someone is stretching and skewing the end of the carpet. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind.",
      "As I stated before, it is difficult to recall my entire psychedelic journey. People began having multiple faces - as if pictures of faces were overlaid. I began to understand influence. A non-tripping friend took on the role of an angel in my mind, while another became the devil. Yin and the yang are understood. Prejudice, politics, infinity - all is understood. The blue eyes of a friend began to radiate as if they were radioactive. Each room had a different personality.",
      "Communication is simple. Words begin losing their meaning. Why are the words becoming meaningless? We simply began communicating without words.",
      "[ 12:30 - T+2:10 ]",
      "I begin to peak. My thought patterns are as stable as an elephant on high doses of tranquilizers. Ideas are jumping left and right. Faces begin appearing. I look outside. The ends of the pine trees explode into fractal-like faces. I am beckoned to stare. Rocks turn into faces of all different nationalities. Wood grain began to flow like rivers. My carpet took on thousands of single inch faces that grew out several feet above the ground.",
      "I cannot remember correctly, but at around this time I had an incredible experience with C. Although we were not speaking, our ideas flowed - there is no doubt in my mind that body language is read easily and effectively while under the influence of mushrooms.",

      "'Faces grow out of the rainnnn, when you're strangeeeeeee.'",
      "Although it was raining, the visuals were still intense. The dirt seemed like opaque glass - the dirt was a glass barrier between two worlds. I watched faces and arms try to break through the glass from inside the earth. I explore the building. I see a person of authority and begin talking to him. The conversation lasted only seconds, but it was too incredibly intense for me. The outline of his face broke open and his face poured out. The hair on his head grew and tangled just as a tree would if a time-lapse video was being recorded over a dozen years.",
      "I walk down the hall and walk up the steps. As I stated before that every room is a completely different universe, the same is true with levels in a building. My field of vision becomes saturated with color. As I take each step up, I feel as if I am being lifted up into another dimension. I feel a sense of a 'bigger meaning' to life. Everything becomes a blur here. Intensity. Intensity. Intensity. Intensity.",
      "My hand melts into my keyboard as I attempt to login to my user account. I am greeted with my desktop, a psychedelic piece of digital art. A face blooms from it and looks at me, as if it were teaching me the meaning of life. My hands end up melting with a lot of things during my trip. It is like mushrooms allow me to 'become' an object for a temporary period of time.",
      "As I closed my eyes to find closed eye visuals, I see rows of neon, rainbow colored Atari and Nintendo logos. When I close my eyes, I see a 'digital' or 'snapshot' version of what I was seeing with my eyes open.",
      "Time flies. Literally. Every time I blink people are feet away from where they were last. I am in a trance. My memory and consciousness begin to fade. I pace my room as we play with our cell phones. I feel like I should talk to my family. No, wait, bad idea. I call several friends and explain my situation. As I breathe on objects they shrink and grow. My phone gets extremely small as I blow on it, and it feels like a child's toy.",
      "[ 12:59 - T+2:39 ]",
      "My alarm clock displays 12:59. I am laying in my bed, and C tells me that putting my face in my pillow is an incredible experience. My comforter flows over my body like a wave in the ocean. I can almost smell the ocean as I feel the movement on the back of my shirt. I am now in a void. A cave that was infinitely large and infinitely small. I understand the meaning of infinity - it is nothing and everything at the same exact time.",
      "I begin feeling unpleasant. The mushrooms are overwhelming. Too overwhelming. I check the time again. It's still 12:59.",
      "12:59.",
      "12:59.",
      "12:59. I check my clock at least one hundred times. This minute feels like an eternity. I feel sick. I hear high pitched squeals coming from my walls. The paint on my walls begin melting to reveal faces. Dozens of full sized faces stare at my frightened ego. My carpet's texture turns into faces. I'm seeing a lot of faces. Wow. Faces growing out of faces? Let's breathe.",
      "From this point on, I remember very little. I remember moments from around 1:09, 1:25, and 1:50. I am so overwhelmed. I begin to recognize my 109 pound body couldn't handle the 2.33 grams of p. cubensis as easy as the more experienced 190 pound trippers. I took too much. Let it stop. 'I will come down. I will come down.' Evidently, during this time, I wondered down to C's room and had a 'deep intellectual conversation', involving a sober friend and trying to make him play hockey with a large penguin on a rug.",
      "The fibers of reality begin to fray. My field of vision began ripping as if someone had begun tearing the 'film' from a projector. Time becomes meaningless. Perception is all that keeps my body from falling apart in the material world.",
      "[ 2:35 - T+5:20 ]",
      "I begin to become conscious. I am told by a sober friend that I freaked out for a few minutes, but it becomes apparent he over-reacted. I do not blame him for putting me in this situation, but he did not know any better. He was obviously not aware his words were scaring me as he tried to joke with me. His jokes were not funny and scared me. I am trapped. Everyone must know. I am trapped. My parents are waiting outside my room. The police are here. The police are here. I am trapped.",
      "'Am I in danger?'",
      "[ 3:00 - T+5:45 ]",
      "Alright - I admit it. I freaked out. I took too much for my first time. I am beginning to come down, but I cannot distinguish reality from fiction. I soon realize what has happened. My positive experience turned into a negative (bad trip?) experience when I let my guard down. My judgement is still extremely altered. I still feel high, and the visuals are still there if I concentrate. The faces in the pine tree, mud, and tile are still extremely apparent.",

      "I lost my interest to write a trip report - words simply don't do justice to the experience. All of my friends want to know what the experience is like. What am I going to say to them? Learn the truth. Expand your mind. Change the world. There is nothing else in this world that has such positively affected me as a person in general. I am a better person tenfold by having this experience. Although I had both positive and negative parts of my psychedelic trip, I gained such an incredible amount of knowledge.",
      "The biases of life were torn down. I was given a fresh start to the world.",
      "But the real question is: Would I do it again?",
      "And the answer is 'definitely'. Although I want to integrate this experience as greatly as possible, the experience is just so incredible, and I feel I need to revisit mushroom land in a better setting. I blame myself for the negative dip in my trip at 12:59. A boarding school where you are completely vulnerable to being caught tripping is not the best setting for a first psychedelic journey. I definitely took too much. I might have a sensitivity to psilocybin.",
      "My advice for anyone wanting to become a better person is the following. Use psychedelics. Start low. I would have rather started with 1.75 grams and worked my way up. Wait for the right time. A positive setting is the best thing. I truly understand why there is 'magic' in 'magic mushrooms'. And unless a person has experienced them, they cannot begin to even fathom the depth of this experience.",
      "Throughout my journey, I had a great time. This experience has been the single most memorable event in my life by far. I am a more balanced and understanding individual because of this. I comprehended the meaning of my life - equilibrium. Balance is everything - the yin and the yang symbolize life.",
      "Tripping was fun. I'm looking forward to doing this again in a better setting."

    "report": [
      "Last night, (the night of November 2nd, 2006) I had my first definite encounter with Salvia Divinorum (10x extract, standardized). I am going to journal the events that happened that evening as best as I humanly can. While the majority of the events in my report will be very similar to those of other experiences, I truly believe that in no way is this a guide for others to learn about what to expect. I truly believe that the experience could be heavenly divine or horrifically soul-shredding. The trip outcome could be transformed to either--without mercy--by even the most infinitesimal factor (psychologically or physiologically). So with that said, I will not attempt to preach to new users on the dangers of this substance. Rather, I will merely attempt to inform the vast public of the events that took place so that they may make their own decisions (best decision is a well informed decision). And please, if you do decide to take an inward journey with Salvia, please have a sober person watch over you (for the safety of yourself and others!). Regardless, live your life to the fullest, and may love be with you.",
      "As for a little background information (not a lot but enough to give you a foundation  to be able to better visualize the occurrences), I will start by saying that I have been an avid drug user for over 5 years now. As of late, I have been taking a zealous interest in dissociatives and hallucinogens. I have had some minor experiences with psilocybin and extensive encounters with large doses of dextromethorphan. Nevertheless, my participation in either of these two substances (or my attempt to mentally prepare myself for what may lie ahead in using this foreign drug) would not grant me the required experience to handle what Salvia had to offer.",
      "The whole process for wanting to try Salvia started roughly two years ago. At that time it was merely a legal substance which was apparently available in most local head shops. Two years then passed, however I still kept my eye on the plant. When I finally convinced myself that I had enough knowledge and willpower to attempt a drug such as this, I decided to ultimately go on with the process. I purchased one gram of 10x Salvia Divinorum extract and spent over five hours preparing myself mentally.",
      "The time appeared to be perfect, so I prepared the water bong and filled the bowl with a fair sized portion of the extract. The dimensions of the amount that I placed into the bowl would most certainly resemble that of the very tip of your pinky (perhaps the size of a raw corn kernel). I sat down on a comfortable chair while soothing background music played. The lighting was dim and my senses were invigorated. I sparked the flame and held the flame over the bowl and immediately inhaled. The smoke was not unpleasant but definitely unique. I thought to myself 'Wow, this isn't too hard, I could smoke multiple bowls of this stuff!' The bowl appeared to be finished off but nevertheless I kept the flame over the ash and continued to inhale until my lungs could not fit another second of breath. Without delay I remembered to hold in the smoke for at least 30 seconds. So I counted in my head, 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine...'",
      "But I saw something outside the window. And at this very instant I put the bong down on the window sill and peeked outside. It was raining out. And it appeared to be very dark--in fact much darker than midnight usually is (how is that possible?). My mind was confused. Not only was I trying to figure out why everything seemed so out of place but I was also wondering what happened to the smoke I just inhaled. Why didn't I exhale anything? It felt as if when I inhaled, the smoke and the air were both absorbed into my blood by my lungs. At any rate, that didn't matter to me then. But god, that rain! That dark rain!",
      "It fell right on top of me, soaking my body and clothes. This didn't frighten me in the least rather I was quite curious (It would be important to note that it was not raining, rather, there was snow on the ground). Instinctively I attempted to pull away from the window sill but my arms and legs were stuck. I was being pulled into the window sill wooden frame. The force did not appear to be pushing me or pulling me into the wall, rather I was realizing then that I was actually no longer human. I was simply the wooden frame. I felt my body and soul becoming the simplistic, wooden, and inanimate object. My god! How amazing! The rain continued to pour down on top of me, and I could see my arms and legs as if they were a piece of wood that was sitting outside under a rainstorm... the water droplets forming many beads on top of the threads of the wood. My body also started to take on more vibrant colors. Not only was I wooden, but I was painted! A vivid and palpable array of paint!",
      "While movement was not completely inhibited, I was able to move my head slightly to look outside. It was at that moment when I looked at the neighboring houses, that I saw something that I would never forget. The houses were wooden and plastic (much like I was, they also had a very human appearance) and they looked at me with a smile. The told me to look up at the sky. The dark rain fell down into my eyes but I managed to squint out the water droplets. I saw something that I will probably never be able to describe but I shall try my very best. Something was coming down upon me. This massive being or entity crept slowly down toward my house and it was very apparent that it was going to consume all of us. I asked the other beings around me, 'Why?!'",
      "They smiled back at me and spoke to me with their eyes. They told me, 'Don't you know? This is our fate and purpose in life.' I didn't believe them! I couldn't! I screamed begging for mercy but what could they do? They were trapped just like me... unable to move or run away. One girl looked at me with empathy but I knew she was unable to do anything. The entity was creeping closer, only this time I could feel it pressing me in between the windowsill and the ledge. My head was pinned. Why? It was in this moment that appeared to be most mind-blowing. I truly wish to God that I could be able to describe this petrifying experience. Why was I simply born in this world to serve such a meaningless purpose only to be 'obliterated' by this unknown force? But my questions didn't have any importance at this time. All I was concerned about was somehow trying to break from this wooden window sill. However, the reality of it was I was a piece of wood. A piece of wood has no legs or muscles. So there I was. Helpless.",
      "At last I was able to break free but I immediately fell to the floor. Soaking wet, I was laying on the floor in the fetal position crying. Will no one help me? I realized how much I had in my life. I was more than something so simple and common. I had a larger purpose to serve and I was not done serving that purpose. Looking up I had the most passionate hope to be saved and to be taken away from this anguish. The faces I saw earlier appeared above me. They looked down at me, still smiling. In harmony they all extended their arms and they lifted me up and above the misery and shadows below. They all laughed and were surprised that I was so upset (as if I was supposed to know that all of this was imminent!). I felt a huge amount of innocence and sadness as they were carrying me up and away from all of this. They sat me down gracefully on my bed, however, I did not want to lay there all wet as it was extremely uncomfortable. The beings slowly vanished through the walls like dust.",
      "It was at this moment when all of confusion started to return to order. The pressure was no longer present, and I started to realize that these beings brought me back to my bedroom. I was so incalculably relieved! Thank you god! Bless you for giving me a second chance in life. I was hot and wet still (as well as enormously out of breath!) from this whole ordeal so I instinctively took off all of my clothes and went to look for a dry set. However I was starting to quickly come back down further into reality and I started to consciously realize that I had taken Salvia and this was all a hallucination. I slipped in an out of hallucinations and realities for roughly 20 minutes after this. I looked for my apparently wet clothes and found them to be dry. I put them back on and tried to watch television and listen to familiar music to help me keep in contact with what I know was real.",
      "Like the calm after a massive storm I was feeling colossal peace and thankfulness. I rested in bed becoming one with myself and my surroundings. I have not slept that peacefully since a child. There were also very unique and pleasurable physical after-effects. They could be compared to that of a very intense (but remember, also very rare) cannabis high. A lingering feeling of being seamlessly and slowly meshed in with whatever I was in contact with. To give you a simple example, if I were to lie down on my bed afterwards, it would feel as if I was becoming one with the bed. I was merging into a simplistic--yet comfortable--form.",
      "I am writing this roughly 15 hours after the occurrence and I am in a deep and constant state of thought (peaceful, too). I still have no concrete idea on what happened or what to think of it all. Perhaps it was merely a chemical physiological episode... regardless, it was so real. I'll need time to think it all over. Will I ever do it again? I cannot say just yet. Was I regretful of the experience? I don't believe so! I was shown something so powerful and intense, yes, but I think that I was being taught. And if the purpose of the lesson was to make sure I was paying attention, well you have my undivided attention!"

      "I have been 'involved' with psychedelic plants and compounds since my early teens but never til now have bothered to experiment with Heimia Salicifolia aka 'Sun Opener'. I ordered 10 grams from a reputable source which arrived within a week.",
      "The first thing I did was rolled a gram joint to experience its effects prior to injesting the rest as a tea. Smoking the leaves gave me a mild buzz similiar to marijuana but more drowsy feeling. Music was slightly enhanced and a noticable feeling of euphoria was also experieced. As I got up for the bathroom, I noticed my balance was slightly off similiar to the result of a few beers. A darkening of surroundings is noticed while on the toilet. Effects wear off around the 3 hour mark as I began to pass out from the drowsy effect. I awoke the next morning with the worst headache I've ever had (Aspirin did nothing for it). At this point I should have taken this as a sign that perhaps I should think twice about injesting this stuff. But instead, I brushed it off as a symptom of smoking and that it could have been a combination of the change in weather pressure as well.",
      "A week later I decide to brew the tea. I boiled it in about 5 cups of water for 10 minutes on High. Then I let it steep for about 20 minutes, letting it cool down. I poured about 2.5 cups into a large pint glass and proceeded to add some cream and stevia to sweeten the taste. It took quite a bit of stevia actually, this stuff is extremely bitter but not quite as bad as Calea Zacatchichi. Next thing I sat comfortable browsing the internet drinking the tea as I would any other tea and after I had drank about half the glass, I began to notice a tensing up of all my muscles and jaw in particular. Then I noticed I was complete crouched over and about as unrelaxed as I've ever been. I wondered why and immediately stopped drinking the tea. I began to feel this tightening in my entire body, head included. At that point I knew I was having an adverse reaction. The tenseness developed more and more into a very painful sensation as if I had been beaten all over my body and was healing from bruises. I could barely walk 5 feet. When I moved I felt extreme pain and wished I had some pain killers kickin around but all I had was some lousey aspirin which I took but it seemed to do little for me. The remainder of the night was me trying to sleep it off and hopefully feel better in the morning.",
      "In the morning I woke up still in alot of bodily pain (even my balls hurt when I went to take a pee!) Then the worst part happened-I remembered people speak about this stuff as an auditory hallicinogen and decided to check if this out for myself. As a music lover, I would have loved to have listened to music during the evening if I wasn't in so much pain. But I couldn't think of anything else but how to stop the tightening adverse reaction. Anyways, I put on some music that I was very familiar with and to my utter surprise, the entire thing was pitched down exactly 1 octave. This troubled me as it had already been the next day and it didn't particularly sound great that way. It seemed to take with it the essence and I couldn't even bop my head to this. It was simply bad sounding. I wanted my audio to shift back to normal. It's still the next day so I won't know for a day or two if my hearing is permanently mangled from this stuff.",
      "I threw the remainder of the tea down the toilet and will never touch this stuff again! I hope this message saves a few people from trying this and having a similiar reaction.",

      "It started off as any normal thursday, I had recently bought a gram of some kind-bud off one of my friends in school.  Since I only had a gram I convinced myself that I should smoke it all in one night and buy some more off him tomorrow. I managed to roll two nice sized jays out of the sack.  I slipped them in my cigarette pack and waited patiently. ",
      "That night around 10:30 I smoked both of the joints in a row taking enormous mind-blowing hits off of them.  After I finished the second joint I lit up a cigarette and stood on my back porch admiring the beauty of the woods, in fall colors, behind my house.  I walked back into my house and went on my computer, I tried to manage some conversations with my friends but this was extremely difficult to accomplish. Then out of nowhere I heard a very loud and persistent humming coming from the back of my head.  After a few minutes it felt like it was pushing my head towards the computer screen, and as I got closer to the screen it felt as if the computer was trying to 'eat my face'.  It was extremely odd and felt as if a gelatinous goo was clinging to my face and pulling, but it had an electrical feel to it as it pulled me in, it's hard to explain.  While this was going on I wasn't having any fear, this feeling that the computer was eating me was quite entertaining and I let out a chuckle every once in ahwile.",
      "I decieded that I was too blown to be on my computer so I laid on my bed and stared at my shelf while laying on my side.  On my shelf I have one of those globes attached to the stand that generate electricity beams and they connect to your fingers when you touch the glass.  I stared at this object for about 5 minutes until it looked as if the black outline of the object was turning a glowing yellow.  A few more minutes passed and suddenly I was able to generate an exact copy of the outline filled in with vibrant colors directly next to it.  I was confused because I am a chronic marijuana user and have never tripped off of marijuana before. ",
      "I wanted to see how far I could go with these visual hallucinations so I decided to see if I was going to have any CEV's.  There was complete darkness for about ten seconds then suddenly a simple object appeared.  It looks like a very wide, upside-down spike, and had a rectangle coming out of the side and another spike sticking out of the box pointing towards me.  Everything was yellow except for the spike on the box which was brown with a black and white tip.  I could see the dimensions of the object very well and tried to manipulate it, but to no avail. All during this time I was having muscle spasms all over my body, which were about three times stronger than I usually have them. ",
      "I heard the Daily Show on Comedy Central come on so I sat up in my bed and started watching the TV.  Then suddenly something came over me.  The only way that I can explain this is that it felt like the top half of my vision was being blurred over my head (like my eyes were outside of my head and looking upwards, and the bottom half of my vision was trailing off to the lower-right.  It was by no means 'Scary' but it was annoying me because I couldn't see the TV.  After about 20 minutes of this going on (even while laying on my back staring at the ceiling) I eventually fell asleep and awoke the next day being somewhat groggy but happy with what I had experienced that night.  It was like a low-dose LSD or DXM trip without the sickness or the paranoia.",

      "I found out through the internet about Diphenhydramine, Meclizine, and Dimenhydrinate and their effects at high dosage.  Realizing that I had some Diphenhydramine around the house in the form of 'Tylenol Simply Sleep' pills, 25-50 mg each, I decided to give it a try.  I am a person who loves analyzing the effects of different substances when I first take them, so this was a great opportunity.  I noticed how everyone's dosage and experience was vastly different, so I decided to start at 100mg for the first dose (it was probably around 8 pm) and wait 30 minutes, while paying careful attention to how my body felt during that time. ",
      "I noticed getting more muscle fatigue and my perception of everything visual was off a little, it's hard to describe how.  I paid attention to my heart, breathing, mental capacity, anything else that I determined relevant and it was acceptable, so I smoked a bowl and took another 100mg.  I started liking the effects, I noticed my vision was getting blurry, the walls were breathing a little, and dark colors were shifting.  I sat around for a little bit more and decided to take another 100mg, making the total 300 so far.  This is when I left to go to my friend's house about 15 minutes away.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "I didn't notice anything remarkably different between 200mg and 300mg, just slightly greater effects of it all.  While at my friends house we were sitting in her car talking, listening to music, and smoking cigarettes with one of our other friends and I took another 100mg before we all smoked a bowl.  I felt great at this point. I was relaxed, and everything was kind of dreamy, but not in an uncomfortable way. ",
      "According to my friends, I was starting to make less sense.  I distinctly remember exclaiming 'My cigarette tastes like berries!' (it did, and I smoke Marlboro Menthols) and one of my friends thought that was hilarious and odd, although it didn't seem out of place to me at the time.  I chilled out a little and talked, smoked some cigs, and took another 50mg after a few bowls had been passed around, smoked a couple cigs and we went in the house.  I was waiting 15-30 minutes between each dosage.  At this time I was having a terrible time reading small text (like on small pill bottles) but I wasn't having too much trouble with computers and tv. ",
      "After a while of hanging out and feeling the pills (more dreamy feelings, nothing felt real, but I wasn't hallucinating at this point) I decided I'd better head towards my house before I got any worse off of these.  I took another 50mg (making the total 500mg -- seems to be threshold for visuals for me) and left. ",
      "As I was driving home I started to feel the effects even more and I was making an effort to pay close attention to the road and nothing else.  I had no problems 75% of the way home, even driving through city traffic for a few minutes.  Nothing felt out of the ordinary, just felt like I was high.  When I was getting pretty close to my house I looked in the road ahead of me and saw an opossum sitting on its hind legs in my lane.  It was probably larger than a desktop computer, just sitting there.  I tapped the brakes while thinking what to do (will I hit it or avoid it?), I had pretty much decided to slow down and go around it since it was sitting still.  All this took place within maybe 2 seconds and I had still been staring at it in the road ahead of me. ",
      "I looked down at my speed for a split second, looked back at the road to get a better look at this opossum, and it vanished right in front of my eyes.  That made me realize how much of an effect I had from the pills. I believe I lit a cigarette at this point to make sure I didn't zone out, 'lose time' and crash. ",
      "A little further along the road I came around a corner and saw maybe 50 feet ahead of me a black spot stretched across both lanes, probably 2 feet wide, and I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  Water?  A shadow?  Pavement patch?  Nothing at all? All the sudden my mind clicked and it became a spike strip!  Why?  Hell if I know!  By reflex and without hesitation I slammed the brakes almost to the floor and dropped from about 50mph to 15mph in a couple seconds (approaching the fastest stop possible for my heavy ass truck), lucky there was no one behind me, and I crept along until about 5 feet before I would have hit it, I realized, 'Why the hell would there be a spike strip in the middle of nowhere?' and it changed into a harmless dark spot in the road.  I let go of the brake and continued on without further incident, thinking I was stupid.  I believe it was a pavement patch after all. ",
      "I got home and went to my room and just chilled.  I looked at my poster of Tila Tequila on the wall, saw her moving her body with the music I was playing from my computer.  I was thinking how cool it would be if she walked right out of the poster. But no, it didn't happen.  I am not one to have detailed hallucinations.  I probably smoked another bowl, some cigs.  A feeling came over me (similar to the fuzzy feeling I get when I mix pot and alcohol at the right level) and generally whenever this feeling happens, if the situation permits I will lay down for a few minutes and close my eyes, a lot of times getting visual or body stimulation, or my imagination runs wild.  I was curious so I did this, and then got back up and sat at my desk.  At this point I should probably start listing what I wrote down the day after about the whole experience, and the report will continue after.",
      "2:",
      "Every time I lay down and closed my eyes, I was all of the sudden sitting in front of the computer looking at experiences online and I read them all out loud but without speaking [my mental voice was louder than ever when I attempted to use it].  Some seemed to make perfect sense in my head, some made no sense and I could tell I was only thinking of it because of being fucked up.",
      "At one point I stared at a spot on the ceiling and I was somewhere else.  Don't know [where] but somewhere.  I realized what happened and my first thought was 'shit, open your eyes!' and when I tried to open my eyes, I discovered that they were already open and I was staring at the ceiling.",
      "I would get a 'feeling' that someone was near me.  It was more of a manifestation of someone, always transparent or only a head and transparent, and always on my right side.  It wasn't something to be alarmed about to me.  Every time I spoke with someone who wasn't actually there, it was done 'telepathically', usually didn't open my mouth.  If they didn't answer I'd find myself saying something out loud, then I'd physically turn around to look at the person, and there would be no one there.  I had only perceived a person, sometimes from when I closed my eyes to look for visuals.  I would sometimes find myself speaking out loud, and not know what I was referring to.",
      "There were sudden flashes of light on the walls and ceiling.  My skull poster was wavy, moving, and unbalanced. ",
      "I swear I saw a cat jump out my window while I was smoking a cigarette.  It was white and transparent.  Then I saw it again floating in my room but only for a split second.  I felt heavy, disconnected from myself, distant, I'd even venture to say enlightened in some ways.  I just had no way to make my mouth say what I was thinking, nor could I actually stay on one train of thought for any length of time, or remember what my response was to someone by the time they stopped talking to let me answer.  I saw transparent 'things' several of which resembled spiders.  I saw one hanging from my model airplane over the bed, and I saw probably 5 or 6 at one time on the blades of the ceiling fan, transparent white slightly glowing spiders.  One of them jumped off the fan blade with a string of web behind it and dive bombed onto the floor beside my bed.  Another one right onto my chest.  That was freaky, but I didn't feel the need to check and make sure it was a hallucination, I just knew.  I kept looking, and I could see no evidence that there was actually a web of any kind, but I kept seeing the 'spider legs' on top of the fan blades.",
      "Also, I saw parts of movies in my head 'on tv.'  Not what you're thinking... these movies didn't exist, even in theory, and I didn't recognize anyone who was taking part in them.  Or as I wrote somewhere else '...movies that were never made, with people who have no names.'",
      "I felt like I couldn't move when I laid down.  Thought I smoked a bowl or two and had a good bit left over, but actually I had smoked one bowl wayyyyyy earlier, and that was the last of it.  Unless I hid the stuff, which is always a possibility.",
      "I kept tripping over shit: my chair, books, random crap in the floor or sometimes things not even in the way.",
      "Light spots, long open stretches, lights in the distance, all these made the whole environment look like it came straight out of a fairy tale or dream of some sort, like the whole reality wasn't real at all.",
      "I was seeing glitches in my vision, the only way to describe it is like the Terminator's vision or something, and the corners would glitch sometimes and move or rip.",
      "Speaking of rips, I saw little rips in the fabric of our very reality... at least thats what it looked like to me.  Tiny balls of light floating to wherever they wanted to go, then expanding ever so slightly to expose a black hole center that soon overtook the light that had been surrounding it, and turned back to darkness.  Looked like the spots were turning themselves inside out.  At the time, I referred to them in my head as rips in the space-time continuum.  I dunno, musta sounded intelligent or something. ",
      "Everything that happened felt like a dream.  I was just mentally floating and everything felt light as if it was a cartoon world but not really, everything just looked like I was seeing it for the first time right then.  Everything was suddenly interesting and cool looking, kind of like when I first started smoking pot.",
      "Kept itching, couldn't sleep.  Had to keep shifting my position or I'd get restless and have muscle cramps.  Barely slept, on and off for a couple hours.",
      "Fan blades were warping or disappearing or spinning slowly, all without actually moving.",
      "I heard voices throughout the night, and 99% of the time I couldn't tell what they were saying.  Computer speakers were seeming to buzz in a way that I've never heard before, with nothing being played over them.  Black spots in vision were common, especially when turning lights on and off.  Had a lot of trouble reading small print such as on pill bottles, looked like a line of nothing.  Had to close one eye and squint the other just to barely see it. ",
      "I noticed that I had begun to walk more hunched over, 50% of the reason was clearly that my body felt heavy from the drugs, and the other 50% is truly unknown to me.  I'm sure I *could* have stood up, especially since I knew I was doing it.. but I just wouldn't. ",
      "I constantly felt like my muscles were 'lagging' behind my brain in where to go like being drunk, except it was controllable.",

      "The above description applies to the first two times I did it.  The below experiences (maybe three separate ones?) were done close together and were coupled with sleep deprivation and taking between 800mg and 1000mg Diphenhydramine.  These were funny while I was on the stuff, but thinking about it sober, it was kind of scary. ",
      "-Constantly heard voices like they were out in the hall.  Not pleasantly unintelligible like before, it was like they were right outside my door. I guessed it was my dad and I would say 'I can't hear you' through the door and listen, and he'd say something else and I'd get mad and say again that I can't understand him, he would repeat again and I'd actually go open the door and look in the hall, only to see no one there.  Same with my mom's voice.  They had long been in bed.  At highest dose this happened maybe 10 times in a row before I realized I needed to stop getting up.  I got pretty mad about this because I couldn't distinguish what was real and what wasn't. ",

      "- I did not experience much drowsiness, and in fact I could not sleep after taking that amount.  My body was *so* tired it was just limp and cramping up waiting to go to sleep, but my mind was still going, but not making any sense.  Everything that came through my mind was just off the wall, abstract, or complete gibberish. ",
      "-I kept getting up to look for something, or go do something, and no sooner than I stand up to do it, I forgot what the hell it was.  That made me irate for a while.",
      "-At certain times I would hear music playing in my head just as clearly as if I had ear buds in listening to my mp3 player, but all my speakers were off, no radio on, nothing.  Just the computer's fan running.  Heard all the instruments and vocals, sounded just like the real thing except for when I didn't know the words and my mind made up something that sounded like it just to continue the song  thats how I found out that the music wasn't really being played, because I almost got up to check.",
      "-I thought this was a dream:  I going through my desk, don't know why, and pulled an envelope out of my drawer.  It was from a friend in another state and he had asked me to put something illegal in it and send it back to him (forget what it was, but we talked about doing it with pot seeds before).  I opened up the envelope to check if I had put something inside to send to him, dumped the contents into my hands and it was two muzzle restrictors (1/2 choke and open choke) and a tool for my pump shotgun.  Been in that envelope for years, since I got the gun.  Have no idea why I did all that... Must have hallucinated part of it then grabbed the envelope is all I can think of!  I seem to remember trying to lick it shut too... But its sitting on top of stuff in my desk drawer so I really did pick it up, usually its around the bottom.  But I cant for the life of me think why I picked it up, or why I thought my friend had sent it?  Well there it is, unlicked and still has a staple in the top flap.  I made note of the staple even in my stupor.",
      "-I could have sworn I got up and looked out the window around 6 AM (yes I was actually awake) and saw my friend's truck back out of my driveway, heard him rev it up twice, then saw him leave.  At the time, I stayed out of view and hoped that he wouldn't come back, assuming he had come to get something he forgot, and I didn't want him to know I was awake tripping because he'd probably come fuck with me.  I texted him when I was sober and asked why he was at my house at that time, and he laughed and said he was asleep then and didn't know what I was talking about. ",
      "-When trying to wake up the morning after a trip, I 'perceived' that three of my friends were in my room passing a bowl (three people that would most likely not be seen in my room, two of which I hadn't seen in a year, the other has never met those two, and I've never smoked *with* anyone here).  It was passed to me, and I reached behind me to grab it while I was laying down, and when I didn't feel it in my hand I turned my head to look at the girl passing it, and the room was dark and empty.",
      "-My mother was trying to wake me up after one of my trips, she said I was talking about things that made no sense and she thought I was on LSD (? later said I was talking the same way I did after getting my wisdom teeth out -- fucked up and disoriented) and she was about to search my room for drugs, and then she assumed I was sick with the flu.  I woke up and felt sick to my stomach, had a headache, diarrhea, fever, all the signs of a stomach bug of some kind.  I told her I thought it was caused by the sleeping pills I took (but didn't tell her I had taken over 800mg of it!).  I hadn't had this kind of feeling from the pills before, so she was able to convince me to go to the doctor, who prescribed an anti-vomiting medicine and sent me home.  I never did take it, stayed up a while then slept it off and when I woke up (9 PM the next day) I felt fine.",
      "-After one of my trips, I found two sleeping pills on the floor and two under my keyboard.  I wonder if I took more than I thought? Or less than I thought?  Also there were two bowl packs of weed already ground up under the keyboard (well, that was a pleasant surprise).  I found four more pills laying loose in my left drawer.  I thought I was keeping track of them better than that, even while tripping.",

Sounds like it came from out my window, or from the computer.  Sounded like high-pitched voice.  I honestly don't know if it was real or fake.  But I really don't care.  5:36  I just felt a larger wave -------- there it was again.  Pleasant, but kind of scary at the same time.",

I'd think I saw something sitting next to me, and just like someone else's experience said, it didn't phase me, didnt seem out of the ordinary at all while I was under the influence of this stuff, I just didn't even question it.

      "I got trapped amongst the mental health regime due to my parents demanding that I see a psych, after condemning my trying recreational drugs.  I love most dopamine, serotonin, and phenylethylamine substances.  I had stated plainly that I liked methamphetamine a bit, mushrooms alot, and when I had research chemicals sent to me (2cp and 5meo-dmt) my family all came down on me like a tonne of angry dirt.",
      "So, I have a meeting with a shrink arranged for me, and I think the mention that I used speed, pot, and what not made him think I was a candidate. He orders that I be reviewed in a mental hospital. When in hospital a few chicks came on to me, I got labelled as inappropriate by the docs, I had a few interviews the outcome of which was that I was 'grandiose and amused' which somehow in some wierd strange incomprehensible to me and judgemental way proved that I had psychosis- hence the 50mg shots in the bum and 6 month community treatment order.",
      "Now it is interesting to note they gave me a 3 months sickness claim, meaning I could have an allowance as they had deemed me unfit for work. The medication kept on coming after I was discharged, but after the 3 months I was back to independence. My beliefs had not changed a bit, I had less I wanted to share with others, I was suffering somnolence (sleeping for 12-15 hours a day), my empathy had trailed off to something vague and brittle and my desire to do anything about it was diminished moreso. I rationalised that patience is all I could rely on and the treatment order would be over soon enough.",
      "For some reason the treatment order has been renewed, and renewed, and renewed, and is imminently set to be renewed once again. I know that I have anger about this, but the risperdal ensures that my emotions are shut tight in the cardboard box so to speak, and feeds me more shredded cardboard, which leaves me morose and sullen, and a bit sick.",
      "The cost of a shot is in excess of $700. It is given fortnightly. 2 people are travelling 30 mins each way in a company car to administer it to me. Add the cost of wages and petrol. I have never paid for this. I really wonder how society is structured in that war, for instance, is so destructive yet makes big money, and in a similar fashion risperidone, which is so unpleasant and destructive to the appreciation of life, can be making money by its sheer distribution and implementation.",
      "Let me just say I think the force is a sham and the outcomes insidious. Reduction in transmitter activity is akin to brain damage. The longer I'm stuck on this hampster wheel for no other reason than that I retain the right to take recreational drugs, the more I think Im a victim of the argument of institution versus freedom. I do have a strong spiritual belief that all the bad stuff is temporary, and if I persevere in doing the right thing God will do an accounting and I will inherit what I really deserve."

      "This weekend has been the culmination of a wonderful month. A series of really great events in my life coupled with some important realizations have led me to being able to continually maintain a flow of love radiating from myself, which has spread to others around me and which has made me the happiest I've ever been for that period of this past month.",
      "I've come to realize two things lately: one, emotion depends heavily upon the physical flow of energy through your body (through your chakras to be specific), two, the flow of energy throughout your body can be altered with practice through meditation and other mental exercises. Personally I've become aware that love and joy express themselves as a warm, euphoric energy radiating outward and being released from the solar plexus and the heart. Depression and anxiety happen when this energy in the solar plexus and heart changes to become a creeping, pulsing unpleasant energy which loops around and never is released like it is when you're feeling love and euphoria (the lack of release is perhaps the reason it feels bad instead of good). The result of this is a buildup of physical anxiety and mental negativity.",
      "Of course, changing this at will is much easier said than done. I just know that this past month I've been able to consistently keep my energy flowing outward and have had probably the best month of my life. The best ways I know of to change this energy are being affected by the love coming from others (loved pets are excellent for this because they never stop expressing it to you), enjoying and/or playing excellent music, creating and/or experiencing other types of art, and passionate discussion. Also with practice, meditation can allow you to move the energy more towards positivity.",
      "So anyway, the weekend culminated in me getting engaged to my girlfriend of five years on Friday night, which was really an amazing experience. So needless to say, when we got home Saturday night I was simply ecstatic! So it only added to my excitement when I discovered a mysterious vial that had appeared in my mailbox containing 30mg of DOM HCl, one of the compounds I've always had at or near the top of my to-do list, but which I never expected to find! Given that my mental state was so excellent, I decided right there to sample it at a low-ish dose. I waited until later on at night so I could have the majority of my experience alone. I've got no problems taking most psychedelics (other than shattering doses) around my fiance, as I am totally comfortable with her, but I prefer to be alone to really explore a substance.",
      "12:55am (1-29-2007) - Ingested 7mg of DOM HCl dissolved in a solution of 2.217mL of ethanol and 4.783mL of distilled water. No perceptible taste. I held the solution sublingually for about 10 minutes before swallowing. I then went back downstairs to hang out with L (my fiance) for a while.",
      "1:55 - It's been an hour, and the effects have definitely started. It feels at this point like a very gentle amphetamine buzz, and nothing but pleasant. As a matter of fact, it has increased the euphoria emanating from my solar plexus, but has decreased the output of love, as it seems to make me a bit more analytical than I am in my sober state. Still, I feel very emotional. The only other DOX I've tried a full dose of is DOC, which I am very familiar with, and DOC seems to distance me from my emotions to a much greater degree. With DOM, at least so far, I feel exactly like myself, but like a version of myself that is mentally stimulated and beginning to see things sparkle.",
      "2:30 - Very light nausea begins, but I'm still feeling very good. Physical stimulation has increased, but it's a unique stimulation. Generally on amphetamine compounds, including DOC, I get some sweaty palms and feet and other minor signs of physical overstimulation. On amphetamine itself, I feel grossly overstimulated most of the time. This stimulation, however, is extraordinarily clean, giving me lots of energy but without any anxiety or outward signs of stimulation. I feel light and happy and curious about what's to come.",
      "3:06 - I threw up in a sudden rapid increase in nausea, feeling fine now. Very acidic stomach contents. Immediately after throwing up I got in bed to lay down with L for a while and allow the rest of this drug to come on. At this point, the effects have snuck deep into my mind. This drug is extremely clean which makes it somewhat hard to describe on the body, at least at this dose. I felt sober and lucid until all of a sudden I'd realize I was lost in fantasy with no idea what had been going on. I had no ability to focus on anything for very long without losing myself in something barely related or totally off-topic. After throwing up, the effects came on quite strongly, and I felt a sensation that most psychedelics do not cause anymore for me. it's a sensation I associate with real mental psychedelic power. It's like a repeating pattern of suddenly finding myself overwhelmed, which compels me to close my eyes and roll them back a bit, and it's almost like I phased out for a second. The sensation of euphoria from my solar plexus was extremely high, leaving me feeling really good. Waves of pleasure flowed strongly over my body. I laid in bed writhing pleasantly and drifting continually further and further into fantasy.",
      "Each time I phased back into reality from the inexplicable world of fantasy I was entering, I became aware that I was starting to drift off really far, much farther than the apparent strength of the drug should have allowed. I felt my mindstate getting deeper and deeper. Every time I closed my eyes, the darkness would begin to arrange itself, gain color, fractallize, and eventually turn into the sorroundings of an entirely different frame of reference. With eyes open, all I could see was a light sparkle and minor shifting of small patterns.",
      "At some point, I fell into a dream. It was just like falling into fantasy as I had been doing for a while as described above, except that I was aware I had actually just fallen asleep. This means my dream was lucid, something that has only happened one other time to me in my life. As I entered the dream I opened my eyes (in my dream) and my bedroom around me began to turn blue and purple. The walls began to fractallize and expand slowly outward until I was no longer in a room at all, but outside on the streets of a big city. This city looked like New York more than anything, but slightly futuristic. I had a few minutes to marvel at the landscape and the fact that I knew I was dreaming. I was tripping very hard but very easily in the dream, on DOM. The feeling of the drug was exactly the same only its intensity level was heightened hugely. The world around me was twisting apart into fractals and bright colors. Impossible events of chance were happening all around me. An air of importance hung in the air. I had a sense that what I was experiencing was being told to me by a presence which felt to me like some sort of warm and patronly figure telling a bedtime story to his grandchild. Again I must stress the incredible vividness and lucidity of this dream. I experienced each moment while realizing I was in a dream. I could see, hear, feel, and taste what was happening around me, and feel the trip very strongly.",
      "I began to notice that everyone else walking around the streets going about their day had started to notice as well. I felt as if my trip was creeping into each of them. I became aware of their alarm and some fear, and mainly a strong nervousness at the apparent falling apart of reality, which had so far not progressed far. Suddenly I became a man who was walking by.",
      "Abruptly I was no longer aware that I was a guy named Xorkoth dreaming a strangely vivid dream. I was a guy whose name I can no longer remember, and I was a businessman. My mind was preoccupied with the desire to hurry up and be on time, and make that money. I was completely consumed by it and had been for years. It was the most important part of my life. It was my life.",
      "Then I looked up when I began to feel a strange glowing in my solar plexus and an inexplicable stimulation. I noticed the world around me rippling and bending, exploding into detailed fractals. I began to feel nervous. I had tried LSD once when I was younger, I didn't like it because I felt out of control. Was I having a flashback? Quickly now, the deconstruction of the world around me progressed. I began to get more nervous - I had absolutely NO idea what was happening! I realized that everyone around me was experiencing the same thing.",
      "Suddenly, my frame of view appeared as a window on a computer would, like a maximized Internet Explorer window without the frame and controls and so forth (which is what makes it look like a window, but somehow a computer window is what I am reminded of). Everything stopped as if the computer had frozen and a window popped up that said 'critical error - the joke is up!' Then my frame of view cracked and split, revealing an impossibly detailed mass of moving fractals behind it. The world began to disappear completely. As it was doing so, I simultaneously became extremely frightened. I went through a very traumatic process where I alternated between denial and realization about what was happening. I began to slowly accept that the world was over. Awareness from beyond my ego began to slowly leak in as everything dissolved. I realized that I had been fooled this whole time, that my actual state of being was not as some silly preoccupied businessman. I hadn't felt this way since I was a child. But the intensity was so frightening and I was still halfway in my ego. The terror grew and grew until I was rocking back and forth, totally consumed by terror. This was my death, this was it, it's all over... As I faded out completely I began to hear frantic meows, and I felt a thought, at first belonging to a host of ambiguous figures from behind the scenes and then from my own mind, of amusement at some cosmic joke, which we had reached the culmination of, the punch line so to speak...",
      "4:53 - The meows continued, stronger and stronger, and I suddenly realized again that I was dreaming and that I had begun this somewhere else entirely. I began to feel a fuzziness pushing on my chest and face. In the endless field of fractals, I saw a large cat's shadow form. Then I slowly became aware of my bedroom. The walls materialized from the fractals and grew back together in proportion. I became aware that my kitty Magnolia was frantically meowing at me and pawing increasingly hard at my chest while nuzzling her head very hard into my cheek. As I woke up she was staring straight into my eyes and looked very concerned. I gathered my bearings as the fractals still playing on my newly coalesced walls faded into the substance of the walls and the room regained normality. As I emerged I felt a deep sense of awe and a nagging feeling of importance which transformed the energy of terror and the realization of mortality back into a euphoric glowing force. My cat calmed down and I got up to go sit at my computer and begin typing notes about my dream before I forgot it. My cat came in right after me and spent the rest of the night sitting on my lap being very affectionate.",
      "Surpringly, the effects of the psychedelic amphetamine seemed already much down from the peak, at just a little over T+4:00. In fact, the effects were never that strong until I laid down with my eyes closed. I still felt the euphoric stimulation and occasionally the intense eye-closing sensation described at the beginning of this report, but other than that, I felt pretty sober, definitely down. I would have preferred to have still been peaking, but I still enjoyed the rest of my night greatly. The DOM remained in my brain, helping me to enjoy some really great music and bringing me a lot of pleasure, but otherwise remaining pretty transparent.",
      "6:45 - I decided to go to bed and fell asleep pretty quickly and comfortably, which is a testament to how incredibly gentle this substance was to me. I woke up at 8:00am with L (after only about an hour of sleep) and we proceeded to have a very nice day, one which was slightly colored by the long plateau of DOM. It was a very pleasant day.",
      "I'm left wondering what the hell that dream was. It was like no other dream I've ever had. It was deep, powerful, totally lucid, and gave me a sense of light forboding. It felt important. Two days later, it's still lingering in my mind. I will hold off on speculation, and I look forward to having a full experience with DOM. Next time I will be taking 15mg, and then I should be able to see just how far this one can go.",
      "DOM seems to be a fantastic substance, transparent but very powerful at the same time. It feels very archetypal, like DOC, only more subtle and with a greater capacity for sneaking you into very far-out situations. It was very pleasurable, but during that dream the terror I felt was very real and isn't something I will soon forgot. As a person who had no experience with psychedelics (the businessman), I witnessed the breakdown of reality and the ascension out of the ego, and as we all know, that can be a terrifying experience, especially when it happens stone cold sober in the middle of the day (which was the case for the businessman I briefly was).",
      "I'm very intrigued to continue exploration with this one ..."

      "In the few years I've been exploring psychoactives, I've had a number of disparate chemical experiences. I usually do not write experience reports unless I think it was an extremely special experience for one reason or another. This is one of those, possibly my second strongest mushroom trip ever.",
      "I am a daily marijuana and tobacco smoker, and I also drink with some regularity, although not nearly as much as many of my fellow college students. Prior to this, I had been tripping once every week or two on 2C-I for about two months. Although I have lots of previous mushroom experience, I had not taken any for quite some time, except for one small dose which I'll write about below.",
      "A while before (a month or so? I don't know for certain) a friend of mine, who I had introduced to acid, asked me to get some shrooms for him. I obliged, picking up approximately 7.1g for him, myself, and possibly one or two other friends. For some reason, he asked me to hang on to them. I thought it odd, but did it anyways, tossing the bag on my glove box and forgetting about it. After being impossible to get ahold of, by friend called me up and told me he didn't want them, wanted to trade for weed instead, which set off a whole other load of bullshit that I won't get into here, but basically resulted in him not being welcome around our group of friends anymore.",
      "About a week prior to the mushroom trip, I had taken my usual 20mg of 2C-I and went tripping. At the tail end, I drank a couple of beers, and decided to pull out the shrooms. I grabbed two caps, estimated to be about a gram each, and ate them. After that I drank another couple beers. By coincidence, the university library was set on fire that night, so I went to watch the fire trucks and billowing smoke with a couple buddies. While there, I noticed a huge body load. Now, body loads on mushrooms for me are quite common. I will constantly have one of my knees give out from under me if I'm standing still, and I'll be unable to keep my balance while walking, and list slightly from side to side, almost like I'm drunk. But this was different. By the time I made it back to my dorm room, I almost couldn't move. I landed on my bed and fell asleep immediately. I chalked the physical weakness up to an odd combination of substances.",
      "So the next week (week before finals) I was bored. Everyone else was studying, but because I started at spring semester, I had a bunch of easy classes that didn't require much if any studying. Might as well shroom, I thought. Borrowing a friends scale, I measured to see how much I had left. With bag, it was 4.7g, which means I had about 3.5g of shroomage. Since I had also given a cap to my tripping partner the last week, I was left with mostly stems, some dust, and one tiny pinner shroom where the cap was still wrapped around the stem. I got some OJ, and started munching.",
      "Kinda. The smell was so bad that I couldn't bear the thought of tasting them, which is slightly unusual for me. I usually have no problems with either the smell or taste, but these smelled so much, it was unbearable. So I broke all the stems up into bite size pieces, then repeatedly filled my mouth with OJ, dropped in a piece or two, then worried them with my tongue until the fell apart enough to swallow. The first time I tried this, I almost choked on the stem section, but after that it was smooth sailing. After about half the bag, something told me to stop, so I did. I decided to eat the rest when I started feeling something. This was between about 6:30 and 6:40.",
      "At about 7:30, I smoked a bowl and decided that what I was feeling was indeed the shrooms, and not a placebo. I proceeded to eat the rest of the bag in the same fashion as above. I put on some South Park, the episode where the kids drink cough syrup and trip out. I have never been so effected by the sounds and visuals presented during the tripping segment before. Either those guys have some experience with DXM, or they did damn good research. Between 7:30 and 8:15, I felt my brain getting increasingly static filled and confusing, and at the same time, I felt physically weaker and weaker.",
      "I looked up at a lithograph my mom had done in college. Already an extremely psychedelic print, it was twisting and waving like mad. I had partially convinced myself this was going to be a light trip, even when I was feeling the effects so strongly, because the bag was mostly stems. I couldn't deny that this was going to be a mega trip any more.I decided to try and lie down. With a great deal of effort, I switched off the ceiling light, leaving only my computer screen and desk lamp on, and crawled onto my bed.",
      "In my memory, the change was sudden, but I don't know for certain if it was. I do know that the realization was sudden, things seemed clear. Simple. Fresh. Clean. My bed was made for the first time since I moved into the dorms, on a whim, and I was lying on top of the quilt with a fleece blanket covering my legs, and I felt wonderful. I am normally a tense person, muscle wise. I don't relax very well. On top of that, I have a high natural tolerance for opiates and muscle relaxers, so I have to constantly stretch and try to stay loose. But on these shrooms, I was totally relaxed, like my muscles had turned to butter. It took unbelievable effort to move any part of my body.",
      "I lay there, listening to South Park in the background, and watching the ceiling bulge and ripple, almost as if it were made of rubber and a whole bunch of dog or cat sized animals were walking on top of it, except it was much smoother. Very liquid seeming. Light geometric patterns, arcs and lines with equallly spaced hashes across them. In my mind they were measuring tics, although I don't know what they were measuring.  The tics would fly across my vision (think of the tie and the refreshments at the picnic in the beginning of A Beautiful Mind). CEV's, not something I normally get, were made of complex spinning fractals. And I felt peace.",
      "Very little emotion, just calm serenity. Contenedness. I have often though that the state of being content was much better than being happy. Happiness is temporary and relative, and is always followed by sadness or anger or despair of some form. Being content, on the other hand, does not set you up for a fall, because it does not aspire to great heights. My belief was fully reinforced by my trip.",
      "I lay in bed till about 10:45 at which point I felt strong enough to go to the bathroom and then sit back in my chair and watch more South Park. I realized the my skin felt funny, puffy and spongy, like those animals that I and maybe you got as kids, where you would put them in water, and they would grow to many times their original size. In the process, the material they were made out of would get slimy and soft, and had a very odd and unique texture. The fact that my skin now held this texture delighted me completely. I started licking and biting my skin to see how it felt. Which was weird. It's impossible for me to fully describe how it felt, but it was somewhat akin to a mild electrical shock. I smoked some more weed, and lay down again. The rest of the night was spent alternating between hits of weed, swallows of juice, these delicious cookies I bought, and the bathroom. I fell asleep around midnight and woke up the next day feeling fine.",
      "Conclusion: Wow. I had forgotten how strong mushrooms could be. I've never had mushrooms like those before though. Usually I will either be chilled out, like I'm super stoned, or hyper and weird, and often I'll switch between these states in the course of one trip. But this is the first time I felt like that, so completely serene and peaceful. If I can find more of these, I'm buying a half ounce."

    "report": [
      "I've tripped on 2C-I maybe 15 times in total. It was the first psychedelic I truly tripped off of. I had taken a small amount of mushrooms previously, but only gotten a body high. And it has remained my favorite, mostly because of its amiability to almost any situation. However, sometimes I can still be surprised by its power and intensity. This is a report of one such situation. If you're interested in a real pseudo-scientific account with all effects and times noted, this isn't it. There is lots of info on the effects of 2C-I in a quantitative sense. This is a qualitative report.",
      "I had acquired 1 gram of 2C-I from an online retailer, and bottled most of it into 20mg capsules. Unfortunately, I only had a scale with accuracy to .01 gram, with a +/- .01, so they could potentially have been as high as 30mg. I have however gotten very good at eyeballing approximate dosages, so I don't think any were off by more than a few milligrams.",
      "Anyways, I was over at my friend M's apartment, where she and her coworker J were hanging out drinking. M started telling J about my 2C-I, since she had done it previously and had loved it. J expressed an interest, but only wanted to do it if we would trip with him. Well, I was down.",
      "I pulled out my pill bottle and poured out the capsules, selecting the capsule that looked the fullest, and one from out of the middle of the pack. M wanted to snort a little bit rather than full-out trip, so I used a flathead screwdriver to pull about 5-7mg from the larger capsule, and held it up to her nose. After it disappeared into her nasal passage, I recapped the pill, gave it to J, and we each swallowed our capsule. (Me ~20mg, J ~16mg, M ~6mg)",
      "We hung out for a little bit, smoked a bowl (not J, he gets tested so he doesn't smoke anymore), then M decided she wanted to go across the courtyard to her neighbors apartment. We grabbed a bubbler and some weed and left. Her neighbor's apartment, though exactly the same style, seemed small and dirty by comparison. I did not enjoy hanging out there, though the fact that only one other person joined us in a large 'party bowl' meant I at least got high.",
      "I also started getting my first serious effects, the classic plate tectonics on the walls, groups of bumps or whatever sliding past each other as if floating on something, and a definite awareness of social situations and how ingrained peoples responses can be. After being there for maybe half an hour, I suddenly realized that B had called M a while ago and said he was coming over. I reminded M, and she bounded out the door. Turns out he was just walking up to her door, so the timing was perfect. :-)",
      "After M came back in with B, we smoked a little bit more weed and chilled. M sat down beside me and said she wasn't really feeling it, and she'd kinda like some more. I interpreted this as a request, and after mulling it over in my brain for a while, I handed her a full capsule to take. I assumed that was the end of it. Shortly afterward we went back to M's house.",
      "I crashed onto the couch, assuming this was where the trip was really gonna pick up. M grabbed beers for herself, B, and J, who had been drinking this entire time. After downing those, M jumped up, grabbed J, announced they were going for a walk, and left. This confused the fuck out of me. I could not understand her reasoning, and it pissed me off that she would exclude me. Weren't we tripping together? Wasn't the sole reason I had tripped tonight because J wanted me to trip too? WHAT THE FUCK?!?!",
      "Added to this was the fact that B, although a cool guy most of the time, is also sketchy, weird looking, weird acting, suspicious, and generally not a good trip companion. He kept asking me what I was tripping on. Not the substance, but the elements in the world, which did not to me seem like a valid question. How do I explain it? He had acquired a sketch pad and pencil from somewhere, and was drawing. I watched him for a while, but it seemed to really bug him that I was watching. Art in action, something I love even sober. So I stopped.",
      "At this point, things really got intense. I remember looking at the walls, sighing internally, and thinking '2C-I....the eternal +2' which is a dammed lie. All of a sudden, the walls started melting away, and the floor started growing up in vines along the wall.",
      "I sorta collapsed onto the floor, not all at once, but in a slow slide off the chair onto my knees, in a prayer or meditation position. I was facing the doorway to the kitchen, and one of M's cats was laying down right in the middle of the floor, perfectly framed by the doorway. All of a sudden I was filled with this great love and acceptance. I was ready for anything at that point. I could have died on the spot, and half expected to, and it would not have bugged me in the least. Anything could happen, and it would be OK. It was almost a disappointment when nothing did happen.",
      "The cat moved, and with it so did the feeling of peace. I sat there, waiting for the cat to return so I could feel peaceful again, but when the cat came back and lay down in almost the exact same position, I didn't feel anything. I concentrated, and still nothing. All of a sudden I realized that the cat had nothing to do with the way I was feeling. It was just a coincidence.",
      "I pulled myself back into my chair, and the cat came over to me. I stroked it's head, mentally telling it 'Thank you, you've reminded me that everyone is on their own trip, and that trip has very little to do with me and even less to do with mine.' I meant life trip, not drug-induced trip, although it still applies. I felt sad, but that was OK. That's just the way things are. I stood up and grabbed a glass of water, which felt wonderful to drink.",
      "About this time, M and J burst back in, full of excitement and talk about how wonderful trees are. I encouraged both of them to grab a glass of water, which prompted J to emit some sort of half gurgled rant about how everyone was too cautious, ending in some sort of comment about bloody noses that I didn't catch. I tried to calmly explain that it was just smart, especially since he'd been drinking and was probably dehydrated anyways. M backed me up, telling J that if I said he needed water, he needed water. He grumbled but complied.",
      "I started to settle back, once again anticipating the usual tripping gab session. But it was not to be. After about 15 minutes, B got up to leave, which was fine by me. But right after he left, M grabbed J and left again, this time with no explanation, while I was in the bathroom. So here I was, all alone in someone else's house, and I'm tripping balls. Not a happy situation. I can understand needing to be alone, I can understand needing to be alone with someone else, but I cannot understand leaving a third person, especially with no explanation or warning, and especially alone in a relatively unknown environment. Utterly ridiculous. I almost left right there. Luckily, they were only gone for about 10 minutes this time. Then M announced she was driving both of us home. Confused, I pointed out she was still tripping.",
      "'No I'm not.'",
      "'But you took more 2C-I. Even if you're not right now, you will be soon, and I don't want you driving drunk and tripping.'",
      "'I've only had 3 beers over the night, and I sold the capsule.'",
      "'....What?'",
      " Yeah, for $10.'",
      "'Well....can I get some of that?'",
      "'No.'",
      "And so she drove us home. Well, she drove me home. I actually think she took J back to her house to screw him, and the point of them leaving together in the first place was to make out. As I was getting out of the car, I once again make J promise to drink water. I went to my dorm and looked at the clock. Oh crap. Only about 3.5 hours had passed. I still had a full night ahead of me.",
      "I decided to best thing to do would be to just crawl into bed, hopefully fall asleep early. But all I did for the next three hours was get more and more worked up about how M had treated me. I'd had a crush on her since I met her, and I knew she liked me too, so I could just not fathom her acting the way she did. I could have used the $10, or even $5. She has a job. And I had given it to her. GIVEN it to HER. So that SHE could trip with US. Being forced to deal with situations and people I didn't want to on what was supposed to be an easy fun night really pissed me off. I could not believe her. I started coming up with all sorts of different scenarios in my head of me going to ask her for the money and her refusing, giving me license to fucking rage at her for a while, really tell the bitch off.",
      "At about T+6 or so I finally fell asleep.",
      "The next day I asked M for my money, and she gave it to me without comment. But I learned several valuable things about her that night that made me stop liking her. And I also learned that if I trip with other people, I better be damned sure about them and their commitment to me and the trip and the vibe. Also, the trip helped me come to the conclusion that you cannot really depend on anything, as much as you'd like to, and as much as maybe you'd like other people or things to depend on you. Shit happens."

      "This will be a pretty brief report, but it was abnormal and interesting so I will relay my experience nonetheless.",
      "For the sake of completion, I should mention that two days ago, I ingested a combination of 2C-T-21 and 2C-C. I don't feel this had anything to do with my experience, but I thought I'd mention it.",
      "At 7:00pm, I ingested 9 grams of kratom after not having had it for longer than usual. I took it not out of a mental craving but because minor withdrawal was starting to creep in and I'm currently weaning myself off, primarily to save money so I'm not poor for the rest of my life. Anyway, the kratom hit me much harder and with greater euphoria than it has in a long time, another perk to cutting way back. I settled down with my girlfriend to watch some TV. As it happens, I was watching a Roseanne marathon (again).",
      "At about 9:00, or T+2:00, I decided to smoke some cannabis. I had smoked it once earlier that day, around 6:30, but it had mostly worn off. The kratom was still in effect but no longer at peak. I took three vaporizer pulls as well as shared a bowl with my girlfriend, in rapid succession. Both devices had a mixture of very high quality White Widow and L.S.D. (a very good newish strain by BOG seeds) in them, and the bowl additionally had a thin layer of pure kief on top. I hit the vaporizer first, and after finishing the bowl next, I laid back and continued to watch TV.",
      "I noticed that I was becoming extremely high, moreso than usual. I find that kratom adds a very good element to marijuana. The combination of the two can be pretty psychedelic. Kratom primarily enhances the physical buzz of cannabis by making me more able to feel my field of energy. Cannabis on its own causes this effect moreso than almost anything else I've used, which is in my opinion why it is so synergistic with psychedelics and almost any other drug. It is a very physically psychedelic substance, even after I become used to it and the mental elements become routine. With kratom added, it feels as if waves of electrical energy are running up and down my body and leaping outward, forming loops which reconnect with my body elsewhere. The patterns of energy roughly form the visual of a group of closed rings of energy that sprout from my body randomly and reconnect somewhere else, surrounding me in a sort of cocoon.",
      "Anyway, I felt so good and psychedelic that I closed my eyes for a bit, as doing so, I've found, can dramatically increase the physical and mental aspects of any high by dissociating me from my surroundings and focusing me entirely upon the aspects of my high. This time was more dramatic than it has ever been without being in a partial sleep state.",
      "I quickly dissociated from where I really was. The body high grew and grew exponentially until it felt nearly salvia-like, with points of great gravity or pressure running around my body, especially my legs - down, down, down, light speed, even faster. I gradually lost awareness of the sounds of the TV and began to realize I was somewhere else. At this point I was unaware I had taken any drugs, but wide awake. I was still aware I was laying down. I began to feel a great pressure on my chest, and I began struggling to breathe. It felt like my throat was extremely narrow and I had to force air to pass through it into my lungs. I was slightly alarmed but I was able to continue breathing so I rode it out. And besides, this was my reality at the moment and I felt I had no choice.",
      "I knew I was me, but I didn't know who 'me' was other than this nexus of perceptions I was experiencing. I became aware of some sort of entity that was communicating with me. I can't remember what was being communicated anymore, although I was very aware at the time and right after I regained awareness of my surroundings. It felt very important though. We were in disagreement but the entity was clearly a figure of authority of some sort. My feeling was one of wariness and sheepish acceptance of what the entity was saying. I was not able to actually physically see anything during this experience, as I had my eyes closed, but nevertheless I was able to perceive information about where I was. I was in some sort of room, laying down on my back (in reality I was on my side). I was unable to move but was fully conscious and awake. I felt no fear but the experience was not really enjoyable either. It felt very serious and slightly alarming due to the difficulty in breathing effectively.",
      "After some communication and some other significant events that I cannot recall anymore, I felt as if I was receiving energy from somewhere. My body felt charged and was buzzing extremely strongly, to the point of producing a soundless but still very loud 'noise'. I was buzzing so hard it tickled, and at that point I became aware once again that I was laying down with my eyes closed, and that I was this guy named Xorkoth and so forth. I opened my eyes and immediately I was totally out of the state I had been in. I looked at the clock and realized I'd only been away for about a minute. Subjectively it felt longer, but only maybe about 10 minutes long, not an eternity or anything. I immediately told my girlfriend about it in more detail than I was able to here, since I had more of it in my memory then.",
      "The experience was very odd and similar to another experience I had with kratom and weed a while back, where I was repeatedly thrown into lucid dreams that were indistinguishable from reality in every way, where I was embedded 3 to 4 layers deep in those dreams. I then woke up and had sleep paralysis for several minutes where I couldn't move at all and found it very hard to breathe. This experience was similar, but it was a total removal of consensual reality into a very psychedelic state, whereas the previous experience was just like reality, only it wasn't. The difficulty breathing was identical, but it seemed to be a perceived difficulty in breathing rather than an actual one, because in both cases, the instant I snapped out, I was able to breathe normally.",
      "The speed and total removal of the state really took me by surprise. It reaffirms to me the psychedelic power of marijuana, when used properly. If one wills themselves into altered states with it, it's possible to have some pretty profound experiences with it, even when you use it every day like I do.",
      "When I get home later today I'll ask my girlfriend what I said to her about it right afterwards, and perhaps she'll be able to refresh me somewhat. If that's the case, I'll add to this.",
      "Just wanted to share because I found it interesting. Has anyone else had any experiences like this?"

    "report": [
      "I'd consider myself pretty experienced in the world of psychedelics, especially with LSD. I'd done mushrooms a couple times before, never with any problems. So on Thanksgiving my friend and I decided to get a quarter of shrooms and split it between the two of us. We ended up getting a little over a quarter, and split it between three people, the two of us ate an eighth and we gave my girlfriend at the time a couple stems & caps.",
      "I was in a great mindset all day, it had been months since I've tripped on anything and I was really looking forward to a good shroom trip--and of course, I had one. About a half hour after I ate them I started feeling really anxious and slightly disconnected from reality. My body wouldn't stop vibrating and all my limbs were going crazy (they wouldn't stop twitching). After about 10 minutes of this my girlfriend and I left go go pick something up from our friends house a block away. It was a relief to get outside, as soon as we started walking the anxiety turned into euphoria and I couldn't stop laughing. Everything looked as if it were a cartoon. The ground was wavering and trees were twisting and bending towards me. I could tell my girlfriend was  enjoying it too, because everywhere she looked she'd start cracking up.",
      "Once we got back to the house we put on the movie Tommy (the Who). I knew it was a really trippy movie and I wanted to watch it, but my mind was fixed on the wall behind the TV. The wall had so much depth and it looked fake, and from each of the four corners of the wall, going into the center, were ripples. Then they started changing colors. I remember people were trying to talk to me and I just felt that words weren't important. What was the point of talking? I just wanted to think, and watch. I felt so good, everything felt so peaceful and geometric patterns were crawling all over the walls.",
      "I zoned out like this for well over an hour, so I was about 3 hours into my trip. Then slowly I could feel myself come back to reality. I felt extremely uncomfortable, anxious, and nauseated. My mouth was really dry and heavy but drinking anything made my stomach more upset. The visuals were completely gone, no wavering effects, colors, patterns, etc. I wasn't even seeing trails anymore! But my girlfriend and my friend were both still coming up, and that's when I felt that something must be really wrong. I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, my skin was extremely pale and my pupils weren't even dilated anymore--in fact, they were smaller than they are when I'm not trippin. Then the nausea and the heaviness in my mouth got so overwhelming that I threw up. Then I threw up a couple more times and figured I'd start feeling better so I didn't tell anyone. But every 5 minutes I found myself going to the bathroom to throw up.",
      "I tried smoking weed but it just increased my anxiety. I couldn't smoke a cigarette because it made me throw up again. 4 hours of this passed and I called my mom to pick me up. While waiting for her to arrive my stomach started hurting so bad that I couldn't breathe and I had to sit on my knees with my face in the ground to help ease the pain. My mom assumed I had the stomach flu, but I knew something was wrong---I just couldn't stop throwing up even though there was nothing to throw up and my stomach felt like somebody was pushing it with a huge rock until the rock broke through everything straight through to the back. And I knew the shrooms weren't bad because for one, they looked very fresh, and also because neither of my friends got sick from them.",
      "I continued throwing up for two more hours or so, and the pain in my stomach just got worse. My mom took me to the hospital, and I had to be pushed in a wheel chair because I couldn't walk. While I was waiting to get signed in I fell forward in the wheelchair (I couldn't figure out what was going on, I just knew my stomach hurt and the only way to help it was to lean forward). They immediately took me back to a room and gave me injections of morphine and some anti-nausea medication. All my veins were collapsed from dehydration and bloodwork showed that I had unusually high levels of white blood cells (700 or so, it  should be 300). The next thing I knew I was being transported to another hospital, where I ended up staying for 5 days. I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and they are still clueless as to why I came down with it, and I assumed it was unrelated to the shrooms and never brought them up.",
      "So about two weeks after I got out, I stupidly ate more shrooms, but only about a gram and a half. They were the same ones as before, only much more blue. And then it happened again. Three hours after I ate them I started throwing up. Except this time I was outside waiting for a bus. It was snowing out and I was on the other side of town, and my car was in Parma with my sister so my mom couldn't come pick me up. So I was pretty much walking down the street throwing up and moaning from pain. I actually fell to the ground, and just like before I sat on my knees and put my face into the ice. I lay there for at least 45 minutes and then continued to walk again. I had to go to a Giant Eagle and have a cop call the rescue squad to take me to the hospital. This time my white blood cell count was at 2600 and once again I went to the hospital for almost a week. I'd really like to know why shrooms would do this to me. Everyone seems to be just as clueless as I am. But the pain the shrooms have caused me doesn't stop there.",
      "The second time being in the hospital was too much. When I tried falling asleep I heard a voice tell me to get out of the room, causing me to jump up out of bed in a state of panic like nothing I've ever felt before. My thoughts were so disconnected and I felt like I was going crazy. My heart was pounding, I was sweaty and I couldn't stop shaking. Then I started hyperventilating. I thought I was dying, I knew that I was dying. My heart was going to stop and I could feel it. And of course, this is a panic attack at its worse and it was even worse than when I had my first bad acid trip & thought I was having a heart attack.",
      "Ever since that night I get panic attacks all the time, sometimes they aren't full blown, and I'm stuck in this anxious state where I feel like I'm just going crazy and my brain won't stop talking. Often within an hour of feeling this way I go into a full-blown attack and then it eases off. I don't know if this is all from the shrooms, because while in the hospital the first time I found out I had polycystic kidney disease and the second time, when I heard the voices, they thought I had cancer (I don't). I haven't heard voices like that since but the panic just won't go away. I'm never, ever touching shrooms again--just thinking about them, they're smell and taste, it makes me sick. And they've left me in this horrible state of mind I can't seem to get out of.",
      "**Sorry if words are mispelled or whatever, I don't feel like going back through this and correcting everything."

      "Yesterday my order of 1g Methylone finally arrived. Yippy!",
      "Not having a milligram scale, I eyed out what I thought was 150-250mg and dissolved it in Powerade. Taste was nearly unnoticeable, slightly bitter but in no way foul.",
      "T+30m: Nothing yet. Mild stimulation (placebo?), excessive yawning.",
      "T+45m: Still waiting. Check email, read message from my mother. I feel the urge to communicate with someone so I call her.",
      "T+50m: As I talk to my mother waves of euphoria work their way from my neck to my feet, causing my hair to stand on end. The high feels peculiarly similar to that of cocaine (better?) but I'm not complaining. Each wave lasts 30 seconds to 1 minute, followed by an equally long period of dysphoric anxiety. Cycle repeats itself over the next 15 minutes.",
      "T+1h5m: All euphoria now. The 'wave' effect has turned into a steady peak with no feelings of anxiety. Emotional barriers lessened (non-existent?). We discuss past issues, childhood problems, current drama, conversation is flowing quite well. We discuss and work through things that I've never had the nerve to talk about before.",
      "T+1h30m: Euphoria still present, still on the phone with Mother. Short-term memory starts to fail. Much effort is needed to talk intelligibly -- I repeatedly lose my train of thought while talking, leading to akward silences. I don't want Mother to suspect I'm on drugs.",
      "T+1h45m: Wrap up conversation with Mother. Break out the Methylone for a re-dose.",
      "T+1h50m: Approximately same dosage (150-250mg) added to a cup of Powerade. I chug the solution, leaving a little in the bottom as a booster for later on.",
      "T+2h15m: Euphoria present, but starting a steady decline. Stong stimulation overpowers the euphoria. Heart rate 100+ bpm.",
      "T+2h30m: Some euphoria, mostly stimulation. In an effort to regain the wonderful feeling I had while talking to Mother, I re-dose again.",
      "T+2h35m: Add approximately 100-150mg of Methylone to remaining Powerade and take it in one gulp. Taste is not an issue.",
      "T+2h45m: Very bad jitters. Legs shaking, arms shaking, yawning continuously. There is still a certain 'euphoria'. Enough of one that constantly has me debating whether or not I should re-dose.",
      "T+3h: Spend some time browsing the net and doing miscellaneous tasks. Very, very stimulated. Much like the effect of Adderall, without the edginess.",
      "T+3h30m: Re-dose yet again. Baggy of Methylone is starting to look depleted.",
      "T+4h: I discover re-dosing replenishes euphoria for a brief period of time, but it is rapidly replaced by overwhelming stimulation. Each re-dose potentiates the stimulatory effect while degrading the euphoria.",
      "T+5h: Compulsively begin researching and reading anything that has to do with Methylone. I find a report where a user injected 1g over the period of a day. What the hell, only 1/3 of a baggy left, why not?",
      "T+5h30m: Eat a hamburger and chips. Goes down surprisingly easily considering how stimulated I am. No nausea, no unpleasant side-effects from eating. Actually quite enjoyable. Sweets seem like they'd hit the spot.",
      "T+6h: Finish eating, re-dose again. Baggy of Methylone is almost gone. I estimate there are 2-3 doses left.",
      "T+6h30m: Overstimulated. Checking my pulse every few minutes. My heart feels like it weighs 20 pounds. I feel it beating in my forehead. Nagging euphoria still present. Totally different from euphoria achieved at first dose. Comparable to methamphetamine.",
      "T+7h: Heart rate slows down a little, so I decide to re-dose. Only one dose left. This sucks!",
      "T+7h30m: Time moving very fast. It's getting late. I scramble to find some downers. There are none to be found. I've committed now I must follow through. Looks like I won't be getting any sleep tonight!",
      "T+7h45m: Empty rest of baggy (~150mg) into glass of Powerade as I've been doing all day. It's become a ritual by now. Gosh, this morning seems like so far away. This drug has a slightly psychedelic edge to it. Definite closed-eyed visuals though I don't pay much attention to them.",
      "T+8h: Not much more stimulated than I was at T+6h30m. I get one comforting wave of euphoria from the last dose, and slip back into the anxious, crackhead-like headspace I've created for myself. Is 1000mg too much?",
      "T+9h: Spent the last hour researching Methylone. Perhaps I should have done this BEFORE dosing (hint). Only a few reports of dosages higher than 500mg.",
      "T+10h: I think I've learned everything I can about Methylone. My paranoia of overdosing is replaced by restlessness as I realize even at this high a dose Methylone is relatively safe.",
      "T+10h15m: Considering going to bed, but I know I won't be able to sleep. Bleh. Already starting to feel some kind of a comedown. Perhaps it is the realization I have no more Methylone that is causing me grief.",
      "T+10h30m: Write an e-mail to Mother telling her how much I appreciated the conversation we had. Several dormant issues were worked through, and I truely feel closer to her now.",
      "T+10h40m -: I'm in a tweakers mindset. I lie down to sleep. I spend the next 7 or 8 hours rolling around in bed trying to lull myself away. At some points it felt as though I was right on the verge of sleep, but I never quite made it there. Not a surprise at all considering the dose.",
      "The next morning I noticed some marked anti-depressant qualities. I was lethargic from lack of sleep, but as the day progressed I was back in a semi-normal headspace with an extra kick of confidence to boot. Marked cockiness and sociability, even while being awake for 24+ hours.",
      "I experienced no major side effects from this large dose except a slight case of HPPD. Toward the end of the day I had opaque swirling black dots in the center of my vision in each eye. I attribute this to sitting in front of the computer for 10 hours while tripping, pupils dilated the whole time. Or possibly a side effect of sleep depravation. It's already starting to go away. No biggy.",
      "Be careful with Methylone. It's very addictive and can get the best of you if you're not careful. I'm lucky I only had 1g my first time, or I may had overdosed. Also note I took 2 10mg Prozacs and a 300mg Wellbutrin XR prior to ingesting the Methylone.",
      "It's a good drug, and legal. Can't ask for much better! Stick with small doses. Larger doses are enjoyable but lead to diminished euphoria."

      "My evening started off after a long day. I have high tollerances to almost all pharms, so even high doses have little effect on me. Please note I am including the pharms I took earlier in the day to provide setting, this report is about the codeine and clonazepam. Below is the chronology in which I dosed the pharms:",
      "1500 (3:00) 20mg Hydrocodone / 650 APAP (2 Norco 10/325)",
      " - This didn't do much for me except a little mood lift and relieve my pain",
      "1630 (4:30) 200mg Codeine Phosphate. I took this as a pick me up and an adjunct to the Norco because I recently broke my ankle two days ago.",
      "Several hours pass",
      "2200 (10:00) 10mg Alprazolam (yes, 10mg Xanax). This is WAY more than medically recommended but I have a substantial tollerance. I was looking for a come down from the day to wind down. In addition to the Alprazolam, I took 4mg Clonazepam, 100mg Oxazepam, and 20mg Diazepam.",
      "I am a medical professional and have the means in my household to estabish an IV drip of D5LR with Flumazenil (Benzodiazepine antagonist) which works on a 'dead-man's-switch.' That means if I lose consciousness and stop clamping the drip, the flumazenil begins to self administer to reverse the benzos in rapid fashion. This is still very dangerous, but safer than no safeguard at all.",
      "After becoming relaxed, I did some work on my computer for several hours until about midnight. At this time, I got the idea to give a try at insufflating Codeine and Clonazepam. I split some of my meds, and crushed them with my mortar/pestle to a fine powder. Below is the result...",
      "I decided to make two lines of both powders (12.5 codeine and 0.5 clonazepam). The first line of each I insufflated on their own. This was the first time I had ever insufflated anything, and to my surprised it didn't burn nearly as bad as expected. With the remaining two lines (one of each med) I combined them, and drew them in as a single line. The experience that followed amazed me, even given the fact I daily take upwards of 600mg codeine, 50mg hydrocodone, and 8mg xanax (or 6mg clonazepam).",
      "About 10 minutes after insufflation, I noticed a high or buzz much like that I remember when I was being sedated before dental surgery. It was very pleasant, and I felt very relaxed. The benzo (clonazepam) created a very creative and almost 'giddy' type of reaction similar to most other benzodiazepines, except this time at a much lower dose and on a much more enjoyable level (especially considering my tollerance). The codeine gave me the classic opioid rush that I expected, but oddly even though it was a very rapid onset compared to oral dosing, it was much softer (ie I didn't get an agitated or anxious buzz like I sometimes do from high doses of opioids). I suspect this was due to the concomitant administration of the benzo (clonazepam) which took the negative (bad part) of the codeine edge off, which potentiating the rest of the rush. The codeine seemed to have a similar effect on the clonazepam as well, in that my uplifted mood and energeticness that I often get after opioids prevented the clonazepam from causing any drowsiness or adverse effects.",
      "Overall the experience lasted only about 45 minutes, and the doses involved were low, but I would definately say that regardless of route of exposure, benzos plus opioids are my dual drug of choice (and I am lucky enough to have an almost unlimited supply of both from my physicians due to health issues). I feel insufflation is probably the best way to get the quickest and strongest reaction as I have described above, but as an organic chemist, I am attempting to devise a way to make many of the opioids and benzos soluble in physiological pH solution for injection, which would allow mainlining to be the optimum means of administration."

      "Approximately 10 months ago, I was prescribed Effexor XR for a sudden anxiety problem that developed seemingly overnight. I was 21 at the time. ",
      "As the months went on, my doctors continued to increase my dose from  37.5 mg to 225 mg/day.",
      "My main reason for adding this report is to describe how coming off Effexor has affected my life.",
      "After about 5 months I started to experience severe jaw pain on the left side, which over the next few weeks moved to the right side as well.  I also had night terrors nearly every night for weeks, to the point where I was afraid to sleep.",
      "At this point, and after reading several similar reports online describing similar symptoms relating to Effexor, I decided to slowly wean myself off of it.  My stomach had been upset the entire time I was on Effexor (very very badly), but even more so when I was coming off it. My doctor had warned me that if I wasn't careful coming off of it, I could end up on IV's in the hospital, unable to eat etc. She was taking Effexor as well, so I trusted her.",
      "Eventually it took me a total of probably a month and a half to get to get down to 37.5 and from there I opened up the capsules and lessened the amount each day until I was completely off it. (this was suggested by my doctor as well)",
      "Now the fun part.",
      "Ever since I came off Effexor I've experienced 'brain shivers' 'zaps' whatever you want to call them, constantly (about 15 times a minute, literally).  The feeling is similar to an electric shock that originates in the brain and quickly spreads to the outer limbs, many times it comes in threes and fours.   It also seems to make a zapping noise, or the feeling of hitting my funny bone, but in my brain.  I also lost about 15 pounds.",
      "This has continued, unrelentingly, for more than a month now.",
      "I used consider myself a relatively well adjusted person.  I had great grades, and I attend a very reputable university.  But I have never felt so disconnected from life.  Nothing that used to amuse me does anymore and I have absolutely no desire to finish school.",
      "I cry at the drop of a hat, mostly when I'm by myself.  And it takes only the slightest inconvenience to completely set me off in anger.",
      "I know exactly why it's happening, but it feels like there is nothing I can do to overcome the feelings that Effexor has left me with. ",
      "I'd also like to note an experience that happened to me when I was taking Effexor.",
      "I had some visitors for the weekend, and we decided to go out to the bars and have night on the town.  Around 10 pm, despite having company, I felt so sick that I had to leave the bar and go back to my apartment.  I had about half of my first drink before I left.",
      "From about 11pm until about 7am I vomited uncontrollably, and I couldn't understand why, because I hadn't been drinking.",
      "At about 7:30, I clued into the fact that with all of the hustle and bustle of company arriving in the morning, I'd forgotten to take my Effexor.",
      "I took a gravol to try to alleviate the nausea but quickly threw it up.  ",
      "Eventually I was able to get my Effexor pills down, and lie in bed until everything subsided. This chemical is grossly misunderstood and understudied."

    "report": [
      "I have been  kavahead, pepperhead, kavaholic, whathaveyou for over 2 years now.  I was first introduced to kava kava in a friends dorm room my freshman year in college.  Been hooked ever since.  At least once a month I drink the goo and sail off to Kiribati or Vanuatu without giving a damn anymore.  I'm a philosophy major and a fiction writer hobbyist, my writing is vastly improved by the inclusion of kava kava.  I guess my continued use makes me something of an novice expert, so let me see what I can add to the discussion here.",
      "First, let me dispell the rumours.  No, I have never hallucinated on kava.  I've had some tinnitus (ringing in the ear) and have mistaken sounds and voices, but nothing more.  No, kava will not give me an orgasm just sitting there, it will, however, amplify the effects of a real orgasm (at least in me).  It does not turn me gay, either.  Its effect is somewhat like an aphrodisiac, but don't count on putting someone in the mood with it, they're just as likely to go to sleep.  I do not feel any effects by taking drugstore capsules.  Trust me, I've downed entire bottles of [ ] brand gelcaps and nothing's happened.  I did, however, get high after blenderizing [ ] brand gelcaps in water, but the taste made it not worth it at all.*",
      "And now the health warning: There might be a chance that maybe Kava could possibly cause liver damage.  I myself have never even felt a problem. ",
      "With that in mind, let's make some Kava.  I buy 1-3 ozs of fresh dried root from any health food store or apothecary.  It's also available online.  Now get a clothespin, pair of pantyhose, a covered micro-wave safe container, a pitcher, some filtered water and a 10oz cup.  Start early in the day.  Taking Vitamin C supplements will amplify the effects.  As will human saliva for some ungodly reason, so keep yourself well hydrated in preperation.  This is also important because Kava is a diuretic like alcohol and can make you dehydrated.  If the root is not already pulverized, you can grind it in a coffee grinder for about 5-10 minutes to get it down to managable size.  You'll want the grains of powder to be about the size of Turkish coffee, if not less.  There will always be coarse bits left over, we'll remove them later. ",
      "Now put the kava mush into the microwavable safe container with enough water to completely suspend all of the particles.  mix it up with your hands (oh yeah -- wash them) to get all the caked bits to suspend.  Ttick it in the microwave untill the water boils.  Take it out and 'YICKTH! NEARCHUS, YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT I DRINK THIS, DO YOU?!'* Shut up, put the clothespin on your nose and stir the concoction with a spoon.  Let it cool.  Boil again.  Take it out, put the clothespin back on and stir.  Do this one more time, then just let it cool.  If it's solidifying into goop, add more water.  If you can't, that's okay too.  when it's cool enough to stick your fingers in, get out the (unused) pantyhose, cut off about a foot at the bottom, and stretch the open end over the mouth of the pitcher, allowing the toe to hang down into the pitcher.  Pour that vile gunk in there.  If it's moving slow, you skimped on the water, just get a spoon and scrape.  Tie up the open end of the pantyhose and add about 30-40ozs of water for every onz of kava, less if you can stand it (cackles maniacally). ",
      "Now, portion it out in 10oz cups, any more is a little too much for a drink.  Get your buddies in the room, give everyone a glass.  Clap once if you wanna follow the Polynesian ritual (why not)  And bang that mother down. This is not to be sipped. Drink it in one gulp if possible, shiver violently and immediately chase it with water (anything else will taste bad). Quit yer winin' and pour another glass.  When the root's all done, sit down in your favorite chair, curl up with your favorite lover, or assume your own favorite dreamin' position, it's departure time.  Ignore the urge to fall asleep.  You are now high on Kava, this may last for about 45mins-3hrs, depending on how much you drank.  You can plan on being slightly disoriented for the rest of the night, so DO NOT DRIVE!!!  Treat this stuff like you would alcohol. ",
      "I find this stuff tastes, smells, and feels like shit.  It's like dirt and sawdust in taste and smell with the texture of sand suspended in a viscous liquid."

When I returned about 2 hours later the water had turned bright green and had a familiar scent (i dont know what?).",
      "I then set about drinking the infusion which had a taste of pea pods (as in Pisum sativus).  I had drank half of it so I went to sit in another persons room, I thought that was a waste of time, but when I looked in the mirror my pupils had covered the coloured part of my eyes.  After seeing this I set off to the toilet as I had drank a large amount of water due to feeling dehydrated and having a very dry throat.  When I started down the hall to the toilet I could feel my self being pulled to one side and then the other so I staggered on.",
      "Having noticed that this had not been a total waste of time I finished the bottle.  All this did was increase the feelings I was already having apart from when I looked at my hands they where moving like waves and so was the floor but only when I looked at them, this continued all night until I finally fell asleep at about 4.30 am with some difficulty. The next day my eyes were still unfocused and my head felt strange. It was a very strange experiance but definitely one to be tried. But be carful with the dosage."

      "To start with, it should be mentioned that I find 4-ho-dipt to be far more similar to lsd than to psilocybin. The body feel and visual effects are similar. I found that there was a point at which the dose-effects curve changed and intensity was not effected, just duration. The mark is at about 40mg, higher than that and it just lasts longer. It seems, (at least for me) that the true promise of this substance is bringing out the magic in other substances. I had far more pleasurable effects from combinations than from iprocin alone.",
      "Dose/effects",
      "5mg- This is the level at which effects begin to manifest. I am not able to define the true character of the substance, but stimulation is felt, and laughter is more common than normal. About 3 hours to baseline",
      "8-10mg- Now I am getting into the trip a bit. Mild visuals (mainly trails) are present",
      "and pupils are about 40% dilated. The same physical effects are present, but overshadowed by the mental effects. 3-4 hours of primary effects.",
      "15mg- At this level, the full character of the material is present. Trails, and patterning with eyes open are present. Cevs are still minimal. Pupils about 75% dilated. 4-5 hours of effects",
      "20mg- The Oevs are starting to really manifest. Objects twist and morph in peripheral vision, and Cevs are mostly just dull pastel blue and green geometries. Nothing to detailed yet. Approx. 6 hour duration",
      "30mg- I am in for one hell of a ride at this point. The visual aspect becomes marked, and cevs continue to become more detailed. Oevs are similar to 500-650mcg of lsd.",
      "I will be able to actually have some control over the cev development by just thinking about something I want to see. The physical effects begin to become less pleasant at this dose. There is significant peripheral stimulation.",
      "40mg+ There is no real point in going any father than this with iprocin. It does not alter the trip, just lengthens the duration. The CNS stimulation begins to get very worrisome, and an ominous, dull headache centered near the sinus cavity and frontal lobe is present.  If I dose higher than this, I am just asking for trouble.",
      "The trip itself",
      "Iprocin has a very pleasurable, rolly body buzz. Tactile sensitivity is significantly enhanced, but this gets distracting and unpleasant at higher doses. Mentally, I found myself far more open to emotional content in things around me. TV is very unsatisfactory. I find good music to be essential for a good trip. Bad Religion and Swinging Utters are usually my 1st choices. I find myself quite horny at lower doses. Iprocin is very capable of providing good insight, but this is dose and set/setting dependant. I have to be able to sit back and focus on the trip to make the most of it. Outdoors night trips are superb. Great material for camping.",
      "Combinations",
      "15mg 4-ho-dipt + 5 mg 5-meo-dmt,",
      "The iprocin is not overwhelmed by this dose of 5-meo-dmt. The two mix into some magical, perfect lsd like buzz. After the initial 5-meo-dmt flash, the visuals remain more prominent than before it. This is one of iprocins special synergies.",
      "30mg  2c-c + 10mg 4-ho-dipt,",
      "I found 2c-c and iprocin to go together like yin/yang. The 2c-c provides a nice, calm, mellow trippy buzz, while iprocin provides the visuals and speedy edge. The visuals are marked, but less prominent than with iprocin and 2c-e  or 2c-i. Mentally, it is very euphoric, thought tangents are hard to avoid.  Watching tv is a waste as I don't understand what I'm trying to watch. Going for a hike in the local canyon is the most rewarding thing I can do on this combo.",
      "20mg 4-ho-dipt and 1.5g psilocybin mushrooms,",
      "This combo was taken in preparation for a 4th of july hike into the hills to go watch the fireworks. The substances were ingested in a chocolate concoction prior to leaving the apartment. It was about a 15 minute drive to where we hike in from, and already I was noticing effects. I felt very light on my feet, happy to be outside and far away from sober people. By the time the sun was setting, I was laying on a tarp in the grass, watching the stars shift around in an oval orbit around me. I decided to light some of my own fireworks (bad idea since I live in Colorado and there is a fireworks ban) and was having fun doing it. Roman candles do some interesting things to my vision. Next thing I know, I have a park ranger in a boat pointing his light at me and telling me not to move. Luckily, someone across the lake light off a mortar and the ranger took off, only to find me gone upon returning. That will kill your buzz quick.",
      "400mg dxm and 15mg 4-ho-dipt",
      "I am very fond of using dxm as a preload for psychedelic voyages. The problem with this combo is the significant side effects. Hyperthermia was marked. Temp peaked at 102.9 degrees. There was a vague hot feeling in the back of my skull, I recognized the feeling from a previous encounter with seritonon syndrome. That is not a good sign. The visual and mental aspects were totally overshadowed by the alarming physical effects.",
      "20mg 4-ho-dipt and 2mg alprazolam",
      "I took the cap and a Xanax xr before going fishing on an isolated local lake. The iprocin kept me awake and alert, while the xanax kept me calm and happy. The only bad part was when the Department of Wildlife ranger came to check if I had a valid fishing liscence, as the lake is popular with people lacking them due to its distance from any roads. There were no problems conversing with him and telling him what he needed to know (he was also doing a creel survey to see how many of what species of fish are being taken from the lake). The whole conversation lasted about 15 anxious minutes.",
      "Conclusion",
      "I have many fun memories of iprocin. The only truly bad one I have is from taking 10 mg for a Snoop Dog show, and having my ride arrested for smoking a joint in the venue, leaving me stranded 25 miles from home with no ride. I ended up running into a neighbor and got a lift home from him, but that is a whole other story. If you are interested in something that is very adaptable and having a short duration, it may be worth investigating."

      "On the day in question, tripping was the farthest thing from my mind. I had spent afternoon walleye fishing at a local lake, drank a few beers and smoked a joint while I was out. As the sun was beginning to set, my friend B showed up and wanted to know if I was down to trip. I was in a good mood, so I said sure and we proceeded to leave the lake and decide on the sacrament for the evening. We settled on 4-aco-dipt. I was then informed we did not have a good place to utilize that night, we thought we would have to postpone the activities for another day. That is not how it worked out though. Soon B's friend R called him up and wanted us to go party at his apartment that night. We had somewhere to go.",
      "Me and B drove over to R's apartment only to find several other people there already drinking and smoking some bowls. 3 of the 5 people that were there had to leave, so it was down to me, B, R, and R's friends X and Z.",
      "X and Z had only limited experience with psychedelics, so me and B got the job of explaining what the weird grey powder in the vial was. We told them it was an analog of psilocybin and explained how the effects differed. We chose to start X and Z on 10mg each to see how they felt about the chem without committing to a high dose. B and I, however, are very experienced with the chem in question, so we settled at 35mg each to start with and gave R 25mg as he has a lot of trip time under his belt, but not yet with ipracetyl.",
      "We proceeded to smoke a few bowls while waiting for the effects to manifest. After about 30 mins, me B and R began to have effects becoming apparent. X and Z were still not feeling anything, but they were on a low dose, so this was no big surprise.  X and Z began to drink beer at a very rapid rate, which we had already advised against, and z soon became slightly ill. When Z went to vomit, I became slightly concerned, but he came out of the bathroom feeling better and laughing hysterically. X soon began to get altered also. Once we all had effects present, we decided to smoke some more pot and see where it would take us.",
      "After the bowls, we did the dumbest thing imaginable. We went to the liquor store to go get more beer, and at the spur of the moment, we decided it would be fun to do some off roading in X's 1980 Buick. We decide to go to a local canyon and see what we could find to drive on, over or through. R began to get ill in the car and we had to stop so he could puke (he had taken down about 8 beers at this point) so we returned to his apartment.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "We got back, smoked another bowl, and we were all feeling well again. I decided to take a booster dose to extend my trip, so I took another 20mg of  4-aco-dipt. B decided to follow suit and do the same (B and I were feeling great, no nausea at all). X and Z still had a good buzz going, and decided not to supplement their doses. R opted for another 10mg. While waiting for the booster doses to take effect, I wanted to smoke some low potency (5x) salvia extract. I took the 1st hit, and it instantly increased the intensity of the trip 10x from what it was. I had massive cev's of futuristic landscapes and physically felt very 'compressed' for lack of a better term. As I slowly came out of the salvia experience, R wanted to take a hit of it. We agreed to let him, though only a small amount since he had only smoked it once before this.",
      "I loaded about 100mg of the extract and let him hit it. Immediately he began repeating 'oh, my god, holy shit' as soon as the hit was exhaled. R soon began to lose all contact with reality. He was talking about fucking trees, and the worms that inhabit and control us, and all kinds of weird shit. Luckily, he began to regain coherency rapidly.",
      "By this point, it was like 2am (about T+ 6 hours since the 1st dose) X and Z decided they were going to retire for the night and get some sleep. It was then that I made my mistake. I decided to insufflate a 5mg and take 25 more orally. 4-aco-dipt does not burn, but the drip is VILE.  I was feeling the small-insufflated dose within about 10 mins. I was then beginning to get VERY high, and the 25mg oral had yet to even kick in. It was at this point I knew it was going to get rough. R offered me some valerian and hops tea to try to take the edge off a bit. The tea tasted Terrible (I presume due to the valerian content), but I chugged it any way, as the Physical stimulation was getting uncomfortable. I was still getting higher and beginning to worry a bit. I know that worrying will only make it worse, but I took way too much of an unknown substance, so a bit of concern was to be expected. About 30 minutes after taking the last dose, I began to feel remarkably ill.",
      "I ran to the bathroom, and proceeded to violently vomit for a few minutes (the vomit tasted like bile and feet). After puking, I tried to drink some water and took an electrolyte pill to get re-hydrated. I was beginning to get ill again within a few minutes. B got out the bowl, and we smoked in hopes of settling my stomach. It failed. I was beginning to get surges (like small amounts of electric shock in my stomach) which were quite ominous.",
      "I was now beginning to get very nervous. The surges were increasing in both intensity and frequency, coinciding with my heartbeat. My pulse was 139 bpm and very hard.",
      "I was getting a headache now, and beginning to have minor leg tremors. Shit was really going downhill at this point.",
      "I was again violently nauseas, and had R bring me a bucket, as I was not particularly mobile at this point. I just dry heaved, there was very little to vomit at this point in the night. The surges were turning into more of a stabbing pain synchronous with my pulse and very frightening, and to make things worse, I was still getting alarming leg tremors also. I was beginning to show minor seizures next. My eyes were trying very hard to roll back in my head.  I was getting worse and worse tremors and pains. I am not a religious person, but for the 1st time in years, I felt the need to pray for my survival. B and R were getting noticeably concerned at the symptoms I had. I was really beginning to question the likelihood of me surviving the night. I then had what has been described as a full blown Grand Mal seizure. I lost all connection to the world.",
      "Next thing I know, I am in darkness. Nothing. Pergatory of sorts. I thought I was dead, but soon a faceless voice was telling me to fight, I could beat this. I could survive. I began to come back to reality as I am being hit with ice water to pull me from the seizure.",
      "B and R are quite happy to see me regaining consciencousness. B had his phone on and",
      "was about to dial 911. I soon had them telling me drink this water, dont stand up, stay where you are, etc as they were still concerned about me having more seizures.",
      "The tremors were still present, but the chest pain had subsided. R soon dug around and found me a cyclobenzaprine(20mg) in an attempt to stop the seizures. As we waited to see if the muscle relaxer would take effect, we smoked another bowl. I was beginning to feel a lot better by the time the pill kicked in (which was very fast due to empty stomach).",
      "B and R were very interested in trying to decipher the OBE I had experienced.  We came to the conclusion that I was hearing them and due to the disassociated state, I was unable to tell it was them. I was so happy that the nightmare was ending. I did not touch a psychedelic for 3 or 4 months after that night.",
      "I am thankful to have survived the night. After doing the math the next day, I realized I had taken 85mg of 4-aco-dipt the previous night. The dose I took was WAY too high for this substance. I have several 50mg in a cap experiences with ipracetyl, but none have shown the toxicity this one did. Before that night, I had felt no toxicity from either 4-aco-dipt or 4-ho-dipt.",
      "I flushed my remaining 4-aco-dipt, and got back to my normal life. I was weak for 3 days or so afterword, but just happy to be alive. I feel very lucky, due to the fact that I did every thing I could have wrong, but still came out of it ok. It is amazing how much a near death experience can change your outlook on life. The following week, I started preparations to start my tackle buissness. I wanted to do work I didnt loathe. Life is too short to sit at a job you cant stand every day all day. This showed me what I really wanted to be doing and I took the message to heart."

      "I have been addicted to opiate painkillers for the past year.  It is controlling my life.  I was on the Suboxone program.  For those who are unfamiliar with this program, it's supposed to be a maintenance medication to taper through opiate withdrawals.  It completely takes away withdrawals, but it's a part opiate itself, so I became addicted to that. Enough was enough, I was ready to quit for good.  Today is my 5th day clean.",
      "Yesterday, I was feeling suicidal from the excruciating anxiety that comes from opiate withdrawal.  I then talked to my aunt, who had been addicted to alcohol and morphine and quite them at the same time, she has now been clean 3 years.  But I talked to her for a while and she gave me some Neurontin, she though it would help.  Well she was right, it completely calmed my nerves and took away nearly all of the anxiety.",
      "It's working well so far, and considering it last so long it works so well.  I was able to actually get 5 solid hours of sleep, and I could've slept more but I had to wake up.  Anyone who has experience opiate withdrawals knows that sleep is hard to come by, and we take it for granted when we don't have an addiction to take care of."

      "Preparation: I grabbed 3 of the yopo seeds I had and put them in the oven, they popped after maybe 5 minutes. I discarded the shell and ground up the seeds with a spoon, and mixed in some baking soda as a basifier at roughly a 2 part yopo to 1 part baking soda ratio. It would only ground so far so I put the snuff to be in the oven for 7 minutes or so to take away some of the dampness that the seeds caused. Anyway, ground it up a bit more and sift-blended it to a nice tan coloured snuff.",
      "Set and Setting: At night, everyone sleeping, on the couch in the living room, relaxed, bored, watching TV in the dark.",
      "T+0 I grab a dollar bill and insulfate a line containing half the powder (1.5 seeds) off of the coffee table in front of me. Stings like a bastard, but about half so much as kanna. Horrid tasting post nasal drip as others have rightly reported. Immediately I feel a bit more sensitive to the TV light, in the way you are at the very start of an acid trip.",
      "T+0:05 Pressure building in head, starting to feel some coming up affects like something might happen. Colours shift a bit on the television, a alight out of body where I was conscious of everything in my periphery. ",
      "T+0:15 I think another report stated that a feeling of grief came over them, the kind you feel when a loved one dies. I had this, a sort of pressure in the chest/heart area and a separate feeling of nausea. Basically I'm in unexplainable pain. A horrid state that lasted about 20 minutes that makes it quite obvious to me that I will never use DMT again, especially in high doses. The nausea I can get over, not that awful uncomfortable feeling. There is also a heavy gravity not unlike salvia.",
      "T+0:20 Starting about 5 minutes into the experience the visual and dissociative affect had been increasing. This was about the peek, very much like the pictures people draw of DMT, the body, the linear filling movements, and things would look typical 70's-ish, with the crazy colours and weird patterns also some interesting CEVS. I can see that if I took more I'd be flying through colours and my head and thoughts and shapes. Over all, not very impressive, kind of interesting, but considering the physical pain of it, it's a no brainer that this is my last time trying this.",
      "T+0:25 Starting to wind down pretty good and 20 minutes later I'm close to baseline.",
      "Summary: My conception of time was largely warped, some interesting CEVs and visuals of the 60s or 70s, the kind that are typically depicted. I prefer the mescaline or acid visuals a lot more though, they are much smoother on you.",
      "I was largely in control of my motor skills the entire time, I'd change channels on TV and think fairly logically. It's a completely different breed of psychedelic. It's nothing fun, nothing spiritual, maybe something that teaches you about yourself. Physically degrading though, uncomfortable, a feeling of being poisoned and physically drained.",
      "I'm not someone who gets overly emotional about trips, nor someone who passes them off and learns nothing. I try to be a realist about it. In my experience salvia and mescaline especially have held extremely strong spiritual connections for me. Acid and Cannabis are more recreational, but I'll learn about myself. DMT however, is a flashy jolting uncomfortable poisoning, even at such a low dose I see this.",
      "The few positives are: I feel a bit warm and nice, although slightly nauseous now that it's about 45 minutes over. A calm is over me, and throughout the 'trip' I had a sort of stillness. This is highly uncommon for me as I'm medicated for tremors and I'm a pretty shifty fellow. A connection to fellow humans that I don't usually have, it's very slight, but nice.",
      "All in all, screw this, please be smart and DOSE LOW your first time to get a taste for DMT. I cannot image the horror of physically emptiness I would've felt on a dose of 5,6, or 7 seeds.  If I want to feel empty and weak, I'll watch a loved one die, screw that sick feeling with nausea and dissociation added on just for some profound experience that doesn't exist. Spiritual drugs leave you with awe and epiphanies, not a fuzzy head from cheap visual affects. It's bearable though, and you may have to experience it for yourself. Don't be scared off from it if it's something you have to do. Not my cup of tea for sure.",

      "Our story begins around midnight, on a cool spring evening in Florida. There I sit at my computer, reading trip stories and the DXM FAQ as I drink from a 4oz bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough. The blacklight in the corner is reflecting on the screen as Enigma, 'The Screen Behind The Mirror' plays softly in the background. This is to be my first trip on DXM. Prior to this night, my only exposure to the DXM experience was a story by Jim Hogshire entitled, 'The Electric Cough Syrup Acid Test,' a throughly entertaining and hilarious account of a first-time on DXM. (Before I go further, I would like to note that I was in the beginning stages of a head cold on this night). That story, as well as the experiences of others, were enough to spark curiousity about DXM and I decided I wanted to try it for myself.",
      "Twenty or thirty minutes pass, I am finished with the entire bottle, and my roommate announces she is going to return her movies to the video store. She was originally going to take this DXM journey with me, but stomach cramps changed her mind. While she was gone, I experienced a little nausea, but not enough to worry me; I knew that I would not get sick. I somehow knew that before I took the first swallow. Nonetheless, I decided to smoke a little weed to calm my stomach discomfort, and since I wasn't really feeling anything other than a little numbness in my mouth, I figured it might jump start the effects of the DXM.",
      "After I finished smoking the bowl, I felt an urgency to brush my teeth so I ran to the bathroom, grabbed my toothbrush and started scrubbing away and by the time I was done, I was leaning my head in the sink splashing cold water on my face because my skin felt warm and a little dry. At that point, my roommate returned and I bounded down the hallway, smiling and giggling, to meet her, telling her that I was really happy she came back (I had the feeling I might want her there; An excellent prediction on my part).",
      "I don't recall at what moment I started tripping...all I know is, somehow, I had anbesol all over the parts of my mind that control my body. I was completely detached from myself, yet fully aware that I was one being. I attempted to write down what I was feeling in the journal I had thoughtfully laid out on my bed. Phrases like 'floating heat' and 'swollen numbness' found their way onto the paper, but without my consciously putting them there. I picked up the notebook, which had the texture and weight of a marshmallow, and I tried to look at what I was writing but my head did not want to face in the direction of the notebook. My arm seemed to be bent in some crazy, wavy, inhuman fashion. In fact, I discovered, any action directly involving my body was next to impossible unless I did it without thinking. I noticed a dull numbness in my mouth and tongue, but found I could speak quite normally and fluently, though perhaps a little loudly. The words sometimes came out incoherent to me and they had the tendency to bounce around in my head for a while after they had been spoken, much like an echo.",
      "I found walking, and moving in general, to be the most fascinating activity of the evening. I must have walked from my bedroom to the living room, out to the porch and back about 73 times. But walking is not exacly the verb that describes what my body was doing. Soaring or floating might better describe it, but even that fails to capture the feeling of separation I had with my body. It was more like I would move from one place or one position to another but the actual moving part seemed not to even occur. I was just there-here, here-there, standing-sitting. Much like a Bobo doll, I felt that if someone would have tried to knock me over I would have simply sprung back to a standing position with no effort at all.",
      "For much of the time I felt like I was stuck in a funhouse. Either I wouldn't feel the floor under my feet at all, or the floor seemed to be at a different height with each step. I thought I was staggering but my friend assured me I looked normal, aside from the fact that my eyes were closed all the time. Were they? I could still see my surroundings just fine. Well, fine enough to know that they appeared extremely messed up. She also said, if anything, I looked like I was 'testing out my new legs.' As I said before, I was glad my friend was there and that she was sober because I was talking non-stop. I felt the need to verbalize immediately all my new sensations and realizations. She seemed to be okay with this. She was really great. She sat with me, not just listening to me talk, but actually participating in conversations with me, even if I was not always coherent.",
      "I was excited as hell to experience music but I was sort of disappointed to find that it seemed very one-dimentional and thin...no substance at all.  But I was still getting into it. I had taken off Enigma early on and replaced it with some trance music set to repeat itself.",
      "I came to many understandings during my DXM experience. I found that there is no one 'normal' state of consciousness, but many, many different states of being. Just as there are many different layers, or planes, of reality. I was involved in more than one layer of reality at any given moment throughout the night. I also found myself with no inhibitions, wanting to say every thought that passed into my head. I can only compare this to being on ecstacy when I say things because I feel like, without even thinking about it, everything is good and 'acceptable,' only with DXM, it seems it's not a lack of inhibitions, it's a lack of identity. I changed clothes about four times. I found I was very indecisive and contradicted myself a lot. I kept feeling light and heavy, or spinning but stable. I'd want to be outside, then I'd want to be inside. But I was never uncomfortable, I just kept changing my mind. I also had no conception of opposites. I had to ask if I was talking loudly or if the music was loud because everything just seemed equal.",
      "DXM is like no other drug experience I have ever had, and I have experimented quite a bit with different types of drugs. It was on of the best trips of my life and I am going to experiment more with it."

      "Introduction",
      "I guess I will start at the beginning. I had been studying the 2c-series pretty extensively. 2c-e was the chemical that stood out from the rest of the pack. After reading every bit of info on it I could find in about a 6-month period, I decided it was time to do some bioassays, and the order was placed. From the 1st dose I took, it was apparent that 2c-e and I got along very well. In all my trials with it (at least orally), I never experienced any significant idiosyncratic effects. I was able to work up to about 50mg comfortably. The amount of information and personal content contained with this phenethylamine is astonishing.",
      "Dose/response",
      "4-5 mg is enough for me to feel threshold effects from 2c-e. I used this dose commonly to add a little magic to my trail rides. There will be minor trailing, but that is about it as far as visual effects go. A slight tingly body buzz is present. There is a notable smart drug quality to this level. Effects taper off at about T+4 hours from the 1st alert at this dose.",
      "8-10mg is where the character of 2c-e really begins to show itself. Significant trails and intensification of color are apparent. There will be minor cev patterning, but nothing spectacular or special. Marked enhancement of mood noted. 5-6 hour duration.",
      "15mg seems to be the sweet spot for easy on the body and mind, yet intense experiences.",
      "I have significant oev patterning and trails, but no real distortions, just translucent coloring over layed on the world. Cevs begin to form basic color patterns, sort of free floating patches of mostly light greens and oranges, with a bit of blue for the background. I am in for at least 7-8 hours at this dose.",
      "25mg is where one might begin to enter a total state of psychedelic bliss or terror, depending on how one reacts to 2c-e. I always got the bliss effect, though I had several trip partners who did not get so lucky. 8+-hour duration.",
      "30mg is as high as I would EVER recommend anyone trying. The world is stuck in limbo between the real world and the fantasy world. OOBEs are a common occurrence at this dose. The muscle tension gets a bit irritating at this level, but stretching is almost orgasmic. I have little to no control at this level, and ego-death is always a possibility. I am in for a full 10 hours at 30mg.",
      "40mg is fucking nuts. I did this dose 2 years in a row for the Warped Tour, and I wouldn't recomment it. Talk about total sensory overload. Thousands of drunk and rowdy strangers, mosh pits and pist off music. It doesnt get any better than that. I got in the pit for rancid the 1st year I did this and it was incredible. I lost all contact with my group, and ended up getting sprayed with a fire hose by the fire department as it was like 115 degrees on the ground and people were getting heat stroke. Luckily for me, I stayed hydrated and wore light, airy biking gear. While the 2 people I was with were being cheered on by a large crowd puking up blue Gatorade and hash browns. The following year I went to see the Transplants and was totally blown away. They are totally different live, they dont have the rap style so much as good old street punk. The crash the next day from this dose is similar to ridicules doses of mdma, so I will only do it 1x per year, and only for the warped tour (or maybe a Bad Religion show). The effects can go on well past the 12-hour mark at this dose.  When I dose any higher than this, or even this high, I am really taking my life into my own hands. The excess stimulation is nowhere as annoying as with 2c-I, but still a bitch. Moshing will rip that excess energy right out of me though.",
      "The character of the trip is highly variable as the dose increases. At lower doses it is very fun and friendly, but as I pass about 15mg, the character turns less euphoric and more neutral. This is not to say it is bad, just not particularly fun, though this is very dependant on set and setting. This is not a particularly recreational psychedelic after about 15mg.",
      "The insight I receive is based on how well I can clear my mind. If I am cluttered up mentally from what is going on around me, I will probably not get a ton from it. The insight is not forced as it is with many other psychedelics, I have to seek it out. Nausea can be present, but is also highly dependant on the dose. Never anything too bad for me. but some others got significant nausea. I find cannabis to be an absolute must for getting the most from 2c-e. It allows the trip to really take over without the ego trying to block it. Alcohol is also good on the tail end of the trip to ease both body and mind. I tend to still be pondering what I was told much of the day after a 2c-e trip.",
      "Combinations",
      "10mg 2c-e and chewed calamus throughout brings about a very clean, centered, sharp mental state. I actually like to chew it prior to and during most of my experiments. This combo is not about visuals or insight, but I find it hard to beat for my favorite outdoor activities (mountain biking, fly fishing, etc) without getting in the way of me accomplishing them. It is the perfect reality enhancer for me. There is mild psychedelia present, though it is light and transparent. A joint or bowl on this dose will make the trip much more visual, but still very comfortable.",
      "10mg 2c-e and 5 wood rose seeds brings on an intense NEED to get out of the house. It has more of a pull to be with nature than even psilocybin. I am unable to remain sedentary on this combo also. The need to move around is profound. Walking is awesome. I am lucky to live in Colorado, so I have an excess of outdoor places to trip.",
      "8mg of 2c-e and 30mg of 2c-c was surprisingly easy on the mind and body. It was if all the 2c-e did was add a visual aspect to the relaxed and friendly 2c-c buzz. I had the visual effects equivalent of approx. 350mcg of lsd, but no major body or mental effects. It was like eye candy with almost no other effects present.",
      "20mg of 2c-e and 5mg of smoked 5-meo-dmt is a very emotional and powerful experience. In this instance, the level of pressure on the body is the only real negative, other than the abject intensity of the 5-meo-dmt, but I enjoy that.  This combo was the catalyst for a major change in my life, but I wont get into the details here.",
      "30mg of 2c-e and 10mg of methadone was one of the best opiate experiences I have ever had. I tend to react pretty poorly to opiates, but there is a special synergy with 2c-e. There was significant nausea as the methadone took effect, but after some dry heaves, it remained gone for the night, though I was pretty hung over the next day. Eyes closed visual manifestations were very detailed utterly alien landscapes. It was nodding with MAJOR cevs. I felt the need to just lie back and see where it would take me.",
      "2c-e and salvia can be a very disturbing experience. Read my report Restitution for more info.",
      "15mg of 2c-e and repeated smoked methamphetamines was attempted on one occasion, long before I came to loathe meth so much. It was not a really bad or good time. I was tired from the comedown of the 2c-e, but still wired from the meth. Not recommended.",
      "25mg of 2c-e and too many (11) Jaeger-bombs will create a very flowing visual effect. Like watching water that is slowly flowing translucently laved over the entire visual field. There was no nausea noted, which really surprised me. I will get ill on 2c-e if I drink any alcohol other than Jaeger bombs or Sunshine Wheat Ale, which is marketed, by New Belgium breweries (located in my hometown, so it is everywhere.)",
      "With any dose of 2c-e I found it to be amazing when combined with N2O. It at least doubles the length of the effects, and causes a 5x increase in visual effects. Problem is, when the N2O begins to ware off, I am already cracking another one before I even realize it. I go on nitrous autopilot, so to speak. I have had nights where I have gone through literally 100 whippets in a night, I feel about 50% less intelligent the next day, but that only lasts a day.",
      "There is also an amazing synergy with 2c-e and any psilocin analogs I have tried.",
      "The effects are very similar combining it with 4-ho-dmt, 4-ho-dipt, or 4-ho-mipt.",
      "There is an insane level of visual distortion. It has literally been hard to find my way around my own apartment due to the levels of visual activity. I will post more info if and when I get to combine it with 4-ho-met or 4-ho-mpt.",
      "Dxm can also be an excellent adjunct for getting the most from a 2c-e experience.",
      "With low doses of each (8mg of 2c-e and 250mg of dxm, for example) brings on a very light, fun, party type of trip, but the character changes significantly as the dose increases. I use 8-12 mg of 2c-e for every 240 mg of dxm. With this dosing strategy, the effects of neither drug will override the other, and the most useful and pleasurable effects can be had. I have used this strategy up to 620mg of dxm and 30mg of 2c-e. I do not recommend taking the doses this high though.",
      "10mg of 2c-e and 15mg of 4-aco-dipt was the only attempt I got to make with ipracetyl and 2c-e, and I have to say it was a disappointment. There was none of the MAJOR visual distortion I had gotten from 4-ho-dipt and 2c-e. They really are 2 different drugs, despite all the similarities in 1st hand reports. I am not saying it was a bad combo, the body buzz was very nice, similar to mdma, but I just did not get what I was looking for from it.",
      "15mg of 2c-e and 175mg Phenobarbital was very lazy and not at all worth the combo. I was too lazy to really enjoy it. I fell asleep after about 2 hours from dosing the chems (cap was swallowed and the Phenobarbital was immediately administered). I won't waste my time with this combo. Same goes for benzodiazepines. I dont see any real use for downers with phens, I mainly use them with too high doses of tryptamines.",
      "If I am using diphenhydramine (benadryl, Tylenol pm, etc) to sleep after the trip subsides for the most part, 150-175mg will be able to let me sleep, but I give it an hour or so before trying to retire. I DON'T dose any higher than this. It will result in full-retrograde amnesia. With no tolerance, as few as 2-3 may be effective for sedation.  Ambien is also effective, but for 2c-e, klonapin is the best sedative for me.",
      "I have had to use ephedrine during a 2c-e trip due to issues with my asthma (I use a tea of Ma Huang or Bala root since it works faster than a pill), but it did not really effect the trip, though the level of physical stimulation did increase, but go figure. Pulse and bp did not reach any alarming levels. Sleep was attained at about 9 hours after the ma huang tea, about T+ 12hrs from the dose of 2c-e.",
      "Other modes of Administration",
      "Insufflation",
      "I realize I will probably get some do as I say, not as I do type of BS from some of you, but please learn from my mistakes. Why do something that you KNOW is stupid? First off, 2c-chems burn so bad only a masochist could enjoy it. The side effects increase far more than do the psychedelic effects. The pain that accompanies the trip is too detrimental to really get anything from it, a la yopo/cohoba snuffs. I was never able to get the same clean high from it that I did from oral dosing. It has also given me nosebleeds within 30 mins of snorting on 2 occasions. With 2c-t-7 having killed people in recent history (though I will give you that they were mainly poly drug deaths, but not all) why risk it with a chem that is so nicely active orally. It is not the same feel snorted either. It becomes too speedy and causes much more muscle tension with this m.o.a.",
      "IV: This ranks among the dumbest things I have ever done. If you have  a brain you will heed my warnings and not IV 2c-e. The pain at the injection site was unbearable. It was like what I imagine a heart attack to be. It was done on a large vein on my left bicep. The pain shooting throughout my arm and chest made me contemplate calling 911. My pulse was not beating an alarming or arrhythmic pace, so I took some klonapin and rode it out.",
      "Please be responsible (unlike me) in your trials with 2c-e. It is a very special substance. I far prefer it to even LSD. If you fuck up and die of an OD, Ethyl will be schedule 1 and rarely seen again, though it will be shortly anyway. We have a chance here, like was present in the 90s with 2c-b. The more the DEA comes across it and learns of it being represented as other drugs, the sooner all phenethylamines and tryptamines will become schedule 1. One should do their research, there is a wealth of information available, but one has to be willing to find it. If one does not have the time to learn about these chemicals and how they affect the body and mind, they have no right to be fucking with them.",
      "Addiction Potential",
      "When I came into possession of my 1st 500mg vial, I went through it in about 3 weeks. I was dosing all day, at home, at work, whatever else I was doing.  It is very malleable and fun in small doses. Nothing really bad came about from the binge, it was like every day was good, the whole time. Still, long term consistent dosing of an unknown chemical is probably not the best idea.",
      "The Title?",
      "I was out fishing with my crazy, straight edge friend G and he overheard me and my brother talking about how well Ethyl had treated us over the weekend. We were on a small amount that day too, so when he asked Who the hell is Ethyl, with a very odd, perplexed look on his face, it was about the funniest fucking thing I have ever heard.",
      "We told him she was a friends aunt in the next town over where we can stay if we are too drunk to drive home. He has not mentioned her again."

      "I would like everyone to keep in mind before reading this, that prior to experimenting with this 1/2 oz blunt between my buddy and I we were clean for roughly a month. Before we would smoke bud at least twice a day, and had been for the last 2-3 years. Despite the avid smokers we were, quitting for a month fully wasnt as hard as it seemed. We kept occupied with alchohol (which when intoxicated sometimes made it even worse not to smoke) and other minor substances. The first week of not smoking was the hardest, but when kept occupied we managed.",
      "The initial goal my buddy and I had agreed to accomplish was to see if lowering your tollerance by being clean for a month, then smoking an assload of pot would infact produce visuals and bring an intense mind altering state (which we read off a report by Terance Mckenna). So our journey began. We spent the month of not smoking by gathering up a great accumilation of different name brand buds. We were determined to find only the best to celebrate the month long 'fast'. Over the course of the 30 days we got 5 differnt strands making up the 1/2 oz: Northern lights haze, california orange, white widow, purple urple, and an unknown brand of sativa that arguably was the most visibly potent out of the bunch (white widow came in a close second). These were bomb and after gathering them the temptation not to pull of a little bud and light up would of been impossible without the support of my fellow friend who would be experiancing this with me in the end.",
      "By the end of the month, as much of a die hard stoner I may sound like, it took me multiple shots of vodka to put me to sleep out of the excitement I was going to endure. We set the date to light up on a Saturday afternoon/evening so we could have a day to prepare and make sure all the settings were perfect.",
      "Saturday Morning: 7:35AM: My friend and I wake up early to start out the most waited rolling of the joint. My friend pulled out his large blunt wraps, unflavored. He pasted 5 of them together with his saliva and promptly laid them out on the desk. Now for the good stuff. I pulled out an old shoe box from my closet containing pure enjoyment. 5 plump ziploc bags were emptied onto the table, colors ranging from deep sparkly green, to a light purple, and an almost fluorecent reddish brown. All were surpisingly still in their full bud form with a little shake at the bottoms of the bag.",
      "When all were opened and placed in the center of the desk mulitple pictures were taken and the aroma filling the air perfectly described the bud: astonishingly dank! My friend pulled out an unused coffee bean grinder and away we went. We put about half the bud in the grinder and gave it a quick three tap blend (coffee grinders are very powerful and any excess grinding pass three presses bruises the THC). We emptied the ground bud onto the wraps and procedeed with the other half. After all the bud was nicely ground up a rather large amount of THC crystals had developed on the outer edges of the blender.  Taking a piece of paper and filing it all into one mound did the job, and then we lined the whole mound of THC in the middle of the blunt, followed by the weed.",
      "My friend is a absolute pro roller and it took him but 5 minutes to roll this, followed with a cardboard clutch in the end. Our masterpiece was complete. It was buitiful, large at the end, followed by an even larger mound in the middle, slightly narrowing down to the clutch. At my friends camp house in the woods he has a movie theatre room that is blocked off completly of any windows, so no form of light can enter. A perfect room to enjoy the blunt and let the sheer blackness of the room create its visuals (if the awaited effect is true).",
      "11:45: We had only water in the morning, going against our routine coffee binges that always take place Saturday mornings. We wanted to keep our entire system clean of any other body/mind altering substances throught the day. We ate no breakfast due to the joint rolling, and had a minor lunch of blended up apples/oranges/banannas/ fresh pineapple/ and strawberries.",
      "2:00: We passed the time by planning out the night with music that must be listened to, food that must be eaten, and activities that were to take place during the high.  After holding back to eating any of our favorite foods, or even listening to any music (to hopefully somehow save up all the greatness for the high) we played multiple card games and took a refreshing walk through the woods contemplating the greatly awaited high. The feelings going through me were like counting down to going to a heaven. Not a moment passed that Saturday when I couldnt contain myself from constantly smiling and doing random outbursts of joyous laughs.",
      "4:20 (on the spot): We counted down on my digital wrist watch in his black movie room for the light of the blunt. Both using a lighter we got a nice deep cherry started. We started off by both taking huge drags and passing it, but after about what seemed to be 10 minutes of this we just took small hits. I would toke a few deep drags, then pass it to him in which he would do the same. We decided not to talk throughout the smoking process in the room to keep the meditative vibe of quiet blackness constant.  The effects hit me almost instantly after the first few pulls. A light tingly sensation throught my body signaled that I was in for an experiance. The mixture of the 5 weeds was almost overpowering at first (also for the fact that I hadent smoked in a month) and I felt very light headed the first 10 minutes. Over the period of the blunt things really got wild. I would see the cherry of the blunt as my friend smoked it and nothing but the cherry. The cherry slowly developed a faint set of eyes that I kept on focusing on, but couldnt figure out.",
      "I unconsiously kept thinking their were eyes on the blunt, but never took it into consideration. We just kept smoking. It seemed as though an hour passed, and we still had roughly half the blunt to go. My mind is racing by now. I feel relaxed to the point of not moving a muscle, but my friend and I almost created a routine motion of me take a toke, then him take a toke. Their was a point when I convinced myself that I wasnt smoking it and I thought their was a bad passage in the blunt, but then figured out I was so high that I had to take a 6 second straight drag to feel the burn, I continued taking small pulls after that trusting myself that I was pulling it each time. After what seemed to be 30 minutes later I got a little nervous of the pitch blackness. I wanted to see things, but I had to just relax and let myself attempt to find out what my initial goal was: visual hellucinations.",
      "The last half of the blunt was definetly the edge of the glass for me. When I started taking pulls it began hitting me in very defined levels (most likely due to the resinous build up near the end - very potent!) After we managed to finish the blunt the effects continued to duplicate and things were amazing in the dark. Once I actually layed back and closed my eyes I slowely  began viusalizing myself sitting in a chair going into space. I sat back and the blackness ran over my like water. I was going full force into space and stars began emerging in the blackness. It was hard to beleive myself that I wasnt just mentally making this up (beucase nothing like this has EVER happened on a marijuana high to me). My face felt cold and I knew I wasnt just trying to make this up when I sat up in my seat and felt like I was falling down in space and I could see rocks on the sides of the room going in upward motions. I quickly sat back and continued on my space journey.",
      "I began hearing deep 'whoosh' sounds that came from the back of my head, and then slowly emerged around my ears and in then continued in the distance. A very deep and very realistic floating sensation roared over me and I was 100% convinced that somehow we hottboxed the room so much that it was being lifted off the ground into space. I was very nervous becuase I knew it wouldnt be good to be lost in space, and someone was going to find the missing room and wonder where we were. When I was aware of my extreme paranoia thoughts, I fully let them go and with no doubt was lifted into a new realm. I felt like I could communicate with the nods of my head. I would see things and if I nodded my head against the head rest once I would want to continue with my space journey to find new things, but If what i saw/felt/heard was appealing to me I would nod my head twice, sometimes with a turn to the left or right (depending on certain specifics about the sense) and I would continue to venture into the the specific detail. It was almost too much at points when I would continue to see random specific details of the visuals. But I constantly assured myself it was just the high. The best way to describe the physical feeling of the high would be to relate it to getting into a hottub when its cold outside. A very strong rush of releif/ euphoria/ and warm comfort continued to strike my body. In very defined waves it would continue to set my body free from reality.  Every wave I felt I mentally came lifted into a new sense of the high, which was most amazing about the whole high/trip. It wasnt like most highs where after you smoked, the peak would be in the next 10-20 minutes, and then you would slowely go down. This was consistantly reaching higher and higher peaks bringing me deeper into almost an outside world. I came very comfortable and unverbally social with the surrounding blackness. I full frontedly forgot about my friend in the other seat, but he was definetly higher than anything comprehendable becuase throughout the experiance he would pound the backs of his feet on the recliners as though it was a way of communicating, with different strengths and motions. Once or twice I pounded my feet on the recliner back to him mirroring the rhythm he did. Hearing and feeling the pounds on the backs of my feet were literally undescribeable because It was like I was almost in a trance communicating through pounds, not even being aware of the fact that I was doing it. I set a beeper on my watch to go off at 7:00 (2 hours and 40 minutes after the first toke). When it did go off I was terribly scared thinking it was a bomb of some sort that got left in the room, but almost instantly after remembered it was just my watch.",
      "I spoke out the first words after to my friend, 'holy shit'. Not getting an immediate response I stood up and opened the door just a crack letting in minimal light and noticably cold air (the air in the room was very hot and thick.) I then threw the door open feeling like simba off the lion king when he was held in the air off the cliff. I felt so refreshed by the light and fresh air that I fell down to my knees, rolled over and began laughing past control. When my friend got up he must of not seen me and tripped over with a unusal shriek and then started laughing with me on the ground.",
      "7:15: After a period of time, we didnt get far from the room. We laid on the floor massaging the thick carpet and noticing the ununsual shapes of light and smoke billowing out of the room. We were blazed past our minds and completly forgot about our appetites (that we saved up throughout the whole day) and the activites we had planned. We would talk to each other in unusal tones, and completly change the subject every 10 seconds to something completly farfetched. Every one of my senses was very heightened.",
      "9:30 After hours of deep and very rewarding and spirtual conversation and more hallucinations (mainly minor closed eye) we began gaining back to our selves. We both remembered food after the extreme effects declined and we ate 2 boxes of Chocolate chip granola bars, 2 bags of sunchips, and plenty of costco muffins washed down with no fear energy drink.",
      "11:30 Still disorianted we were near the end of the high. We both recouped with more convorsation and then both endulged in multiple nintendo games, transitioning between halo 2 on the xbox360, and Mario party on the gamecube, then we had the best damn sleep of our lives."

      "I will not bore you with unnecesary details about my life. I have taken Cubensis 3 times prior to this experience, even higher doses, and experienced nothing like this.",
      "Yesterday (Friday Feb. 2nd, 2007), myself and my younger brother (18 years old, I am 20), decided to trip on some of our dried cubensis. We decided to increase our dosage from last time, to 2.6 grams, as these seemed to be extremely potent cubensis. We went far from humanity, out to a beautiful spot in nature, right by a river, with birds chirping and a generally pleasant environment. We took our doses at the same time, at 2:30 PM. We sat on a warm rock in the sun, and smoked some cannabis while waiting for the effects. After 15 minutes, I could feel my thought process changing, getting deeper. I felt happy, but that anxious feeling of coming up was present too.",
      "By 3:00pm, the first real effects began to kick in on both of us. We decided to walk.",
      "We walked along the path by the river, where there were no other humans. I could feel myself forgetting or losing everything in my psyche I had ever learned about social interaction and communication. Me and my brother walked along, until we came upon a beautiful tree. I touched it, and I felt so understanding of the tree. I felt sorry for it, because it could not move along with me and experience all the wonderful things to see. But we kept moving, and we would stop every couple of feet to marvel at some small rock or shrub and how beautiful it was. Every place we stopped took on a brand new feeling, that was so overwhelming and beautiful.",
      "Finally we came to a sandy spot by the water, that was in full sun. It was warm and we liked it. So we stopped here. We sat on the sand there for at least an hour, although I had no understanding of time at all. The subject of time was very confusing. I repeatedly tried to figure out what time we started tripping, and how long we had been tripping for, but found it impossible. Why should there be a beginning, and an end? that is not our natural function. We are eternal, never ending. It was at this time, sitting on that sand in the warm sun, that I entered a dream. EVERYTHING that I could perceive with my eyes, was a visual. Everything that I looked at was surrounded with black, although it is impossible to describe what I saw, It seemed to all follow a theme. What was real I could still see, but it was much more colorful and beautiful than normal. It would also warp and twirl fantastically. Plants seemed to wave at me. Everything was surrounded by a blackness, which I believed to be space.",
      "We then stood up to leave that spot and return to the car to listen to music. As we walked (it was a long way), I felt I was extremely tall, then I was getting lighter. We walked to the top of a hill, where there was a cliff, at least 40 feet high. I walked to the edge of this cliff (very dangerous looking back on it), feeling more like I was floating to it at this point more than walking, and a gust of wind shot up from the cliff when I looked down. When the wind hit me, I was flying. I remembered EVERY dream I have ever had, at the same time. and it felt exactly like I was flying. I could fly. It felt so good, the best feeling in my life. I was actually flying, and there was not a chance in hell anyone could have convinced me I was not, because I was really flying.",
      "I looked down the canyon, from where I stood, and I could see myself down by the water, playing as a kid. As a child my parents would always bring us to this spot to play, and I could remember all of those feelings as a child playing by the water. I remember how badly I would want to stay when we had to leave. And I also remembered so many dreams I had experienced, where I was in this exact spot. I believe I was in a lucid dream, while awake, I had returned to this spot that I had dreamed of so many times, in real life, and in the dream world at the same time. This was the best part of the trip. Absolutely indescribable bliss.",
      "My brother felt the same thing. We did not speak much, but we understood each other. I KNEW I did not need to speak to him, because he understood me without me needing to. I honestly don't know if we experienced some form of telepathy, but he told me afterwards that he felt the same way. We were communicating without words or on a physical level. This place had a huge significance. I felt as if leaving this spot would signify something extremely big, but I was not sure what.",
      "When we finally left, I could feel the trip change as we walked away from it. We got in the truck, and lit a cigarette. I found it amazing that I only had to take one puff of the cigarette, and instantly felt it 10x stronger than if I had smoked the whole thing when not high. We began calling them pleasure sticks, because only one puff would bring on a feeling similar to the drug MDMA. Then we loaded a bowl of ganja, and found the same to be true with it as well! one puff and I was stoned out of my mind. It was awesome! I have developed a tolerance to weed, cuz I smoke too much of it, but on shrooms, that doesn't exist. I was so blind it was like the first time I smoked weed.",
      "Then we drove to another spot[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!], where we began to come down. The come down wasn't pleasant. I realized that tripping that hard must have some repurcussions. It took over two hours for us to come down. I felt as if I was learning everything about reality again. I literally felt my conciousness COME DOWN to another level. I felt stupider, more restrained. As reality began to take over more and more, I felt so much knowledge, understanding, compassion, slipping away from me. I strongly believed, and still do, that the place where I went on these mushrooms was the place we go when we die. Our bodies die, but we just leave them, and go on to another place, another world, another body maybe. I fully understood and realized this. I also found many flaws in our society, government, etc. I could think so clearly, and understand so much, I can not even begin to describe what I learned.",
      "The reason we tripped so hard this time may be because we forgot to drink, and got dehydrated in the sun. We had bought drinks to avoid this, but carried them around with us the whole time, not really understanding why or what they were for. So we did not drink until about 7:00 pm, sitting in the car, and suddenly realized we were dehydrated, that's why we were STILL tripping. I thought I was sober, when marijuana leaves grew from the stereo and covered the entire dash. After drinking a half gallon of water (I was SO thirsty and didn't even realize that's what that feeling was) I vomited, urinated, drank the other half, and was finally sober.",
      "We got home, and it felt like it was the first time I had been there. I took a shower, and when I got out I felt so clean, fresh and new. I made decisions to change my life for the better. I realized I was doing a lot wrong. I feel that my life is forever changed, in a very positive way, by these mushrooms, and I am very grateful. I will not do shrooms again with anyone except my brother."

      "For years I have been curious of all drugs and try as many as i can find at least once, and around the end of Janruary 2001 I got my hands on 25 grams of Amanita Muscaria off of a botanical website.  To say the least it was the worst single experience of my life.",
      "My night started with me eating 10 grams of the shrooms.  I have been told this would give a medium to strong hallucinogenic trip, so I ate them with no problem with the taste and an excited feel for trying something new.  After 3 hours me and my sitter decided that it wasn't going to work, no effect had taken place and no horrible taste as we had heard came with the shroom.  We made the stupid decision to have me eat the rest in 30 minutes if it didn't set in.  Well, the time came by and I decided it was down the hatch for them, and I ate all but three of the grams that were left over, and again I waited.  Then the horror began in an odd visual, a small fire began crackling on top of the halogen lamp in my living room.",
      "At this point I got drowsy and as much as I tried to stay awake, I could not.  In a few minutes, as far as I can figure, I woke up with a sense of understanding that to the day I die I will never be able to tell with words, but the best explanation I can give is that I was traveling from different times to other different times and memories all the way to my death only to repeat the cycle when I died.  At this point I had the genius idea that I had died and my life was flashing before my eyes.  I panicked.  I stood up and ran into the middle of the living room, but could not see one part of my house any longer, it was a full blown visual hallucination.  I got close enough to the sitter and could see the slight image of his face, at this point I began uncontrollably screaming and crying, falling to the floor and the changing of visuals began again.  I couldnt grasp on to one visual and panicked yet again and tried to run anywhere to get away, but only ran full speed into a wall and collapsed.",
      "Two of the three people at my house now tried to restrain me.  The horrible visuals stopped and I relaxed thinking it was over and lay down, so confused that I had no idea that I was under the influence of a drug only that now was the peace I needed.  Unfortunately the same hallucinations started again and I somehow found my way to my room where the third person at my house was.",
      "I had not said a word in over 3 hours at this time and the people now feared that I would die under the influence of this as I had been staring, crying, and been in a vacant state as if I had given up on surviving.  I had been moved to the couch somehow and rested there, still without the reassurance of speech to my friends, but now began what I thought was a game of spitting to make the visuals stop.  And strangely it was working, and finally I was responding to their yelling at me.  Most people think this is the comedown of my trip, and if I were only that lucky, it would be, but I now began to watch my friends die before me in horrible ways such as having their necks ripped open by unseen things and people melting.  Everyone I held close now went through a sequence of death, and a normal human reaction was displayed after this: I vomited.  I would not let this vomit out of my mouth however and one of my friends had to tear my jaw open with his hands in my mouth to let it out so I didn't suffocate to death.  At this point I finally began coming down.",
      "I woke up feeling fine and didn't even fully remember the experience for the next month.  Through all my experiences with drugs, this was my worst.  I believe it as more of a poison than a drug, and I would wish this on no one, not even my worst enemies.  This was however my wake-up call to be more careful in my drug use from now on, and the true value and importance of sitters and friends."

      "This is a quick note on my first 2C-E trip, last month.",
      "I had not planned to trip at all on the night in question. I had recently come into 500mg of 2C-E from a pretty reliable supplier and had been planning to wait until it felt like the right time to use it.",
      "I finished work at 8pm and took a taxi to a nearby courier depot to pick up some whippets I ordered earlier in the week. Once I got home, I ate a pizza and took around 200mg of Methylone while listening to an aphex twin album at a decent volume. In doing so I reckon I upset everybody who lives within 200 yards of my flat! Fuckem if they can't appreciate some good noise though.",
      "After an hour or so I was beginning to get a good buzz from the methylone, and redosed with another 100mg, insufflated. I also did some nangs over this period. By about 1am most of the pronounced effects of the Methylone had faded somewhat and redosing was not really taking it much further. I was very clearheaded though, wide awake and feeling good.",
      "Around this time I took a walk to the shop and picked up some cigarettes and Orange Juice. By the time I returned I had decided to have at the 2C-E, so I took my scale and measured out 100mg or thereabouts, 100mg being the smallest measure my scale will take. I really should have dissolved this in water, but instead I eyeballed a tenth of the powder and drank what I reckon was 10-15mg of 2C-E with some orange.",
      "Then I settled down on the sofa, intermittently inhaling nangs while I posted on one of my favourite forums and half watched 'Drawn Together'. After half an hour I had almost forgotten I had taken the stuff, but after 50 minutes or so the text on a comic book sequence on tv was expanding and contracting, and the room seemed bigger than usual. I also noticed some pictures on my wall were sort of misty.",
      "Once I had those first alerts the trip came on really quickly. Open eye visuals were not too much at first, the room was lot brighter than usual and the computer screen became too much to deal with. I put on some random chill out music and lay back on the couch with my eyes closed.",
      "I could hear the music that was playing but was not really processing the sounds. Instead I was seeing these fantastic angular shapes and colours rotating and floating inside my eyelids to the tune and beat of the Aphex Twin I had been listening to earlier on. I had no real anxiety or thoughts to speak of, I just let my mind follow the lights and colours for what felt like an eternity, but was probably more like 30 minutes. Occasionally during this time I was vaguely conscious of my thighs and hips vibrating and thrashing somewhat.",
      "Later, I inhaled some more whippets and switching off the lamps moved to lie on my beanbags, just inside the window. There is a wooden slat blind on this window and green and translucent shimmers of light flitted in from between the slats. I don't remember a huge amount from the next while, but at one point I opened my eyes and there were two celtic patterns, like triangles with rounded corners rotating in opposite directions on top of each other on the ceiling above me. For some reason I found this really reassuring, and made some sort of connection between them and my heritage which made me feel really warm and this set off a very nice fantasy.",
      "Moving back to the sofa, I had at the nangs once again, and this time after a few cartridges I had this incredible sensation of electricity on the right side of my head, just behind the temple. It felt like I was projecting through the side of my head so I looked in that direction, towards the window where it was like some sort of cosmic breeze/flame had caused the top few feet of the blind to be blowing into the room with a shimmery purple/blue colour. Looking outside, everything was bright purple and pulsing energy. The room seemed to be closer to me on all sides, brighter and was humming/buzzing. For a while I felt like I was floating! It was fucking amazing.",
      "Even the air in the room, while still transparent, could be seen curving and bending into these fantastic shapes and angles.",
      "I was in heaven, past thought. I did try to post online, but it was impossible to put anything into words or thought coherently.",
      "I went to bed at some point, my memory of bed is not really there, I was restless, got up a few times to take a leak. At around 9am I was more or less down, but still awake so I dosed 2.5ml of GBL which gave me a fitful sleep until 12 or so.",
      "The next day was been pretty ropey. I had a bath, did some shopping for food and cleaned the house but only after 24 hours I feel 'normal', whatever that is.",
      "I didn't really have many meaningful insightful moments that I can recall. I made a conscious decision when I felt the first alerts to just let the drug take me and not to impose myself on it and succeeded in doing that. Maybe that's my lesson, if there is any.",
      "I am definitely going to use this again. It's one good psychedelic."

      "Wow. I finally tried Salvia divinorum for the first time. Boy was I glad I had read up on it and spent time visualizing how I wanted the experience to be. It was incredible!!!",
      "I went to a friend's place to watch hockey - the ulterior motive being for three of us to get together and give Salvia at try for the first time in a comfortable setting, with people that wouldn't be acting like jerks. I decided I would give it a go after the first period of the game. I packed the small bowl of my water pipe very tightly, with approximately a gram of salvia leaf. I had this Salvia for about 2 weeks, but I hadn't really felt ready to try it until now - I wasn't nervous at all. Without hesitating I lit the bowl with a regular lighter (keeping the flame on it) and took my first big hit, held it for 15 seconds, let it out and and then took my second hit. As I was leaning forward to place the pipe back on the table, I felt a small giggle rising out of the depths, and a bit of strange pressure on the front of my face.",
      "Well.... No one would have convinced me that a person could experience what happened next. I let out the giggle, along with all of my second hit in a messy, giant blow, as the giggle from the depths immediately turned into a 'perfect storm' of uncontrollable, loony laughter. There was also a sense of sliding forward and forward and forward, but the intensity with which the laughter came on really had me in disbelief, because just after the first giggle, but before I could even say to myself 'Is this IT?!?! Oh my God! This can't be it! WOW IT IS!' - I had lost it. The laughing grew and grew and grew. There was no going backwards, there was no calming myself, or relaxing to analyze the experience, or even catching my breath. There was only forwards and forwards with more and more intensity.",
      "I quickly let myself go and everything felt incredibly, genuinely, hysterically funny. The entire scene of me and my friends in the the living room took on a whole feeling of being in a sitcom, performing, being watched by an audience, all in my head. The cheers from the crowd at the hockey game on TV were for us! I was laughing with the crowd/audience. I was the source of the funny and I was laughing at it all. Immediately after my initial burst of laughter and obvious spiral down into a complete lack of control, my friend said, 'Come ON?!?!' in a skeptical, character-typical kind of way, which I greatly appreciated and made me laugh even more, his next words were, 'Fuc*ing RIGHT! Pack me a bowl!!!', and with my friends laughing along with me I nearly fell off my seat, again because this was the funniest damn thing I I had ever heard in my life.",
      "Everything my friends said to me, everything they did, everything I did, elicited the same kind of internal response as I would get from watching a character driven running gag, like Seinfeld, or Trailer Park Boys - a warm, driven, imaginative, familiar and satisfying sense - Kramer bursting through Jerry's door with the funniest expression ever - Ricky with his six-paper joints and reckless, self-centered interpretation of reality - except TIMES 10!!!! So there was the incredible laughter, which I was very thankful for - it was exactly what I had wanted and preconditioned myself to experience after watching about 50 YouTube videos of various degrees of Salvia trips.",
      "I also immediately noticed that my centre of balance was WAYYY off, as if my head weighed 100 lbs. I would lean a little one way and it felt like I was falling over. But I wasn't, it just felt that way. When I leaned forward I felt a huge roller coaster ride rush downward. When I put my hands over my eyes to wipe away tears from laughing I ACTUALLY SAW the roller coaster tracks and the tunnel I was riding in. I had heard many times in videos and read of people describing a tunnel - I know exactly what they were talking about. I had presence of mind enough to speak to my friends between laughing fits, but only enough to say, 'OH MY GOD', and make airplane noises, 'Vrrrrreeaaaaaoooooooohhhhmmmmmmmm-HAAHAHAHAHAHEEHEEHEEHEEHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!' with my arms stretched out - my friends were impressed.",
      "So the laughing and roller coaster lasted about four minutes. Then I snapped out of it! Still giggly, very relaxed, but completely awestruck at what I had just experienced. Before I had come back to earth my friend had already packed a bowl and lit it up, but he hadn't used the pipe right at all and just sat there telling us, 'Yeah, I feel a little strange'. But no laughter. I was really disappointed for him. My other friend tried it next and being a veteran pipe user, got the required dose for a breakthrough, but his experience also seemed to be less like a carnival ride and more like a meditation. There was no laughter, he just closed his eyes and described feeling as if he were riding on the front of a car, driving forward very fast(the same sensation as my roller coaster), and seeing a big fence along the sides of a tunnel(the same as my roller coaster tracks?!?)",
      "I waited until the second intermission of the game (45 minutes later) to do it again, and I had enough time to squeal,'It's happening again hahahahaheeeheehheee', before the ride started all over!!! Again, laughing in disbelief, and the disbelief making me laugh. This time though, I felt a little embarrassed for a few moments as it seemed like I was acting a lunatic with my laughing, and I knew my friends couldn't relate because they didn't experience the same thing. My friend said, 'You're freaking out the dog!', but rather than let that ruin my rush and turn things dark I just let myself go and laughed and laughed. The Roller coaster was even more vivid. I was in another world.",
      "This was incredible. I think it's all in the dose (of course) - I'm really excited to explore other experiences with stronger and lighter doses. I was disappointed that my friends didn't get the laughing fit - it was invigorating! The closest thing I can think of is having the most incredibly fun carnival ride. I HATE carnival rides! But I've seen people on them that laugh and laugh and laugh until they are exhausted. I imagine it's the way they've trained themselves to respond to the crazy motion and fear, and rushes, and the adrenaline boost! That's what I felt like - one of these people that enjoys the adrenaline rush from riding the craziest, highest, most jolting and life-threatening carnival ride you could imagine.",
      "It was a Super Fun Happy Slide! It helped to feel and believe that I had fully prepared myself by reading up on the drug and other people's experiences. I think I had an idea of what I could expect and that helped me to really enjoy the rush! I can't wait to get back on this ride!"

      "After running out of Klonopin which I usually use help to get to sleep, I decided to seek out natural alternatives. I had read online that combining Melatonin, vitamin B6, and Valerian would produce the most vivid of dreams.  I've been interested in dreaming for as long as I've been alive and this intrigued me.  From what I've learned, people dream every night, whether they remember it or not.",
      "Melatonin absolutely allows me to remember my dreams better than without.  The order of events, sounds, colors are completely available for recall when I awake.  I could write for a half hour about my dreams when I take melatonin before I sleep, while normally I can sometimes remember only bits and pieces. The sensations that I experience while dreaming are unlike anything I could adequately put into words. While the dreams are not what I'd call lucid dreams, they are extremely vivid, and simply different.  I experience, or remember rather, sensations that are so intense it makes dreaming a treat.",
      "As for Vitamin B6 and Valerian - while they don't seem to inhibit the effect of melatonin, they certainly aren't necessary.  I've tested that numerous times."

      "Night before New Years eve, and me and 5 friends decide to go for a nice trip.",
      "We all dropped at our friends house at about 10pm, in the middle of a party. We all dropped somewhere between 1g and 1.5g of dried mushrooms. I didn't notice anything happening by 10:30, so me and a friend decided to do everything that was left. I'm not exactly sure how much it was, but it was about the same as what I had taken at 10. By 11pm I was starting to feel the initial effects, mostly just an unexplainable feeling that something 'big' was about to happen. Like the feeling I get outside just before a huge storm. Everyone else left for a bar at about this time, leaving me and my 5 friends alone.",
      "In the next hour my storm broke. I should mention that this was only my second time trying any drug other than pot, and it was at least 2x the shrooms that I did the first time I tried them.",
      "By 12am I was well and truely tripping. It was far beyond anything I experienced my first time, nearly 9 months earlier. We (everyone on shrooms) were all sitting in a circle in my friend's living room, talking and sharing what was happening to each of us. I didn't share too much, as I was barely conscious at times. I remember listening to my friends talk about trees, colors, dogs. I kept laughing, and each time I started laughing I would stop to find myself laying on the floor with my friends lauging at me. I decided to go hide in the corner, beside a little tree that looked peaceful to me.",
      "I can't say what time it was, as I had lost all concept of it by now, but eventually we all decided to go downstairs and listen to a CD my friend had brought with some trippy music on it. We went downstairs, but most of the guys couldn't stop talking or laughing, so they abandoned the music and went up stairs. I was the last person in the room, and I remember trying to walk towards the stairs but I kept forgetting why it was I wanted to go to them. So I just stood there with my head back and my eyes closed.",
      "While I stood there, I began to notice the clouds and blobs I could see with my eyes closed begin to take on definate shapes. Colorful and intricate fractals started to appear and 'dance' to the music. I was amazed at the power of my mind to create these things that my computer struggled to produce. I watched with awe as the fractals moved and zoomed in to reveal new and wonderful shapes. I couldn't control what I was seeing, but that didn't bother me at all. About this time a few of the guys came downstairs and found me laying on the floor with my eyes closed (note that I don't actually remember how I got there). They tried to bring me upstairs, and I tried to tell them to just leave me. I couldn't talk. One or two words would come out and suddenly the sentence would change and another one or two words of a different thought would come out. I remember KNOWING that it was because I was only partially in this world and this reality. Eventually the guys just decided to leave me down there, with the music.",
      "With my eyes closed and the fractals dancing to the music, I hit what I can only describe as the peak of the experience. Suddenly the music faded away almost to infinity, until I could only barely hear it. The fractals dissapeared from my view and I was floating in an empty void. Remembering back on it, I couldn't even feel my body. I couldn't remember life, being alive, or the concept of existence. I just WAS. Presently I understood that the blackness I was 'seeing' was an empty sky. I waited for what seemed an eternity as blue and red 'stars' appeared in the blackness to keep me company. The sky filled with these stars and a blue cloudy mist that looked much like the Milky Way on a dark summer night. In an instant I could feel myself again, but not where I once remembered being. I was laying on a bed of soft grass. My arms were spread out to each side of me. Above, and around me, statues appeared. They looked like the kind of statues you would see in a church, with serene faces and hands against their chests in prayer. They were all positioned around me in a circle, and seemed to be looking down at me. Suddenly the stars in the sky exploded in showers of red and blue dots, much like fireworks do. As the exploding stars faded from existence, so did the rest of the world. I was, for the moment, back in reality staring at my friends basement ceiling.",
      "I started to get a little depressed about losing the vision I had just been treated to, so I decided to go upstairs. Everyone was watching TV, so I just layed down in front of the TV and tried to enjoy the rest of the night. I didn't have any more visions, but I kept slipping in and out of reality. I remember gasping for breath for no other reason than being able to.",
      "The rest of the night, and my trip, was extremely enjoyable. I woke up the next morning feeling great (despite sleeping on the floor) and can honestly say the experience has changed my life for the better."

    "report": [
      "I have experimented with diphenhydramine for a number of years now, and I figure that it is about time that I share my experience with the world. My usual dosage is 200mg, but I have been known to take considerably lower and considerably higher dosages for differing effects, lower for less of a crash, and higher for more of a debilitating state. And I have never taken over 14 pills, 14 only because at one point I was taking so many that I became tolerant to the effects and required such a high dose for any sort of recreational feeling.",
      "I used the drug, rather the abuse of it, to calm my mind. It is hyperactive, on a normal day I cannot seem to shut it off and this causes me to be paranoid and unstable in my thought processes. Sedatives help alleviate this and so my ride began. Now, this is not to say that everyone would have a positive relation with the drug, simply because I have certain mental oddities I do believe this is one of the only reasons why I can tolerate the drug and utilize it in such a positive fashion.",
      "My mindset that first night was wonderful. I entered the euphoric state within thirty minutes of ingestion. My muscles relaxed, the world became hollow and tolerable. my vision blurred and then my eyes dilated, I became intolerant to light and could see decently in the dark. After about an hour, my body was completely submerged in the euphoric state, pain was lessened, my heartbeat became deeper and stronger, and I experienced a dryness of my facial orifices. Typical, and usually not my concern, however it can be bothersome when my eyes become dry and sticky.",
      "Well, now to the absolute point of my tale. I became musical. Knowingly I am already quite the musical/artistic being, I have my own art gallery online and sport a knowledge of seven instruments, however like the drug suggests, in a hypnotic state one may experience an 'artistic enlightenment', which I did. And do everytime I take the drug. I picked up the flute upon my dresser, and began to indulge in playing every song on my media player playlist! What was more odd, is that I, unlike normal, could hit nearly every note of any song I had beforehand not attempted to play, easily and well. I now understand why some stage musicians delve into drug usage during and before shows.",
      "I've never experienced any amnesia from taking diphenhydramine, although I do tend to find it harder to grasp the right word in any situation now, I am wondering if this is not an after effect of prolonged use.  Also, I am beginning to think I should stop taking it altogether, due to a recent problem concerning the veins in my throat, which dilate heavily and ache everytime I decide to 'trip'.",
      "It is not wise to take these pills for the length of time I have, tripping hundreds of times due to the fact that I have taken them for the anxiety alleviation everyday, for two and a half years now. Also, it is a bit shaking when now I have to punch my chest due to the 'heart flutter' which aggravatingly flares up everytime I trip. I have also become dependent on them for sleep on workdays, I'll stay up till five in the morning on any given day, and have to trip hard in order to get any sleep. My circadian rhythm is so messed up from tripping that it doesn't know when to sleep, and when not to sleep. After a 16 hour sleep binge, I will wake up for four hours and grow weary again, falling back to sleep for another 10 or so hours.",
      "In my heyday with the pills I have taken them and been so educated with their effects and the time it takes for the hypnosis to set in that I've binged on them, gone to the store with my mother, and been although fried out of my gourd, completely cognitive and with mental understanding. However unlike the described symptoms suggest, I becme very untalkative and withdrawn noticeably, rather than social. I have also much to my embarrassment, become unbelievably 'in season', contrary to the symptom of decreased libido, described. Instead of a decreased libido, it became quite increased, perhaps that is because I am normally all but dead down there? Who knows.",
      "Also, I have gone through a rather uncaring phase where I would binge on the pills, and then synergize by consuming alcohol. Now, this was stupid I agree, but the effects? They were quite fun. Now that I think about it actually, the reason I did this is because of another horrid symptom that I experienced. The feeling of decreased temperature. I became extremely cold, now I'm cold to begin with, but see nobody should donn flannel in the summer heat of the south. You see what I'm saying?",
      "Anyhoo, being the chemist I like to think I am, to counter the effects of the feeling of frigidity which I knew wasn't really a decrease in core temperature, but the effects of the drug making my body think that I was cold, I drank liquor in the knowledge that liquor makes your body think its hotter than it really is. The result with the right amount, was a settlement to the confliction of thermal instability.",
      "I have also used these pills as a coping mechanism for certain sensory disturbances. I become easily aggravated by cacphonus auditory assaults, and with diphenhydramine in my bloodstream, this became null and void. I would take them, and the bell that bothers the heck out of me at my place of work, would no longer shake me.",
      "The positive and negative effects of the pills have pretty much balanced out, but I do believe that I have decided that should I wish to keep my life, I should stop my habitual indulgence in them. But it was a good run while it lasted."

    "report": [
      "Curiousity led me to try it. I had gone to the smoke shop to buy a new pipe the night before. I noticed the salvia inside the showcase, but I told myself not to buy it yet. I was hesitant because I'd heard so many stories of bad trips. I once heard of guy who saw his dead grandmother. He said that her skin fell off. I'd also heard less scary stories but still bazaar experiences nonetheless. My friend warned me about it, but the curiousity was eating away at me ever since I bought the pipe. I returned the following afternoon to buy it. One of my roommates was here when I got back. She had never heard of salvia. I explained to her what I've been told about it, and I wanted her to watch me do it in case something bad happened. I had never taken a hallucinogen before this incident, so I had no idea what to expect. I figured I would have some sort of vision or see nonexistent things. I thought I would be able to sit back and escape reality for a few minutes. I was very wrong.",
      "I packed the salvia neatly into my pipe and set it on the table. I told her that we could watch Wonder Showzen. I thought it would enhance the experience. It's pretty much the most twisted show ever created. Full of sarcasm, social commentary, and most of all cruel reality. I was quite excited to watch it during my trip. I popped in the dvd and proceeded to smoke my pipe by the balcony. I slid open the door to blow the smoke outside. I took my first hit, released, and stood still for a few seconds. I wanted to turn around to tell my roommate that salvia is bull because I didn't feel a thing. I stifled my comment and stared at the pine tree in front of me. I thought if the salvia started working its magic that the tree would turn into something crazy.",
      "I wanted to give it a chance, so I took a second hit. I don't know if I was doing it improperly because I didn't have anyone experienced to direct me. I inhaled it like weed and held it in for ten good seconds. As I exhaled I could've sworn my brain hit the back of skull. A wave rushed over my head, and I stumbled backward. I turned around and tried to look at my roommate. She was sitting on the couch, but I couldn't see her. Everything was so unclear. I tried to walk slowly. Instead I rushed to sit down in panic. She though I was faking it. I was trying not to alarm her, or what I thought was her. I was there next to her, but I was just a shell. I looked out into an unfamiliar, blurry distortion of what I thought existed. I expected to see crazy random things. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I couldn't see anything at all. It was a kaleidoscope so intricate that the pieces were not visible to the naked eye. It was as if a computer took all of its pixels and scrambled them into some random configuration.",
      "I could make out certain things through relative space. I could hear the tv loud and clear. I wanted to close the lid to the salvia before I spilled it everywhere. I completed that task. I also put the pipe back in its protector. I stuffed it in there still half full of salvia. I wasn't aware. I just didn't want to leave anything for my roommate to clean up. My roommate had gotten up, but at the time I didn't know it. She was spraying the room to get rid of the smell. I had no idea that she had done that until after the trip.",
      "I saw her eyes focused on me. She was standing up next to the couch. She asked if I wanted to be taken to the doctor. She turned into a giant spinning blur. It was like an excellerated version of the Disneyland tea cups. She wouldn't stay still. I could only see her eyes. She told me that I stared at her blankly. I blurted out 'no'. It was all that I could gather enough thought to say. She asked me a question. I don't what she asked me, but I thought she kept repeating it. I couldn't understand what I was being asked. I know that I tried to tell her - You keep asking me the same question over and over, but I can't understand it right now. It didn't come out right. My motor skills were shot. Panicking that she was going to try to take me outside (shudder), I slammed my hand on the couch and yelled - NO! Sit down.",
      "I could see the tv screen come in and out of focus. I saw the little boy punching the meat at the butcher's shop. That wasn't a hallucination, that was really the show. It scared me even though I had seen the episode more than once. I stood up in a frenzy looking around. I thought my bed would fix it. I felt worse when I stood. It felt like the sudden falling sensation that causes me to gasp and my head to jolt right as I'm about to fall asleep sometimes. It was worse than that. The sensation was neverending in addition to being amplified ten fold. I told her I was going to my room in an akward way. I wanted to say bed, but the word was nonexistent in my new vocabulary.",
      "As I entered the room my b/f called me. I heard my phone in my purse. I ran over to it. I couldn't find it. I threw my keys out. I was panting. I soon realized that I was suffocating. I didn't want to talk, but he would get mad if I ignored the call. I finally found the the phone and answered it. I don't know how I managed this, but I climbed into my loft bed with the phone in my hand. I can barely do that when I'm sober. I flopped onto my stomach. I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating that he called me or if it was real. I tried to seem as normal as possible because I knew he wouldn't approve of what I was doing. I could barely hear his voice. I told him I was lying down. I asked if I could call him back later and hung up.",
      "The bed didn't fix me. I was uncomfortable. I'm normally a cold person. I always have chills, but I was boiling. I was suffocating and on fire. I heard the phrase - STAB YOU, STAB YOU, STAB YOU! on Wonder Showzen. My roommate was still watching it in the other room. That was last thing I need to hear. I started writhing on my bed. I decided it would be better to get up. I literally leaped out of the bed to the floor. Keep in mind that my bed is practically next to the ceiling. I pretty much jumped seven feet off of my bed with distorted perception and no sense of my surroundings. Luckily I wasn't injured. I didn't even feel it. I rushed into the room where my roommate was watching the show. I yelled at her to turn it off. I didn't mean it to sound rude. I couldn't get anything out but the simplest of commands. It was like I had become temporarily retarded. I didn't want to hear the show because it was scaring me. Then I got an idea.",
      "I would feel better if I emersed myself in water. I fumbled around to the bathroom. After I finally got the hang of the light switch I forgot why I was in there. I turned it off and ran out. I'm glad I didn't do what I intended to do. I was going to try to take a cold shower. Nevermind that I was wearing a shirt, a sweater, a belt, jeans, and red leather shoes. I went over to my roommate's room to try to apologize. The words wouldn't come out right, but I think I got the idea across. That falling thing wouldn't stop as long as I was standing. I told her that I was going to my room. I meant to say bed, but of course everything I said sounded like gibberish anyway. I ran back to my room and turned the light off. I ripped off my pants like I was in the NBA. Then I whipped off my belt, threw off my sweater, and kicked off my shoes.",
      "I can't sleep with doors open. I tried to close my closet. It wouldn't close. I jumped up and down trying to force it. I was losing it. Then I realized that one of my shoes was lodged between the doors. I removed it and slammed the doors in fury. I began to climb up to bed. I went to pull the sheet back but ended up ripping up the sheet that covers the mattress too. I flipped out. Bunched up sheets and ruffled covers are one of my HUGE pet peeves. I yanked the sheet down into submission. It was going to be tucked around the mattress if it was the last thing I would ever accomplish. After my epic battle versus the sheet I crawled into bed and covered my head. I rolled back and forth trying to rid myself of this intensity. It lasted almost twenty minutes total. I kept thinking 'Why do people do this to themselves? Will it ever end?' That was the moment I realized that I had actually done something to cause this mindless, panicked state. I didn't realize I had been on salvia. I instantly felt better in ten minutes.",
      "This trip made me appreciate life. I have never in my life been so panicked and scared. I had never felt so close to death. I thought I was stuck that way. I've read and heard about many people's experiences with salvia, but I've never heard anything like what happened to me. That's some powerful shit. I had never imagined that anything could ever feel like that. It was a feeling that I can't put into words. It was a terrible and tragic new dimension full of vague figures and failed communication. I do not recommend that to anyone. I don't know if I would ever do that again. That shit should be illegal."

      "So last night I went to a rave. I can honestly say that I've never been so euphoric, nor excited in my whole life. The amazing this is, I didn't consume any illicit things until AFTER the rave. The whole time I was there at the rave, I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I am to live in the world I do, to know the people I know, and to think the way that I think. It's truly given me some major leeway with my plans for the rest of my life, because I feel like I understand the true emotions I once held far and away. But the rave was only the beginning for what my friend and I had in our near futures.",
      "After leaving Cece at 12 (I wish I coulda stayed), we were outside and my friend was having trouble opening his car door. I mentioned that I was a little bit frustrated we didn't find ANY substance at the rave, and at almost that instant, the girl (I think Ashley was her name) that I didn't know came up to me and offered a bit of speed, 30 mg. Naturally, I was hesitant at first to try the drug, but I was not going to leave that night without some sort of substance to explore my own mind with. So I bought my capsule, and my friend and I went home in his BMW going upwards of 120 mph listening to hardcore techno only to find his mother still awake. We had planned to leave back to the rave after she'd seen we were home and she'd fallen asleep.",
      "She didn't fall asleep....ever. But it's neither here nor there, it's not important.",
      "Anyway, we got home and put on Infected Mushroom (techno) and I went into his bathroom to take my speed. Pop, in my mouth. Easy. Twenty minutes pass, I feel nothing.",
      "Thirty minutes are now past, I still feel not a shred of anything.",
      "Now I'm sitting here upstairs with my friend talking about how fun the night was, and in one large sweeping feeling throughout my head, I feel suddenly euphoric and had an overall feeling of extreme well-being. The things we talked about ranged from girlfriends, to the human psyche, even to the way government is lying to us (Theory). I can honestly say I've never felt so amazingly happy than I did during those twenty minutes upstairs. It was during this twenty minutes in which I felt mentally invincible. I could tell my friend anything.",
      "I told him my story of the rave, in which he was very interested it seemed, and moderately impressed by. Now I'm at the end of my story, I can barely keep up with my thoughts, words come out slurred and jumbled. My brain is a frenzy of light and color that I can't explain with any other phrase than 'Brilliant Fuzziness'. It's at this time when my friend and I give up on going back to the rave, because his mother inevitably won't sleep and will therefore catch us sneaking back out.",
      "We go downstairs to listen to more music, and watch the iTunes visualizer (Very VERY trippy). I feel fuzzy and warm inside, I feel completely content with my situation, I feel invincible. Words, phrases, stories start spilling out of me, all of which Darin (My friend) is completely interested and helpful with. I tell him again how seriously euphoric I am, and he says he understands. An hour passes, and my mind races relentlessly from one topic to the next, going off on tangents, and occasionally, completely malfunctioning because of an overload of information.",
      "I tell Darin the story of how I met Caity, and our relationship. I tell Darin the story of how I really never was happy until now. I tell Darin that he is the best person I'd ever met, I feel like unraveling an entire chain of events and actions that have taken place, just to prove this fact that yes, he is an amazing person.",
      "Around 3:30, my mind is simply too packed full of both useful and useless information, so I take a break from my constant ramblings. Darin begins to speak. I understand perfectly what he's saying, I can keep up with his train of thought, everything around me is finally in focus, and I see and embrace the truth in my life, rather than always running away from it.",
      "Now it's 4:30. I begin to feel myself drift away into a positive state of sleep, but I'm woken up (willingly) by Darin to continue our conversation. It's during this time that I decide to finally stand up and walk around a bit. What was I thinking, it was fading? The head rush I get pushes the trip back into motion and I'm off in a rambling of words once again, Darin listening and discussing all the while. The stories I've already told spill out once again, I feel complete.",
      "Now we've gotten to the point where we literally have nothing more to talk about, because we had spend five straight hours continuously talking about everything. Again I feel the positive sleepy feeling, and this time I'm forced to give in to it, being immediately enveloped in a relentless frenzy of colorful dreams. As soon as I lay my head to sleep, I awake from the insane hallucinations being played over and over again like a projector on my eyelids.",
      "It's the morning. The dreams I had been having recreated themselves in my conscious vision. I feel afraid, but not in danger. I rouse myself from the sleeping bag I'm encased in, and a feeling of total relaxation and contentment surrounds me. This is the end of my journey. I'm a changed person. I feel...different. I have feelings of trust, feelings of love, feelings of admiration toward certain people in my life now, but it seems futile to let most of these people know about these feelings, because they're not ready to understand what they feel about themselves yet."

Some were eaten, some were given away, I ended up with about 15g of them left in the bag. I ate 7.5g one weekend, had a really intense, but great trip. Three weeks later, I ate the last 7.5g. To say I was unprepared is a mild understatement.",

As I prepare it, in the dark, I seem to be enveloped in a large hollow sphere which had tribal symbols swirling all over the inside of it in glow-in-the-dark color, and is closing in on me slowly as I prepare it. When I put the balloon to my lips, the symbols/sphere rush inside of me. I am wearing clothes at this time.",
      "T+0:30??: I am no longer wearing clothes. The lights are on. Why am I in the bathroom? More importantly, what's that sound? Suddenly, the memory floods back, sort of. I was laying on the couch, laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing... and then I had to poop, so I went to the bathroom, still laughing maniacally. This wasn't just a chuckle laugh, or a belly laugh. This was the 'I'm totally batshit insane and I don't care who knows about it' laugh. I walk out to my computer through doors whose frames are swirling about in mischievious ways.",
      "T+0:45: I only know this time because I looked at my chat logs, which show what time I dosed and was talking at (since I said it in there). My chat logs show me TALKING IN CAPS SAYING HOW I WISH EVERYONE COULD FEEL LIKE THIS with a lot of repeat letters. I remember not watching the keyboard because my face was down on the desk. I wanted to chew on something, so I just started chewing. It felt really good, so I got down and started chewing on the desk. I told everyone in chat about how awesome that felt and how satisfying it was to be 'eating the world'.",
      "Suddenly, a revelation struck me. What I was feeling at that time, this absolutely indescribable feeling of what I can only call 'CONTINUITY', was that I was riding the crest, that I was having all the fun in the entire universe, that the reason that there was so much suffering in the world, was because I was having all the fun. I started to feel really bad about the fact that I was just sitting there when I was having all the fun in the universe, instead of actually doing something fun, so I jumped up and down and ran around my crappy apartment until I got tired and laid on the ground. Through this entire experience I was chewing happily on whatever was in my mouth.",
      "Some time passed. I went to get up, and I couldn't move. The only way I could move was by chewing, eating. I had to swallow some stuff too. I was perceiving in 2 dimensions. This was very remarkable to me, and I wanted to share it with the world via my computer. So, I start chewing my way over there, along my floor, to the corner, where a little bit of the world leaked out of my mouth, up the wall, over the underside of the desk, and up.. ahh, there's my goal. I turn on the computer monitor, and realize my mouth is full. I should do something about it, and I figured that since the stuff inside my mouth was the same stuff as on the outside of my mouth, I would just exhale or whatever, right? I'm not sure if I've been clear on this, but all boundaries between myself and the rest of the universe had been crushed. So, I get rid of the stuff that's in my mouth, and then there's blood all over my monitor and desk.",
      "Wait, WHAT?",
      "So, there's blood all over my monitor and desk. At this point, I realize that it is coming from my mouth, and that wasn't the universe I had been chewing on. It was my cheeks. Or maybe they're the same thing, really. I get some paper towels and clean up the worst of the mess. At least now I can see what's on my screen without there being lots of blood in the way. The dirty paper towels are shoved down the garbage disposal. (I find those the next morning.)",
      "I stared at the time on the computer for about 5 minutes, perceptively. I knew that I wanted to know how much time had passed since I ate the mushrooms, and I could read the numbers on the screen... I could tell you the name of the symbol, but I could not tell you what time it was. I was rather freaked out, both by the blood and by my nonchalance in the experience. I mean, my cheeks didn't even hurt, how could they be gushing blood like this? At this point, I decided that I was immortal and went into the bathroom and started licking the electrical socket in there. A few seconds into this routine and it occurs to me that if this doesn't kill me, it will probably hurt a lot and be very unexpected, so I decided to do something much less unexpected... which brings me to the part where I beat the hell out of myself with a 4'x4'x3' post. I had a large number of bruises, cuts, and splinters when I got tired of this and started really coming down 45 minutes later.",
      "I smoked some pot after that and started to relax and think everything was okay. An hour or so later, I got tired, and went to bed.",
      "Now, I've discussed what I did to some extent, but I didn't really express what I was going through, or feeling in that time. A lot of that is because it doesn't bear being put into language very well, but I'm going to do my best:",
      "CONCLUSION",
      "==========",
      "Throughout this entire trip, I felt this endless momentum rushing through me, and I tried to focus on it at different times through the trip. What I perceived from the momentum is that it is not a single unit of momentum rushing at insane speeds, but the combined momentum of countless tiny little pulses. Each pulse would start out as near to nothing as it can get, and it would build and build and build to a shouting climax, after which it would ebb and recede away.",
      "That same sort of arc is the life cycle of every single thing in the universe, including the universe itself. It grows, and grows, and it may change in time, but then it starts to get old, and ebb away, and grow less and less, until it forms back into that whence it came, nothing. It is a natural phenomenon, and both to be parted from (birth) and reunited with (death) the perception of this universal particulate momentum is a joyous event.",
      "I cannot overstate how important of a discovery this was for me. I see reflections of that insight in almost everything I do on a daily basis now. I see it in the world power cycle of the United States, I see it in the birth of a child, I see it in a growing corporation, as well as in dying ones.",
      "We are all transversing the same wave in the universe, but we are all at different points on the wave, and thus seem incomprehensible to one another. We have laughing fits when we trip because everything is really so ridiculously simple that we don't understand then why we don't understand when we're sober.",
      "It's taken me a long time to organize this enough to write it, and some details have probably been forgotten since the experience, in August of '06.",
      "Oh... I almost completely forgot to mention the aftermath. Turns out I chewed my way about 2/3 of the way through the insides of my cheeks. Couldn't eat solid food for about a week and a half, and had to rinse my mouth with peroxide every hour or two or it would start burning like hell. The cuts, bruises, splinters, etc. all healed up fine by themselves. IMO, that wasn't stupid shit I did because I was tripping... I look at it as the price I had to pay to receive that insight. Worth every single peroxide rinse."

      "I ground 18 grams of Mimosa Hostilis root bark and 6 grams of Peganum Harmala separately in a coffee grinder. I then blended five lemons and added the pulpy solution to a stainless steel pot. I added the ground Mimosa Hostilis to the solution and began the boiling process. I lightly boiled the mixture for twenty minutes and then strained it through a t-shirt. I repeated the process two more times, each time collecting the liquid in the same container. After the third extraction I discarded the depleted Mimosa material and returned the cumulative collected liquid to the pot and boiled it down to a small, drinkable amount of liquid.",
      "I set up my trip area with blankets and pillows on the floor, some plants, including a small tree and a large selection of didgeridoo and tribal drumbeats music. I turned off the lights and lit candles. My girlfriend and I prepared the pre-ground Peganum Harmala into two equal piles of three grams, added each pile to a glass of water respectively and consumed. Fifteen minutes later, I ingested the equivalent of nine grams of Mimosa Hostilis in my prepared tea form and my girlfriend consumed approximately six grams. I immediately felt I had to vomit, which is unlike me, as I have a stomach of steel.   ",
      "We lay down on the blankets on the floor and relaxed as we waited for the effects to kick in. About 20 minutes later I began to feel brief, intense waves of psychedelic activity come over me. Poignant words like Love, God and Christ overwhelmed me as I shuddered at their outstanding profundity. At this point, I would momentarily lose sight of myself and ever so briefly lose my grip on reality. I began to think that maybe I had gotten in way over my head and that this could be a life changing experience. I remembered what it feels like to trip hard and although not at this point yet, lose complete touch with reality. I had a complete mental block. I couldnt remember why I had done the Ayahuasca.",
      "The effects elevated. The tree I had put in my room earlier was now methodically moving its branches, paralleled only by one prior mushroom experience, where I witnessed an identical display of trees showcasing their celestial dancing abilities. I could feel the tree using its strange energy to pull me, almost invite me to enter the DMT universe. At this point, the intoxication was strong and borderline frightening. I hesitated and closed my eyes, only to be greeted by intense, vivid closed-eye visuals of fierce animals with gnarly expressions, mostly big cats. One tiger-like cat with bright, almost electric purple tentacular rays of brilliant energy emanating from its body really stood out in my mind. I began telling myself, its okay, you can control this, you are in control, I turned to my girlfriend and told her not to panic, that everything would be over eventually, but to my surprise she was not experiencing the Ayahuasca to nearly the same degree as I was.",
      "A brief vision of an Amazonian shaman with a jaguar-tooth necklace helped me keep a grip on what sanity I had left. I said to myself, this is what the shaman sees, you are the shaman, you are the ayahuasca. Between the severe nausea, the closed eye visuals of fierce, scary, out of this world big cats and the tree formally inviting me into a universe of potentially endless possibilities, I did what had to be done - I turned over and purged my guts out!",
      "The purging lessened the intensity of my experience, but only enough to allow me to cope with my altered state of consciousness. I felt like my sense of self was being systematically broken down. We turned on some music and I laid back and closed my eyes. I took flight, not in a literal sense, but viewing Ayahuasca visions with my eyes closed is like being airborne somehow, like I am floating through other dimensions. I saw many fierce animals, including big cats, snakes and even for a brief moment, a Native American serpent.",
      "The music started to brilliantly influence my experience. I could feel the didgeridoo throughout my body, I moved to the beat. The frightening imagery ceased, and I was all of a sudden, floating in a magnificent room made of solid gold, overlaid with intricate, mosaic design. In the middle of the room, suspended majestically in thin air, was a giant statue of Buddha. I was overtaken by euphoria. The only word to describe this state was - bliss. Then, as quickly as it began, I was sucked in to the next scene, again seeing images of fierce gnarly big cats and some red and black snakes. Throughout this experience I must have used the phrase Oh my God! about fifty times to describe my state of mind, although it did absolutely no justice to describe the truly revolutionary thoughts and mind-blowing imagery I was experiencing. My mental block was lifted, now I remembered why I had done the Ayahuasca in the first place. Next stop on my cosmic journey was a bright white, infinitely serene celestial paradise I called bliss. I imagined what it would be like to spend the rest of eternity in bliss and it sent waves of giddy euphoria through me.",
      "I was really having some extraordinary, existential thoughts like, what is the nature of reality. We know as human beings that matter is made of particles, which are constantly moving and not solid. Using this principle, we know that objects we see and feel are solid, for example a wall, theoretically cant be, thus proving that the human brain creates a projection of reality that is not congruent with science. This proves that the human brain projects an image of reality that is not entirely real at all. With this said, the tree, which is now moving right before my eyes, could in all actuality be moving like this all of the time, yet my normal conscious brains projection of so called reality, doesnt allow me to see this phenomena. Reality is only a projection of the normal conscious brain, but in no way reflects what is really happening all around us.",
      "With my eyes closed again, I had a vision of overlooking a beautiful gorge with waterfalls on both sides, absolutely brilliant. I believe, had I not purged, the visions would have been so strong they could be conceived as real.",
      "I noticed at this point, that my thoughts had become so deep and complex, that I was arguing with myself. I would start a thought and then interject and begin rambling another opposing thought. It was as if different parts of my brain were in the middle of a heated discussion. My next major break-through thought was actually the answer to all of lifes problems. I remember it clear as day. The Ayahuasca had given me the secret to life and it is so simple. The answer to everything is - love. I realized for the first time in my life that love is the answer to everything and this filled me with immense joy and elation. I became giddy at the idea.",
      "The closest thing I can equate Ayahuasca to is death. During the experience I learned that the physical body is just a shell and Ayahuasca allows one to free themselves from the restrictions of the physical body and sense of self and venture into what I believe could be what the afterlife is like, if the two are not actually one in the same. One taps into something that is literally, larger than life. It encompasses all life, as we know it. It is like an infinite entity, a collective consciousness that is one. It is what life as we know it stems from, our origin the Earths origin. This entitative consciousness, whatever it may be, the Afterlife, the Logos, God, an alternate dimension, may be hard for just anyone to comprehend, but when you get there, it is like you are home. You dont wonder what you are doing there, or how you got there, it is like you are back in the womb with complete recollection. Ayahuasca taught me that there is no such thing as the self, the self is merely an illusion. Everything is one in the same and this thing called life is an intermission between birth and death. Birth is the acquisition of your physical body and death is where your physical body ceases to exist, it is where your soul or consciousness returns to this magnificent entity, similar, if not identical to Ayahuasca.",
      "The music was creating cultural imagery in my head that was most appealing. I wondered how Ayahuasca, and other entheogenic substances, seemed to be engrained with specific human culture. For example, Ayahuasca seems to carry with it images of jungle animals. Is this a product of suggestion? Does researching the cultural use of these substances before trying them influence your experience? Or do these substances create un-biased jungle imagery in anyones mind, regardless of cultural background, or knowledge of the origins of this Amazonian drink? These are certainly the mysteries of Ayahuasca and other entheogenic substances for that matter.",
      "With my eyes closed I saw vivid images of another world. A black salamander with pink splotches and a black frog with blue spots sat atop a vibrantly colored leaf in what seemed like an alternate reality that could be existing congruently with ours. These were no ordinary amphibians, they seemed to be from a very different, alternate reality or other dimension.",
      "The effects of the Ayahuasca quickly tapered off and left me in a state of cosmic awe. After some hasty contemplation I consumed my girlfriends leftover mimosa tea (approx. 3 grams)",
      "Ten to fifteen minutes later the effects began, starting with the now familiar nausea. I stared intently at the tree, which had been symbolic of the entire experience. I was convinced that the DMT spirits had used the tree to communicate with me. They were using the tree as a vessel with which to communicate an invitation into their universe. Again, the tree began methodically moving its branches, using its energy to invite me in the DMT dimension. Seconds later, an entity appeared, vividly, stable and unflinching. My jaw dropped! I turned to my girlfriend and said  Oh my God! I am seeing aliens! The entity looked almost identical to the stereotypical archetype of an alien, large cranium tapering down to a pointy yet rounded chin, only this alien was translucent. Its color was a transparent, yet vibrant, electric alien blue. At first, I was quite frightened and thrown awry. However, my interest in the creature far outweighed my fear, so I sucked it up and just stared in awe at this seemingly real tree entity. I stared at it and it stared at me. At one point, I believed I was possibly staring at myself in an alternate universe. Sort of like staring into an alien mirror and instead of seeing my reflection, having my identical alien self, stare back at me from an alternate reality.",
      "I was sober enough to be describing this to my girlfriend real-time, yet inebriated to the point that this so called hallucination seemed completely genuine. This experience went far beyond a subtle hallucination. It seemed real and shattered any pre-conceptions I held about the nature of reality  truly a mind-bending experience. ",
      "I am quite amazed at the amount of clear, concise, useful information I have recalled from this Ayahuasca session. It was really an amazing mystical experience and I feel that I am taking a great deal from it. I have been thinking about the experience since I had it around one week ago. I still feel very alive. Ayahuasca has lifted me from my boring, mundane pre-conceptions of life and allowed me to see that there is more to life than meets the eye. It has opened the doors of perception. To have a good experience with Ayahuasca, one must do one's research and put a great deal of time and effort in to preparation. This can be a very powerful substance and very frightening, although I did not experience this to its full capacity. Treat Ayahuasca with respect as with any entheogen and you, too, may get to ride the celestial highway.",

      "Ever since I smoked my first joint, I've always been very interested in drugs.  One thing resulted in another, and ultimately I had tried pot, shrooms, salvia, ecstasy, oxycodone, nitrous, dexedrine, and had combined many of the above.  One day a good friend of mine happened to come into the possession of some crystal meth, and being the person I am, I told him I was very interested in trying it with him.",
      "My friend had smoked it a few times before, and he demonstrated the appropriate method for heating the crystal to the point where it released smoke and inhaling it.  He took a big hit, heated it for me and passed it my way.  After a few big hits, I felt the amphetamine rush many people describe as being the beauty of meth.  The best way I can describe the rush is an intense adrenaline rush, but feeling very euphoric to take the edge off of it.  My heart started beating quickly, and I felt so alive.  Everything felt crisp, any sleepiness I had was gone, and I felt fairly euphoric.  After the euphoria faded, I was left feeling energetic, and everything felt unusually crisp.  The energy was nice, and I could see it being useful if I had to stay up, but it wasn't anything special.  Though it was much clearer than the kind of energy I get from caffeine, and less edgy.  The rush was very nice, but when it boiled down to it, it was just a powerful adrenaline rush.",
      "The experience was nice, but it was not something that I feel any urge to repeat.  The energy was nice, but it isn't worth the health risks, or the potential for addiction.  The rush was definitely a beautiful thing, but when all is said and done, it wasn't all that much better than some of the powerful rushes I have experienced already in my life that have been completely unrelated to drugs.  When all is said and done, it's just adrenaline."

      "I was reading up on the history of mushrooms this evening, and i came accrossed some information concerning the treatment of cluster headaches and migraines through psilocybin and LSD.  I have only eaten mushrooms 4 times, all in the past month.  I have eaten various doses of them, from a little over three grams, to less than to grams.  I have eaten them in various settings, from a concert, to a home, to a small apartment. The particular experience I would like to talk about was at a friend's home. We had blacklights on, and The Doors, the greatful dead, and some drum and bass house music is what we choose to listen to.  Two out of four people present ate mushrooms.  We had a good time.",

      "I experience terrible headaches of the migraine sort.  The only type of headache i have ever had are migraines.  I often pop my neck and back to relieve tension.  I find when i am on mushrooms that i am very easily able to pop my neck several times in each direction without any pain at all.  I'm not really sure this has much to do with anything, but I figure for research purposes, anything helps.  I will definitely keep track of my frequency of headaches since i have used mushrooms.",
      "I have found the last two times that i have used mushrooms (less than 2 grams of penis envy mushrooms) that i have had an eye opening spiritual experience.  I discovered a lot about myself, and I learned a lot about the world around me this past weekend.  To me, using psychoactives is a very rich spiritual journey.  I have had scary trips too, but in the balance of the universe, there is no positive without negative.  I want anyone who reads  this to be very careful and extremely responsible when using drugs of any kind, Take care of yourselves, and thank whatever God you pray to for these wonderful gifts he/she has given us.

      "I, when the coast was clear, took down all 3 pills (on an empty stomach) at a water fountain.  I proceeded to my first class mildly nauseous.  After about 30 minutes, I began to feel very lightheaded and nervous.  My surroundings seemed surreal...I almost felt as if 'I' was floating aimlessly in and out of my own body.  Concentration was impossible and I began rocking back and forth in my chair.  Shortly thereafter, I found my arms tightly pulled in front of my body and I was pinching my skin, completely disassociated from my entire situation.",
      "My pulse had quickened, and it was weak.  I became pale (as was recounted to me by fellow students).  I asked to go to the nurse, now becoming fearful of my own state.  When asked questions, it took me a very long time to answer (although it felt like a heartbeat to me) and it was hard to sift out unrelated thoughts.  I tried to avoid any incriminating evidence about my friend, who would readily be in trouble should they find out about the source of the pills i had taken.  I was severely nauseous now, in a cold sweat, and shaking.  I was sent to lie down and encouraged to sip on some orange juice, which proved completely useless and ineffective.",
      "I was kept in the nurse's office for about 3 hours, during which I mumbled to myself and had difficulty understanding my condition because of the hyperspeed state my thinking was in.  I was thoroughly convinced that I was going to die.  After this, I was interrogated by our principal.  I, due to a weakened state of mind, blurted out something about my friend.  We were both assigned a special 'drug' seminar.  In the end there were no repercussions as a result of my mistake, but I now have a heightened caffeine sensitivity.",
      "In the long run, the entire event was pointless because all that this dosage caused me was severe panic and fear.  There was definitely a 'high' of some sort, but not a favorable one."

    "report": [
      "I had been reading up on various RC's for a long time now, and at the end I decided that 2CE was the one I wanted to give a spin. From what I had read, it was one of the more 'difficult' of the 2Cs - but also highly regarded, and some even claiming it had the depth/intensity of LSD.",
      "After many months of waiting, my 2CE arrived, and then I had to wait for my scale to get in as I did not want to be eyeballing the substance.",
      "Initially, I was planning on tripping on the Friday, but events of the day didn't have me getting in from class until nearly 10pm, my friend was going to trip with me - but decided not to at the last minute, and I figured - its late, I'm getting tired, and if I take it now - I'll be up all night and be worried about keeping my friend awake, so decided to post-pone it until Saturday.",
      "At around 4:45, I measured out approx ~14mg of 2CE. My scale, I've decided - is not very accurate and it was a bit of a pain to work with. I mixed it in with some juice and down the hatch it went - no taste to note of.",
      "I finished watching The Prestige with my BF - he had decided to remain the 'sober sitter' for the evening. The movie was kind of boring and wasn't really into it, but still gave me something to distract myself while waiting for the come up. I wasn't sure if it was just excitement / placebo, but started to notice initial effects fairly quickly - but nothing overwhelming.",
      "As the 2CE started to kick in, I started to get a vague sensation of having 'a flue', mixed with typical come-up feelings of LSD for me. By around 6:00-6:30pm, I was feeling a bit burpy / gassy / nauseous, but not enough to make me feel bad or like I wanted to throw up. I did have a few thoughts of 'what the fuck am I doing to myself? Putting unknown chemicals into me to make me trip' and started to ponder on my drug-using habits a bit and the 'why am I so into this? Kind of things'",
      "At around 6:30, I decide to hop into the bath-tub, the nausea was starting to go away and I could still feel things rising a little bit more - but starting to taper off. I drew a hot bath, threw on some music and turned off the lights.",
      "The isolation and relaxation helped kick the trip into gear a bit more. I was finding it hard to find music I wanted to listen to. With Acid/Shrooms - pretty much anything sounds great, on 2CE - it seemed to be a little less forgiving I found myself going to stuff with more Rhythm/Melodies and 'flowing' sounds - the jarring mix/cuts/beats of some of the music I have didn't fit well with it. But, with the music that 2CE did work with - it worked with really well.",
      "I was not getting too much in terms of OEVs, but the CEVs were rather nice - saturated, not very neon, they had more of a geometric/fractal feel to them and didn't burst into full-on surreal scenes like what can happen with LSD. In the bath, I felt lazy, relaxed and had surges of erotic sensations - touch felt nice, and I just spent quite awhile swaying back and forth in the tub getting into the music. The peak had hit - and had put me into a nice place. Not as intense as LSD, but enjoyable.",
      "The mental aspects of 2CE were pretty interesting - I almost felt sober, but still in a bit of a psychedelic mind space. My mind could easily wander, but never felt as manic as LSD, or as thought-looped as mushrooms. I could bring issues to the surface of my thoughts, look at them, examine them, but not be involved with them. The best way I can describe it is as 'emotional detachment from logical problems in my life'",
      "I got out of the bath after awhile, and threw on a few layers of clothes and headed outside for a walk. I didn't walk for too long as it was damn cold outside, even when I had on flannel PJs under my jeans, 2 sweaters and a jacket, but it was still refreshing, and got myself lost in my music for a bit.",
      "Getting back in from the walk, I ask my BF to put on Drawing Restraint 9. The first 15 mins of this movie are BRILLIANT -- it was so cool to watch it, it was a visual treat for the eyes, and the rhythm of the soundtrack was stellar. Too bad that once the intro credits are done the movie loses steam and just ends up being 'bjork being weird' - I watched another hour of the movie then got bored of it just ended up throwing on some music for abit and laying on my couch relaxing.",
      "One thing I noticed during the trip, is now and then I would feel 'chalky' like I was just coming down from K. There was a bit of a dissociative feeling, which is why I think I could get that 'emotional detachment' at times - it reminded me of when I mixed LSD+K.",
      "Typically on LSD, I can have a hard time dealing with 'sarcasm' and end up taking things personally if they were meant to be just joking around. But, toss a bit of K into the mix - and I can take things better and joke around with it instead of getting caught up in the 'are they insulting me?!' type loop, and 2CE kind of reminded me of that feeling - that 'just whatever' and not getting all emotional over everything.",
      "All in all, by around 11pm or so I had felt 'pretty much' down - watched some peewee's playhouse, an episode of wonder shozen, then was in bed by around 1:30am or so - slept easily and fairly well, woke up feeling pretty much normal. No hangover, but also no feeling of being 'refreshed' like I do after a hefty LSD trip.",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed the trip and as a '1st dose' - seemed to be right on the mark. Nice to get my feet wet, not over-whelming at all, felt fairly easy to cope with. I'm curious to try for a higher dose next time.",
      "Some of the downsides I'd say though would be.",
      "- Feeling of unease during the come up, and some negative thoughts",
      "- Now and then, it'd feel like my head was 'clogged' - like a night after doing too much K",
      "- A bit of tension in the chest - but this could be a result of smoking weed. I've found weed + LSD, while it can up the intensity of the trip, makes my chest area feel a bit tight and can really feel it in my lungs",
      "- Duration seemed a bit short, this could just be a result of the dose. But, dosed at around 4:45, was not until about 6:30-7:00pm that I had 'broken through' the physical un-ease and got to enjoying the trip, and then it felt like that by about 11pm, I was pretty much down -- there were still some lingering effects / minor visuals / etc, but it felt more like after-glow residuals effects and not really 'tripping'",
      "Then again, the shorter duration can make it more appealing in some ways - as you may not want the long haul of an acid trip for every trip you do. But, I think I'm the only person in my circle of friends who wishes that LSD could last a few hours longer  Everyone else seems to complain that LSD lasts too long."

      "The setting is my dorm room. Its Friday evening. The door is locked to prevent any unnecessary intrusions, the lights are off. I have prepared a small crash pad, a doubled over blanket and pillow, on which Ill lie for the majority of my trip. In the background theres some generic trance mix playing. The window is slightly open for ventilation, as the room has a fire alarm wired to a central system, and Im sure that this going off would make for a very bad experience. Ive done Salvia Divinorum a couple times before, and its always been enjoyable, but Ive always felt that there was more to experience, and have chosen tonight to see if I can change that. Ive never had a sitter, which probably isnt the smartest thing, but Ive prepared the room to minimize the possibility of harming myself, and I feel comfortable with what Ive done. Ive packed a bowl of 20x non-standardized extract, acquired from an online supplier.",
      "Very quickly after the hit was taken, maybe 25-45 seconds, I can start to feel it. I position myself on the blanket. As I lay down, everything seems to be composed of flashing, bluish geometric shapes. Im not sure if my eyes are closed or open, but the room as it was no longer exists. My thoughts seem to repeat themselves over and over, I keep telling myself to let them know that Ive made it back. In the back of my mind there seems to still be a shred of conscious reason, but for the most part Im floating through the geometric madness playing out across my field of vision. My mind doesnt seem to be working the same as it did before. As I recover a bit, I realize that Im pressing my head against the pillow, and the back of my head is beginning to tingle. I raise my hand and it startles me. It takes a while for me to realize that it is my own. Slowly, as if it were my first time, I stand up, stumble over to my dresser, and turn on the lights.",
      "For some reason or another, I pack another bowl of the extract, fumble with the lighter, and take another hit. The harsh smoke, combined with my semi-conscious condition and trembling hands causes me to spill the contents of the bowl mid toke, and I begin coughing vehemently. Again, I collapse on the mat, but I dont reach the same peak, probably due to the bad tokage, just a rush of tingles throughout my body, and a melting sensation, what Ive identified to be the most common factors throughout my experiences with the substance. Im afraid for awhile. What if the people next door come over? What if someone saw me through the window? A car slowly drives down the alley outside, and I become terrified, before slowly calming myself down. I resolutely stand up, steady myself, and pack a third bowl, determined to reach a greater peak.",
      "My hands trembling, I set the pipe down. I was standing up, staring at the visualization on the media player on my computer. A tendril of drool runs down my lip, and I lie down, right before losing all semblance of consciousness. Im traveling through a geometric void. Echoing in my mind is an incomprehensible word. Although it is meaningless, and in retrospect I realize Ive never heard it before, at the time it seemed both familiar and commonplace. I then discover that I am not myself, but looking at my soul from a vantage point outside of anything Ive experienced before. I was contemplating switching to another form or myself, or another representation of self, I guess is the best way to describe it. It was clear at the time, however now it seems pretty cryptic. All of this was very visual, taking place in some removed, vast space, although everything seemed to be composed of intricate, grey, fractal patterns. After this, the experience seemed to climax, although I dont remember what happened then, aside from the pulsing repetition of the same unintelligible word. I think it was yeltres or something to that effect.",
      "As I returned to my body, which seemed to take hours (although clich, the perceived time distortion was this prevalent), I began thinking of my family and my friends with excitement. I couldnt wait to tell them about my profound discovery. Soon I realized that I couldnt tell them about it (theyre all unaware of my explorations with ethnogens, and wouldnt take it well), which frustrated me, but didnt detract much from the overall sense of euphoria that had possessed me. The repeating word seemed to take on a different form, and soon I realized it was actually the underlying rhythm of the track that was playing.",
      "By this point, I was able to stand, and paced about the room in excitement. Colors were more vibrant than usual, and moments seemed to congeal, as if each one were a painting, and I was viewing them as a series, like a slideshow. My hands had trails behind them when they moved. I enjoyed this for a while, still reveling in the euphoria left over from my trance-like state. Eventually I returned to baseline, aside from a subtle afterglow. I wouldnt hesitate to repeat the experience, especially after preparing my mindset and surroundings further to optimize it, and perhaps somewhere where I dont have to worry about smoke detectors or other people intruding. Definitely the most powerful psychedelic experience Ive had to date."

There's also a subtle feeling of being 'on my game,' i.e. increased sharpness/ adaptability. In general I feel like I can take on a lot more.",
      "I'm also finding that I can recall memories from my childhood with disturbing accuracies, down to small details, though I'm not sure if this can be attributed to the gingko. This continues on in my sleep, where I've been having vivid dreams about my childhood house, childhood friends etc. which is definitely not normal for me. I hardly dream at all, and usually can't remember my dreams."

It didn't even make me sleepy, and the bottle indicated 1 pill would be enough.  I did some research and found that when in high doses (> 1 gram) there is some mild narcotic activity.",
      "T+00:05",
      "I fasted for 6 hours and thought about how many I should take.  I decided to take all the rest (26) as it seemed like a relatively safe drug.  It has a really bitter, almost phlegmy taste.  I managed to get down all 26 without vomiting.",

Lying in bed was very comfortable, when I got up to get a glass of water, I felt like I wasn't really walking, like I was still in the same place.  It was a vaguely disconnected feeling, but nowhere near intense.  I also realized I was breathing slower than usual. When I finally feel asleep, I have very vivid, realistic dreams.  Kava + Valerian was a very subtle combination, almost unnoticable.  It wasn't worth paying for, but it's still an interesting experience."

      "Then again, I suppose everyone has their hobbies.  Some work on their cars, some follow sports, I like to see things and feel good.",
      "I don't condone intra-veinous drug use.  I believe that after the first real IV hit of a drug, one can begin to develop an affection for the needle.  After I injected OxyContin for the first time, I began dabbling with injecting every drug I could (with proper research beforehand, of course).  Pushing chemicals directly into my bloodstream is completely different than any other method of drug administration.  What makes it that way is simple:  the head rush.  A head rush is a damn hard thing to ignore, and once I experienced it, it was very, very hard to forget.  It lingers in the back of my head, even while I may be happily sedated on other drugs, I know that I've found the best of the best, and I feel like I'm wasting my time and money on anything else.  And thats how the slippery slope starts.",
      "On to my first IV experience....",
      "My friend and ex-heroin addict, A., picked up two OC's from Rochester, not far from my CNY town.  I had expressed interest in shooting up to him previously, and he ran me through the basics.  I agreed to shooting with him, as he had recently procured a clean 10-pack of 100-unit insulin single-use needles.",
      "He warned me that a whole 80mg dose of OxyContin could be dangerous to some first time shooters, so I told him about a time 6 months earlier when I had insuffulated 60mg of OC and drank a fifth of rum, and the worst that happened was vomiting.  Besides, I was gung-ho about it at the time.  I wanted my first hit to be memorable, I had no fucking idea.",
      "He broke my 80mg tablet of Oxy into 4 similar pieces and placed them into a spoon.  He then pulled 85 units of clean water into my syringe, and squirted it onto the pill.  Next, he cooked the pill with a Bic until there was some bubbling and a faint trace of steam above the mix.  In one motion, he crushed the cooked pill with the back of the plunger, and it squished down into the mix.  Last, he placed a tic-tac sized cotton piece in the spoon, and drew up roughly 70 units of liquid oxycodone into the syringe.",
      "I tied my right arm off with my belt, pulled it tight with my teeth, and let him spot the vein.  He inserted the needle head, pulled back blood to indicate a clean vein hit, and pushed the plunger down as I let loose the tie.",
      "INSTANTLY, I felt my first real head rush, and let me tell you, it was insane.  All at once, the tension in my body released, and I fell back onto a pillow, and stared at the ceiling, enjoying the incredible wave of warmth that surrounded my being.  It was as if God himself reached through the clouds and granted me total bliss, without any responsibilities or worries.  The world was suddenly right, and all of the suffering of humans no longer mattered.  I distinctly remember it as the most euphoric moment of my life.",
      "The Initial head rush stayed with me for about a half hour, followed by the easiest, most settling opiate high I have ever known.  Small things like smoking a cigarette, or taking a sip of hot coffee would intensify the euphoria.  Even vomiting (which I did on 3 occasions that night) brought the head rush feeling back for a little while.  I was laughing hysterically the whole time I was throwing up.  While music was enjoyable, I remember not really caring about my surroundings.  I could shoot OC and heroin in a completely dark and empty room and still have a blast. ",
      "That is actually the testament to the true power of shooting up drugs like OxyCodone and Heroin, the pleasure from the high is so intense that addicts are able to accept the fact that their lives are shit, that they may lose everything in the end, and not care.  They accept their lives no matter how ridiculous the circumstance, and just keep pushing and pushing to stash more, because the high is literally that good.",
      "That was my first experience with shooting up, in October of 2006. ",
      "Since then, I have put Cocaine, Morphine, MDMA, Methamphetamine, and Heroin into my arm.  I have even shot whiskey and sometimes warm water just for the act of using the needle. ",
      "I spent my student loans and scholarships real quick.  Then I dropped out.  Then I sold everything.  First to go was the iPod my dad bought me for Christmas.  Then my Xbox, games, movies, and even my baseball card collection.  Then I started stealing.  I'm still stealing.  My arms are sore and they look like shit.  I'm in the kind of weird junkie phase right now that would prompt me to write this, and think the last 5 months over.",

      "Up until experimenting with Salvia I was not a drug user at all on any regular basis.  No tobacco smoking, only the occasional beer and nothing else aside from over the counter antihistamines and pain killers.  About the best feeling I ever got from drugs was morphine during a hospital visit.  But that was because I was in genuine pain.  Although it felt incredibly warm and relaxing, like being back in the womb (I imagined), I had no desire to take it recreationally in the future.  Philosophically I am very much opposed to drugs being illegal.  That power junkies and control freaks would sanction what other people do with their own minds and bodies seems to me a gross hypocrisy.  However, I was still working from the perspectice that drugs were a risky thing that one should generally avoid if possible.  But not having taken drugs myself I felt it was important to see things from the drug user's perspective.  But where should I start?",
      "After reading about Salvia it sounded like something to try.  I am not a party person and something that allegedly lended itself to a quiet evening seemed right up my alley.  The other factor is the legality.  I would rather have tried marijuana first.  Even though it's absurd that any plant be illegal the fact remains that some are and the cops don't care about my personal political views when they're slamming me to the ground and handcuffing me.  So with salvia I could actually buy the stuff online and not worry about the State.  But the real reason is that despite the commonly held belief that drugs are everywhere and that pot is easier to get than alcohol for teenagers, I quite frankly haven't the first clue about where to get pot.  I'm 33 years old fer cryin' out loud, am I supposed to go hang around high school kids and ask to score some weed?  Are there shady characters walking the streets to get it from?  I haven't a clue.  Call me a backwoods bumpkin, but in my town the source for marijuana just wasn't clearly evident to me.",
      "I watched some videos online about Salvia, namely the Sacred Weeds BBC show.  This was excellent.  Instead of the usual image of drug users as a bunch of college-age goofballs acting crazy this was a bunch of stuffy scientist types in some posh English country manor waxing ponderously about drugs.  Much more my speed!  See, not everyone who does drugs needs to be an empty-headed frat boy moron!  It was possible that earnest, intelligent folk were also part of the picture.  This was the type of approach I was looking for.",
      "Eager to give this stuff a try I got all the equipment you need for smoking it and purchased some plain, un-enhanced leaves for starters.  The most objectionable thing was inhaling smoke.  My little sissy-boy, pink, non-smoker lungs just weren't used to this at all!  But I sucked it in as best I could.  Practice makes perfect, right?  The effects I would describe as dizziness and disorientation.  But where are my hallucinations?  Where is the profound connection with the 'spirit world'?  Where is the uncontrollable giggling and euphoria?  Where's the goddamn visual patterns and traffic reflectors!? Did I do this wrong?  Did I get bad stuff?  I felt completely disappointed.  At no time did I leave my physical body and go off on psychedelic trip.  No visual distortion whatsoever.  I was just really dizzy and out of it for awhile and then I went to sleep.",
      "So then I bought some 6x stuff.  Same deal there, except the effects seemed to last longer.  I would say that it felt like my body was being twisted like a large screw, but I hate to even say that because when someone else reads that it comes off as more impressive than it really is.  Who knows, maybe I have completely cocked this up.  Maybe my inability to keep a lungful of smoke in for more than 2 seconds is the problem.  I tried chewing some of the leaves but the taste is very bitter and awful.  What does a guy have to do to see one lousy hallucination around here?  I have tried it about four times in total and not felt any of the things I've read about or watched regarding salvia.  Not so much as a single laugh escaped my lips.",
      "The realization I came to is that the drug experience is only as good as the person taking it.  One has to have this fancy stuff in one's mind before going in.  My problem was that I expected drugs alone to provide the profound experience so many others had described.  Maybe it just doesn't work that way.  I must be too objectively minded for this to affect me in a positive way.  It also made me even more convinced that drug illegality is a pointless thing.  I can't imagine why salvia would be made illegal.  It seems that this drug at least, has no power to take control over a mind and offer otherworldly experiences, much less make the body do nasty, property-rights-violating things that might be grounds for illegality.  I doubt such a substance exists."

    "report": [
      "Background: I am 22 years old and experienced with LSD and Psilocybin Shrooms (More than 7 trips, less than 12. Can't really remember specifics, one acid trip 5 hits strong). I bought some salvia 20x extract (1g) and had smoked a little bit a few times before. Just enough to get some crazy visuals (open or closed eye) and some weird time distortions, but nothing earth shattering. I had started to lose respect for psychedelics/hallcuinogens because it had been a while since my last voyage into lala land and I had forgotten what it was like to be humbled. Anyway, one night I decided to take my vial, a bong, and a butane lighter/torch over to a friends apartment (in the same complex as me). There were about 5 or 6 good buddies there, and we took turns taking salvia hits. Well, I went last (being the provider for everyone else). Here's what happened, in 3 phases.",
      "Phase 1) Directly after I took the hit I realized that I had taken a much larger dose than I had ever before. As I started exhaling I could feel the physical effects kick in. I could also feel my mind start accelerating at warp speed. Suddenly, everything was black. The entire room around me had collapsed onto me and myself and all objects and people in the room were all one, but we were not a consciousness. More or less, I was perceiving the end of my universe, in which all atomic molecules had been infinitely compressed into one point, much like the universe is said to have been before the big bang. I was myself, and yet I was everything else in the universe also. Slowly I started to see again.",
      "Phase 2) As I regained my sight, I realized/percieved that I was laying down on a couch (though I wasn't actually lying down, because there was a friend sitting on either side of me). From my perspective, the couch looked like a piano and the 3 pair of legs on it resembled keys with the lines from the cushion segments and space between the people seated on the couch looking like the sharps/flats (the black keys). The world had a muddy orange tint to it that at the time I somehow associated with the original Super Mario Brothers NES game. My visual lucidity was coming back, and now I started to hear voices of the people in the room. I couldn't understand what language they were speaking, but I knew what they were saying: I was dead. I tried to lean forward and communicate, but I found myself paralyzed. I tried a second time and succeeded, but I had completely forgotten about the capability for speech. This is not to say that I forgot how to speak, but I had forgotten that verbal communication was even possible for humans to perform at all.",
      "I fell backward into the couch in dismay. My mind was screaming 'I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'm moving! I'm breathing. Please...don't let me be dead...' I felt the physical effects of the salvia, which for me is tingling all over my body which feels like little ant bites. All of a sudden, a more pressing issue hit my consciousness. Not only was I dead, but my crotch was on fire because I had dropped the bong and lighter onto my lap and I was burning. I leaned forward and looked, but I could not find the bong or the lighter. I looked on the floor near my feet, thinking I had dropped and broken it. I still could not see it. Falling back into the couch, I realized once again that I was on fire because I had dropped the bong onto my lap. Still, there was no bong. The friend who's apartment I was in leaned in real close to me and asked: 'What are you looking for?' It was the first sentence I had heard thus far that I actually understood as English. I widened my eyes and fell back into the couch, intimidated by his use of communications, and for some reason utterly confused as to why he was talking to me considering I was dead according to them.",
      "At this point I seemed a little more in control, but I closed my eyes and I realized that my whole body was not tingling because I was on fire, but because I was God's right arm, and it had fallen asleep. I opened my eyes and started to cackle maniacally internally. After a couple more minutes of looking around in utter confusion, I regained most of my lucidity. My friend had brought me a glass of ice water and asked me if I wanted to go outside. I did.",
      "Phase 3) I layed into a hammock that he had outside his apartment and we started to talk about my experience. As I recalled the events to him, I began to cry. I realized at this point that it was the scariest thing that had happened to me since one dream I had when I was a teenager (I dreamt that I was falling off a cliff, but instead of waking up right before the impact, I hit the rocky bottom and everything went instantaneously black. The dream still didn't end. I continued to dream the blackness without conscious thought but a sense of time for about 3-4 minutes. Then I woke up). While I was swinging in the hammock, I realized that I was having open eye visuals very similar to a level 3 experience on LSD. These continued for about 20-25 minutes after I went outside. I continued to cry, because I had never been so scared.",
      "All in all, Phase I and II happened over the course of about 10 minutes. I couldn't find the bong because as soon as I took the hit, my friend took it away from me but I didn't know it. The bong had been sitting on the table some 8 inches in front of my legs the entire time. I am very thankful for my friend, of whom I have the utmost respect for. I am also very thankful for salvia. I haven't smoked any since then, which was several months back, even though I still have about 6/10ths of a gram left. Without salvia, I may have lost my respect for hallucinogens and had to be taught the hard way (say over the course of a 12 hour acid trip). I'd much rather have 10 minutes of terror and a long time of reflection than have an entire trip of terror which could possibly ruin hallucinogens forever.",
      "Moral: If I am going to put a chemical into my blood and ultimately into my brain, respect it. Drugs can show me a great time, but they can also show me very ugly things that I may not want to see, but are forced to."

Theyll know what to do if something goes awry. I mean, Hell, theyre the ones that taught me how to do this junk in the first place.",
      "Dude, you good? Bills chuckling, looking over at me through bleary, weaving eyes. I nod, unable to speak. My eyes roll back in my head for a moment, and through the buzz of supersonics raging through my head, I hear Joe chuckle in that labored, breathy laugh I know oh so well.",
      "I fall. Not far, but I know Ive just lost control of my body functions for the next few minutes. I hit the carpet with a thud. Nothing to do right now except shake and orgasm. But this time, this time its different. Something subtle isnt right. I feel it creeping through me, a spoon-warmed heat-seeking missile about to hit my heart and disperse into a million million shards of ecstasy. Its like that every time, and it doesnt matter what any one tells me, theres no way I can capture it in words. This time though, this time, theres something extra along for the ride, something evil, something new.",
      "Bill laughs, a cigarette bouncing in his lips as he says something to Joe. I cant hear what it was, but theyre both looking at me, giggling. Sounds not working right now. The ability to hear should have come back by now. Im deaf, and I think Im starting to go blind, but I cant formulate the words. Im still orgasming, still exploding like fireworks throughout every inch of my body, still raging with fueled fires I have no way of extinguishing except by waiting for the fuels to burn strong, hard, bright and then out.",
      "My hearts doing something. I can feel it skipping. My skin is starting to crawl, but Im still blinding. Somewhere in the distance, I can hear Joe and Bill talking.",
      "Is he OK?",
      "I start to sweat. Ive been sweating all night, that part is normal. This new sweat is nothing like Ive ever felt. My whole body is wringing itself clear of moisture. I know whats happening now. I feel another pop. Im crystallizing inside, I can feel the crusty exterior of a hard candy shell about my person, and I realize I cant move. I open my mouth and cry out, not in ecstasy, but in sheer fear of the reality that has hit me.",
      "I think I just ODd. Im scared, but Ive got to remain calm. Ive got to keep my wits about me. Joe and Bill will take care of this, I know it. They wouldnt just leave me to die here in the corner of this shitty little one bedroom apartment in Kansas City. Theyll get me somewhere. I roll my eyes up at Bill, whos now standing over me.",
      "Fuck, hes blankin out, I catch, as Bill grabs at my eyeball and peers in.",
      "I cant hear Joe, but hes jumping around and moving about frenetically. The coke will do that to him after a while. All he can do is shake and move. Joes saying something, but I dont know. Bills nodding agreeably, and all I can do is watch whats happening from a seat way in the back of the movie theater of my mind. Ive lost control of my other body functions, and am just a guest in a dying shell.",
      "From the echoes of distance and time I hear the word hospital and I know Ill be alright. Bill rocks my head back, and I watch from my seat in the dark theater as he puts a pill in my mouth and rubs my throat until the involuntary action of swallowing is induced. He reaches down and pulls the needle out of my arm, recaps it, and throws it away. I watch from the darkness as my body is hoisted over Bills shoulder. Joes in a craze, ranting and raving about something, and the words cant go to jail ring out into the theater. I sense bounding, which I recognize as steps. Im in the back seat of a car, and its rattling down the highway. The lights of the city ripple past my vision. Theyre taking me to the hospital. I just have to hang on for a little longer.",
      "The city lights go dark, and my fear is amplified by my confusion. My head rolls up on the door handle, and I can see stars through a clear, city lamp-less night. Something else is starting to wave over me in billow rolls of grogginess. Something eerily peaceful. I think back to what we had that night. Joe scored the coke, and Bill brought the heroin, and my",
      "My creeping fear was starting to gallop as I realize what Bill had given to me. I had brought the Ambien for sleep after the nights festivities. I wanted to cry out, but a squeak was all that I could manage. Ambien was the most powerful pharmaceutical sleep-aid on the market. In a few minutes, I wouldnt be awake, and would be unable to awake for the next 8 hours.  It was a drug so powerful, once it hit, I wouldnt care about anything but sleeping.",
      "The car stopped. The doors opened. I could feel pressure at my legs and my arms. I was going cold. I could feel the heat leaving me through the steam of my chest in the cold of the winter night. Joe and Bill stood over me, talking. There was something digging into the back of me. They had placed me on a concrete bench of some sort, and were looking over me, talking and rubbing their hands together in the cold.",
      "Hospital? I said. ",
      "Through the theater, I heard Yeah, Mike, yeah. I felt the wave of sleep coming over me. I couldnt hold my eyes open any longer. I slipped slowly away. There was a sensation of falling a great distance. An explosion of cold forced my eyes open one last time. Cold water was everywhere, pulling me, turning my hard candy shell, cracking it in pieces. At this point, I really didnt care. I was just so tired.",
      "I closed my eyes and let the darkness take over."

      "I had heard that dramamine was an interesting and cheap way to hallucinate. After reading all of the stories on the site I decided to also try this over the counter pill. I smoke a lot of pot and drink a couple times a week, but that is the extent of my experience. With this in mind I decided to eat 6 of the pills. I chose the original formula and made sure I was well hydrated and ate a good meal beforehand. My friend and I both took 6 of the pills and since I knew that people tended to sometimes freak out on the dramamine we also had a friend there who was sober. I am not the type of person to take unnecessary risks.",
      "Approximately 40 minutes after taking them I felt a strong sensation of tingling in my limbs and my speech was slurred. It was neither pleasant or unpleasant, just weird. I sat down to watch television and that was when the drug became unpleasant. I felt strong waves of the drug come through my body and then suddenly I would feel sober. It was extremly difficult to walk and I managed to drop the one beer I drank all over my lap. After this my skin was very itchy and I had repeated sensations of bugs biting my feet. My scalp and face were also itchy.",
      " Talking was difficult because I felt like I was making sense, but my roommates would just laugh at me. They said I was 'speaking drammamine.' It is also important to note that although my roommate was sitting next to me, I could also hear him in the next room talking. Very strange.",
      " The reason I regretted taking the pills was the next day. I felt as if I had gotten the worst nights sleep ever. I had twitches all day and my scalp still itches. Loud music was unbearable and I felt nauseous and crabby all day. I am just glad I only took 6 pills and can only imagine what the hangover must have been for the people who took anything more than 10.  Just watch out for the fucking godawful hangover."

      "Yesterday was the last day of my vacation from work.  I had been planning on going snowboarding, but the weather on the mountain was terrible, so I decided to brew a pot of mushroom yerba mate instead.  I crushed up what looked like a little less than 1/4 oz. of shrooms into the filter of my teapot on top of some yerba mate, then added lemon juice to the bottom of the pot, poured hot water in and let it steep for about 45 minutes.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It tastes really good, and you dont have to swallow all of that indigestible fibrous material.  Ive done mushrooms dozens of times, and have eaten an entire 1/4 oz in the past.  I drank the entire pot within about a 10 minute period. ",
      "The psilocybin began to take effect within about 20 minutes, beginning with a sense of breathlessness, the familiar body buzz, and then increasing intensity of colors.  Soon after, I began to experience more intense visuals, with paisley and fractal patterns appearing in the carpet and the appearance of things (plants, paintings, etc) moving.  My stomach began to feel very uncomfortable due to the high volume of fluid in it, so I decided to sit and meditate while the water passed.  While doing so, my mind began to race.  I was starting to get very high, with incredibly intricate and vivid patterns appearing behind my eyelids when I closed them.  I began to fear how much higher I might get as the psilocybin contained in the water in my stomach was absorbed into my system, but was able to easily put that fear aside.  My thoughts raced around for a while, and I felt much better after having peed a couple of times. ",
      "After I released all that water, I felt very light.  I decided to brush my teeth, and found myself dancing around the lower level of my house while doing so.  After that I looked out the window.  The trees and other plants appeared vibrantly alive, and the clouds swirled and danced before me.  I had my face pressed against the window, simultaneously enjoying the sights, and the sounds of my fingers tapping arhythmically against the glass.  I then went upstairs and began dancing around, my body feeling increasingly fluid and light, and in sync with the rhythms of the world around me.  I was simply enjoying the music being made by the house- the sounds of air in the ducts, water flowing through its pipes, the compressor of the refrigerator all in perfect harmony.  I thought briefly about putting a CD on, and then decided instead to make my own, so I ran downstairs to grab my didgeridoo.",
      "I lay on my back in the couch in my living room and began to play.  I started out with a low hum, and worked up into a steady rhythm.  I soon worked myself up in to a frenzied state.  What came through me can best be described as a grand opus to the pure joy of existence.  It felt as if God itself was pouring through my being and pulling with it all my emotional, sexual, physical and spiritual energies through the instrument.  I could see the path of all the energies of my life- emerging through my mothers womb, traveling the path of my 27 years of life, all emerging in that one glorious period of musical creation.  With my eyes closed, I could see intricate patterns dancing to my music.  My mother was upstairs taking a bath as I was playing.  I hoped at the time she could hear me, but I really didnt care if I was my own audience.  The word awakening occurred to me as I was playing, which is what I decided to title the piece.",
      "After I was through playing, I just sat and stared out the window in a state of shock over what had come through me.  I had experienced a glimpse of pure unadulterated devine power.  I felt that my ego kept getting caught up in that power, and I needed to repeatedly let those thoughts go.  My thoughts began to take off in odd directions.  I began to think of my friend who is recovering from a bad gunshot wound.  Though shes recovering remarkably, and facing her challenge with more courage than I believe Ive ever witnessed, I became filled with sadness in thinking about her.  My thoughts wandered some more in fairly random directions for a while, and then my mom came downstairs.",
      "I asked her if she could hear what I had played when she was in the bath, and she said she could a little bit.  I asked if she minded if I played some more, and she said she did not.  So, I played some more, pouring the sadness I was feeling, as well as the joy and other simultaneous emotions I was feeling into the music.  After playing for a while longer, I felt the desire to build within me to share the music coming through me.  So, I strapped my didge on my back, hopped on my bike and headed for Drake Park, near downtown Bend.  At this point I had come down quite a bit from my peak, but was still experiencing some visual intensity, as well as the emotional and physical energy granted by the mushrooms.",
      "Once I got to the park, I spent over an hour and a half playing for the grass and the trees and the geese and the ducks and the sky and the occasional humans and dogs passing by, which brought me great joy.  I hope it brought joy to the other beings in the park.",
      "I feel so blessed to have had that experience.  First, because I made a quantum leap in my ability to play the didgeridoo.  Second, because I have gained the ability to express myself through music, something Ive never known before, as well as a desire to share it with the world.  Im excited to see what comes of that."

      "It all started when me and my friend (ill call him A) went on a random trip to burlington VT. We went in search of cannabis but instead we came to someone who told us he had 'foxie'. I have heard of this drug before and have always been skeptical of trying it but have always wanted to. I am a very experienced tripper and i would suggest that - at least 10 mg or up - anyone who tries this should also be experienced. Me and my friend got back home and we were very excited about this as we have heard so much about it. I went online to find out the best way to take this drug, and i came upon a post of someone shooting it. As sketchy as it sounds, and yes it sounded very sketchy to me, the report was too good to pass up. The following is my experience with 5-MeO-DiPT.",
      "0:00 - Me and A went to the mall thinking it would be fun to walk around. We shot 5 mg each in the parking lot and proceeded to the macy's entrance.",
      "0:05 - The effects immedietly kick in and the second we walk into macy's we are forced to turn around because the effects are so intense. I see colors, and the most noticable thing was the sound. A lady next to me was talking to somebody else and all i heard was 'waa-a-wa-wawa' me and my friend looked at each other and started dying with laughter because we had both experienced the same thing.",
      "0:15 - driving home from the mall was a very intense - yet fun but not reccomended - experience.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "0:30 - we arrived at A's house and decided to do a second 5 mg shot. Immedietly after i had a very intense rush of feeling and colors and it lasted for about 30 min before i went into a trip similar to LSD.",
      "1:00 - i feel now as if i am on MDMA, LSD, and cocaine, i feel great. i am tripping exceptionally hard but at the same time i have a clear head and i can think straight.",
      "2:00 - i now have alot less visuals but i feel as if im on ecstacy and this lasts for a few hours before the effects wear off.",
      "In conclusion, although i have never tried it any other way, as sketchy as it sounds i really enjoyed shooting this drug."

      "I no longer use nitrous, but when I did it was for four enthusiastic months.  I was in my mid twenties and teaching at a university, and I realized how incongruous and potentially retarded such dabbling could be.  Nonetheless, beercans and vaporized weed had become routine, and I wanted something accessible, intense, and cognitively interesting.  Psychedelics were difficult to come by, so nitrous chargers seemed like a good fix.  I preferred huffing them in a balloon (inhaling, exhaling back into the balloon, then inhaling again, recycling like this 5-6 times, or until it was enough) although I also used a pressurized canister intended for making whipped cream and/or sparkling drinks (if you use soda chargers, CO2). ",
      "The effects are well noted, though Ill offer a sketch of its more notable aspects: reverberations that slowly become tactile lead to a paradoxical sense that my body is pulsing organically while numb.  With eyes closed, a singular clarity relieves all pain, anxiety, or confusion even as I am in the midst of an utterly dis-associative state.  Moments of profound insight, though later unusable or un-recallable, often accompany a sense of synchronicity (dj vu, or alreadiness): as though Ive finally recovered a memory that has eluded me forever, yet all along that memory was simply the experience itself, now, in the present, memory and anticipation fused into a recursive continuum (if you wanna hear me get fancy).  Also, I definitely concur with the reported phenomenon of nitrous ghosts: frequently, the bodily and temporal disorganization was such that I would find myself as though in another room with other people, often unidentified.  I would come out of the experience with my eyes still closed, and upon opening them I would be shocked to find myself where really I was and that I was alone.  If friends actually were present, they often reported that I would be gesturing toward non-existent people while in the middle of the experience, and that they thought I was losing it altogether until they had the same encounters while on nitrous.",
      "Ultimately, other than the way in which it focuses me on utterly impossible modes of time, coincidence, and memory, nitrous can be very boring.  However, it is deeply, deeply relaxing, and without the negative experiences Im about to relate, I would probably still occasionally use it instead of alcohol.  ",
      "What went wrong for me was simple: foolhardiness.  I thought, Fuck it.  I can do this stuff and still think.  Lets see how far it can go.  Well, Not far, was the resounding answer.  On appx. 10 occassions, I would use 12 chargers.  On 5 occassions I used a box.  These nights were somewhat closely strung together and eventually it all culminated in a night of 2.5 boxes (I wrote a previous report called My Tinnitus which Ill be updating in what follows).  Ive never talked to someone whos done this amount, although Im sure there are many.  The things is, I need to be able to rely on my brain all the time, and if you know anyone whos done such an amount to cap off a week long binge, chances are they were less than eloquent about it.  Fortunately, Id read enough to know that taking in enough air while using a balloon is important, although not enough to keep oxygen levels stellar ",
      "To the point: tinnitus developed, which I thought was fucked up.  Then, after two weeks of ear-ringing, I went swimming, the pressure clogged my ears, and I found out that earwax build-up was to blame.  An easy cure, and so maybe tinnitus was a mere coincidence.  However, it may have had something to do with the nitrous use since huffing with a balloon leads to frequent, intense changes of pressure in the ear canal and that can promote wax build up.  Therefore, if youve done nitrous and have tinnitus, just plain get your ears cleaned by a doctor.  It helps a lot.  The safety of home cleaning kits is suspect, but Im sure they work too as long as you know what youre doing. ",
      "However, that was just a prelude.  After the wax episode, I called it quits with nitrous.  The minor scare of permanent damage made me cautious.  But then, I began to notice slight numbness in my extremities and an insane twitchiness and tremor, especially while falling asleep (FAR more pronounced than that jerking feeling you get as you doze off: the myoclonic jerk, as its knowna good band name perhaps).  It wasnt enough to derail my life, but it bothered me and seemed unhealthy and, more than that, reinforced an ugly idea that Ive struggled with before: that somehow, the damage Id done was irreparable and that, in being foolish, I deserved it.  That idea seemed so juvenile and puritanical that I was pissed for even entertaining it.  Still, I worried, blamed the nitrous, and decided to go after some B12.",
      "A short bit of reading let me realize that normal vitamins just werent going to cut it, and that what the nitrous had done (if the nitrous truly was to blame) was sort of short circuit the whole system by which B12 gets absorbed and used.  I suspect that I would need something like a B12 shot to reboot my system.  Still, lining up a shot with a doctor seemed tricky, so when I fond out sublingual B12 tablets (dissolved under your tongue) had been developed, I went for it.  The results were immediate and surprising (and certainly suspect as placebo effects).  Nonetheless, nitrous use, abuse, and recovery is a murky, superstitious area, and the fact that this worked at all was a blessing.  My twitching and numbness went away, and eventually I felt great.",
      "Im done with the gas."

      "Now the mindset. I have abstained from alcohol and ALL drugs for four months prior to this experience, and also quit smoking two months prior. In the four months leading up this I began exercising six days a weeks and have gotten in really good shape physically, mentally and spiritually. I run four days a week, lift weights three days a week, and do Yoga and Meditate everyday.",
      "Let me also say that my favorite feeling from my drug history has been either on opiates or MDMA, and I enjoyed them both a little too much in the past. I try to stay clear of them now except for special occasions.",
      "Now onto the experience. I've done Kratom several times before, but this time was special, I fasted for 18 hours prior, my last meal was around 9PM the previous evening. The day of, I went for a 2 1/2 mile run followed by yoga and meditation. I thought around 3PM would be a good time to ingest the Kratom.",

      "4:45 ~ Listening to music sounds like a really good idea right now. I put on a live Jerry Garcia Band disc from 77' and just lay on my bed really enjoying the moment.",
      "6:15 ~ Starting to feel back to normal, I still very happy though.",
      "Overall this experience was incredibly satisfying. What made it really magical was the fasting and the aerobic exercise, and the fact that this was the first time in four months I put anything psychoactive into my system."

I'm not sure of the purity of the material, so I.M. administration seems like not such a great idea ... What is a guy to do? well....",
      "One thursday while sitting around with A, having smoked some DMT earlier in the evening, we found ourselves wanting a little pick me to go dancing at some strange club downtown. I thought about what I could have lying about. my mood for the night was ok - a longtime friend passed away that day, but I try not to mourn those passed and realized a zany adventure is exactly the sort of thing he would have liked. how about some 2-cb? I suggest. I had two doses left, and it seemed like a good occasion, so we got down to it. After scraping it all up, about 40mg of material sat in a lump on the mirror. 'How you wanna do this?' I asked. 'Snort it?' A shook her head vigorously then produced an insulin needle, sans point. 'Ahhh,' I saw where this was going immediately. I got a sharp, removed the point. we inserted 60 units of water and the mass of 2-cb into a container, and after it was dissolved drew it up. 'Ok, here we go' I hadn't tried this method of administration yet and wasn't quite convinced. A went to the bathroom, came back. I went to the bathroom.",

      "at this point I lose all track of the timing of the night, but the roller coaster stopped going up and my body load levelled off really nicely by 10:15. after that, we ended up getting in a car with a designated driver who took us to a crazy downtown club with walls that changed colors and beds to sit on. It was pretty much the perfect environment for a 2-cb experience, all the people looked quite lovely. several more bowls of weed throughout the experience kept things on the warm and fuzzy body high side. I didn't do much dancing, but I watched silly hippies and suddenly it was 2Am, so we went home. I slept well, and felt fabulous the next day.",
      "Altogether, I feel the anal administration method is superior both to insufflation or oral administration. The effects come on in a strong, but not stupifying (a la insufflation) arch, and the duration lasts as long as an oral dose. The best of both worlds, though most people might want to scale down their amount as a 20mg anal dose felt more like a 30 - 35mg oral dose."

      "The first time I did 2c-i was mixing it in a shot glass of water and drinking it. I then went with some friends for what would turn out to be one of the most memorable days of my life. A true plus 4 experience.",
      "At first we just hung out at my friends house and listened to music, I did not notice any effects yet really. We decided to walk to a fast-food place and get something to eat, and on the way there is when I noticed the changes first. Cartooning is the word I use for it. Everything still has the basic shape and form as it would in an unaltered state of consciousness, but it seems as if someone has replaced the color scheme of reality with a color scheme of a 90's cartoon. This cartooning is pleasant to me, and I figure that the entire trip will be mostly visual alterations. Boy was I wrong!",
      "Anyways I ate the food we ordered inside the restaurant but then I got nervous that people could tell I was high so I left and my friends came with me. Walking back to my friends house everything was majorly cartooning and I started to get the first bit nervous that maybe this trip might have more left to it. We got back to my friends house and the music was turned on, the music blew me away! I had heard this song before but never had it sounded near as wonderful as this! Music really sounded infinitely better!",
      "The mental part of the trip really started to set in now. My friends decided to play some video games on the television, but I just laid down and watched. Mentally it was indescribable but I will do my best to try and explain. My parents had divorced and my dad was going out with a girlfriend who later became his wife. When I was in a normal state this didn't bother me, but now that I was high I was realizing just how much it mattered to me. I was having revelations left and right about all the aspects of my life and what I had to do to make things right again. The revelations focused on my family life but they covered pretty much every part of my life, switching from topic to topic in literal bursts of revelations, not aided by myself focusing on a specific topic but switching randomly back and forth between this and that in such a rapid and clear fashion that I got mentally dizzy from it. It was as if someone had taken a firework show, made it into a mental object, and set it off in my head. One moment a burst of revelation would set in about one aspect of my life and the next moment, just as the first revelation bloomed into full beauty and started to fade, a second one would blast off overshadowing the beauty and purity of the first but being itself beautiful and pure. This went on for what seemed like an eternity but I can not even guess at how long it lasted for.",
      "As the 'mental fireworks' started to not be as intense I suddenly got a strong urge to communicate. I informed my friend that I needed to hold his cell phone and he was nice enough to let me. Just holding the cell phone and knowing that I could be connected to anyone else in the entire world with a cell phone gave me an overwhelming feeling of belonging to the human race. I was a mere individual, but I was part of and could communicate with the entire group of individuals that had cell phones if I wanted to, and this meant I was more than an individual I was part of an enormous group of people. The theme of interconnection between me and the world lasted for a good part of the trip, when my friend tried to take his phone back I begged him to let me keep it for the night and he reluctantly agreed to.",
      "After my friends stopped playing video games we went back downstairs to my friends bedroom and the music was still fascinating to me. I got the urge to learn about peoples history and be told stories about them so I could figure out how all of our individual paths crossed in the universe.... forming a sort of three dimensional network where each line in the object represented an individuals path and it was interwoven into it...crossing paths with everyone else that formed the object.",
      "I asked questions about my friends older brother who had been sort of an idle to me in the past but who was unfortunately locked up in a rehabilitation center. My friend gave me a breif description of his brothers life and although I am sure it was a very basic description I felt as if I had total insight into his life. I felt a wave of empathy for him and everything he had been through. True empathy at that, I honestly felt his pain and shared his joy, based only on a short biography that his brother rattled off in a matter of minutes.",
      "Anyways I started to feel sort of sick and went to the bathroom. I locked the door and sat on the toilet with my head in my hands trying to comprehend what was happening to me. I looked at the patterning on the walls and it was rapidly moving and transforming into symbols which I imagined was an ancient Indian language for some reason. I realized that I had been too preoccupied with what was inside my head to realize that the visuals were intense!",
      "Thankfully I did not vomit and left the bathroom. My friends had called up some girls while I was in the bathroom and we were going to go to a movie together in about an hour. We decided to go to my other friends house so he could shower and get ready.",
      "My second friends dad and step mom speak Spanish with each other and I kept hearing them. It was freaking me out that they were communicating and I was unable to understand them. The feeling of not being able to fully communicate, to not be able to fully connect with these people in the same house as me filled me with sadness. I went to another room so I couldn't hear them anymore, and immediately cheered up.",
      "My friends kept talking and I was hardly listening, but I did hear them talk about one of the girls that was picking us up (I at the time did not know who they were talking about). They mentioned she was beautiful and how much everyone wanted to get with her, but that she would never have sex with anyone so it was a waste of time.",
      "The girls picked us up shortly after this. We had driven for about ten minutes when introductions were made. Upon being introduced to the girl they were talking about, I asked (In my intoxicated state) if this was the girl that everyone wanted to get with but who wouldn't have sex with anyone? After an initial grunt of shock we rode the rest of the way in silence. I got elbowed rather hard in the side several times however.",
      "Anyways we got to the theatre and watched some movie, I was paying more attention to the way the light reflected off the droplets of water inside my straw than the actual movie. My high quickly wore off and by the end of the movie I was near baseline, and utterly exhausted."

Blocks of hash sitting on a table waiting to be eaten or smoked. A bottle of jagermeister in my hand and countless women surrounding me. I was in my happy place. Not just imagining it...I was in it. All the bad things I had heard about getting morphine were eliminated. I cant recall it completely but I was then put to sleep but I remained in my happy place. When I awoke it was a feeling of drunkness. Extreme drunkness. I am not an abuser of any narcotics but whenever I need surgery i ask for morphine.

      "I first became acquainted with this drug after a visit to the doctor complaining of chronic back pain. I know how ridiculously hard it is to get any opiate from American doctors so I expected some naproxen or ibuprofen. He gave me tramadol instead and I thought it was just some generic celebrex. When I learned it was a synthetic opioid I was pretty excited, I should admit I have a bit of an addiction to Vicodin.",
      "I got home and after some research decided on 100mg. The effects took very long to come on, nearly an hour. I would have to describe the most overwhelming feeling of this drug as warm and tingly. Unfortunately I experienced no euphoria as with traditional opioids, however it wasn't an unpleasant feeling, just not a 'high' like I'm used to.",
      "I will say that it lasts a heck of long time, 8-10 hours, and is very great at reducing withdrawal symptoms from opioids like vicodin, etc. That is the only reason I keep it on hand. It's similar to methadone, in that it provides a numbing long lasting opiate feeling that hides the nasty withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, as I found out later, tramadol has some withdrawal syptoms of it's own, but I found them to be much more manageable than the restlessness, anxiety and fatigue from vicodin withdrawal."

      "I have written trip reports using another name, but this will be my first report that makes use of the Tryphen name. This trip report is more of a summary of my experiences with 2c-t-2 than a trip report per se. Anyways, I like to start trip reports by mentioning a little bit about myself. I am a male and weigh approximately one hundred and sixty pounds. I have extensive experience with drugs, especially psychedelics. I have used over ten active research chemicals and also several stimulants, narcotics, and ethnobotanicals. The total amount of active substances I have used for the purpose of getting high is somewhere around twenty-two. Not much compared to some people, but enough to allow me to make comparisons with 2c-t-2 in an objective fashion (at least in as objective a fashion as can be done when comparing psychedelics).",
      "The first time I used 2c-t-2 I was fourteen years old. Since this time I have used 2c-t-2 countless times, using batches from several different sources. I would estimate I have gone through approximately 5 grams of 2c-t-2 in the past four years, but this is just an estimate as it may have be off in either direction by a gram or so. I have taken 2c-t-2 orally, nasally, by smoking it and by injecting it. I will write briefly about the effects of 2c-t-2 in general, and then I will write about how the various methods of administration and various dosages affect the experience.",
      "The effects of 2c-t-2 seem to be fairly heavily influenced by dosage, I notice a sort of plateau system as with DXM but not as well defined.  Effects at lower dosage include a general feeling of peace similar to euphoria but not really the same. Euphoria is a word I use to describe extreme pleasure, the peace I get from 2c-t-2 is more relaxed than extreme.  I also notice a mild increase in color brightness and definition, mild tracers and the impression that patterns are shifting or changing the direction they point. At lower doses I dont notice many negative effects, but sometimes will get slight nausea, muscle tension (including jaw clenching) or an uncomfortable body load.",
      "At medium doses it is pretty much the same effects as at lower dosages but more defined and with a bit of a twist. Feeling of peace bordering on what I can only describe as a light Euphoria (although saying you can have light euphoria is sort of contradictory to my above definition of Euphoria as being extreme pleasure, I can not think of a better way to describe it).  Colors are much brighter and more defined, tracers are stronger and patterns morph and shift much more. Sparkles and sometimes a shooting star type phenomenon sometimes occur in thin air (similar to the fractals of 4-aco-dmt but very different at the same time).  I notice some time dilation at this point, but nothing near the amount it is on 2c-e.  I also notice a change in depth perception that is very pleasant to me. I normally dont notice space between myself and an object as existing as something on its own, I usually just notice the items in the line of sight in front of me and how far away they are. On 2c-t-2 I am more aware that the empty space separating me from the objects in front of me is an object on its own. Objects farther away seem to have more detail than they usually will, and my vision seems to focus on a larger area.  Really hard to describe in detail but 2c-t-2 creates a very unique visual atmosphere that I have never experienced off any other drug.",
      "2c-t-2 tends to increase aesthetic appreciation in all doses. At lower doses this is mostly due to the color enhancement, but in medium doses it is an effect of its own, enhanced by color intensification but not dependent on it. I see all things as very beautiful, especially nature related objects. Trees in particular seem breath taking. At higher doses the effect is about the same as it is in medium doses, but I will talk about 2c-t-2 in higher doses later on.",
      "Medium doses of 2c-t-2 also tend to create a feeling of trust. I have on occasion said things to people while under the influence of 2c-t-2 that I would have never told them otherwise.  It opens me up emotionally and simultaneously lowers my social inhibitions, similar to alcohol but with out the dissociative / clouded head effects alcohol seems to have. This can be utilized as a benefit when working through things with people, but it can also be bad if you end up saying something to someone that you dont want to. It is an effect that is not really present in lower dosages but becomes most realized in medium doses.",
      "Music appreciation also starts to become more apparent in medium doses. It is not a very strong effect as compared to some drugs, but it is most definitely real. In lower doses 2c-t-2 tends to not have a huge deal of effect on music (although maybe it has some slight change in the way music is perceived), but at medium doses the effects become much more apparent. 2c-t-2 seems to be more focused on making visual stimuli seem beautiful than it is on making music more beautiful. It is more of a bonus effect than something to concentrate on, at least in my opinion.",
      "Although the positive effects of 2c-t-2 become more defined at medium doses, so do the negative effects. The first time I took 2c-t-2 my only prior drug experiences had been dextromethorphan and marijuana, and the first part of the trip was very nauseating on the border of painful in my subjective opinion of the time (Of course I was comparing it to DXM and weed so had I taken it later in my chemical using career it would probably have been a different conclusion). For some reason the come up was only like this for me the first time I used it, but I still feel the need to include this. Many people have reported that 2c-t-2 has a very heavy body load but in my experiences (minus the first time) it is not really that bad, especially compared to other drugs (higher doses of 2c-e make me just as sick feeling, 5-meo-dipts come down is just as bad as 2c-t-2s for me, 5-meo-amt is by far the more unpleasant experience as far as body load goes).",
      "The negative effects I do notice consist of nausea and intestinal disturbances (gas usually) and muscle tension for the most part. I get tremors in my legs often that are fairly annoying but not painful. The body load is not always pleasant and can get to be pretty annoying, but it isnt as horrible for me as it is for some people. The negative effects at a medium dose are much less than they are at higher doses, but I will get to that in a bit.",
      "At higher doses (for me I consider ~40 + to be a high dose orally) 2c-t-2 seems to take on a very different personality. It is without a doubt disassociating (for me anyways) at higher doses reminding me vaguely of a psychedelic version of DXM. I become fairly cold and this often frightens me adding an edge of fear to the trip. I also become very sloth like and dont feel like moving much, I often will just lie in my bed with a blanket covering me and my eyes closed, usually questioning why the fuck I would choose to do this to myself. The come up is very disturbing, I often get nausea (fairly bad nausea actually), intestinal disturbances (gas mostly) tremors, muscle tension, an uncomfortable body load, feeling of being very cold, paranoia and confusion. One time when I took a higher dose of 2c-t-2 I kept coughing up very thick phlegm and was having what seemed to be difficulty breathing (possibly psychosomatic?), but it is worth noting I had just gotten over bronchitis (although the 2c-t-2 seemed to revive it and also make it worse for the duration that I was under the influence of it.) I have since done some research on 2c-t-2 and found a reference to a study done on 2c-t-2 in rats that shows it may perturb the immune system. This was found on a government website however and they are known to be liars. If anyone is interested in reading this report do a Google search for 2c-t-2 perturb immune and it should not be hard to find the website it is hosted on, I would give the link but am unreasonably paranoid. Needless to say, the negative effects of higher doses of 2c-t-2 are much worse than the negative effects are at low and medium doses.",
      "I have had very dissociative effects at higher doses. I have had the impression that I was on a space ship inside of my body, for example. A friend of mine has had a very similar experience off a high dose of 2c-t-2, he was in a car (not driving) and kept thinking he was on a spaceship. Knowing this may have had a large impact on my similar spacecraft experience. The dissociative effects are not exactly comparable to DXM but the best way I can describe them to someone that has never used 2c-t-2 is Sort of like DXM with a psychedelic twist, but at the same time not. Very shitty definition but it is hard to describe some of the effects of psychedelic drugs, especially when they go beyond color intensification and tracers.",
      "The dissociative stage of high dose 2c-t-2 seems to last for a while and then fall down over a period of time into effects more similar to what one would imagine a high dose of 2c-t-2 to be like. Good color intensification, more attention paid to details, modified depth perception, complex patterns rising out of no where, patterns morphing and twisting, very strong tracers, more noticeable increase in music appreciation but not significantly more than a medium dose, time dilation is increased as far as positive effects go. Negatives are, Nausea (although not as bad as during the come up of a high dose trip), muscle tension and slight exhaustion, tremors, uncomfortable body feelings, intestinal disturbances (gas usually), possibly still a bit of a cold feeling. I also notice memory loss from what happened at the dissociative stage, for example I once came back to my bathroom to find I had sprayed shaving cream all over the place while in the dissociative stage and taking a hot shower.  I only had a vague recollection of actually doing this, I imagine I may have forgotten other things also.",
      "Ok now that we have the general effects out of the way I will briefly mention how the various methods of administration change the trip. These wont be in as much detail as the above descriptions are, but will still give a general feeling.",
      "Orally 2c-t-2 takes longer to set in than any of the other methods, I have heard reports that it sometimes takes up to two hours but for me it is more like one hour give or take a few units of time (I never really timed it but this seems more close to correct than two hours does for me anyways). The come up is smoother than the other methods, but it produces much more nausea. Effects last longest this way, and the trip really seems to have less of a speedy push and more focused on smooth visuals.",
      "Insufflated 2c-t-2 comes on almost instantly for me, and I have never seen it take longer than about a minute for someone to start coming up. It Peaks fully in about ten minutes give or take a bit. Snorted 2c-t-2 *fucking* hurts (pardon the language =P). It burns very bad and the drip is horrible, similar taste to the smell of fertilizer in my opinion.  The trip lasts for a shorter duration and has a much more speedy push to it in general, much more stimulating effects. Seems to me as if it is a good deal less visual for some reason (perhaps the smaller doses dont fully allow for as much of a visual disturbance) but much more of a stimulating trip. Seems as if muscle tremors and tension may increase slightly as compared to the oral method, but the nausea is a good deal less (especially at first). At least in general.",
      "I.V. Injection of 2c-t-2 is very similar to snorting it. I have only done this a few times and each time I did it was on the same day. I was very disappointed actually, I had read a wonderful trip report regarding injected 2c-t-2 and was hoping my trip would be similar. It was not at all similar even though I injected it a few times with in the same day. It was a lot like snorting it but with out the burn and drip. It was a bit different than a regular snorting trip, but only in small ways. It seemed to be even less visual than snorted 2c-t-2 (again leading me to think this is because of the smaller doses) but was more stimulating than oral (pretty close to snorting). I think that shooting 2c-t-2 is pretty pointless the only real benefit I had was that it didnt burn my nose, besides that it was pretty much the same as snorting with a bit less visuals. I dont remember my doses, but it should have been enough. And if you ever shoot up 2c-t-2, I suggest that you start VERY low just in case, as I have read trip reports where people had very incredible experiences. Maybe I we (my friend is the one that actually injected me) did something wrong, I have never been shot up with anything else before. Worth noting is that the next day I had a large bruise on my arm, but this may be due to a physical altercation I had gotten in and not the 2c-t-2 itself.",
      "Smoking 2c-t-2 I used as more of a booster where I would smoke it after snorting it. I have smoked it with out snorting it before however, and it gives minimal effects, although noticeable. When smoked alone 2c-t-2 gave me some color intensification, some tracers a bit of a relaxed stimulation (hard to explain and could have been a placebo effect?) and that was about it. When I smoked after snorting it seemed to help make the trip a bit more visual. I have heard reports that smoking 2c-t-2 could cause cancer and have read one chemists reasoning behind this, but I think his logic was flawed. I am not a chemist though, nor a doctor, nor do I have any experience with cancer causing substances (other than consuming them when I smoke). Although I think his reasoning was not entirely solid it was enough to make me decide that I will not be smoking 2c-t-2 anymore. The possibility of greatly increasing my chances of cancer more than I already do by smoking organic material is not worth the weak effects that 2c-t-2 gives me when smoked.",
      "Well I hope this little report helps someone out. Remember that everyone has a different body and that some of the effects I get you may not and you may get some effects I do not get. One of my friends gets aural hallucinations from 2c-t-2, something that I have gotten to a degree but with no where near the frequency and intensity that he does. Different people are affected differently, some people get very bad body loads others get not hardly any. 2c-t-2 really seems to have different effects for different users more so than most other phenethylamines do.",
      "This is by no means a full account of 2c-t-2. If I was to write every detail I know about the effects of 2c-t-2 or I was to document my entire knowledge of this drug and my experiences with it and people that use it, I would be able to write a book. This is all just a general analyses of 2c-t-2, worth reading but not the sole authority. Always read as many reports as you can before you trip, negative positive and summary alike.",
      "I have been involved in the research chemical scene for four years and it has done wonderful things for me and my life. I honestly believe that these chemicals can help just about anyone, (or at least offer entertainment to just about anyone, if that is what they seek), but if not respected they can have dire consequences. Please respect all chemicals you consume and be safe!",
      "One last note: Try taking it on an empty stomach and after having used the bathroom, it really seems to help for me.",
      "Best wishes to all and thanks to everyone that has helped me and supported me and been my friends."

      "You are experiencing the drugs? best (basic) aspects. Extreme empathy towards virtually anybody (I recall generating tremendeous affection for a cop who was shutting down a desert rave that I was attenting), the sense of utter physical relaxation (so calming indeed, that even as a avid smoker, I prefer breathing fresh air over filtered smoke), a cozy sense of space (that can lend the warmth of a swiss ski hut with a fireplace to a vomit-littered back alley in hollywood) and the peak perception of both sensual (touch, smell) and artistic impulses (music, art, nature).",
      "Now, in addition to (and usually as a consequence of) all those lovely things, one can feel overcome by a most beautiful sort of sexual feeling, reaching far beyond the basic animalistic lust into a realm of physio-psycological lust. It could be described as an urge to be ultimately close to someone, to exchange each others bodily fluids in order to understand the essence of what makes them and yourself so human, so beautiful and complete. This is not a race for orgasms but rather the pursuit of lasting and sustained erotic waves.",
      "These moments are so exquisite that they can outlast the effects of the MDMA. So even though there might be melancholy tied to the gradual fading of that wholesome feeling, the essence and beauty of it all seems to prevail and help you through the inevitable next-day dumpiness.",

I take better care of myself, do plenty of sports, loving it, I also use more vitamins in conjunction with the drug, as well as 5-HTTP. I typically take the e in the afternoon, and I will sleep during normal hours thereafter. All this should help to improve my trips, but it doesn?t. Off course, I still enjoy doing e, but either I don?t get sexually excited anymore or I will be too knocked out to be able to do something about it, even if I DO have erotic thoughts.

      "Did I Eat Morning Glories or Ecstasy/Shrooms!? Haha...here we go...",
      "I purchased 114 grams of Heavenly Blue seeds online ($20) from a site that says their seeds are 'organically grown and harvested, untreated seeds'. I read a ton of reports about Morning Glory seeds and decided it would be best to buy seeds that I knew for sure were untreated, since alot of the ones you purchase at stores are treated with poisons and other chemicals. I'd like to make a note, seeing as how no one really seems to have had a completely similarly flawless, nausea-free experience as mine with strong MDMA/shroom-like effects. So I believe that anything in my preparation, or anything relating to things I had done on previous nights should be taken into account. For example, 2 nights before I took the Morning Glory I tripped really intensely on DXM. Also, it could be something as simple as me using spring water, instead of tap water, or organic seeds, etc. that caused such an amazing, mind blowing experience. So I think that should all be taken into account.",
      "I used the water and alcohol extraction method mentioned in the MG FAQs. I counted out 250 seeds, and used an electric coffee/pepper grinder to grind them up completely. Then I poured it into a jar, added some spring water, and shook it up really well. I set it in a cold place near my balcony where it's very drafty and almost like a refrigerator and shook it up every now and again for a few hours. I noticed that the seed pulp seemed to absorb most of the water I added, so I added some more spring water, and shook it up again. The jar, which was about the size of a regular peanut butter jar, was just under half full. I had planned on letting the seed pulp sit in the water for a day or two, but after several hours I became impatient and decided to strain it.",
      "At first I tried using a coffee filter, but the mush was just too thick to go through. I tried this twice, and was quite sloppy, probably losing about 20 or so worth of the seeds. I became impatient and decided to try a very fine wire mesh strainer that we had sitting in the kitchen. This seemed to work perfectly. It let the thick dark liquid drain through, yet kept out the solid seed mush, which I then discarded. I took the thick brown liquid that was left and poured it into an aluminum (or tin or whatever) cheap baking tray. I let the liquid spread out evenly, set it on my floor and placed a fan to blow straight onto/across the liquid.",
      "I thought it would take alot longer to evaporate than it did. It was only a few hours later that I noticed that the liquid had turned into a very thin flaky layer that covered the pan. It was alot like dead dried leaves but more delicate. Once it was all completely dry, I very easily picked the dried flakes off the pan and placed them back into the now clean jar. I then added a few shots of 100 proof Vodka and shook the jar up really well and again let it sit in a cold place. I had read that you should drink the mixture with the alcohol at this point, but I was in no mood to drink any 100 proof vodka, so I decided I would let the alcohol evaporate. So after several hours I poured the contents of the jar back onto the now clean flat pan and again set a fan to blow across it so the alcohol would evaporate. It became dry even quicker this time, in just a few hours. By now it looked like a heap of dry dark brown corn flakes. I let it sit out for a whole day, until I was ready to take it that night. So the entire process of preparing the seeds only took about 24 hours. Then on the second night, I ate them.",
      "I took the little pile of brown corn flake looking stuff and put it in a glass and mashed it up a bit with my spoon, because there were still some big flakey leafy pieces. I mixed it with some water and an emergen-C, which is a little packet of powder like kool aid that fizzes and has a ton of vitamin C in it and other vitamins and such. I had also taken a flintstones vitamin before hand =P gotta love those, cause I wanted to make sure I had plenty of vitamin C. As I was drinking/eating my glass of pink fizzy brown corn flakes (so odd haha) I right away noticed a tingling feeling in my mouth and teeth. I figured this was a good sign(I was right). I consumed the mixture at 8pm.",
      "Every single trip report I read talked about nausea and vomiting and I was a bit worried about this, so I smoked some really effing amazing weed and just chilled out and played Kingdom Hearts. After a half hour I really began to notice some effects, definitely felt something coming on. An hour later, around 9pm I had that definite coming up acidy/shroomish feeling. My palms were sweaty and wet, but not in a bad way. My whole body tingled. I felt really happy and my eyes were slightly dilated. Not once did I even feel a tiny hint of nausea.",
      "The effects I was experiencing were growing and growing. By 9:45pm I was extremely happy and talkative and wished I was doing this drug with friends because I wanted to talk sooo badly. Then at 10pm, WOW, suddenly I was rolling my ass off. Ok, now you might think this sounds crazy. But I've done ecstasy many many times, and I've done shrooms several times, and acid only twice, but I KNOW what they should all feel like, and this was just bizarre. It felt exactly like I had taken some really great MDMA and by 10:15pm my pupils were enormous and I even had eye wiggles! I was astounded. I was texting my friend who I used to roll with all the time because I was like, in shock but loving every second of it. The music was orgasmic, all I wanted to listen to was trancey type music, and not only could I hear the music but I could see it and even more so, feel it running through my veins like a drug. It was awesome. It was like rolling with the extreme feel good happiness, but without the whole 'lovey-doveyness' which was replaced by a shroomish clarity and a high (I think I had smoked a bit more by then) anaylitical extremely lucid state of mind. It was like all the awesome parts of rolling/shrooming/frying all at the same time!",
      "Between 10:15 and 11pm it was more of the shroomy/highish feeling that took over and I was listening to music, feeling amazing, and thinking about everything and having some closed and open eye visuals. I spent a good deal of time staring at the visualizer on my computer, it was amazing. At this point I discovered the theory of relativity and figured out how to manipulate time. I was able to slow down and speed up time. That was extremely trippy. I'm not even going to begin to explain it because it would take a year.",
      "Then at around 11pm the 'rolling' kicked back in, and I mean full swing! I spent the next few hours, until around 1am, listening to music in bed naked and well, yeah, rolling *wink wink*. Again. Amazing!! I think because I had such awesome weed that when I would smoke the drug would change courses over the period of the night between acidy, shroomy, and rolling MDMA (ecstasy whatever) feeling. But it was sooo fun because I never got bored with any of it!! All night long, every single thing I did was even more amazing then the last thing. I never ceased to be amazed and was in a constant state of awe and excitement haha.",
      "After I had had enough fun with myself, I also discovered that it was great to wander around and at one point I stopped to smell a scented cupcake necklace that I have. I can't even describe it. It was like the greatest thing I had ever smelled, the scent traveled up my nose and dispersed throughout my entire body and then filled my head with the most amazing visuals. So I decided I wanted to smell more things! I scent my own jewelry, so I have a box of fragrance oils and I grabbed the box and just sat in my bed opening and sniffing each smell lol. Each one was like an explosion in my head and an orgasm at the same time. After doing this for a little while I noticed that the smells were making me hungry and I noticed that my tummy was rumbling. I decided that I was hungry as hell and I couldn't wait to eat!",
      "So I ventured down to the kitchen and put together the oddest little plate of food I've ever made haha. I discovered that shocking my senses was insanely cool and amazing so I cut a little piece of cheese, a slice of roast beef, a dab of whipped cream, a vanilla wafer, a tiny scoop of apricot jam, a cracker, and a dab of canned garlic!!! Haha. I found out that the weirder the tastes/smells I could find the better! So I took the tiny plate of oddly assorted foods to my room, and my god that was the best plate of food I have ever eaten in my entire life. After each bite of anything I took I think I let out little gasps of joy lol. It was fun as hell. I would mix things like the garlic and the apricot jam on my finger and taste it. It was soooo bizarre but so amazing.",
      "After that it was around 3am and I was still tripping just as hard as I was hours before and I was starting to get sick of it and thinking, haha, ok, I'm ready to come down now! But the drugs certainly weren't ready to stop. I was so awake and tripping so hard, so I smoked quite a bit of weed hoping that it would make me tired. But no, it just made me even more awake and make it feel like I was rolling again. I was almost starting to get a little frustrated and I think around 5am I finally turned the music off and laid my head down on my pillow and tried to sleep. I have no idea if I slept at all or if I just had a ton of closed eye visuals but it felt like I slept because at 6am I woke up with a jolt and was tripping harder than ever!!! I couldn't believe it!! So I found some people online and just talked to them for awhile.",
      "It had snowed alot the previous day and that morning around 11am my sister comes into my room and I'm still tripping. She wants to go sled riding. So I go and it was alot of fun, but I ended up bruising my tail bone. I think I had finally come down around 1 or 2pm that day and wasn't completely normal until the next morning! That's like 18 hours of tripping my ass off and another 20 or so hours of coming down, which was really awesome, but it would have been SOOO much more awesome if I had friends that I was tripping with!",
      "I have no clue why the Morning Glories felt like ecstasy. It could have been the fact that I had tripped hard on DXM 2 nights before and it may have still been in my system, or the amazing pot that I have, no idea, but whatever I did it was freakin amazing. I feel sorry for all those people who eat this stuff and get sick and never know its real potential! I love my drugs but I won't be doing Morning Glories again for awhile, just because I tripped sooo goddamn hard and long! lol. And when I do it again I'm going to make sure that I have friends to hang out with and a boy to take care of my needs. Hah! Cheers everyone!"

      "I am a 56 year old man that had never tried anything of this type. I have been a stoner for the past 35 years, relying only on ganja for my pleasure. I have recently become aware of the need to do some searching. I have been searching for spiritual truth for many years, but had always rejected the use of drugs as a path. I had apparently bought into the US Gov's propaganda, I grew up in the 60's ( class of 68) but had been a redneck in HS, violently opposed to drug use.",
      "I met up with MJ the night I came home, at 19, and found my wife and baby gone, only a note that she left for good. I called a buddy and he produced a joint, been there ever since, except for the years in the army when I ran the drug testing unit for my division and was tested 2x weekly plus randomly. I smoked all thru college and professional life and so far, 4 years into my retirement.",
      "I decided to try to get to another level and experience the psychedelic realm after reading about the healings of the Shamans and their use of Ayahuasca. I read about the drugs used and eventually landed on this site, where I found experiences listed and reading them both quieted my fears a bit and heightened my curiosity.",
      "I drove 90 miles to the city ( I live in a very remote town in Arkansas, retired from Dallas, Tx) and found a store selling 20x Salvia D. I bought 2 grams and headed home.",
      "I had been reading the experiences listed here to find a report that involved someone older and inexperienced like myself. I wondered about the dosage, the reports all list body weight, but I wasn't sure about it because no height or level of physical conditioning was ever talked about. I am 230 pounds but 6'3' as well and only a few pounds above my workout weight of a few years ago. I didn't know if body fat levels had any influence on the usage or dose level. I am a big guy, old , and yet I am not carrying a lot of extra weight. The reporter I found closest to my weight said that he used a very small dose and warned of using too much. I used altogether, about 0.2 to 0.3 grams during the entire episode, spread out through 8 or 9 hits over an hour.",
      "My wife agreed to be my sitter while she read this site to gain some perspective. She had not read any of this stuff and had no idea of what to expect. I was going to wait until the next day to try it, but she looked at me about 10:00, kids were asleep ( I have 5 yr old twins) and said 'well'.",
      "We turned down the lights and put on some mellow rock to listen to and I sat on the bed.",
      "I placed a small amount of the stuff on a wire screen in my pipe and smoked it, big hit, held in as long as I could. I waited a few minutes and felt the warm wash over me and my balance was affected. I was hoping to see some visual effects, never have had any, and was anxiously looking around the room for any Dali-like changes. Nothing. But when I laid down and closed my eyes the colors were amazing and they were moving, making very bright colored patterns. I was looking up at a towering stack of balloons that were extending forever up from each corner of the bed, which now looked like a giant playpen.",
      "I opened my eyes , hoping to see some alteration in perception in the room. Nothing. I took another hit. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the colors for a few minutes, but wanted to see something more 'vision-like' I suppose. I got up and stumbled over to the desk and loaded the pipe again. The Salvia definitely affects the balance and coordination.  Took two hits and laid down. I was looking at my wife and suddenly the buzzing started. It was like a bunch of crickets and birds were outside the window, but the sound was all around my head. I could feel something pulling me into what seemed to be the corner of the room. I could not (or dared not) look in that direction. I was being pulled up and away thru the corner of the room. I remember my wife saying, rather sarcastically 'are you leaving me?', to which I said ' yeah, they are taking me away'.",
      "I remember almost a feeling of panic. I wanted to go with the flow, but I was afraid of not seeing my wife again, and as I stared at her and reached out, I floated back to the bed and became heavier..that is, I found my weight again..no floating away. I enjoyed the view with my eyes closed for a few minutes, but it seemed to be over.",
      "I took several hits and was picked up again, floating feelings. I made my way back to the bed and laid down, hoping to be pulled thru the wall. The room seemed to slip past me, I was at the corner of the room and held it between my outstretched hands, one hand on a side, like carrying a cardboard box, and was turning the room over and over looking at it like a cube. The outside surfaces of the room/cube were different brilliant neon colors. The area behind me and all around the outside of the room was all dark, I never looked in that direction, my attention was focused on the room and watching my wife. She was engrossed in the experience files on this site and had her back to me.",
      "I am disappointed to some degree. I was hoping to see more visual distortions with my eyes open, but that never happened. I think I am more disappointed in me than the drug. Overall I took about 8 or 9 hits on the pipe, spread out over an hour. I really did enjoy the closed eye visuals, but I am disappointed that I didn't stay there..kept getting up to hit the pipe to push the experience further. I backed off when I was feeling like I was being pulled thru the fabric of the room. I felt I was half in and half out of this dimension, but I didn't dare look into the direction I was being pulled.",
      "I chastised myself for my cowardice and resolved to try again, maybe Sunday, with a bit more preparation, maybe create a ritual, fast for a day,and ask for help from the spirit world.",
      "As a side note, I suffer from erectile dysfunction. I believe that I had some nerves cut when I had my vasectomy reversed in 98. I have a young wife, she helped me raise my teens and now wanted her own babies. The surgery was 4 hours long and a terrible experience, DON'T DO IT, they have other ways. Anyway, I got an enormous, almost painful erection, which I thought was weird, but given the warm feelings I assumed that my circulation was in high gear and accounted for the erection. My wife was not interested at the time, still wonder what sex would have been like while having all the visuals. Not exactly a spiritual thing, huh?",
      "I can see that there is a powerful substance in this stuff, my lack of experience is probably what colored the trip. I really think that I will try again and have better results. The apprehension is much less now, having seen that I will return to myself after a short while...gee, my govt lied to me again, go figure. I will try harder to prepare myself and the setting for my next trial. The effects of this stuff were much stronger than anything I have ever had. I was out of weed, but hope to have some for a companion at the next trial, nothing like an old friend along for the ride. I will continue to read and evaluate the effects while I experiment with it. I am ordering some live plants to add to my garden and greenhouse. Don't like to expose myself to the perceived scrutiny of entering a head shop, it kinda peels away the carefully crafted 'bubba' personna I use to escape notice. I just don't look the part of a person doing weed, I look like the guy out to bust them."

      "I am a twenty year old college student who has been a daily smoker for four years. I have bipolar II and occasional anxiety attacks. I always dream in color, my nightmares are particularly intense and I normally remember significant portions of my dreams. I recently started on medium-strength Habitrol nicotine replacement patches in an effort to eliminate or reduce my future cigarette consumption. Other than an occasional head or joint ache, I have had no side effects, unless I leave the patch on while sleeping. This has produced extremely intense, psychedelic dreams, second in intensity only to dreams I have had while my body adjusted to various SSRI antidepressants I have used in the past.",
      "Soon after falling asleep, I had a dream in which I was running through a set of sprinklers in front of my dorm with some friends. We then had a mud fight in these huge puddles that appeared. The dream itself wouldn't have been that spectacular, if it weren't for the amount of *detail* involved. I could see individual blades of grass, hear the direction voices were coming from, feel the mud between my toes, and athough the water lacked any real sense of temperature I could feel water from the sprinklers. A spurt once hit me in the ear, and it sounded just like I would expect it to. I have never had this many senses fully present in a dream sequence before. In addition, people I know in real life are almost always absent from my dreams, so perhaps nicotine enhances memory retrieval in the dream state?",
      "Everything eventually changed to a less coherent, fantastical scene in which my friend and I had to hide in rooms of this leaky, derilict house and hide from spiders the size of chihuahuas, who if they found us would report it to this unseen beast lurking in the basement, who would in turn try to eat the room of the house we were in before we could escape. I could hear the clicking of the spiders' exoskeletons and see the shimmer of their dim red eyes, and everything looked warped and twisted like a trippy graffiti mural. I also had a wonderful sex dream, and a dream in which I listened to about 5 songs that never existed, and all of them were normally structured and sounded fantastic.",
      "Finally, I awoke in the middle of the night, and kept drifting in and out for a while. Then, something very odd happened. The line between dreaming and wakefulness disappeared. I actually started to hallucinate when I was awake, and when I lapsed into sleep my dreams continued from my last point of consciousness without a hitch. I looked at my wall in the dark and saw that it was gradually being covered with faint, illegible cursive in a pale blue. I blinked and it went away, then returned in a few seconds. I believe these to be a form of hypnogogic hallucinations, the forms some people see before they fall asleep, although they differed from the pulsing purples and blacks I normally would have seen with closed eyes.",
      "I then unknowingly passed out, and in a dream went to hit my lightswitch, to find it was covered by a piece of paper. I tore it away and tried to turn the lights on, but the electricity was out. I became acutely aware that something in my room didn't want me to see it. I freaked out and awoke to find I was still facing my wall where the cursive had appeared. I sort of remember that various things of this nature occured several times in a row, and I always awoke at the point where the hallucinations began. I then made it a point to force myself to stay awake during the hallucinations. My eyes tried to close, but I forced them to stay open with considerable effort. I looked at the light on my ceiling, and it grew strange angles and took on a gelatinous shimmer. Then a large black tentacle started to extend through my ceiling next to the light, waving around and making a loud humming. I found I was unable to move. The humming increased in intensity and became an electric vibration that ran strongly through my whole body.",
      "This made me start and look around the room, which quickly returned to normal, although my fingers, toes and scalp tingled for minutes afterwards, telling me that the vibration was some sort of nervous system activity. I was definately at least semi-conscious during the time of this final hallucination. According to a book I read about astral projection, this vibration comes at the point just before your consciousness exits the body, so I'm thinking that what I experienced parallels this, or perhaps even alien abduction reports. In short, I was extremely shocked at how powerful a mind-alterant nicotine can be when administered at an atypical time. I am wondering if it's effect on dreamlike states has anything to do with it's reward action on the brainstem, as nicotine is active at acetylcholine receptors, and the part of the brainstem involved in dreaming (the pons) is stimulated by acetylcholine. This was an amazing experience that rivals the visuals of any drug I have personally taken as an experienced psychonaut/space cowboy."

So I took a Marlboro medium cigarette and began to roll it till the tobacco was half empty. I crushed up a 5mg tablet of Melatonin and mixed it with the tobacco. I then balled the mixture of crushed Melatonin and tobacco and placed it back into the cigarette with the help of some tweezers. The effect of smoking my concoction was quite delightful it was relaxing as if smoke weed yet gave the nice alertness of the nicotine in the tobacco. The experience was very nice I compare it to being high without the effects of stupidity and laziness. It was very nice. I still cant live without my pot."

      "I was prescribed alprazolam for my anxiety problems, and knowing that it's commonly preferred in certain circles, I decided to try more than I was prescribed. At first I took 2 pills (1 mg), and waited for an hour for the effects to kick in. It affected my mind only mildly, and I felt somewhat disoriented, and a slight impairment in muscle coordination. Nevertheless, no significant or desired alteration happened to my mental state. My friend then consulted me, that I should take at least 1 mg more of that stuff. I did that, and started to drink beer in the hopes of some kind of euphoria that I have read and heard from others.",
      "After the fourth beer it started to kick in. It felt like I have drank double as much as I actually did. For some reason (this was very stupid, as you will soon find out) I decided to take 0.5 mg more. After that I had a complete blackout, and woke up very dizzy and disoriented after 5 hours. The bed was full of urine. I was fucked up and mad to myself.",
      "A few days after that I took only 1 mg when drinking heavily, passed out and had no hangover, which is a miracle and a good side effect of this drug :)",
      "The conclusion: I had no desired and good effects with alprazolam alone, but with alcohol it kicks in and hard."

      "Seeing as there aren't very many reports on somewhat longer term usage of Provigil, I thought I'd add my two cents.  I've read many other 'experiences' about the use of Provigil and feel that too often users are describing the effects of the other drugs that they are on, or describing binge usage.  While every user's experience differs, I thought it might be relevant to have another description regarding the long-term, regular usage of the drug at a normal dosage. ",
      "I'm relatively experienced and familiar with many psychoactive pharmaceutical drugs--particularly 'wakefulness enhancers.'  I was prescribed Provigil about a year and a half ago, and have taken it regularly as a sleep regulator.  I typically dose 200 mg per morning.",
      "Although many users describe Provigil to be some sort of miraculous cognitive enhancer or a super-stim, I don't find such descriptions to be accurate with respect to my own experiences.  For me, it is nearly identical to having a few cups of coffee but without the negative side-effects.  In other words, it's not fundamentally different or improved from caffeine other than that it is less harsh.",
      "Typically, the effects onset about half an hour after the dose is taken.  Usually, this is hardly noticeable because it is so subtle.  Primarily, it only removes the impulse to sleep, fatigue and exhaustion still set in and general cognitive performance declines as per usual.  The only difference is that the desire to go to sleep is significantly reduced or removed.  If you're an insomniac you should know what I'm talking about.  After being up for too long, my eyes get heavy and dry, my attention span is cut down, my body aches to lay down, my mental acuity is dulled and my motivation is diminished.  Normally, this kind of fatigue would be accompanied by an intense desire to lay down, close my eyes, and drift off to sleep.  With Provigil, that impulse is nearly completely removed.",
      "I can stay up for an incredible amount of time if I want, but seeing as my body and mind feel like shit after the normal 16-20 hours, I rarely choose to.  Granted, being overtired is somewhat more tolerable when there's no overpowering impulse to sleep, but physical and mental exhaustion still set in.  For example, I can get 2-5 hours of sleep per night for days on end and still stay awake, I'll just be drunk with fatigue. ",
      "This is useful when I need to go to work all night then go to class with no sleep and not fall asleep in my chair.  When driving with little to no sleep, I won't doze off but my reaction times and awareness are still significantly dulled.",
      "Like I said before, the drug keeps you awake pretty much like caffiene or any other stimulant and won't allow you to stay up for three days and have no one notice that you are a little dulled.  I'm sorry to dash anyone's dreams of twenty-four seven living, but just because you don't feel the need to sleep doesn't mean your body doesn't need it.",
      "The biggest allure to this drug over others like lie in its lack of side-effects, not its primary effects.  Unlike other stimulants, there is little to no come-down, built-up tolerance, physical addiction,  anxiety or nervousness, jitteriness, or physical tension.  I can use it consistently for weeks or months with identical effect.  When I come off of it, I rarely notice anything at all.",
      "The revved-up fight-or-flight feeling of most stimulants is completely lacking -- making provigil pretty much useless as a party drug and for most recreational purposes.  I never feel that sense of enthusiasm, energy, and invulnerability common with most other stimulants.  Consequently, while many stimulants help me find that motivation and energy to get something done, Provigil only helps keep me on task.",
      "At work or in class, other stimulants cause me to become stressed, I can feel my heart rate rise, I begin to fidget or tap, I might start to sweat a little, I become empassioned with energy and drive, I become over-invigorated.  This is fine if I'm going to the gym or a party, but not if I'm giving or watching a presentation or trying to read a book.  With Provigil, I don't feel the tension as with other stimulants.  I can sit through the most boring lecture of all time, and stay completely focused on the issue because I'm not struggling to keep my eyes open.  Granted, my ability to comprehend or respond to the material might be diminished with sleep deprivation, but normally I'd simply be thinking about how much I want to take a nap.",
      "When I want to go to sleep, I can usually do so with little difficulty.  Occassionally,  I experience some difficulty if something is on my mind simply because I will stay awake and keep thinking about it rather than just passing out.  Otherwise, falling asleep is not a problem.",
      "Generally, if you're looking for a way to keep your eyes open and stay on task without all the problems and side-effects of other stimulants, provigil is definitely your best choice.  However, if you want to party all night long or recklessly motivated, you'd be better off with even an energy drink or something a little more illicit."

      "Hello, over my short life, I've tried several drugs. Starting with caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, I moved onto marijuana, which I smoked regularly for about one year. Because I lived at home at the time, and I was a careless teenager, I got caught by my parents. After that, I kept things quiet for a few months, and then I started doing E, acid, ketamine, nitrous, and various amphetamines.",
      "However, I had always been interested in smoking heroin (needles aren't my thing). So, when the opportunity presented itself to score some h from a local dealer/friend of mine, I jumped on the opportunity to buy twenty dollars worth. I took it home, got some tin foil and a small glass tube to inhale the smoke. After trying unsuccessfully to get it to smoke over a candle, I got out a simple bic lighter, which worked much better. It took a while to completely burn up, but by that time, I was pretty damn faded.",
      "I felt good. It's not what I would call 'euphoria' but was more like a content emptiness. I put on some Coldplay and just chilled, watching the candles flickering in the draft in my room. Life was good. I didn't care about the problems in my life, and work seemed like something completely pointless, I see how people become addicted to this. Now, it's been about an hour and a half since I smoked and it's starting to wear off. I feel itchy and tired. Overall, this has been a great experience, but I won't do it again because this is a habit that could ruin me financially."

      "I feel extremely guilty about this, but to accomplish this trip, I stole the hydrocodone from my aunt's prescription. A moment of desperation to feel different on anything, I guess.",
      "It was about 9 PM, and I just woke up from a nap. Knowing I had the hydrocodone, I immediately took 4 of the 7 tablets I had. I took 4 because I knew that went fine the first time I did it.",
      "I made sure to lounge in my bed, instead of being active (like I did the first time, which made the onset longer than it should have been). I started feeling the effects about 45 minutes later. It started out as a very mild calm, then all of the sudden it whooshed in.",
      "I swear it was like a body orgasm. I took another, hoping to extend this feeling as long as possible. Everything felt good, and it seemed like nothing could ruin the trip.",
      "Sometime between 10:30 and 11:30, I got up from my bed and walked around my apartment. Everything was slow. I felt like I was walking normally, but when I really looked at how I was walking, it was a slow, basically tip-toe around the house. I got back into bed five minutes later, after the novelty of my slow walking wore off, and let the feelings of calm consume me once more.",
      "I took another tablet, sometime around 12. I really hoped this feeling would stay. I needed it too. It felt like I was going to cry once it was over. At around 12:15, I took the last one. I rubbed myself on my blankets, my stuffed animals, anything that felt good. I pet my cat, and it felt amazing. Everything was so calm, and I had a permanent smile plastered on my face.",
      "At around 3, I felt everything wearing off. I felt like crying because I already missed it. And I already exhausted my 'stash' of tablets, so I had nothing to look forward to having later. Then, it felt like I just blinked, and I looked at the clock again, and it was 6 AM. Somehow, I fell asleep for 3 hours, and it only felt like a blink. This happened the first time I was on it as well. Then, I had to get up to go to school. I was fine all through school, and I felt really peaceful all day. The only thing was that I already missed it.",
      "I love the feelings that hydrocodone gives me. Everything feels warm and fuzzy, and fantastic."

      "My girlfriend Indica and I were invited to our friends to spend the day 'traveling' and relaxing.  It was a beautiful June day and my expectations were high.  Our friends are experienced sitters and I have a decent experience with psychedelics so I felt confident something significant would occur ... surely it did.",
      "I did some research into the chems available and decided 2c-t-2 seemed appropriate for my experience.  I felt my surroundings and my sitters would be the backbone of this journey and prepared myself mentally and physically ... in time both would be tested.",
      "0:00- Consumed 15 mg of 2c-t-2 in water.",
      "1:00- The typical feelings of an x trip is creeping on me ... slight sick feeling, restlessness ... I decide to smoke some herb and relax as the chemical begins to take hold of its host ...",
      "1:45- Not much to say ... the negative feelings have subsided ... we decide to look at some photographs on a laptop ... during this time the images on the computer began to take on a personality all their own ... images of the beach came to life ... images of people began to move with colors sweeping over faces ... an image of my 6 year old son with a simple close up smile began to take on emotions ... I could see in his wonderful smile a face that was on the verge of tears ... back and forth his face changed ... it began to test my psyche ... the walls which had a beautiful textured pattern began to move and crawl like a snakes scales ... Whoa!... things were starting to get weird ...",
      "2:00- While my lady and friends continued to view the pictures I felt a wave of emotion take hold of me ... almost instinctively I slowly seperated from the group to a bedroom to try and collect my mind and spend some time alone ... the bed spread, a tiger print, was literally blowing like a sail on the bed ... a carved image on some furniture began to exhibit movement and seemed real ...",
      "2:30- At this time I began to feel very uneasy about myself ... I felt like nobody cared about me ... especially feeling unliked by my friends and family ... an extremely emotional time ... my friend entered the room and asked if I was ok ... I remember responding with a trembling lip and tears ... I asked very timidly if my lady would come in ... she peaked her head in ... I asked with all the sincerity of a 8 year old if she liked me... 'Of course I do Baby!' she responded, which brought some relief but the waves of emotion were becoming stronger and stronger.",
      "3:15- The full power of the chemical had finally taken hold and I remember this thankful feeling in my heart for such amazing friends offering so much love and support ... My thoughts began to focus on the loss of my mother to cancer ... All my friends were huddled closely around on the bed ... touching through hands and fingers I could feel the energy in the room swelling ... Finally a primitive wail began to escape my mouth, building in it's intensity until I had no more air to exhale ... yet ... it continued to escape ... the deepest, most intense emotion imaginable was pouring out of my body ... exhausting my lungs to the point of no return ... the three friends sobbed and cried in unison as they touched and rubbed and encouraged me to let it out ... i did for a good 15 minutes ... when it passed I lay on the bed gasping for air, grasping to reality and wondering what I had done to myself ... all throughout the experience on the bed my hand was clutched to my lady's forearm as the others held us all in a tight embrace ...",
      "3:30- Things began to feel a little better as we left the bed room to look at the adjacent river ... I remember walking towards my lady and expressing to her that this chemical was nothing to fear ... (she stayed sober as did another friend) The other woman, already coming down from her trip decided to take a bath while things wound down ... only 2c-t-2 was not finished ...",
      "3:45- A disturbed and ill look took my partners face as she slowly walked by me without a word ... she continued into the same bedroom and laid down ... this took me by surprise and scared me immediately ... I asked my buddy if they had slipped her anything, my logic was beginning to fray and her inexplicable illness only reinforced my fears ... I began to worry if she and the others were ok, checking on one in the bath and my lady ... still ... I was locked in this cycle of illogical thoughts repeatedly asking (maybe 50 times or so) if my lady was ok ... I decided to check on her again only to now find her in the bath as our friend stroked her back and held a bucket while she vomited ... What??? ... I was the one who had taken the chemical ... 'what the F is going on?' I asked repeatedly ... panic quickly took hold of all logic as I began to feel like a puppet at the end of the strings ... something was manipulating my moves ... I could hardly stand on my own ... my friend suggested that sitting might be a good idea ... so we stood ... er ... he stood, holding a man twice his size while I held on to him like a baby to his mother ... he gently guided me to the couch as I began to feel a complete ego loss ... suddenly my lady appeared next to me looking healthy and refreshed ... she expressed her love for me and reassured me I was ok ... I remember wondering who I was ... if I had a friend named Tim? ... (I do) ... If I ever smoked pot before? ... totally ridiculous questions at the time, but they had a connection to my earthly reality that I desperately wanted back ... I was definitely ready for this to be over ...",
      "4:00- With the gentle voices encouraging me to return ... I calmly slipped back into my ego and began to feel much better ... laughing about my paranoia ... thanking everyone for the support during the trip ... With the day nearly done and evening setting we decided that an hour drive home would be ok and within a half hour we made some tearful goodbyes and my sober girlfriend took us home ... still on the fringe though ...",
      "4:30- The car ride home turned out to be a bad idea, so soon from come down as a truly terrible sensation began to ripple through my body ... it felt like the vibrations from the road were ripping my limbs from their sockets ... a horrible feeling ... I decided to ride it out as uncomfortable as I was because my bed would be my reward ...",
      "5:30- We made it home ... I collapsed in bed until morning feeling no afteraffects at all ... just a profound contentment ... a purging of the poisonous grief I never knew how to release ... an adjustment in how I remembered my mother ... not on her death bed, rather a woman laughing, proud of her sons and healthy ... remembering her healthy and happy was something I had not done since her death 10 years earlier ... in regards to my lady vomiting during the trip ... my take is this ... I last vomited one morning in may '87 ... I was 14 ... I believe she experienced what is known as a contact high ... she literally vomited for my body which had forgotten how ... a connection between us so deep that she offered herself unknowingly to help me overcome these demons ... a truly incredible mind altering, life changing experience ..."

      "This is a follow-up to For Those with Seizure Disorders. It took place New Year's Eve, Dec 31/06.",
      "Two months prior, my bf 'S' returned home from a few months work, during which time I was only able to see him online. I missed him, but I found myself using my free time to swim and hit the gym regularly. During that time, I lost 20 lbs but was not overweight to begin with. I basically tightened and toned, turned my body into a slender, shapely figure. S came home & was ecstatic, as you could imagine. My general attitude had improved as well. It was hard not to feel content, even if something was going wrong. I also ate the best of foods. Every cell in my body was filled with positive energy. I couldn't wait for New Year's to arrive, with the promise of Ecstacy.",
      "S had been home for a week, and I skipped the pool and gym, wanting to spend my time with him. I HAD every intention of resuming my workout schedule. It took 1 or 2 weeks, and my mood began to slip. I was unhappier than I'd ever remembered being, to the point S realized I was severely depressed. Everything pissed me off and I wanted to sleep every second I didn't have to be at work. After nearly 2 months of this, every day worse than the last, S did something that saved me.",
      "I had gotten to the point that I didn't want him near me, didn't want him to touch me. One morning, after dealing with a cold shoulder from me, he said he didn't think he could take it anymore. I thought he was going to leave me. I could feel my emotions bubbling to the surface, which is foreign to me, as I haven't really cried in about 20 years. I began to explain why I was afraid to have him near me, and then I began to weep. My entire body shook with sobs. I can't relay the sounds that escaped me. All of this came from a history of being repeatedly molested.",
      "Realization and acceptance of the fact that there was a problem was my first step towards healing. I knew from my previous experiences with E that I gravitate more towards conversations with people than anything else. I also recalled how joyful and alive I felt afterward, and was looking forward to these feelings again, especially with how dark my mind had been as of late. I also wondered if perhaps I had opened a door to simply getting better just by talking, and one time I am able to talk freely",
      "and honestly is when on Ecstacy.",
      "New Year's Eve: I was nervous about coming up based on the last experience, so I decided to take only half a pill. That was 10pm. An hour later, I felt nothing and dropped the other half. It was only when we started to drive to the rave that I felt myself rushing just a little. But that was no surprise, as it takes me 2 pills for the effects to begin. It was 11:30 or midnight when I took the second pill, these pills were considered to be a '5' on a scale on 1 to 10. An hour after taking the second, I asked S for a third, who denied my request. He told me to wait a little longer, just in case. Not long later, I realized he was right.",
      "I first noticed the effects had begun when I looked at the lights that were hanging from the walls. There were these blue outdoor LED lights, and my eyes were continually drawn back to them, they were so beautiful. Then I realized I was coming up. I was starting to feel great. The music was amazing, and I loved watching people dance. A series of events occur after this point, but I can't recall for sure what pill I was on during those times. I will do my best to be accurate.",
      "S and I always part ways for a substantial portion of the raves we attend. There were four rooms, and I decided to explore them all. I kept returning to the room with the blue lights, where there was nothing but Jungle. That isn't my favourite, but there was something comforting in the room that kept drawing me back. Perhaps it was the lights. I think I had dropped my third pill at this point, so it must have been between 2 and 3am. I was sitting alone when this guy 'D' came over and sat with me. He began telling me of this horrible car crash he was in that resulted in him being paralyzed for some time. He eventually said screw that and decided to take his life and body back. Now he's strong and happy, and can walk or run anywhere he pleases. I told him of my being shot in the head, and the results. We were amazed with each others stories, and spent most of the night hanging out.",
      "Then came the irresistible need to touch. Only I had never felt it this strong before. D and I were sitting facing each other and I was running my hands up and down his legs, his arms, playing with his hair. At one point I was rubbing his leg, and reached over to the girl sitting beside us and started running my fingers over her legs as well. Then I realized that I had no idea who she was and asked her if it was okay for me to be doing that. She said she didn't mind at all. My hands were moving on everyone around me, and as a result, we ended up forming a massage line, random people joining in because it looked so inviting. I absolutely loved giving massages, but D offered to give me one, and then I discovered how amazing it was to receive one. Touch had never felt like this before, and I was loving it.",
      "I took my fourth pill around 4-4:30am. This was the first time I had ever gone beyond 3 pills in one night. When it kicked in, I had eye wiggles for the first time. Thankfully, unlike tracers during my last experience, I had heard of them before so I knew they were normal and not the possible onset of a seizure, so I knew I could enjoy them. And I did. I discovered a way to make them continue on for 5 to 10 seconds, marvelling at the tracers that followed them. It had a 3D effect, like when a show simulates an earthquake by making your tv screen 'shake', I would shake along with the eye wiggles. I was so disappointed when they began to stop.",
      "S spent a lot of the end of the night sitting with me. Around 5 or 6am, I was still feeling wonderful, but could feel the urge to take a fifth pill. S didn't want me to, just in case something negative happened to me, so I didn't. We were sitting, S against the wall, me sitting facing him. I was all smiles, stroking his arms and face. I asked him how he was feeling, and he said he was really high. I looked at his face and despite how high I was, I could see he wasn't kidding. His eyes darted everywhere, and nothing about him looked even remotely sober. He said he was feeling nauseated. Not long after, we decided to leave.",
      "At home, I realized I was wiped out. I also realized how long and hard I'd been grinding my teeth ALL night. I recalled how on my fourth pill, I had tried to keep my mouth open, and I could feel my jaw literally shaking because my muscles were trying so hard to clench down. I remember being amused at how high S looked when I felt sober. Anyone who has seen someone coming down off E knows that look. It can be a little scary to see the face of a person who's been messed up all night. At that point I went to the bathroom while S smoked a few bowls and tried to come down. In the bathroom, I got a fright. My reflection in the mirror was not what I was expecting. I looked high like S did, my eyes vacant, or something I can't explain. My face was contorted into a frown that I couldn't erase. I guess clenching for hours had put lines in my face that would take a day or so to relax. I did not look like myself at all.",
      "The experience of seeing my face in the mirror was unnerving. I smoked a few bowls myself and headed for bed. S was already under the covers when I got there. He still had that look, his eyes darting at me, looking paranoid, even though he wasn't. The next thing that happened to me was when I tried to sleep. Even though I didn't feel like I was losing my mind, my thoughts were the strangest that I've ever experienced. When I'm falling asleep, my mind wanders of course, but my thoughts were so weird they were almost scary. For example, a man is a cd case who's trying to turn on a light by talking to a railroad which is a part of a mall that only sells lighters by climbing a tree..., etc. Nothing coherent whatsoever. I kept having to open my eyes to stop it from continuing, but when I closed my eyes again, another series of thoughts just as insane would begin. That happened for what I guess was probably an hour, at which point I finally fell asleep.",
      "I remember thinking that I couldn't believe we deliberately do this to ourselves. Being high and coming down felt like the most unnatural thing in the world, which I guess it is. I couldn't understand why anyone would put a foreign substance into their bodies. All of these thoughts came from the fear of having seen my face in the mirror, how distorted it looked. I think my brain was a little fried at that point, after having ingested 4 pills, and I was experiencing a slight freak-out.",
      "The next day was perfect though, except that for about a week, chewing was a painful process. I remembered what it was like to feel happy, and how wonderful it is to connect with other people. After working up the courage (which took a few months) I put myself into counselling. It was the best decision I ever made. And I have E to thank, and of course S, who is the best thing that ever happened to me. S brought me to the realization that I needed help, and E reminded me that it is possible to trust people, and that talking to others is one of the best things that a person can do to keep their mind healthy and happy.",
      "Not once the entire night did I feel any real negative effects with regards to seizures or anything else. As usual, I kept myself, and everyone around me, hydrated. I am looking forward to my next E experience, which will either be in April at a rave for my birthday, or in July or August, alone with S in our home.",
      "Remember to take care of your body and your mind, and each other. That's why we're here."

      "I'm 15 years old now but I was 14 when this happened. I've done a variety of other drugs such as ketamine, coke, weed, ecstasy, and LSD but have never had a reaction like this before. I was attending a party with my older brother and some of my other older friends who I had done coke and ketamine with. I never really felt good about going to parties with people who were all older than me (average age being probably 18 or 19) so I decided to phone a friend and ask him to come along. His sister was also attending so it all worked out. When we got there I saw a few unfamiliar faces and asked Jason (my brother) who they were. He told me to mind my business so I left it alone. About an hour into the party my friend who I had phoned to come along came up to me with a very worried look on his face. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he was leaving because he had heard that people were going to be shooting H and he didnt want to be around. I told him not to be a baby and that he didnt have to do it, all he had to do was pass. He said 'no' and left.",
      "Everyone was sitting in a circle so I went to join them. Everybody was so cool, it was like a big happy family. It was then that I saw some guy I didn't know pull out a needle and say something like 'anyone want to try some H? Believe me if you try it you will never want to do any other drug.' I listened to his little speech and watched a few people shoot it up. My brother told me that when he got to me to refuse. Jason then got up and went to the kitchen to get a bite to eat. When the guy with the H got to me, my brother was still gone. He said 'So little man you wanna hit this?' I looked around at the others and they looked so happy. I thought what the hell I'm not going to get addicted the first time. I replied 'sure dude, but will you help me? I've never shot H before.' 'Of course I will' he said, with a big smile on his face. He tied some plastic wrap shit around my arm and shot it. I immediately felt sick. I felt like I had to throw up. I went to the bathroom but I couldn't throw up so I came back to the living room and sat down. I totally blacked out. The next thing I know I saw a bright light and heard melodic voices. I know it sounds like I'm crazy but I think I went to heaven and back.",
      "Anyway when I woke up I was in a hospital bed with my mom and brother hovering over me. All I could think was 'Oh shit Oh shit what the fuck am I going to say?' My mom was crying and my brother looked disappointed. I said 'Mom someone must have put something in my drink.' 'That's what I was thinking at first and then the doctor told me that you shot heroin into your arm. What the hell have you done?' she said. 'I'm sorry' I said. I couldn't say anything else, I had royally fucked up and I knew it. The doctor came in with a cop and the cop asked me who I got it from. I looked at my brother and his eyes were huge and he was shaking his head. I replied 'I don't know his name and I can't remember what he looked like.' My brother also said he didn't know the guy. That night I learned not to fuck with shit when I don't really know what Im doing. I'm not trying to preach or anything but I hope this is a lesson to anyone thinking about heroin.",

      "Here is my story",
      "Im currently 17 and before this year I would never have even dreamt of taking any drugs, I was even scared to try weed so I put it off for 4 years. 4 years ago my best friends started smoking and I decided back then that I wanted no part of it and began distancing myself from my drug user friends. As a result I became distanced from everyone and I was unconsciously provoked into a corner where I found myself becoming enveloped in massively multiplayer online games. I began these games young and before I distanced myself from my friends I played games but not like this. I played games from the time I got home from school till I went to bed and neglected all schoolwork. Being a naturally bright kid I was able to compensate on my tests through my power of deduction and other such tricks/methods and never cheated.",
      "Anyways my parents had been Divorced since I was born. My father a current alcoholic and my mom a past alcoholic both of them grew up in the drug age and I'm sure they experimented plenty. One night during one of my dad's drunk emotional phone calls to me my father told me that I was actually an accident and that my mother never wanted me and that is the real reason they got divorced.",
      "For years I wrapped myself around my computer screen not living in this world but having become one with a virtual world, my life was based on something intangible and fake. I spent years building relationships with people across the country or in other countries. The virtual world was a world where I didnt have to worry about anything and just minor annoyances like fighting monsters and dungeons, I had found a temporary way to immerse myself in an unresponsive environment and being ignorant of the real world I continued in fantasy land for 4 years or more. Probably way worse then drugs is being a completely over sensitive emotional anti-social computer addict.",
      "11th grade came rolling around the corner and over the summer I spent the entire 3 months basically in my room in my own little world. The 11th grade midterms came rolling around the corner and my responsibilities to real life kicked me in my balls. Gasping for air I frantically tried to cram in as much knowledge as I could, like I said I'm a bright kid, but lazy. I got through the midterms ok and after, feeling completely drained, my friend told me she would bring me home and so she did. Several days later on new years I get a call from my friend (R) telling me to come to this party. The party was being thrown at one of my friends houses whom I had distanced myself from 4 years ago when I began my anti-social curl.",
      "Never having gone to any parties I showed up ignorant of the situation. The friend whose house I was at lets call him (C). I showed up with a beanie on and was telling people I had a migraine because I hadnt had any caffeine, yes I was a caffeine addict just due to the fact that I stayed up all night playing computer games. In the past many people have said that C and I look alike, which I thought strange but ignored it. A total stranger bust through the room telling me to take this little white pill, Nice! an advil, and so I did what a nice guy I thought. Within 30 minutes my headache was gone and I was feeling amazing, the music really felt good. Later I found out the total stranger mistook my for my friend C, and consequently I received a sample of ecstasy. As I sat on the couch I felt air rushing past my face and I could feel each beat of the strobe light as if it was pushing down on me as I flew upwards through the clouds.",
      "Someone handed me a bowl of weed, as having seen everyone doing this I knew exactly was I was supposed to do with these beautiful orange and green leaves in this shiny bowl, and with the lighter in my hand and my virgin lounges took a deep breath and coughed hard and fell backwards onto the couch and awoke a moment later. Someone handed me 2 hand held back massagers, and they had green lights on them at which I remarked and showed everyone how amazing they were. I began to rave with them, and feeling the power of the MDMA, the feeling of empathy dripping down my face being excreted from my pores only to be reabsorbed a moment later. I wanted others to feel how I felt, I wanted and still want the entire worlds population to feel the empathy, joy, giddiness, sheer euphoria that I had felt.",
      "Never having raved before my friend C showed me how to make a figure 8 with my hand and how to move the lights. The music was coming from the stereo in waves, the waves never broke they were swells, swells in happiness or in vibe I couldnt tell, but I felt my body my mood, the whole room moving with these unbreakable swells in pleasure and emotion.",
      "Everyone is concerned with the idea of electricity and power and seeking the infinite power source, well I say its been here and it has been here for thousands of years, our ancestors discovered it in its basic uncut raw form. Indian tribes beating their drums circling which their eldest shamanistic guide to lead them through their spiritual journeys and often taking special herbs and medicines to invoke visions of the gods. Music is an infinite power source, every sound wave resounding endlessly from this CD, and the sound waves that night were pumping into my body, being like a human beacon for the music I felt it flowing through me and like electricity I felt the surge of energy needed to escape through some part of my body. So instead of letting it simply be released back into the air I transformed that energy into physical energy and began to rave for my first time.",
      "Enjoying raving more then having others rave for me I was able to feel my first empathetic experiences in my life. I was able to give other people happiness through raving. I cant take the credit for it though because the music is the real energy I was giving them, I was merely able to shape it into a language that everyone could understand. My friends became entranced with my hand movements as if every motion had a deeper meaning and was actually a message encoded into the music, that only this magical pill could enable me to decipher.",
      "My friends R and C told me that I was amazing at raving and to keep going, so I did. The language of the gods was flowing through me and I felt it in every movement, the hand of the gods. My arms no longer arms but mere puppet strings that followed directions from the music. I had found my passion in life, to make others happy through the unending power of music and raving. I raved until 4 am at which point my friend C told me that everyone was going to bed and that I should do so before my roll wears off so I did.",
      "The next morning was a wonderful one except my lips hurt from sucking on a pacifier. I drove home still feeling very happy and in a very good mood. When I got home I said hi to my mom and gave her a big hug, and ever since that day Ive been getting progressively nicer to my family and Im beginning to participate in our family events and things such as that. Im writing this one month later and I still remember the absolute euphoria I felt. I want everyone to be happy. This little miracle pill changed my life for good or for bad isnt to be judged because its myself and each individual should decide for themselves their path to enjoyment. I judge people less and I like people way more now. I actually enjoy being in social situations and I especially enjoy being nicer to my parents.",
      "Unfortunately my father is still an alcoholic but there isnt much I can do about that. Every person wants to feel important and they want to feel like they are doing something that they are good at. I believe that I have found my passion in life which is to make others happy through my power of raving and music, And to practice raving as much as I can because just was with every generation there is something new, something wonderful that brings the nations youth together to enjoy themselves and to bond with each-other, with other humans and to love one another. By raving I feel that Im spreading my love and joy with others.",
      "Each generation of people has something that bonds them together and thus bonds human kind to other humans. Only people born in that generation can understand others from that generation, and cross generation translations are only 50% understandable at best. I feel bonded to my people in my fellow generation. Life is only available to us for so long as if it were a sort of gateway, and each person needs to find a way to cross the gateway into happiness, because death without happiness means that that person wasted their life, death without happiness is merely decomposition. Being able to find our way across that gate is what lifes journey is. People need to do what ever it is that makes them happy in order to cross that gateway, but trying to escape reality isnt how it should be done. Making other happy through the power of music and dance and raving is what Ive discovered to be my crossing quality.",
      "MDMA (ecstasy) was invented originally as a therapeutically medicine. It enables us to unblock mental or social paths, and it completely wipes away social boundaries that are created through a judgmental society. Being able to wipe away those social barricades is nothing short of a miracle and should be using sparingly, people are abusing substances because they are trying to escape from lifes problems. Drugs shouldnt be taken to hide from reality but to enhance it and enable you to live more then youve ever lived before and to bond with humans. Sometimes drugs such as MDMA are prescribed as spiritual tools and can be used as such under proper conditions (in my opinion).",
      "I dont advocate the use of drugs but I feel that they have enabled me to see my path across that gate in clear view. I believe that I have seen my inner light and it has changed me for the better. People told me I was practically glowing with love and excitement days and weeks after my trip"

      "After a traumatizing, drug-infested experience with my first semester of college my brain was an emotional wreck. I was extremely depressed, including daily thoughts of suicide -- I felt as though my only option at the time was to self-medicate with every drug I could get my hands on. Although I had experienced several drugs before college, my mental state forced me to amplify my use. It eventually got to the point where in a single day I would have used cocaine, amphetamines, psilocybin mushrooms, and oxycodone all on top of a few beers and a pack of cigarettes. I had become a mental wreck and I knew that I needed to get out of the situation I was in and seek help.",
      "After the most traumatizing four months of my life at college and severely damaging my mental state with different chemicals to cope with suicide and anxiety, I transferred back home and went to see a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with Severe Major Depressive Disorder and prescribed me 450mg (400mg before bed and 50mg during the day) of Seroquel to be taken every day. The goal, he said, was to reduce my anxiety and social phobia as well as prevent me from having suicidal episodes.",
      "It is now a month later and I feel as though Seroquel is helping a little bit. If I had to rate my anxiety before the medication, it would have been a 10 on a scale of 0-10. After Seroquel it is more like a 4 on the same scale. I am able to function somewhat normal in most social situations, it helps to take your mind off of negative thoughts. However, I feel as though it does not do enough during the day for depression. I still get suicidal thoughts and feel hopeless and confused a couple times a week. However, the Seroquel has reduced the intensity and the length of these thoughts.",
      "The feeling I get from Seroquel is not so pleasant. About an hour after taking my 400mg nighttime dose I feel thoroughly sedated, almost like being drunk. I have trouble moving and difficulty speaking, my body also buzzes really hard. It also stuffs up my nose, makes my legs restless, and makes my eyes really red. But since this is the nighttime dose, it's no big deal, eventually it just knocks me out and I get some great un-interrupted sleep.",
      "The daytime dose of 50mg is nice, but not quite strong enough. The nighttime dose (taken around 10pm) wears off at about 1pm the next day. The 50mg taken at 1pm usually makes me feel like I just smoked a bowl of cannabis (a bit aloof but still able to function, feeling somewhat happy, suppressed)."

      "I had taken 25i multiple times in 1mg doses and unhappy with the experience I had 5 days prior I decided to kick it up a notch. At about 10:30 I stuck the two 1mg blotters in my upper lip and waited for the effects to kick in. I knew about vasoconstriction, but didn't really experience much at 1mg so I assumed it wouldn't be too bad at this does. I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't experience any, and had know weed to work well at preventing LSA vasonconstiction so I smoked some as well, about 30 minutes after taking the 25i.",
      "At first I just really felt like a strong stoned feeling. As time went on I became more anxious, and my body started tingling. I didn't have a watch with me after this time so I can't be sure how long this period lasted, but it seemed to last for awhile. During this period I took a walk, and soon objects started to distort blending together slightly. As well as lights became brights, and rays of light where cast fairly far past them. This was a state I was familiar with.",
      "As more time passed I started to become nervous, my heard began racing, and that started to frighten me. I know what vasoconstriction feels like, and I wasn't feeling too much effects from that, had I been sober I would have know to just ride it out. However I was not sober. My thought process was starting to deteriorate. I couldn't remember many things about who I was, or my life. I was panicking, I woke my mom up and had her drive me to the hospital. There I was asked my date of birth, and I could not remember it. Yet strangely while I could not remember when I was born, I was able to travel to periods in my life. I could think and experience things from my past. Visually I could see and feel them happening inside my head, though I had no control over where I was going. I struggled to think, I had the doctors reassure me I wasn't going to die. Which they did. My memory and perception were both terrible, I couldn't tell what was going on really. Objects were still swirling together. I was seeing very vivid fractal designs.",
      "Perhaps the most interesting part, were the closed eye visuals. I could not tell the difference between when my eyes were open or closed. I can't recall what exactly I saw, but it must have very closely resembled the real world, for I could not differentiate between the two. During this time I was asked several questions by the doctors, none of which I could answer properly. I didn't like them asking me these question, if someone said something to me I didn't like I started to dislike the person. Which is not something I ever normal do.",
      "The whole time the body load was a bit uncomfortable. It was like an uncomfortable orgasm going on throughout my body. It felt good and bad at the same time. Not of the tingling, or pains I had experience with vasoconstriction, and my veins seemed to be normal size as well as my hands were a healthy red color so I can only assume the feeling was a product of the psychological effects of the drug, and not any actual physical side effects. Though my memory wasn't very good, so I can't say for sure.",
      "Time was at a stand still, everything seemed to last for an eternity. I kept waiting for myself to die, for everything to end. Not sure of why I was alive, or what I was doing here. Yet I kept going. It was like I had no idea what life or my own consciousness was and I expected it to just cease at any moment.",
      "I remember at one point during the night I couldn't differentiate between words and tangible objects, and it seemed as if I could see words. See them, understand them. It was almost like I myself was a word, and as my thought process continued and I thought new things I became those new words.",
      "Other interesting quality was the headspace. Now I have heard this term before, but never had it described to me, so I am not sure if I am using it correctly. It is the word that bests fit though, sorry if it isn't the accurate term. It seemed that my mind was actually physically and I could walk around inside it. Which is how I got from one thought to the next. Perhaps this was why I had perceived myself to be words. It was like a big physically area inside my body that I had access to, and I could access any part of it I liked. Well that's what it seemed like, but as I mentioned before I could not control what thoughts came into my head.",
      "With my memory shot so badly, I assumed that I must have been an alien trapped inside a humans body. Obviously this was not the case, but I couldn't even really remember who I was, and this world seemed so foreign and strange to me, it really seemed like I must have been an alien.",
      "While I did not have a clock throughout most of the night. I distinctly remember seeing strong visuals at around 3 AM around when I finally got how and went to bed. So around four and a half hours in. Light seemed to make them stronger. In the dark it just seemed like rays coming out from my alarm clock and extending into the darkness. When I would periodically get up to go to the bathroom though, as soon as I turned on the light it was like everything in my bathroom was swirling together. Vivid fractals and blending patterns. The fractals at this time were more fluid than ever, and very dark green in color. It was a shade of green I had never seen before, and I didn't like it to tell the true. This went on til 6:30 AM. The effects very slowly dissipating. Once they were over my mind was still racing and it was very hard to get to sleep, though that was something I was used to.",
      "All and all it was very enjoyable, even with the doctors nagging me. Once I had their word I wasn't going to die, and I would be safe I stopped worrying, and when I did most negative aspects of the trip where gone. While I know it wasn't necessary to go to the hospital I am glad I went, because it helped me get out of the bad part of the trip. I have no idea what my mom thinks of all this, I don't want to talk to her about it again though I know it will come up. My philosophy on that though is I would rather be alive and have her upset with me, than Dead regardless of how she felt. And with the state of mind I was in I really did feel I was going to die before I got to the hospital.",
      "To be blunt the effects at 2mgs even with having taken the drug 5 days prior where vastly stronger than at 1mg. At 1mg I barely got any visuals. There was some rays casted off objects, and some fractals, but nothing vivid. And my perception of the world, and my thought process remained fairly normal. I was not prepared for how intense this trip would be. The effects were far more than twice as strong. Be careful when taking higher doses of these chemicals, I have taken it and other psychedelics before, but never experiences something quite like this. While I told my mother and the doctors I wouldn't do it again, I think I will. Though I never plan to take that high of dose with 25i again. If it wasn't for the racing heart rate which I think was caused by it, I don't think things would have gone out of hand at the beginning. Still a great experience though, and again despite my mom finding out and going to the hospital I think it was worth it.",
      "I wish I could put this better into words, but the psychedelic experience is something I have a lot of trouble describing. And my memory of the time isn't the best."

      "This was my first experience with shrooms. I had been trying to get my hands on some for months and finally the day had come for me to eat some shrooms. I was very eager to try them, with no fear of a bad trip at all. I purposely did not eat anything that day. I wanted to have an empty stomach. I arrived at my friends dorm at 3:30 in the afternoon. It was a beautiful day with barely any clouds in the sky. For the middle of February it was extremely hot. We consumed the mushrooms around 4pm. The 3 other people venturing on this trip were my good friend J and his two friends C and T. They were all experienced with mushrooms and aware that it was my first time. The shrooms tasted like shit, but we washed them down with some mountain dew.",
      "T+15mins... T decided that a bowl would be a good idea so we proceeded to smoke some very fine dank weed. When that bowl was cashed he quickly packed another one. I was feeling pretty high by the end of those two bowls.",
      "T+45mins... We have been sitting on the couch listening to some music, I can't remember what. Possibly some phish. I started to notice my vision was becoming distorted. I sat quietly and watched as my friends floor changed colors and intricate geometric shapes spun around. This did not frighten me in the least bit. I welcomed any type of visuals. The rug on the floor was no longer visible to me. I looked at the door and watched as it melted into the ground. I asked the guys if they were seeing anything, and they simply laughed at me. They told me to shut up because it was too soon to see anything. But I knew I was begining my trip.",
      "T+50mins... The group decided to take a walk outside. The sun was still shining and it looked great outside. Walking was an extremely fun activity. My body felt very light and my legs felt very jello like. Shortly after going outside we had a laughing attack. I had a huge grin on my face the entire time. I was laughing for no reason at all. I just felt so great!! Despite how warm it looked outside, it had gotten somewhat colder. Trees were changing color and size. The grass fields seemed to be talking to me, even spelling letters. I was having a blast!",
      "T+2hrs...  The walk was getting old so we headed back to J's room. Upon entering the room we discovered there to be company. There were five girls sitting around with L, J's roommate. People were trying to introduce each other, but I wasn't understanding it. I was seeing all types of shit. These strange girls were not who we wanted to trip with, so we quickly left. We went back outside in search of a room to chill in. We went to T's room and found more people there. We grabbed Pulp Fiction and headed out. Someone in his hall was playing LOUD ASS techno music and it was definitely having an impact on my senses. It was like a sensory overload. Damn these shrooms are fun!",
      "T+2hrs20mins... We arrive back at J's room and find that L has left. These sluts are in his room even though the owners are nowhere to be found! This is where things started to take a bit of a down hill. I would just like to say that psychedelics are wonderful things, especially when used responsibly. But the people you are around have a HUGE impact on your mood. I did not want to be with these girls. I had no idea who they were, and I was tripping pretty hard. At one point they asked me to change the channel on the tv. I walked upto it but could not see a damn thing. I stood there like an idiot for a minute or so and then gave up. I sat back down and felt like a jackass. I was imagining everyone laughing at me. I was even hearing things that were not being said. Someone put a Doors video in and I like the doors usually, but the music was fucking with me in a bad way.",
      "T+3hrs... This might be the worst part of the entire trip. The girls were still in the room, and I was still feeling very uncomfortable around them. I can only describe what happened as being stuck in a loop of thought. I kept thinking the same few thoughts. 'These girls really piss me off. I should just leave. Fuck it I'm leaving. I need to get gas and I don't have much money. What am I thinking, I'm too fucked up to drive anywhere. But these girls are pissing me off. Fuck it I'm leaving. I need to get gas, wait what am I thinking, I am too fucked up to drive.' I just kept thinking those thoughts over and over. I couldnt think about anything else. I kept looking at a LCD clock and time seemed to be going so slow. A minute seemed like it took an hour. I started to lose touch with reality. I started to think I was going insane. I was begining to become very afraid and I wanted to be able to think straight, but couldn't. I knew it was only a trip, and would be over, but when? Finally J kicked the girls out of the room, and I almost instantly was back to normal. Still tripping hard, but at ease now.",
      "T+4hrs... We are now watching Pulp Fiction. What a great movie! I suddenly realized that I had to call my mom to let her know when I would be home. I'm still in high school, with a very bitchy mother. She knows I do drugs and is very strict with me. I was really in no shape to call, but I had to. I was an hour late calling. She discovered that I was not with who I said I would be with all day. She wanted me home immediately, but I couldn't drive. So I told her I would be home after midnight. I was very glad I no longer had to worry about calling her. Sure I fucked it up pretty bad, I sounded like I was on something. But I felt too good to care.",
      "We smoked another 2 bowls when I returned. I was no longer seeing all that much, I just felt trippy. That was not the case for T. He stood up out of nowhere and just started to mumble something and tried to walk around the room. We all started laughing at him, so he asked us to take a walk outside with him. It was after eight and we were relaxing. Noone wanted to go. So he sat back down for a little. Soon enough he had another episode. Without any warning he threw up. I thought it was pretty late into the trip to throw up, but what do i know? He then said he wanted to go the bathroom because he had been pissing himself. Scared that the hallway would 'eat him alive' C went with him to the bathroom. When they came back C was laughing his ass off. It turns out that T was saying,'C am I pissing? Tell me if I'm pissing. I can't see anything man.' He ended up pissing himself on the way back to the room. He was pretty fucked up.",
      "The remainder of the night was spent in J's room just watching tv, smoking more pot, and drinking some beers. T passed out for a good bit of the night. When midnight rolled around I tried to start my car. It caught on fire!! So I had to call my already pissed off mom and tell her I couldnt drive home. My car was broke. She refused to come get me so I spent the night on J's couch.",
      "The next day even though I was in a good bit of trouble, I didnt seem to care. I felt as though I had found this secret. That life was beautiful no matter what happens. Life is a gift, and should never be taken for granted. I was depressed a few years ago, and almost killed myself. Boy have I come a long way from there. Everyday I thank God for giving me all I have. Life is not perfect, but it's still a whole lot of fun! I will never again hate life so much that I would want to take my own. Shrooms helped me to see this. It was like my eyes were finally wide open. I intend to trip with these little wonders again. I would suggest that anyone who is interested in shrooms, or any psychedelic, to investigate what you are getting yourself into first. They can be great fun, even life changing tools. Just don't be stupid and rush into something you are not ready for. It's called a trip for a reason. Once you embark upon it, you can't just quit halfway through. You're in it for the long haul. So have fun everyone, be safe, and remember that life is a beautiful thing!!"

      "This is an experience that I believe no human should go through and was the resulting cause of doctors that were too busy or didn't care about their patient's well being.",
      "In October 2006, my lower back problem started to get out of control, so I decided to go see my D.O. for some pain killers. She started me off with the usual NSAIDS, anti-inflammitory/codeine, tramadol. None of those seemed to help so she gave me 10mg hydrocodone/500 acteaminophen. I started off with 1 to 3 a day as needed but this turned into a problem since at the time, my lower back was still under a lot of stress from my daily activities. I only used them the days that the pain was unbearable so I wouldn't become dependent on them. Sadly this changed a few weeks later as the pain intensified and up until December I was on 20-30mg/day. Throughout the rest of December and Jan. 2007 I was on 40-60mg/day to keep the pain from being excrutiating. Throughout January I went to several orthapedic back surgeons, pain management doctors, and they all said that 50mg+ a day was too much to be taking especially for more than a few weeks. But regardless they just handed out more 10mg hydro scripts and all said the same thing 'try to not take as much'. This was complete bollocks because I had a serious back problem and these dr's were filling my bloodstream with simply the wrong chemical.",
      "In between doses I was getting anxiety and pain withdrawls which were pretty bad so I decided to get a second opinion about my pain management (this was actually the 5th doctor I've seen about my pain/meds). I told him what all the other doctors said and how they continually ignored my back problem and just threw countless 10mg hydro scripts at me. He was the first to look at my MRI and see that something was wrong, a bulging disc. No other doctor had the fucking brains to figure it out so they simply thought I was another junkie looking for opiates (I could tell the way some were talking to me and how they dismissed me out of their office). He told me that since hydro has such a short half life I was literally giving myself withdrawls every day with the current doses and that people really shouldn't be on it for more than a few weeks. He said most doctors that have half a brain move should have moved me to oxycodone for long term pain within 3 weeks, not 2 bloody months.",
      "He prescribed me 10mg oxycodone extended release and I stopped the hydrocodone dead cold. Even though I had the oxy to help mask some of the opiate withdrawl, the physical and mental pain I went through was ungodly. I have a very high resillience to pain (getting hypothermia in a frozen lake last year wasn't even close to this) and frankly too stubborn to go to the hospital because I didn't want to appear weak. but my god, I wanted to jump off a fucking building every time the pain level changed. Full body tremors ensued followed by the usual chills, and then my heart rate would jump to 115 BPM randomly even on the oxycodone and just sit there for hours, simply to piss me off. I'd get a shooting feeling starting from the top of my spinal cord through my circulatory system like I could feel the blood poking the inner walls of my veins, it was horrific. Can't sleep, can't move, can't even think about putting any type of food down my throat. The nausea is what fucking topped it all off because at that point I WAS ready to get to a hospital. The worst feeling out of all the opiate withdrawl ones is when just the back of my neck gets to be around 100 degrees and the rest of my body is cold and then it starts to make my entire head really hot and dizzy. Had a few bouts whens I almost would go unconcious as well. As an added bonus effect I got to deal with was the anxiety and depression which were worse than 60mg/day diazepam withdrawls which I went through a few years back.",
      "This is day four now and the effects are just -starting- to slowly subside. I called my prescribing dr of the oxy and he said come in and see me tomorrow about a higher dose and that he was sorry he couldn't see me over the weekend (worst 3 days of my life).",
      "To those of you who were wondering how I did somehow survive this, I used diazepam 5mg and lorezepam 2mg for when the anxiety spiked, clonidine .1mg as an anti-hypertensive, oxycodone 10mg 3 times a day (dr. didn't want me to go over that for now), cold packs/blankets, I think I also cleared an entire crate of vitamin water since I got so dehydrated too. My advice to everyone is don't stay on hydrocodone for more than a few weeks for pain and if you are seeking the opiate chronic euphoria get something with a much longer half-life like morphine, ms-contin, oxycodone."

      "A few weeks ago, I ordered a quantity of sinicuichi from an online distributor along with a few other herbs (wild dagga, dream herb, etc.). When the package arrived in the mail I was eccstatic. I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.",
      "Last night, I was with a few friends at my apartment when I decided to attempt to make sinicuichi extract, following the instructions on another's post.  On the post, the recommended amount to use to start was 10g, but I decided that since this was my first time to use less.  I took 6g of the plant material and boiled it in about a cup of water for about a half hour.  Once the water turned a dark brown color, I strained the leaves and boiled them again in fresh water.  Once this water turned brown, I added it to the previous water and boiled for a third time.  Once I had almost a cup of this dark brown, bitter liquid, I began to boil it down. I've heard of boiling this substance down to a shot-glass worth and gulping it down, but the taste is terrible and I wanted to try to get more potent effects by creating an extract.",
      "Once the water boiled down to about 50mL, a yellow film appeared on the side of the pot.  Once boiled even more, the remaining water turned into a brown goop at the bottom of the pot.  I allowed this 'goop' to cool and harden, and when it did I scraped the pot clean and put the results in a bag.  What I was left with looked almost like very cheap cannibis, and a decent amount of crystalline powder.  I am not sure if I boiled the liquid down enough, or even prepared the sinicuichi in the correct way, but all I knew was that I wanted to smoke it. ",
      "Time = 0",
      "I packed a pipe with a small amount of the substance, I would say about .15-.2 of a gram worth. My 3 friends and I then preceded to smoke it, and even with such a small amount the pipe went around the circle twice.  As it burned, the substance and ash hardened in the pipe allowing for an extra hit or two.  From the first hit, I felt it in my lungs, a heavy, thick-smoke feeling. ",
      "Time = +5 mins",
      "Within 5 minutes, I had an extreme light-headed feeling, and felt very similiar to being 'stoned'. We were all laughing at not much of anything and commenting on how the extract worked better than we thought it would.",
      "Time = +15 mins",
      "My friends passed out within another 10 minutes (granted we were drinking quasi-heavily before this, but that is besides the point).  As I walked into my room around 3, definitely still feeling effects, I hopped on the computer.  All was well. I felt light-headed and somewhat stoned and my chest felt heavy.",
      "Time =  +30 mins",
      "Rather suddenly, I began to feel cold. I put on an extra shirt, but it just made it worse. Within minutes I was full-blown shivering and decided it was best to lie down.  Before I could, the heaviness in my chest worsened, and I could feel my breathing passages shut tight like an asthma attack.'OK, don't panic,' I told myself, 'This is just from the smoke, it will pass in a few minutes.'  Not true.   Once I began to shiver, my lungs filled up with liquid.  I could only take a breath 1/3 of that of my normal breath and an attempt to breathe any harder caused extreme pain in the chest and made me feel as if I was about to vomit/faint.  I thought if I lied down it would go away, but it did not. The more that time passed, the harder it got to breathe. I struggled to gasp for air, taking the biggest breath I could, but still it got worse.  I stumbled into the bathroom at this point, unable to walk as my limbs were not functioning properly.  I sprawled out on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet (not one of my prouder moments) gasping for air for dear life.  My lungs were getting tighter and tighter and I found it almost impossible to breathe. The deeper breath I took the worse I felt.  For over an hour I laid on that floor, pleading with an unknown creator not to let me die in such a unglamorous fashion.  I was beginning to lose my grip and could feel darkness setting in. I thought that was it. ",
      "Time = +1 1/2 hours",
      "With my last ounce of strength I forced myself to drink from the faucet as my mouth was drier than sandpaper.  Doing so felt refreshing for a quick moment, then brought about extreme pain in the chest as if someone was squeezing me as hard as they could. I could only drink a mouthful.  I dragged myself back to bed. It was a little after 4 now.  The rest of the night was filled with me tossing and turning every 30 seconds trying to find a position that allowed me to breath easier, but there was none.  I stared at the clock on my nightstand for hours, watching minutes tick away, all the while wondering if this was the picture wrap for yours truly.  I thought about how much I still wanted to accomplish in life and kept hoping that my lungs might suddenly open back up and I could breathe again normally. That never happened. Instead I was forced to rip off my clothes as they had become drenched in sweat, and all the while I was shivering uncontrollably. I thought with the water in my lungs that I was developing pneumonia. That still could be the case.",
      "Time = +10 hours",
      "The time was about 11:30 am now, and breathing got slightly easier.  I did not sleep a wink all night.  My mouth is so dry my lips were stuck together and I had to tear them open. Deep breaths are still impossible, but I can take slightly deeper breaths than I could before. My girlfriend called around 12:30 but I could only squeak out a few words.  She's on her way now to take me to the hospital. I don't know what I'm going to tell them.  As I write this it is 2:30 in the afternoon. I did not sleep all night. I cannot move my limbs well, my mouth is still bone-dry and I have a terrible taste in my mouhth.  I can still only breathe a small amount, enough to keep me living.  I don't know if my breathing passages are closed (like an asthma attack which I've gotten very infrequently, but this was no asthma attack), if my lungs were filled with water, or if one of my lungs collapsed (it happened to a friend of mine 3 times already). I am honestly extremely surprised I made it through the night.  When I finally got up my friends had vanished back to their own apartments, but I was never able to talk to them to find out how they reacted. When I do, I will post their answers. For now, I will be bed-ridden until tomorrow when I have work (provided I make it that long). I feel like I have an extreme fever, and am only breathing with a quarter of a lung.",
      "Last night was the worst experience of my life. I had heard so many glowing reports about sinicuichi that I was so excited to try it. Perhaps I had a bad batch.  Or perhaps I prepared it completely wrong (it was my first extraction). Rather still, it could just be my own personal reaction to it due to my chemical composition. I'm just happy I didn't take more than a hit or two, otherwise I might not be here to write this.  I warn to take EXTREME CAUTION with this herb unless you know exactly what you're doing (I didn't).  Maybe this will be the best herb you ever try, or maybe like me you'll find yourself paying homage to the porcelain god, struggling to take every breath, wondering if each would be your last, trying to fight blacking out.  I just had to write this experience on here to warn others, because what happened to me last night I would not wish upon my worst enemy."

      "It's now been just over a month since I had my first encounter with Salvia Divinorum. I've spent the last five weeks trying to put my thoughts together on this experience, which has not been an easy task. My experience was truly profound, enlightening, and utterly horrifying. Coming to terms with exactly what happened in those 6-7 minutes of my life in this human form is difficult as I'm left now with nothing but my human perceptions and recollections of the event. I understand that this is a feeling common with the drug, and I write this with the certainty that only those others who were on the same stuff truly understand, now enlightened. The following account is my recollection of the experience.",
      "Setting:",
      "I was spending New Years with some college buddies in my home state of Georgia. One of my friends offered me the chance of trying some salvia, having tried it once and shared it with a few others. I was at the time under the impression, as many still seem to be, that it would be something similar to marijuana, which I've become very familiar with over the past few years. Maybe this is due to its legality, which is absurd considering the paranoia of being a pothead, which is completely taboo nowadays. Anyway, I was curious and I'll try anything once. Understanding the environment is essential to understanding the events which unfolded, so the important things are these: We had just finished smoking a joint of high-mid marijuana, I was peaking on this while myself and three friends present were talking while listening to Pink Floyd's The Wall.",
      "Of the three others present, two had taken the drug previously, one being the friend in possession, the other a housemate who had only achieved mild visual affects. I am still uncertain as to the level of hallucination (horrible term, forgive me) achieved by my provider, if he broke through as I did. However, remember that at this time I had absolutely no idea what was to be expected from this drug, having been misinformed as to its nature.",
      "Ingestion:",
      "Since I was the most experienced smoker, I took the task of constructing the water bong. I used a 2-liter cola bottle, filling the bowl about half full (the suggested amount, also an incredibly large dose) with 13x Salvia Divinorum extract. In the kitchen sink, I filled the entire bottle with water, and proceeded to hold the flame to the bowl as a muddy light brown smoke filled the bottle. With my very excited friends just behind me, we quickly skipped our way back into the bedroom. My friends began to speak with raised voices, instructing me, 'Huff it... you have to take it all...,' 'the whole thing...' I told them to start the record and I took the biggest breath that I could, inhaling almost all of the contents in the bottle. I coughed, but it wasn't too intense... I prepared to take the rest as my ecstatic friends yelled at me, 'Take the rest! Do it!' I finished the rest in the second hit, but my friends weren't satisfied, still instructing me to take even more from the bong. Just to satisfy them, I breathed in on more huge breath of dirty air, now tasting the bitterness of the extract, and vomited...",
      "Luckily, there was a trash can right in front of me, but needless to say, there was some excitement over this, but I was at this moment distracted... Almost as soon as I started to feel an intense tingling running up my body (and out of my mouth), my sitters and I all recognized that the drug was taking effect. I sat down trying to relax, a little embarrassed, as my friend said, 'This is it...'. I remember little more at this point as in a few seconds, I was gone.",
      "The Breakthrough:",
      "This is the difficult part of the account where I attempt, as many others have before me, to describe the end of life and identity, the ego-death. There nothing but a sensation at first, not of being ripped apart but of having been ripped apart. I couldn't say that I had been ripped apart, as in a million piecesthere were no pieces because there was nothing the pieces would consist of... I had no physical body. The sensation now gave way to awareness, and I had a sense that I HAD BEEN something with a physical body which was suddenly extinguished by a strong force pulling to the right. There was a sort of two-dimensional plane which I was pushed through rightward, and as I went through I lost all perceptions, memories, and sensations of my life in human form on this earth. There was no pain, it was instantaneous. But still, I was only conscious in the most basic sense... aware, not consciously thinking these thoughts, but perceiving them. It is not unlike the state of waking up from a dream with the memory of it still very present as the body adjusts to the state of waking life... except my life was the dream, and as I was suddenly 'awakened' all sense of that life was gone.",
      "Death and Hell:",
      "Within the void I soon began to see an image, that of my three sitters looking at me, smiling... very hazy at this point, and there is a green aura present. I recognize them, but they have no names to me.  I cannot identify them, but I know them... and I can sense that they know me.  They are sentient beings and they are communicating with me... and they are me.  Rather, we are of the same existence.  Here in this void there is nothing and everything, everything that is, ever was or will be is perceived, and seen for what it is.  I was now existence in its purest forma part of everything that exists, and time was irrelevant.  The entire history of human existence is, in reality, just a moment in time.  I was now seeing this first-hand, and time was revealed as the illusion that it is.  Here, in this moment, there was all the time that had ever occurred... and I felt it... I KNEW it.  Some of you understand... but for those who don't, think of something you know to be true, and someone trying to convince you otherwise.  If someone told you You don't have a hand you'd think them silly... You look at your hand, you move it... You KNOW it's there, what it feels like to have it...",
      "The image of my three sitters became increasingly clear... There was just this image... moving... spinning... And soon the image expanded and was not just an image, but an actual moment in time which I was perceiving.  I came to understand that this was an impactful moment, bearing some significance.  What was it?  I tried to concentrate on exactly what it was but I could not put together a single thought.  I was still in a state of total perception, gaining information as if being SHOWN and not by conscious thought.  I became aware that this image was from a time I had spent in a life which no longer existed.  This was accompanied by an immense feeling of guilt, that I had somehow been foolish for living as I did.  However, I still had no recollection of life or why I should feel this way, but I did nonetheless.  At this point, as this one moment expanded, I was becoming quite rapidly aware of my stateI had lived this moment... and I was living this moment.  I was contemplating this fact when I became aware that I was contemplating, and that I WAS.  I realized that I was me, or that I had been and wasn't anymore and the first crystallized human thought came to me... I DIED. ",
      "I tried to speak this thought, forgetting that I didn't have a mouth, and I found that although I couldn't form the words properly, I could communicate to the these smiling faces before me what I felt.  My friends would delight in telling me later that what I actually said was, I died-ded.  It was very hard to communicate this because as this moment occurred it was only a moment, and it was repeating itself over and over... and over.  As soon as I could crystallize a thought and attempt to speak the moment would revert back again and I was stuck.  It was not simply feeling like time isn't passing...  It was like NOTHING ELSE IS HAPPENING... Just this... over... and over... THIS IS IT.  It was accompanied by the intense fear of never being able to experience anything else ever again...  This is the closest thing to Hell I've ever experienced.  It is the most intense deja vu, which cannot be described in words.  It's as if you're reading a book when you're really tired, and you can't help it but you keep reading the same line over and over again and you can't help it but you keep reading the same line over and over again and you can't help it but... understand?  Some of you do.",
      "Coming Back:",
      "It is interesting to note that at this time, Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb was playing on the turntable, with the haunting guitar solo screaming out as the moment of my death stretched out into forever.  With each harmonic chordal change in the music, the moment in time began its repetition.  My friends were at the time telling me to relax, that I didn't die.  I was not getting any of this, except the knowledge that these people who appeared as friends which I knew in that life wanted me to feel ok... that there was nothing to worry about.  At this time I thought that what I was experiencing was a sort of fleeting memory of life, one that would soon vanish as quickly as it came when I was hit by the freight train to oblivion.  But the moment continued expanding, growing longer with each repetition and each time, revealing more to me.",
      "I felt as though I was coming back from a future point in time... back to where I was me in this life.  I was remembering more and more what it was like to be me and the thought of having lost it all was heartbreaking... I had not DONE anything, not referring to how it ended, but to my life as a whole... My whole life was nothing if not just a grain of sand in an endless desert, and I couldn't believe it: I was coming back.  There was a sense of relief (not being dead, go figure) but I had trouble convincing myself of my own existence.  The place that I was coming back to was the same place that I had left... The bedroom, the music, my friends looking and smiling as if nothing had happened.  But something had happened and I then realized whatSalvia Divinorum.  Until now I had completely forgotten about taking the drug.  I had to do something... something to change my settings... to make something ELSE happen...  I had come back, but to when?  I felt my body again, I ran my hands over my chest, feeling again for the first time.  When did I come back to?  Where is the vomit?  Didn't I throw up?  Is this before that happened?  These were all actual thoughts I was having...",
      "I moved over to the bed... I had to leave the spot where I sat...  I had to see something ELSE.  I asked how long I was gone... just a few minutes.  As I sat there, watching my friends delight in watching me freak the fuck out, I harbored horrible thoughts... That my friends KNEW what had just happened, that I would experience what I did.  I had the sense that they had known this all along, and it was terrifying.  It was as if by taking this drug I had become aware of some huge cosmic dark secret, one that was truly horrible and yet totally ironic... The joke was in being forced back into this reality after having it stripped completely from you... Forced back into nothing but limited human perception, and the delusion which it is.  I was completely in shock at this point, and I looked at my friends expressing something like, Why did you show me that?... I didn't want to see that.  Although I harbored these hostile feelings (especially towards the provider) for a couple hours afterwards, I now understand that this is a common symptom of salvia.  As the effects of the drug slowly wore off over about 15 minutes, I tried to talk about it and tell my friends what had happened to no avail.  All I could get out for awhile was... I thought I died..."

      "A friend had used some sage in South America and she told me about it. I decided to check it out and got it from one of the many online sources. I tried it once, a few weeks ago with a sitter but I did not smoke enough.",
      "Last night I was alone, which was plan dumb. Find someone you really love who really never or rarely freaks you out. I also suggest a set up meditation, though I did a little bit, it was not enough. I was anxious before I did it. That should have clued me in. My reasoning for moving forward was a desire to 'see what I was made of'. I suggest not being this way. I got my ass kicked for the foolishness. But then again, why else take something so strong outside of a ritual experience with a culture to put the thing into and a guide etc... This is an entire other thing to write about.",
      "So, alone, I filled a bowl with screen and hit it three times. I was on the floor as it is suggested and I re-assert this suggestion. Be on the floor when this hits. It cherried nicely. As the third hit was being held everything went away. I got the little buzz first, for a second, it was similar to my first experience with sage where I did not smoke enough. I thought, oh am I gonna get off this time....I was floored. I have read you should close your eyes. I couldn't or I didn't. My field of vision was transformed into a bizzarre living cavorting thing made of little fragments of details from the last moment before the drug hit. They moved in gear like shapes and the whole world was breathing, space was infinite in  my apartment, the walls were gone, or see-through, I felt like I was being pulled to the floor, I could not get up, there was a man I know in my room all of a sudden,(he was not 'there') I saw farther than I could see, my eyes open on the floor, there I watched time elapse outside of my visual field, things happened with my family odd things transpired time passed, and anxiety filled all the spaces.",
      "I have been thinking about serious things in my life and I suggest not doing this drug when there is an ounce of anxiety in your life. Well, at least when there isn't a ton of it. The anxiety became the world with the gears moving the walls missing, sound like in a huge funnel, breathing, space on forever. This was about 30 seconds or a minute and then I looked at the clock and just thought 'GOD DAMN' there was alot of god damn last night. I couldn't believe how high I had been. I stood up, still high, but not as high. Everything was strange, out of place, charged with emotion, slightly anxiety coated. I was scared that I was too high, that 'doctors' were coming already to take me away. I lay back down and babbled into a tape recorder. Within the hour I was down, and by two hours later I wasn't even too revved up.",
      "Today I feel odd. After an early acid trip when I younger I remember feeling 'different' altered, and I was sad because I liked the 'old me' and I was scared. I have a similar thing today though as the night approaches I feel more like 'myself' whoever that is. I realized this morning that when I fuck with time and space in my head it doesn't make me feel closer to other people. It can be a little alienating. The worst thing I have experienced, though it too is wearing off, is a feeling under everything that NOTHING matters. And I am not that kind of person at all. Be careful with this drug. It's a freight train experience, I imagine somewhat like cliff diving or bungee jumping in its extremity."

      "I am in my 40s with about 30 years drug experience under my belt, including MDMA (I used to sell it before it was 'scheduled' in the US) and GHB (I mention it because of its MDMA-like and Neurontin-like high), and almost everything else (heavy emphasis on psychedelics). My general health is excellent and I am in very good physical condition. The only meds I am taking are Buspirone and citalopram for GAD, a condition I have had chronically off and on since childhood, unfortunately. My state of mind was one of relaxed amusement at the time of the experience, and the purpose of the experience was to see if there was recreational, social-enhancement, relaxation, and/or euphoric potential for Neurontin based on the reports of a good friend (who provided me with the dose).",
      "The experience took place on 18 June 2003, in San Francisco.",
      "I spent most of the time with a very good, very drug savvy friend, who provided me with the dose and took the Neurontin with me. My friend and I began at a breakfast place in the Haight Ashbury, and then on to most of the afternoon in Golden Gate Park, then to my friends apartment. From there a walk home and then out later to a bar with friends.",
      "It took about an hour for the first dose of 1500mg to kick in, and it felt more like a subtle, but definitely noticeable, mood shift. I was expecting a rush, but that did not happen. At about 1 1/2 hour we did another 1500mg by 2 hours we were feeling the full effect. Did a couple 'boosters' over the next 2 hours and I felt the effects until about 10:30 in the evening about 10-11 hours total.",
      "Our interaction consisted mainly of my friend becoming very chatty, which is fine because she is very interesting and I was happy to let her do most of the talking. We talked for hours mostly about social/political and media-related observations, and thoughts and feelings about art and pleasure, and frank, insightful observations about ourselves and people we know. Interactions with other people we encountered were Ecstasy-like in that they were warmer and more open than usual and with a feeling of ease around the limits of mine and others needs attached to any interaction, as well as feeling like there was an easy and appropriate way through every interaction.",
      "The effects of the drug were very mildly sedating and, like Ecstasy, somewhat sensuous on a body level. I felt most of the anxiety held in my body and any body judgment issues fall away. I was easier to 'just Be' on a body level. I often feel inclined to walk when in this state, and this time was no different.",
      "It also felt very good to lay on a blanket in the park with my friend. I got a bit of the 'rubber legs' feeling that has been reported as a side effect of Neurontin, but not the stagger effect that has also been reported. Colors seemed a little deeper and all the senses a bit magnified in a pleasurable way. Unlike Ecstasy or even GHB, there was no 'edge' - no jaw clenching, no eyeball twitching, or anything like that, in fact, nothing speedy or edgy or buzzy in any way. Neurontin was amazing in that respect, actually. The come-down was the easiest Ive ever experienced on any substance - more like a subtle, gentle mood shift than anything else. Unlike Ecstacy, on Neurontin I can become hungry and eat and become sleepy and nap.",
      "Neurontin put me in a very easy, open mood a very good mood. Like Ecstacy, kind of a warm neutrality, where all judgments seemed 'appropriate' and issue-free. My insights while on it revolved around the utopian desire for humanity to design life as a celebration from birth to death, where work is hyper-efficient and minimized, and leisure and pleasure is strived for and maximized.",
      "In conclusion, its a lot like a single dose of E without the rush, the edge, or the crash. I have never experienced such an easy on and easy off on any drug before. The occasional, recreational use of the drug is probably a lot different than the prescribed therapeutic experience, and I wonder if it is probably wise to not do it too often as the recreational benefits might decrease. Apparently the recreational dose is fairly high. Still it lasts longer than E and is much cheaper at about $14 a dose. Probably not a good drug for dancing all night, but a very nice daytime high."

      "One night I was snooping through my fathers medicine cabinet, and viola! There was a bottle of about 50  Buprenorphine pills. I decided to take about 6 or 7 out of this nearly full bottle, in hopes that he would not notice. I had heard of the brand name of this drug before, (suboxone), so I went onto the internet to do some research, and found that it is a very long lasting opiate, used to get people off of heroin. And was generally taken sublingualy, or placed under the tongue until dissolved.",
      "I read another report that said the pill was crushed and placed under the tongue so I crushed one 2mg tablet and placed it under my tongue. Right after I did this, I hopped in the shower and waited for the effects to come on. About 15-20 minutes into the shower I noticed that I started to get very 'spacey' and out of it. I remember my eyes drifting from one tiny water droplet to another, and focusing on how the light hits each one. After that I got this strange urge to just sit down. So I sat for about 30 minutes and then decided I was bored of that.",
      "After my shower, it was about 11 PM, and I went into the other room to watch some television. I was sort of expecting a more intense high, more like when I tried heroin, methadone, and oxycodone. With this in mind I decided to take another 2 mg tablet. At this time I did not want to be bothered by crushing up the pill again and holding it under my tongue, so I just took it with some water. I wasn't quite sure whether it would work this way or not, but I didn't think that it would have any negative effects.",
      "About and 2 hours have passed now, and I am really feeling a strong body high. Everything was numb, and almost vibrating. I was having trouble walking from room to room. Although I wasn't doing anything at all, other than watching television and going onto the internet, I was very content and happy. At this time, I noticed a little bit of nausea coming on, so I went into my room with my ipod, and lied down on my bed for a while.",
      "So lets say that about 4 hours have past now, and I am really feeling that normal opiate high that I know and love. I ended up staying in my bed for about 3 more hours just listening to music, not necessarily awake or sleeping. All I can describe my feeling were being in 'heaven' for the rest of the night. That is until I decided to get up for whatever reason. As soon as I got out of bed, I was so sick to my stomach I couldn't take it. I ended up getting a drink the going back into bed. As soon as I lied back down I felt fine, and my nausea went away. I fell asleep some time after that, just to wake up in about a half an hour. This cycle went on for the rest of the night.",
      "So at about 7 AM I got out of bed to go into the living room to watch some television. The nausea was still very prevalent whenever I moved. I was still pretty high and remember thinking to myself: wow, this drug last forever! Throughout the rest of the day, the effects slowly tapered off, but the nausea stayed all the way untill the next night, about 24 hours."

I immediately got REAALY dizzy, INTENSELY Dizzy, and my voice sounded like it had been taped and the recording slowed down.  Eveyrthing sounded really tinny, like a cheap reverb on a guitar amp.  It lasted for about 2 minutes.  It was mildly amusing.  I did it a few more times just to see. ",

I had planned to take X again, so that was the first thing I was looking for.  Security confiscated my shopping bag of water, but let me keep my smokes. I got into the door and met up with M, K, Dee, Beezle, Bi, Hows, J, and Hed.  Hows got the X for us, it was two for $12, 'double stack' Blue Crosses.  I took two and so did nearly everyone else with the exception of M, K, and Beezle.",

      "I finally hit, I could feel the tingle creeping up my spine, and began to instinctively bob my head to the music.  Five Minutes later I was swamped with it.  It was beautiful, I was covered in vibrating particles of bliss, and felt as if I wasn't even sitting on the floor.  Shortly thereafter I felt the need to burp, and it wouldn't come out.  The longer I couldn't burp the more I felt like my throat was getting closed up.  I gagged...  I realized I was going to puke.  It wasn't in my stomach, (the feeling that is), I just knew it was going to happen.  I stood up walked to the trash, and vomited.  The whole experience wasn't like puking with mushrooms or alcohol, it felt GREAT.  For a few minutes I thought I just puked my buzz away, but it came back.",
      "People who don't go to raves don't understand them, you can tell them, but they won't believe it.  People really are that nice, I was offered water every two minutes, given back massages by completely random people, got lightshows all the time, and returned the favor also.  I enjoy being nice to people.",
      "Things just felt great, even sober I have to say that I would be having a good time there with everyone.  My mouth started to hurt from the gum that I was chewing on.  I followed Bi around for a bit and finally got to know him, it was the first time I met him.  We ended up starting a little love fest in our corner of the room, and I laid for most of the next two hours kissing random women and girls, and writhing together on the floor.  Even though I was highly aroused, I just didn't get an erection.  I had only wanted one for a short while, but my attention span was pretty small, and I ended up using my mouth.  It was a bad choice that I would have made while sober, but I wasn't sober so it was even more fun for me.  There is something weird about the sensation of being so close to somebody, the smell, the heat on your face, the taste, the skin.  It just seems perfect.  She was a random person, and she was on X too.  When she was thoroughly satisfied, we both ended up giggling and laughing and saying thank you at the same time.  I invented a few new tricks to play on people who are rolling or shrooming that are based on my hypnotism techniques, but inspired and invented while I was rolling.  These only really work if one has the voice and the technique to work it.  I learned about hypnotic voices in books and on the internet.",

      "This is my full blown trip, with many hallucinations. This is the real deal.",
      "Me and my 2 friends had been hoping that our guy would have ecstasy all week, but by Thursday, we were getting kinda annoying and wanted to experience something. Another friend tried to get us vicodin, but he was out of that too, so he recommended benadyrl.",
      "After school, we got on the bus and took it down to the local CVS and went in and bought 2 packets of 48 benadryl capsules. It was surprisingly easy actually, I was expecting to have to make up a story, but we got them, along with a couple powerades to wash it down. We started our mile walk home, talking about what we anticipated this to be like, all very excited. When we got to friend 1s house (3:30pm), his dad wasnt home and wasnt supposed to be until late so we all opened our packets and split it, 20 pills each (500 mg) and downed them all at once. We went into the other room and watched some TV.",
      "Me and friend 1 had done ecstasy a couple times each before, but friend 2 had never had anything. In past times, mine has always been the one to kick in first, and sure enough it did. After about an hour (4:30) I suddenly felt a weird twitch in my fingers and suddenly felt happy. None of us knew what to expect from this new drug. They were all laughing at me trying to stand up, then losing my balance and falling over but I was still fully conscious and knew what was going on, but boy was I excited. Then I suddenly felt so unbelievably tired and almost fell out of my chair wanting to sleep so badly, but knowing I had to stay awake to experience this.",
      "By now my friends were beginning to feel it too, and I had a slight headache, but was beginning to trip. One of the first things I did was going to the bathroom, which hurt very much for some reason, and was the first of many trips to the bathroom. Then I came out, starting to feel the full effects. I had the first hallucination. In my friends house, he has a picture of a dog and as I stared at it, it started to move, nothing really just like it was shaking and there were tons of weird lines around it that were kinda blurry. Then friend 1 said he could see the lines too, but allover the walls and on the computer screen.",
      "They werent feeling the full effects yet, and were trying to mess with me by throwing things at me which really freaked me out and knocked me over, even if it was just a piece of paper. For the first few hours I felt kinda hyper and couldnt stop walking around, kinda expecting this to be like e. One thing that was really starting to piss me off was that when ever I tried to read anything, my eyes would go cross-eyed, and I couldnt stop it. I couldnt read anything, not even the computer screen. I went into the kitchen and allover the fridge and on the dryer and washer I saw these little black bugs, more like tiny spots actually, but the guy that told us to take benadryl said I would probably see them.",
      "After that I just remember sitting in a chair with my 2 friends around me, trying not to fall asleep, broken up by me going to the bathroom. The whole time we were sitting their, I seemed like I had been knocked out and I would suddenly jump up, not knowing if I had fallen asleep. What I think happened was I was in a state where I was so out of it, that I had my eyes open, but I was basically sleeping. While in that state, the tiniest sounds would set me off and I was told that every time anything made the smallest sound I would jump up and say WHAT THE FUCK WHO DID THAT WHAT WAS THAT!?!?",
      "Then we all started to wake up and talk, and walk around a bit. It seems like what anyone said, would happen. Friend 2 was sitting in a chair still and was staring at a fake dog that was life size. He said, Look the dog is winking and sure enough, I looked at it and the dog was winking, right at me. We knew we were hallucinating and laughed a bit. Then we sat down again, TV off, but friend 1 was laughing and smiling at it and later told me that we were watching VH1, and I had to explain to him that the TV was off.",
      "We were all fully conscious and gathered around the computer, when my mom called me! Im not fully sure what I said, but I did say I was heading home. Walking, in the dark, alone. The first thing that happened, right as I walked out the door, is I saw three guys from my baseball team, playing lacrosse in the neighbors driveway. I didnt notice it wasnt real. Then, only like 20 feet later, I saw 2 people (girl and boy) holding hands and running up towards me. The guy stopped right in front of me and started to rub a tree. I was about to say, Dude are you high right when he disappeared. Then I got down to the road and luckily made it across even with it being rush hour traffic. I kept on walking on my journey home, still not noticing that I was actually hallucinating at most of the things I saw. I was walking down the sidewalk, and I kept forgetting what road I was on and kept thinking I had to turn around and go the other way.",
      "After about 6 stops and 6 times I tried walking the other direction, I made it to the end and now I had to cross a large patch of grass. From one side of it, I saw two white Great Danes (not real) sitting right next to each other, starring at me. Oddly, I wasnt scared at all and just kept walking towards them. When I got within 5 feet of them they both scattered in separate directions and I kept walking. Now I am on a trail that I have walked millions of times. Its a paved walking trail that goes through the middle of the woods, over to my development where I live. After walking for a few minutes, I see three friends from school, a guy and 2 girls (not real). They all looked normal and the guy was listening to his iPod. I asked, Hey what are you listening to and it seemed like the sound of my own voice made them disappear. That time I noticed that that was a hallucination.",
      "Now I had to cut off the path and walk straight into the woods. But right before I stepped off, I looked down the path and saw another couple, with a lot of clothing on, walking 2 German Shepards (not real). I walked into the woods, pitch black, and somehow made it across the stream, and to the other side-my back yard. I walked to the front door and as I started up the stairs, I notice my recycling bin was right their, and it was filled with wreaths (not real). I took no notice and walked up the stairs.",
      "I got out my key and kept forgetting which one was to open the door, or even how to use them, so I just rang the doorbell and my brother came to let me in (7:00pm). I went up stairs to my room and unpacked my backpack, took off my jacket, ect. I came back down to go on the computer and even though my mom wasnt home yet, I kept thinking she was and I was trying to act as normal as possible. I went on AIM and started talking to friend 1. I tried to tell him about my hallucinations while I was walking home but I kept forgetting to tell him and decided to just go back upstairs.",
      "I had to do a few chores like empty the garbages and came back downstairs to get a garbage bag, but forgot what I came down for and went back upstairs. I went up and down trying to get a garbage bag like 4 times until finally I kept saying garbage bag out loud so I could get one. This thing of forgetting things was really getting on my nerves. I went back upstairs, into my moms room to empty her garbage. It was dark. When I was filling the bag, I looked towards the doorway and saw another guy I knew from school (not real). I said What are you doing here and because he dont particularly like each other I walked up to him and pushed him into the wall, then he disappeared. I stood at the top of the stairs, garbage bag in one hand, and starred at the wall in front of me for several minutes. The little black bugs reappeared. I walked down to the garage and put the garbage in the bin and stuck it outside. Now I remembered that I had to bring the recycling in so I went to where I thought I saw it, but it wasnt their. I looked all around the street and still couldnt find it so I just went inside. By now its 8 pm and Im on the verge of falling over from exhaustion. I went up to bed and fell asleep within 10 minutes.",
      "The next morning I woke up to my alarm, 5:50 am, and shot up, still tired as hell even though I got almost 10 hours of sleep. I got ready and got in the car with my mom who I hadnt seen for the past 24 hours. I felt really shitty but I asked her where the recycling bin was and she said it was right in front of the garage. I asked her if she had thrown away any wreaths and she looked at me funny and said no. I was still somewhat under the influence and felt like I had a hang over, even though I had no alcohol the night before. I went to school and talked about the night before with friend 1 and the guys who suggested it. Friend 2 had skipped because he felt so bad. Now I was starting to realize that a lot of the things I saw the night before were not real. I didnt feel normal at all that day, I felt extremely tired and completely off track. I didnt start feeling myself again until about 4 pm. I recapped the last 24 hours and noticed that much of it was a blur.",
      "We all under estimated this drug BIG time, I think we should have tried 400mg instead. Weve still got 36 pills left from the box of benadryl and me and friend 1 plan on using it up sometime soon when we will be safe."

      "We took the blotter over to my girlfriends appartment to try it out.",
      "As soon as the blotter was on my tounge my suspicions were even greater, because I had never ate acid so bitter. A taste almost like copper.",
      "About 45 minutes after eating the blotter and smoking some buds with everyone I could feel the eerie body high creeping up my back and patterns in the wall and carpet became more graphic.",
      "Colors are very vivid and the lights seem to be becomming brighter.",
      "Soon we grow weary of sitting in a small apartment and we decide to take a walk, we couldent have been outside long before everything started to happen. A couple of my friends had stepped in dog shit while we were walking, and when we all figured out what had happened hysteric laughter ensued.",
      "We were all rolling around in the street laughing like crazy people when someone thought if sober people saw us, we might freak them out.",
      "We went back inside probably an hour and a half after we first took the doses. By this point were all tripping pretty hard, and we decide to all start drawing. This went on for hours. The way the colors seemed to pour out of the pastel was so beautiful and amazing. Everything seemed to be flowing together.",
      "After some time spent with the crayons, it seemed that the drugs had shifted gears. All of the free flowing lines I was drawing in the beginning were looking more and more like the scribbles of some kindergardener. I felt very tense and I kept breaking the crayons in half when I would try to hold them.",
      "When I got up and stopped drawing it seemed that everyone was in the same boat as me. The coloring had become to much so we just layed around listening to music. I could see the waves of sound comming from the speakers and hitting objects, wich then started to sway to the music. After dancing around the apartment with blankets tied to us like capes, we continnued to lay around the place for quite a while. And eventually felt like we were starting to come down. The rest of the trip lasted for some of the next day. Everyone agreed that we were still feeling something pretty much all the next day.",
      "The DOC was a strange experience much like LSD can be. It took me deep into my mind... Which can be really enjoyable or quite scary.",

      "I am writing to voice my positive experiences with Wellbutrin.  I became addicted to Adderall in senior year of high school in order to make straight As.  I did, and went on to a great college, but that's not the point.  My addiction was so bad that I started taking it from friends and I even got arrested for it once.",
      "Anyways, Wellbutrin has made the appeal of uppers literally non-existent.  I have no desire to obtain directly or otherwise stimulants of any kind, aside from a free line of yay.  I am SO happy that's amphetamines are OUT of my life. The quality of my life has improved so greatly.  So I am now a few months into Wellbutrin, and aside for an occasional rash on my arm or something it has done MUCH more than it is prescribed for. It gives me a natural boost throughout the day, no jitters or euphoric high, just a pleasant natural energy.  It helps me concentrate better than amphetamines because I am not so easily distracted like I used to be when I was wired.  It also completely eliminated any pleasure from smoking a cigarette.  I was only an occasional smoker, but I literally could not get any buzz or relaxation from them and as a result I cut them off entirely.  It does a mildly satisfactory job of curbing my appetite.  It also increases my sexual pleasures.  In summary, Wellbutrin is a miracle drug!"

      "Ill introduce myself as K.  Over the last 5 years I've experimented with a numerous quantity of mind expansion including weed, meth, morning glory seeds, ether, DXM, diet pills, Adhd stimulants, barbiturates, copious amounts of iv coke,  benzodiazapines, narcotics, and the most sinister intoxicant of all... women.  On a daily basis I take effexor, smoke bud, drink. I cant function without my uppers, the downers are strictly for fun.  All this dope yet somehow I consider myself a happy person with all wits and IQ intact. ",
      "My faithful friend M is every bit as psycho as me.  One day while burning CDs from a college computer (M and I do NOT go to college) I was browsing on the internet and remembered that Ms Darvocet was on its last refill.  I was compelled to conjure up a new pharmaceutical suggestion to relay to his doctor (he was running from the cops after a drug deal without shoes and acquired frostbite which caused nerve damage).  The oh-so-naive doctors have been fueling me, M, and whoever has cash, with pharmaceutical dope for the last 2 years and will continue to do so forever.   I did some studying and stumbled upon gabapentin.  Three anxious days later I find myself snickering I always get what I want from those M.D.s. ",
      "It was noon, I was in a motivated mood having just got off the phone with a Devine female requesting I go party with her  time to get sauced out.  Script in hand we drove his 2006 Nissan to the pharmacy with a liter of pop (the carbonation dissolves pills faster).  When he came out I suggested we start with two, he inquired we take 4 each, somehow we took five each.  Ill not forget the bright, orange, almost intimidating appearance of the pill.  We returned to my house to take my effexor and cigarettes which are both vital to my mental clarity and stability. ",
      "M is a speed freak in more ways than one.  A forty mile trip was ahead of us and he consequently thought 95 MPH was necessary.  Upon arrival and prior to our rendezvous went to Wal-mart to waste time. Midway though our two hour shopping and about 2 hours past dosing up M says these pills are bunk. I reply Indeed.   Fifty cents worth of pennies were rolled across the store for the sheer beauty of looks on peoples faces.  I talked to a Scottish chic and got a phone number. ",
      "As we left I was hit by a colorful, exhilarating disorientated shock from a tranquilized rush.  The Nissan looked like a three-dimensional photograph as I get in.  I felt very sociable, and started spouting off every joke and every topic that came into my head.  I felt very high but still maintaining focus.  The Gabapentin hits M as well, judging by his worse-than-usual driving. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  We arrived at a seemingly luxurious apartment estate where a small keg party was being held.  I sat next to A and start telling her about my whacked-out mind state.  She seems interested despite her drug abstinence.  I was intrigued upon realization that my personality was very different and in some ways better.  The few beers I drank reacted strongly with the tranquilizer and I began laughing, talking, and seeing double.",
      "I convinced A to go in the back room with me where I got a hickey and a erection that was not tended to properly.  In laymens terms, she teased the holy hell out of me.  Girls dont know what they want! I was too high to care.  She was very drunk but didnt want to screw, we went back out to the party room. Some ditz bumped into me and I fell on the table and messed up a game of poker, a couple of people looked pissed but started to laugh after As sexy body laid on the table with me and progressed with the teasing.  Some other chic joined in the kissing and the game was moved to the living room floor.  As usual the spotlight was on me. ",
      "I was pretty much in heaven. Later on some giant, dorky looking guy approached me and said you have to leave, nobody wants you here.  I said something loud and obnoxious which I do not recollect.  My invincible attitude at the time led me to throw a powerful swing to his jaw. He didnt swing back so recalling a favorite movie of mine I said the only think that gives orders is balls.  A few guys stood up,  I had adrenaline, and dopamine rushing through my brain but, like I said I still have my IQ and possessed excellent intoxicated judgment so I eyeballed them and left. ",
      "A stopped me in the hallway to bid me a farewell and suggest I get off the 'oranges'.  We each took three more and spent a spirited night playing videogames and bullshitting.",
      "Since this glowing experience M and I have been using Gabapentin every 15 day refill without any disenchantment.  I suggest Gabapentin for people who like a confident, motivated, clear-headed high for 8 hours at a time.  In a twisted turn of events my documentation became a detailed story.. then again who doesn't appreciate fine literature.",

      "The indigenous healers were teaching me about their lives and medicine in a small village deep in the rainforest. I showed absolutely no interest in ingesting anything, and unlike vacationing trippers, had never had any intention of even trying ayahuasca in the rainforest. However, after weeks of instruction and preparation, including ayahuasca ceremonies, my new teachers decided that I was prepared and should participate in a final ceremony using a plant they call maikuia. Only after returning to my country did I finally figure out what maikuia was in English. I was the only foreigner in their village. Some background information, a few days before I had been stalked by jaguars for four hours during a night hike, so that was fresh in my mind.",
      "This is what I wrote in my journal early that day:",
      "We have to fast after breakfast. F and I are going to ingest maikuia (floripondio). E and J are going to ingest ayahuasca. We will pass the night in the jungle, taking hammocks to sleep in. They tell me that F and I will lose our five senses for the night and we will have visions of the past and of the future. I am ready. It does not scare me. The only thing that gives me fear is being without my senses where there are jaguars like those that stalked us four nights ago. But, we will be four people, and they know the rainforest, the plants, everything. It will be a good night. Tomorrow I will have to rest for the whole day as all the broken connections of my nerve system reconnect.",
      "This is a short excerpt from my journal several days later, when I had regained enough vision to write:",
      "We ask the old stone our favors before we drink. We both ask for good visions and direction before swallowing the greenish concoction. I wander off and sit on a fallen log. F wanders off in the opposite direction. After an hour or more watching the darkness fall around me, I decided that the plant has not worked and perhaps it is because I am not ready.",
      "Marching back to the village, alone and with no light, I meet E, who is on his way to take care of us. He says I must come back with him to the mountain. I insist on going back to the village and bed, as nothing is happening. Then we both hear it again. The two jaguars. Far away, but coming closer.",
      "That settles it. I am heading back to the village. He stands silently as I go and retrieve F, lug him out of his hammock and slip back down the mountain.",
      "There is another small post like the one on the mountain, and there we stop.",
      "'You cannot go back to the village. It is forbidden for you to go there after you have ingested maikuia,' says E.",
      "Just then, a large black jaguar, tall as E's shoulder flies toward us in the night. His spear is flung to the side and somehow gashes his right shoulder open. They struggle in my dim lantern light. E ends up killing the monster with his bare hands in spite of the wound. The lantern lights begins dimming. I think the battery light is going out.",
      "My battery wasn't dying, my eyesight was. My vision was so dim there was no point in turning on a light. I think F must be in a maikuia coma now.",
      "Two more jaguars arrive.",
      "'We should fight these two and run to the village,' I say.",
      "'We can't. First, I am injured. You are weak, and you and F must stay here for the night after taking our sacred plant.'",
      "'My eyesight's dimming, your wound will be more of a detriment as the pain and stiffness set in, and look... more.'",
      "Sure enough, two more pairs of gleaming eyes, crunching up slowly, watching us, but hesitating as they see the great dead cat at E's feet. I don't think about why the maikuia isn't working. I am busy calculating and trying to stay calm.",
      "'I can't believe it! I can't believe it!' E calls. 'I've never known so many jaguars to pass through our territory.' This doesn't sound like happy news. And I have bigger worries than thinking about how the jaguars came to be there.",
      "Then was the first time I thought 'What if this isn't real? I am dreaming in my bed back in the village, and all I must do is wake up.' I throw myself on a hammock, fall asleep, and wake up, still on that hammock. So this wasn't a dream. And my little snooze hadn't helped. More cats were circling, five or six. I tried to rouse F but he'd only half-smile, mumble in his language, and turn over. And E was gone.",
      "Out of nowhere came human voices, a woman and a few children bringing food for E and his overnight stay. Climbing down from the village. I try to tell them they must not go on. They must turn back. The woman refuses, but hearing the crackle of the jaguars and seeing the large prey of E, she decides to wait down at this post for his return.",
      "To my dismay, her children throw some blankets on the bamboo floor, no walls, half-finished hut, and they fall fast asleep. I could not rouse them. Now I definitely could not go for help. The jaguars have given up subtlety and are practically tramping on the feet of the children. One bent down slowly, but his eyes looking in mine, clamped a child by the foot in his jaws and slowly began to drag him away.",
      "I had never killed anything larger than a cockroach in my life, but I couldn't hesitate. I grabbed a burning log and let it fall crashing over his head. The cat dropped the child and rolled over, dead.",
      "Just then I noticed the poisonous snake, a toadheaded pitviper, crawling from our fire, I turned and hit that too. But with the first blow, it turned into a log.",
      "Then, E was there and said he would help us for awhile, but then F and I really must go to the other mountain. I wanted us all to get up to the village right away and agressively.",
      "Another family came down the path, the man even had a gun. They chatted in their language.",
      "'Tell them to help us!' I frantically command, probably in English.",
      "Two of the kids decide to stay with us, to my dismay.",
      "'We are going back up the sacred mountain. Now!' E commanded, despite my protests.",
      "His insistent and sincere expression puts the thought to my mind, again, that this isn't real. All I have to do is pass some test, I think. I should respect those who try and teach me. So I could go back to the hammocks on the mountain, trust E's judgment, and get a good grade on this test.",
      "But if it IS real? The wrong decision is life and death.",
      "'And the children?' I ask.",
      "'They must learn to have no fear, too. Let them learn,' he says. I can't leave them.",
      "I knew that fearlessness was only one factor in winning a battle against the jaguars. So I'd fail the test and look silly. I knew no martial arts, could hardly sheathe a knife, and really abhorred the idea of killing anything. But I would not leave the children.",
      "'I'm not going,' I said harshly. Then, 'Please, stay, we need you.'",
      "'You must be calm and unafraid,' E tells me.",
      "'I'm not scared or frantic. I just can't protect these sleeping children in this poor hut. My eyes are going dim,' I reply.",
      "In fact, the only thing I could see were the black jaguars. They were splotches of darkness blacker than black with brilliant eyes.",
      "I sat down finally on a hammock, the cats watched us, but did nothing. Some of them rarely moved. I did not move. E told me F and I must go back up the mountain. I refuse. I convince E to sit for awhile on the other end of my hammock, trying to keep him there.",
      "And thus began the waiting. The cats would hardly move, inching forward so slowly, then pounce! For some reason, they attacked more where I had a body part out of my blanket. And they attacked me the most. I would stay under the blanket as long as possible. Sometimes, I heard E frantically crying 'Cover up! Cover up!' I would throw the blanket over my head and E would beat the jaguar back.",
      "After a long time of this, we were very tired. He began snoring and I couldn't wake him up sometimes. The cats seemed to tire out, too.",
      "[Then my account goes into phrases that make no sense at all for a few pages, and then it starts making sense, but I switched to referring to myself in third person. The account continues for twenty-ish pages, filled with detailed experiences that I live over the next two days. Sometimes, I refer to myself in third person, sometimes even as 'he' instead of 'she.' Sometimes I lapse into nonsense phrases or Spanish.]",
      "After a few days, I realize that although I had thought during the whole experience that the plant had not worked, I had actually entered a deep schizophrenic psychosis. I had no idea I was 'hallucinating' as everything seemed completely real to me. According to E, I had to be tied up as I was violently roaming the mountaintop, convinced I was saving children from stalking jaguars. I also had been attacking logs with burning sticks, convinced they were vipers. One time, I escaped and they found me standing in the middle of the fire we kept going on the mountaintop. Miraculously, I was not burned. For two days, I answered everything in English, convinced I was speaking Spanish. They would tell me in Spanish that they could not understand me when I spoke English, and I would get annoyed telling them I WAS speaking Spanish... though I was not. When I wrote this account days later, I could still barely see, and reading some of the nonsense I wrote, I was still not all there.",
      "I was shocked to learn that makuia was brugmansia and probably would have never agreed to go on that vision quest had I known at that time. However, I was about as prepared as you can be. I was psychologically, emotionally, and physically trained by indigenous healers with over forty years of experience. It is against their tradition to 'speak against' your visions. Therefore, when I asked the shaman, for example, if he saw the jaguars I saw, he would reply 'yes' and ask me if I was afraid. I would reply 'no.' Their culture believes this plant helps the prepared person conquer their fear as they combat enemies in visions that last for days. I always had two 'sitters,' really guides that would ask me about my visions and ask me about my fear of whatever I saw.",
      "If I had not been with these guides, I probably would have lost my mind, especially over the next few days, as I began to weave back and forth between lucidity and insanity without my vision. But they taught me to be calm and to fight any 'bad' vision as if it were a real enemy.",
      "I took a dosage prepared by someone with dozens of years of experience, fortunately, as this stuff can kill you or land you in a psych ward. Even one of his relatives lost his mind for two weeks and wandered off in the jungle, lost for almost a month.",
      "I am grateful for what I learned but would never ever ever do this again. You go completely schizophrenic. It is not like a normal hallucinogen that makes you see your friends face melt off or makes you see squiggly lines in the wallpaper. You are totally immersed in a convincing alternate reality while your body here on earth crashes around violently, hurting yourself, your surroundings, and even the people around you.",
      "I respect the indigenous cultures who use the plant spiritually, but even they do not do it more than a few times in their life. It is the most powerful plant they know. NEVER mistake this plant for a recreational drug!"

    "report": [
      "I tried codeine once (codeine plus acetaminophen, processed using cold water method), and really didnt enjoy it at all. It just made me feel sick. Tramadol caused no such unpleasantness, but it wasnt the euphoric bang I had expected. My first experience was three 50 mg pills taken on a full stomach. This is what I wrote at the time (provided as an unvarnished perspective on what I felt at the time):",
      "***I took three 50mg pills of Tramadol this evening around 7:42. Its now about 9:40, and the effects became pronounced only about 15 or 20 minutes ago. I feel lethargic. My body is somewhat numb. It feels like being very drunk, but without the dizziness or wildness. I wouldnt describe it as euphoric. Not comfortable and not uncomfortable. I broke into a sweat as I finished typing the previous sentence. Definitely uncomfortable. I drank two glasses of water and then laid down on the floor to read my homework. I quickly began to feel much better. Still, this is a very mellow and muted high, with none of the exuberance and rush of being drunk.***",
      "Now that Ive had a little more experience with it, I offer the following summary:",
      "Mellow, relaxing and comfortable, but no sweeping feeling of euphoria. Ive never tried other types of strong pain medications (other than codeine, as mentioned above), but some people say that the Tramadol experience compares favorably with Oxycontin, etc. If thats the case, then I cant imagine what all the fuss is about.",
      "Tramadol is not an addictive, euphoric rush. Its much more subtle. I compare it to the feeling I get after having stood in the cold rain for twenty minutes, I go inside, take a nice hot shower, and then relax in front of the fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa.",
      "All aches and pains and such disappear. I get a pleasant numbness of the body, especially fingers, toes, hands, feet and legs. Im neither dizzy nor sleepy. The best thing about the high is the lack of stink and sloppiness that I get from drinking. Tramadol is a very clean and gentle. I dont notice any loss of coordination or sloppy speech. Itchiness is not a problem, at least not anymore than I normally feel when the air is dry. For me, onset is affected by whether Ive eaten or not. On a full stomach I dont feel anything until an hour and a half after I take the pills. On an empty stomach, the numbness hits after about forty minutes.",
      "AlcoholI like to drink a little when I take the pills. Slowly drinking beer (about one can per hour) really augments the high, by which I mean that it increases the mellow, comfortable feeling. In instances when I have taken Tramadol by itself without drinking, Im left feeling like I need a little boost to the experience, even when I know I should be feeling the peak effect. Maybe Im just a booze hound. On the one occasion that I drank too much (several stiff drinks in short succession), my head started spinning and I felt even more terrible than I might have if I had just been drunk. I woke up the next morning with nausea and a lingering headache. Ive never had a hangover with Tramadol alone.",
      "Peeing At high doses Tramadol seems to numb whatever muscle handles the urination function. Not impossible to deal with, but I end up standing in front of the toilet for several minutes while my pee dribbles out.",
      "ToleranceDefinitely a problem. After a week or two of abstinence, 150 mg will do nicely, whereas after several daily doses the effect is hardly noticeable. Daily doses require more like 300-400 mg to get a good high, and even then it tapers off. Ive never taken Tramadol more than three days in a row. The most Ive ever taken is 400 mg to start and then a 150 mg boost about five hours later. Instead of producing greater intensity, the boost only prolonged the plateau."

      "Here is my recipe for Kratom flour balls, and the amazing effects they gave me.",
      "Yes, it is very simple, but VERY effective.",
      "---------------------------------------------",
      "Recipe:",
      "Kratom powder",
      "Flour",
      "Confectionery Sugar (Granular will also work)",
      "A saucepan",
      "Big plate",
      "Add the desired dosing amount into the saucepan. (Mine was ~12g)",
      "Add just enough water to mix with the kratom powder. Mix. Now add enough water so there is a layer a little bit more than the kratom 'paste.'",
      "Put on very low heat on the burner. (I put it on '2')",
      "Check every ten minutes or so, and stir.",
      "When it gets to the point where its basically a thick paste and you stir it, it should almost turn back into a powder form, just with some water weight.",
      "Put a plate on the counter. Add a thin layer of flour to the plate.",
      "Take out an amount of kratom paste/powder that will roll into a ball the size of the circumference of a quarter. Roll it. Then roll it in flour to make it look white. Now remake the ball, and then roll in the flour again.",
      "Now roll that in a good amount of confectionery sugar. If it is granular thats fine.",
      "Grab a cup of milk if you have one, otherwise just put the ball in your mouth. Move it around on your tongue a little until it gets kinda slimy. Now, swallow (with the milk preferably, but I did it a few times without any liquid with no problem.)",
      "Doesn't taste bad, and you get to actually use ALL of the kratom, so none is wasted.",
      "---------------------------------------------",
      "Effects:",
      "For the first hour or two before becoming ill...the euphoria was amazing. I was almost nodding, and the euphoria was probably better than the heroin I had last week. It was very strong, and the combination of kratom's ability to cause sedation and excitation made it feel like a speedball, which I also had last week. Now, I am just talking about heroin + coke that was smoked on foil...and not IV-ed or anything, but I honestly believe the kratom was BETTER than that feeling. It was stronger.",
      "I went outside to smoke a cig, sat down, and literally said, 'Today is a beautiful day.'",
      "My dose was obviously too high for me though. I ate some spaghetti-O's thirty minutes or so after dosing and threw them up a short time after. Once I threw them up, I felt a lot better, but still nauseous. If I tried to stand longer than 60 seconds I would get nauseous, and then would have to lie down for at least two minutes for it to fade away. This was annoying as I was trying to watch a movie on my computer before I had become nauseous. I would try to watch it for two minutes, and the nausea would slowly creep up on me, until I had to lie down before I vomited. Even during this, the euphoria still made me feel pleasant though.",
      "In retrospect: Be careful if you use this method. Don't take more than you can handle.",
      "The effects of the kratom lasted until the next day, and helped me for my first few hours at work in the morning until it faded away."

    "report": [
      "I started reading many of the newsgroups that pertained to psychedelics.  Mostly, I was looking for information on how to improve my roll on ecstasy.  I had read on several occations that taking 5-htp (an amino acid which rebuilds serotonin) was reported to actually improve the roll.  According to what I read, it was advised to take 5-htp about 45 minutes before taking ecstasy.  This was reported to increase the high and lengthen the duration of the high.",
      "After I started following the preloading advice, I did notice a change in the way ecstasy worked on me.  The change was unfortunatly for the worse.  I had always thought that my dealer was giving me placebo pills because the high was either non-existent, or was very mellow.  It didn't even occur to me that an amino acid could have such an effect on such a powerful drug like mdma. ",
      "This dampening effect was most apparent on Friday night when I took 150 mg of 5-htp about 1 hour before taking ecstasy.  I took this ecstasy pill (brand name D&G) and waited almost 2 hours without noticing any effect.  To say the least, I was feeling kinda down because I had blown almost $60 on a couple of pills that seemed to do nothing. ",
      "So later that same night, when the bar was closing, I went outside  to go back to the car.  Upon going outside, I noticed the slight buzzing effects of the ecstasy; almost as if I was comming down from a high.  Apparently, I didn't even know that I was under the influence while I was in the bar.",
      "The next night I was browsing the newsgroups and had noticed and entry about 5-htp.  In this entry, it had stated that taking this amino acid right before, or while taking an ecstasy pill will actually diminish the effect, but prolong the duration.  According to what the guy said in his posting, he stated that you should wait a minimum of 6 hours after taking 5-htp before taking the ecstasy pill.  He said it was actually better to take the 5-htp right after you have come down from the roll; just before going to bed.  So, I decided to follow his advice before I went out. ",
      "I had not eaten for 8 hours, I had taken no preloading vitamins (this time), and only drank water.  I had a hit and a half of the same kind of pills I had Friday night.  I took both of them at once in fear of getting caught for possession.  I figured that I probably MIGHT roll a little harder but I wasn't sure.  So, I waited for about 45 minutes and still didn't really feel the efects of the drug.  I decided to buy another pill in the bar.  Again I downed the tab right way so I would not get into legal trouble.  About 5 minutes after downing the second whole pill, I started to feel the effects of the first hit and a half.  The roll started to hit me really hard, and I thought to myself....'Oh shit! What have I done now!'  I decided to warn my friends around me that I had taken 2 1/2 hits of ecstasy and told them to please keep an eye on me.",
      "This was the hardest roll that I had ever experienced.  I must have been on cloud 9.  The total peak time must have lasted a good 3 hours.  This legnth in time was starting to worry me, as the bar's closing time was only 30 minutes away, and I would have to be driving home soon.  Fortunately, my high was over right at the time the bar closed (how perfect).",
      "When I got home, I took 150 mg of 5-htp and went right to sleep.  This did make my waking up easier and I didn't feel like I had been hit by a train like I normally do after taking e.  So the guy's advice was correct.",
      "There are a couple of morals to this story.  First, don't believe everything that you read.  Secondly, wait at least an hour and a half before downing more than one pill; I could've gotten into a lot of trouble, but was pretty lucky this time.  Lastly, the best preloading is to wait at least 2 weeks (that's two weekends) without taking ecstasy.  Try to enjoy your weekends while being sober... it may not sound like it's fun, but it really is.  Just remeber that you can chose to be just as empathic as you are while you're on the drug.  What you throw out at people will always come back to you.  That's what ecstasy has taught me.",

      "I learned a lot about myself this night. I took between 10 and 15 mg not so carefully measured of 2C-I, (it was 27 drops) a hallucinagenic drug and went to a Tool concert. I went with two friends, one a guy named D. who had 37 drops in his water because he's done 2C-I several times before, and one friend named N. who didn't take anything and we didn't tell her that we had either.",
      "We drank our 2C-I desolved in bottles of water. We were in the first section at the concert, front and center within the first 5 rows I'd say. The stage was about 5 or 10 feet away. It took a while for the show to start, and I didn't really feel too many effects yet. The woman next to us had red eyes. I don't know if that was real or not. I think she was just weird and wears red contacts though honestly. It wasn't a big deal, but I thought it might have been my first effect. When the show started the lights went black, and I saw the rack of lights above the stage coming down, like the whole rack moving down toward us, and after a few minutes I realized I was probably just imagining that.",
      "We were standing right in front of the drumset, and I had a railing right next to me. It looked like metal which had been bolted into the ground but when I touched it or put weight on it I thought it moved. I couldn't tell though because by now my hands were somewhat numb. For the rest of the night my lower back, knees and my jaw especially felt like they were made of clay. Often times I would force myself to unclinch my jaw because I was biting down so hard enjoying the euphoric warm clay feeling.",
      "When the show actually started the singer came out with a Mohawk, in a bright orange flurecent sweatshirt, state trooper glasses, and a breathing mask like a surgeon, or someone afraid of SARS but with an angry monkey's mouth on it. It really freaked me out but I think it was really there and would have freaked me out no matter what.",
      "My entire body felt like it was made of warm clay. It was great but I couldn't feel myself breathe or swallow. When a song came on that I knew and I'd sing it, I wouldn't run out of breathe. I knew something must be wrong, that it must just have been an illusion and that I'd better control my breathing before I passed out. But I indulged a little a few times in shouting with no restrictions, as loud and long as was my will.",
      "Throughout the concert, I first of all was blown away by how awesome the songs were. On a sober level even, but especially when just letting go, I was amazed by how good those songs were. Anyway though most of my trip was inside my head. My body felt weird yes, and I did see some things strange too. There was a huge backdrop of the 10,000 days album cover, it's such a weird picture anyway, and it was covered with all different colored lights, but I could swear it was getting bigger or coming closer.",
      "I turned my body slightly to the left to face the guitarist and singer and it was throwing off my depth perception a lot because my point of referance had changed without me realizing it. The bar I used to literally keep a grip on reality disappeared. How had I drifted so far away, why did the stage look so different? But I realized eventually that I just needed to face the other direction to be ok. I, unlike D., didn't have many visual hallucinations. He asked me several times if static objects were moving, if the walls were breathing, and he also seemed to be confused and unaware what was going on at times.",
      "I freaked out a little when the singer's arm band began to look like a giant bug but it lasted maybe half a second. The show was so sensory over stimulating. The huge monitors behind the band constantly had vivid strange images on it but Tool videos are crazy even if you're not on drugs. They feature aliens, or just ugly, freakish people doing weird things, like levitating, or performing autopsies, or acting like animals. Mostly though they just had a lot of pictures with eyes, or veins and weird geometric shapes.",
      "I was thinking that most people contrive significant meanings for these things, but I understood them to mean that they were totally arbitrary. Like 'this shape means nothing, these creatures mean nothing and we could have put something else in this video that was a different color or shape and it'd have the same effect.' So step one there was realizing that it all meant nothing at all. This thinking led to an inner quantum mechanics discussion about how matter itself fades out of existance constantly. The only tangable reality is what's made of thoughts when it's observed consciously.",
      "So I kind of decided what I was seeing was nothing, and I thought that about the notes in the songs too. I am always trying to figure out crazy patterns to write 'the perfect song.' And I guess you could put any notes after eachother and make it work and it doesn't matter because there's no perfect song. They're all kind of meaningless, and I just have to do what I like instead of relying on mathematics or something. Life shouldn't be a science.",
      "On the otherhand I got so into the songs, that I felt each one was a new dimension to which the band had opened up a gateway. Because the song was so weird and different from conventional music it was on a linear path no one had ever taken before and we couldn't appreciate the new dimension because it was just too different. This made me think that people are afriad to be different, and that we repeat the same thing everyday over and over for years and generations even though we have infinite possibilites. I think I may have connected too much with the songs. Even days later I still feel that they were so powerful. They made me feel something incredible.",
      "Some points in the show I couldn't stop giggling even when the band was trying to be serious and I really wanted to. D. couldn't help it either, nothing was funny, but I just couldn't take the smile off my face, and occasional giggle or chuckle. Other times though I'd look back to my right and there was a wild mosh pit going on. It was like a tornado, or like the standpede from the lion kind that killed mufasa. I wanted no part of that.",
      "My most troubling thoughts came when I got too deep into my own mind. I was thinking that there are some things in my life which I was convinced I could beat on my own. I thought of a girl that I was friends with in high school, then I was in love with, and dated only for a few weeks before she broke up with me. I told people I got over her but I didn't because I never faced it. I was just pushing her to the back of my mind, replacing with with other girls. Since I wasn't actually depressed and I had excepted that she wasn't a part of my life anymore I took that as being over her. But I was wrong.",
      "While I was dating my last girlfriend all I could think usually was that I didn't like her anywhere close to how much I liked the other girl, and that it was just a crappy relationship and it wasn't what I wanted. I didn't confront the problem for the last few years because my friends got tired of me whining about her and I thought it was the responsible thing to do, to just force myself let go.",
      "It showed me just how complex my brain truely was. Or rather, simple in fact. I can push her to the back all I want. I don't have to be depressed about her, but she's still in there. My brain was saying 'You can't beat me.' 'You truely can't solve all your problems by yourself, can you?' It's not that my mind is so complex, it's that its so simple and everything is right there. It's like I was trapped in a room (my mind) with my problems and now I'd have to face them. One example was this girl, but she wasn't the only thing, it means all problems that people cover up and lie about.",
      "There were, and possibly are, two me's. Often in life I narrate things to myself. Either before I say them out loud to someone else, or even when I'm by myself, to get my thoughts straight I will say the actual words silently in my head in correct english grammar. While tripping though I couldn't do that. My words were getting slurred and I couldn't even interpret them. It was really scary, because I knew what I wanted to be thinking but I couldn't say it to myself, and I have a hard time knowing what I'm thinking unless I repeat it to myself.",
      "So I'd want to say something like 'Ok this is too intense, it's time to slip back into reality. I need to hold onto that raliling. These people on stage are just men playing guitars and drums. Those are just lights and pictures.' In the beginning of the trip if I did that it would bring me back to soberness, but now it wasn't really working that well because I couldn't think of those full sentences, maybe 2 or three words at a time, and then I'd just stop. Then I'd get angry with myself, and be like 'come on finish the sentence!' Then I'd think something like 'Man I can't wait to try to explain this tomorrow.' Then something like 'Wow I'm tripping balls, I keep thikning that I wasn't tripping but now I'm sure that I am.' Then I'd realize again that I wasn't focussed on saying the words and I needed to snap out of it.",
      "Then I would see the security guard 2 feet from my face staring at me. I'd get paranoid. I thought he could tell I was acting strange because I wasn't singing or dancing and because I was looking at him instead of the band. So then I'd try forcing a dance and singing and bobbing my head. Then I thought that looked too forced so I just threw one of my hands up in the air and kept watching them, but I didn't scream or anything, my face was probably pretty emotionless.",
      "The feeling of having a duel personality, and of the other one being someone so dark and who knew all, my mind was truely shocking and indescribable. It knew everything, and showed me everything. Truths and epiphanies right there, in front of my nose.",
      "Everything in the universe has explanations that contradict each other, but according to my other self that's only because we are looking at them from the wrong viewpoint. The view point is what is contradictory because it's not the correct referance point from which to judge, and that's why we get rediculous answers that don't make sense.",
      "Another point was that there are things that I don't know the answers to and can't objectively find out. Like for example whether we landed on the moon or not, or who really shot JFK, or 9/11. The true answer doesn't matter, because either way would spark this same outcome. The future (present) would be the same way. People still wouldn't know whether it actually did happen or whether it didn't, and they'd still claim the same conspiracies. Both possibilities exist with each other simultaniously in superposition, just like matter in quantum theory and that's it. The point is I shouldn't waste my time thinking about it because it doesn't matter.",
      "Another thing that disturbed me was the video they played for the song Aenema where the alien ripped out his intestines, because it reminds me of a story called 'GUTS' that I read a few years ago. It was the first thing I ever read or saw that made me feel physically ill and since then I think I tapped into some part of my brain that connects thoughts to reality. When I saw the intestines I started feeling sick and really really forced myself into a normal state of mind, away from the trip, away from Tool even, just trying to not be sick. When I read GUTS I broke into a cold sweat and blacked out on my bathroom floor while waiting to vomit, so I didn't want that to happen again. eventually I overcame it.",
      "After each song I really wanted the concert to end. I loved the feelings and thoughts I had, but I wanted it to be over so I could regain control. Every song I heard was the best song I'd heard up to that point in my life and I was glad they played it, then I'd really hope that it was over, then they'd play another and I'd be glad I got to hear that one too but then I'd hope it'd end after that. It ended at a good time though.",
      "When the show was over there was no encore. They turned the lights on and I was still at the peek of my trip. I couldn't hear very well, and I was numb and my pupils were probably dialated. D. was totally out of it even more than I was. N. got one of Danny Carey's drumsticks and the setlist, and when she showed it to me, I was just saying 'I don't want it, it's just a stick it's not special.' Like, it wasn't the moment, the moment was over and done. Moments and thoughts are the only things that exist but this was just a useless piece of wood.",
      "While the drug made me realize a lot, they also fucked up my thoughts, I couldn't even form sentences and I was afraid of my own brain and the sad truth that I was alone useless and not special in anyway. So I don't want to do them anymore I don't think.",
      "On the way out I couldn't feel my feet so I was walking on auto pilot just hoping that I didn't fall, sishing I brought a notebook with me to write stuff so I didn't forget it. D. and I wished N. hadn't come with us, because we wanted to talk about our experiences, but she didn't know what we had done. It's ok though, she was nice and didn't bug me out, plus because of her we saw the setlist and the names of all the songs they played.",
      "When I drank some water I hoped it went down because I couldn't feel myself swallow it, but I wasn't thirsty anyway. The lights and the scenery of the city was so cool. It was an epically spectacular view, but really that's just Tokyo. So many weird coincidences and things kept happenening after that concert. I've forgotten most all of them. Also I felt like my depth perception was off, and my hearing was as though I was underwater, but that's probably just from the amps. My effects wore off entirely about 7 hours after drinking the 2C-I, as we left on the monorail, but D. was going for another hour and a half or so saying he wished he only took as much as I had.",
      "It was still early so we went out for dinner, I just asked N. to order whatever she wanted and we'd share. I ate it even though I couldn't feel myself swallowing, but that food was damn tasty. I still didn't want to drink anything.",
      "On the train ride home, I was about to text a lot of people and say 'I'm tripping balls' or 'Tool was so good' but I decided that's a part of my personality I don't like, where I brag and try to be the people's hero, so I didn't say anything to anyone.",
      "For the longest time I've thought Japanese people were stupid. I thought they were trapped in an illusion, that their society is based just on mimicing America, but that they did it wrong and it was meaningless. They have kids who dress like gangsters, but don't act tough, aren't in gangs, and don't do drugs or listen to rap. They idolize Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt because of cell phone commercials, but they don't even do anything in the commercial. I just hated how dumb and empty Japanese people seemed.",
      "After realizing how meaningless everything is though, even matter. I decided that they are right, and America is the one with the illusions. It's all arbitrary, and Japanese people just dress how they want and don't judge. They bond together, it's real unity, it's not like America at all. They trust each other, they are considerate of each other. It's what America is missing, it's what I want, what people need. It was really especially comforting that even though I'm not Japanese. I am a person, and I am on earth, and I am matter in the universe and I felt that Japanese society excepted me. I felt pretty good.",
      "I went home around midnight and got back to the dorm around 1, but before that I stopped at the convenience store and bought some really weird snacks that I would never have bought otherwise which seemed to stand out to me. Some green tea mint oreos and some weird anmochi. I was worried most of the night about how good I felt because when I've felt that good from drinking alcohol I usually got pretty sick soon afterward.",
      "I fell asleep at around 2 and I had a really bad headache. I woke up with the same really bad headache, but I'm so glad I haven't been nauseus at all. I layed in my bed with that terrible headache feeling hot and cold, I put on 'Seinfeld' because I needed something happy and familiar in the background. Sadly, I could only think about how far away I am from home, and that I'm on the third floor of this building. I felt like useless floating particals out in space that didn't matter, and I just wanted to go home, and wished I could sleep and stop thinking."

Very jittery and stimulated feeling. When both of them were working I felt awake and good, slightly euphoric, but less euphoria each time I redosed. Focused, and the jitters went away. The Modafinil seemed to keep my mind awake, and the Ritalin my body. I took 5 Modafinil throughout the day, and about twice that many Ritalin.",

      "I am six months clean as of today. I am eightteen years old, and I am still in treatment for my addiction to drugs. My story is long and complex, but genuine. I am taking some time to reflect on what I've done to my family, my friends, and myself for the past 5 years.",
      "I started using somewhere between the ages of 12 and 13. As usual that's the age where adolescents start to expose themselves to the wonders of alcohol and drugs. I had no previous expierence with either of the two accept for a sip of beer on new years my dad gave me when I was 6. I vividly remember a party my friends and I were having. We invited some girls over, and we got a case of beer and some liquor. I took a few sips of liquor with some soda, and had about 4 beers. I got drunk for the first time that night.",
      "Normally being a socially awkward and very introverted person, the alcohol I consumed made me feel good. It made me feel more comfortable with myself, and therefore more comfortable in a social setting. I was talking to girls, smoking cigarettes, ect. Just being one of the guys, it felt good. I continued to drink at various parties all the way through 7/8th grade. Things started to change at this point, I started changing the way I dressed and shifted away from my friends, and tword the dirtbag type of people. Mainly because I felt comfortable and less pressured around these seemingly mellow ladies and fellows. They introduced me to Marijuana.",
      "Me and 2 of these kids walked up to a cemetary and smoked a few bowls. I didn't get high, but I continued to smoke with them reguardless, just to feel comfortable around them and for them to like me. After several nights of this, I did get high and I laughed untill Tears came out of my eyes. I loved it, I loved the feeling of not caring, just looking at even the most serious of situations and just cracking up. All my worries were pretty much phased out when I was high, and I liked this.",
      "By 9th grade I started smoking weed on a regular basis. Throwing down on a bag after school, buying my own pot, getting my own bowl, papers, dutch, bong, whatever. I started to smoke everyday, to the point where I was pretty much in a 24/7 stoned state. More importantly I started smoking on my own, and prefered it that way. Many a night I would just sit in my room, high, watching tv, and be perfectly content with the world. My parents started to worry, grades were dropping, money was missing, but they never found enough evidence that an excuse coulden't handle. Besides, I had the upper hand, what parent wants to think there kid is smoking pot?",
      "The cicle rolled on into summer, when drugs were very abundant in my town. I had a part time job, and allot of friends. Parties every weekend ect. I started getting offered different substances, things I'd never heard of. I found erowid.org, and did some research on drugs.I discovered and had my first taste of Painkillers. Vicodin's, Oxycontins's, whatever my friends could get from there parents medicine cabinets.",
      "By tenth grade, I was in a band with some kids I met from another town. They were pretty down and out people, but being the dumb ass I was I thought they were the shit. They offered me some Meth which I tried and indulged into slightly, but I never did enough to get really hooked. Eventually I tasted LSD, and Mushrooms through the same group of people. There was a shortage of pot in our town, so me doing my research came across DXM which I took pretty much every week from the time I tried it, onward. Drugs pretty much became my life at that point. In every social setting I presented myself to be a drug addict, to look cool, but also, because deep down, I started to feel like one.",
      "Once the summer came about again, I had ditched my girlfriend and met up with a kid who was into doing coke. I told him I could get him some, not really being serious, and next thing I know he's at my house telling me to round up 30$ (coke fiends really are that desperate). I got some money and we threwdown on a gram we got from some of those friends of mine. He cut up the lines in a bathroom of Dunkin' Dounuts, and sniffed them infront of me. He offered me a line and at first I hesistated. But peer pressure took control, as did my growing addiction and I snorted a big fat line. I scurried out of there saying to myself 'It's over, it's done with, nothing happened'. When the effects began to take hold.",
      "I was feeling like a fucking GOD. I was walking around and I was everybodys best fucking friend. I was highfiving and hugging people I never even met. Talking up a fucking storm, I loved it, I was the shit now, I was the guy everybody loved. From then on coke become priority #1. I spent all of my job money on coke, All of my friends money on coke, stole, robbed, lied, pawned my possesions, whatever I could to get more coke. It was the the point that 3 months down the line I didn't feel shit from coke, So I got the bright idea to start smoking rock.",
      "I cooked it up using an online tutorial, literally in my kitchen. I smoked out of a stem one of my friends gave me to hold onto. I was fucking flying. I thought coke was the epitome of pleasure, but I was oh so wrong. Rock is totally different from coke, yet similar. The feeling is so much better, but just when your getting a full fledged taste, it's gone and you need more. Around this time I had a girlfriend who did coke with me, and we were on a 500$ a week habbit. We'd buy it, part ways, I'd smoke, she'd sniff. My addiction was out of control, It was either rock, pot, DXM, pills, or any other interesting things that were around town that week.",
      "Eventually the new thing became Heroin. People started going into the city and scoring a bundle or 2 and coming back and selling it to us kiddies. A friend of mine we can call E was pretty much a full fledged junkie at this point. I gave him some money and he got me a bag of dope. I sniffed it and wow.",
      "I was used to doing coke, so when i saw what a bag amounted to in a line I thought it would be nothing. Man was I wrong. I was fucked up beyond all belief. More importantly I totally didn't care. I could lose everyone I loved and just shrug it off. That feeling is just to strong, more powerfull that any emotion I have ever felt. I nodded off a dozen times that night, and eventually found a friends place to crash at and puked up a storm in his garbage pail, and passed out. I continued to give E my money hoping for a score. He ripped me off several times (junkies really are that desperate).",
      "The few times I got it I sniffed it, but eventually I started going right to the people who were giving it to him. I payed them my money and got my moneys worth. Bags were coming in left and right, I watched them shoot it, and became intrigued. Thought about it for a second, and tried it. Ahhhhh, that rush, that fucking chill that goes down your spine when dope enters the bloodstream and just rearanges your dopamine and serotonin. So much faster, so much stronger than snorting it. I was hooked. Dope and Rock, my two new best friends.",
      "Eventually I was nothing anymore, I walking shell of my former self. If I didn't have my fix for that day, I was begging for money, or stealing from somebody. My friends, my real friends, finally told someone about the shit I was doing. I got called into the principles office, they searched me and, I disovered how fast the cops can get to your school when they hear the word Heroin. I was arrested on possesion of Heroin and Marijuana. This was last March(2006). I entered Rehab and turned my life around.",
      "I got clean, I worked on allot of my issues that I was using drugs to cope with. I expressed my insecurities without being fake or hiding. I became a person again. I realise what I did to everybody who loved me was terrible, and I'm so fucking lucky that they love me enough to forgive me. I am happy now, and I have a future ahead of me. Even though I know I may live the rest of my life wanting a hit, I know that for today I don't need it."

      "Brennan B,18, was a classmate of mine since freshman year. on december 28, 2001, Brennan went to Jimmy's, a bar uptown.  He was partying, getting drunk, enjoying the end of the year.  Soon he was outside purchasing GHB.  The GHB was inegested .",
      "As the evening progressed, Brennan became 'overly intoxicated', and was escorted outside.  Outside Jimmy's, Brennan collapsed.  He sat there not breathing for 30 MINUTES. He was taken to Charity Hospital, comatose.  When they tested his brain for activity, there was none.  Brennan was brain dead.  Nothing could be done to save him.  On January 8, 2002, they turned off the machine that breathed for him.  I attended his wake on January 10.  I never would have thought as a freshman, that I would be attending this kid's wake, and that this kid would die from the mixture of GHB and alcohol, months shy of his 19th birthday, and his graduation.  The Times Picayune reported yesterday that  was arrested for the unintentional death of Brennan.  B faces 20 years for selling the GHB that killed Brennan.  He didn't even make it to the new year."

      "Ive been using drugs such as alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, lsd, inhalants, benzodiazepines, coke(just once), crack(just once) and some others that i dont remember.  But the point is that i have some experience and for about 4 years i'd only had one bad trip and it wasnt that bad.",
      "Well, yesterday i was alone and sober and as i didnt have to go to school the next day i wanted to smoke some pot, watch tv and go to bed, but i couldnt do it here because my mum was here and outside was rainin like hell. So i decided to make some butter with the weed and wait to get a little high (ive done this once before and it was just perfect). I got a piece of butter (like 6cm x 3cm x 1cm)and put it in a bowl with a bit more than 3 grms of cannabis (3grms = 3 joints?), i realized that i had too much weed so i put a bit more butter and started to boil it. When the bubbles came up i hold it there for a few minutes (6 minutes maybe)and then i put it in a glass full with water to separete the weed from the butter already full of thc. i put the glass in the freezer for five minutes and when it was solid butter again i ate it with some crackers.",
      "For 40 minutes i was perfectly normal so i thought that maybe id boiled it too much. but after 20 minutes i started to feel very hungry and i thought what? that is it? im in the come down already?, so I ate a lot until i started to feel a little high and sleepy...so i was very happy that the butter had kicked in perfectly. but that wasnt it, i was gettin higher and higher every minute and i didnt like it because i was alone and i didnt have many interesting things to do.",
      "An hour later i went to bed to watch some tv and relax, but i knew that something was really wrong, my body was trembling a lot and my heart was really fast, i couldnt see anything because i was feeling the bed floating in the air. at this point i knew i was having a panic attack, i was so fuckin nervous cause i was lonely i didnt know what to do, so i talked to myself about what was happening and that i was having a bad experience, that everything was gonna be ok so i shouldnt worry. But the feeling was so strong...",
      "I knew i should do somethin cause otherwise i knew i was going to scream a lot for help, and my mum would see me so fuckin stoned, and i didnt want that. so i played the guitar but every sound was so sad it wasn't working. then i looked for somebody on the net to chat with and thank god a friend of mine that lives very near was there. i could hardly use the keyboard with my hand tremblin so bad and my hurt trying to get out of my body...i couldnt read very well my eyes were very fucked up. i was really ashamed of what i was going through but it was the only thing i could do, so i asked her to come over and she said it was too late (3am, 2 hours since i ate the butter), so i started to feel worse, my hole body was tremblin very very fast and i was freakin out, i told her i was havin a real hard panic attack and a paranoia feeling so she said she whould be here in 5 minutes...but i couldnt wait that long, i",
      " went downstairs i walked all over the kitchen for a long long time tryin to calm down but that was imposibl. sudenly my friend came over and asked if i was ok, i told her how i felt but i realized that i could talk, words just wouldnt come out so i see her face and she was really scared. i drank some water, my throat was so dry and started to feel a bit normal and then i could talk so i told her everything and she told me to go to bed but i didnt want to be alone again, i knew i would freak out again, so she stayed with me for about 2 hours and i couldnt belive i was still very high (4 hours since i ate the butter)",
      "I tried to sleep while she was here with me cause i knew it was the only way i could calm down but everytime i was fallin asleep i suddenly opened my eyes and everythin looked so wierd, i saw a lot of shadows, the tv looked so far away. i didnt like it at all, i just wanted it to go away. At 5:30am she said she should go home and i was still high, but i thought she had already done a lot, so she went and i was feeling better. i tried to sleep and some minutes later a was sleeping.",
      "What ive learned of all this is that i had a panic attack because i didnt belive that eating cannabis was so much stronger than smoking so i wasnt warned about this, and i was alone with nothing to do that think, and my brain was thinking too fast that i coulnd haddle it. If i had to go trough this alone the hole time i think i wouldnt make it (i had a lot of suicide thoughts), so i warn you guys, eating cannabis is not the same shit that smokin it, so dont wait for a relax feelin and a few laughings, i woulnd say its a real trip like lsd, but its not too diferent."

      "I was hesitant submitting this story due to privacy concerns, but since I didn't see any other listing for this combination I thought my story should get out there.",
      "A few months I took some mushrooms with a friend.  Since the quantity of mushrooms was less than desired I decided to put together a psychedelic sampler.  Per the title: won't do that again.  In the end I feel it was the Kratom which was the wild card.  The Mushrooms Cannabis Combo was something Ive had plenty of success with in the past.  We took approx. 1.125 grams of your standard magic mushroom.  One half hour later we took a 1/2 teaspoon of Kratom. What grade I couldn't say, but it must have been high-octane.  One half an hours after that, we smoked a joint of some high end hydroponic bud.  Time elapsed approx. one hour. ",
      "The effects of all three blended together creating an amazingly euphoric high.  We were discussing this as the 'trifecta of good times.  We felt like we'd discovered a whole new thing and wanted to spread the good news.  At this point I decided to up the ante with another 1/2 teaspoon of Kratom.  A half hour later I could feel the effects of this second helping of Kratom taking hold.  It's been a bit since this happened, so I can't get super specific about the buzz.  Visually I was having wavy, blurred, and distorted vision.  Physically I was warm & euphoric.  To this my friend decided he was going to try more Kratom as well.  This is where the wheels came flying off.",
      "He had decided to make it in hot chocolate, and went about preparing that as I sat down and had a cigarette.  As I was smoking all the sudden I was overwhelmed with a sense I needed to lay down.  Next thing I know, my friend is standing over me on the kitchen floor trying to wake me up.  I had convulsed at the table and passed out.  I was weak, disoriented and had trouble speaking.  After laying there for about five minutes, unable physically to do much, he/she tried to sit me up.  I immediately passed out again.  At this point my friend, who's a nurse, took my pulse.  I was running at between 35-40 beats a minute, which is exceptionally low from my understanding.  After a half hour I was able to stand up and walk to the bathroom. ",
      "While I was standing in the bathroom (I'd been upright for about 3 minutes tops) I felt myself passing out again.  Since it was coming, I decided to start heading in that direction while still conscious and somewhat in control.  Trying to yell for my friend, I again couldn't speak.  Groundhog Day!  I woke up to my friend standing over meagain.  This time he insisted we go to the ER.  I was able to convince him that third times a charm, and if that happened I'd go. ",
      "I was able to drag myself into the living to lay on a couch using only my arms.  At this point my legs weren't altogether cooperating and by raising my head too high I risked passing out again.  Then I'd be heading to the hospital.  Things had gone terribly sideways and I didn't know what to do other than ride it out.  But let me say this: I've ridden things out before.  This wasn't my first rodeo.  But in all my experience, this was the first time I didn't know if I was coming out the other side.  I started to wonder if this was what OD'ing felt like.  My friend, who deals with dying and nearly dead folk all the time, was terrified.  Both times I passed out he/she had trouble waking me up again.  I had nothing to gauge this experience against. ",
      "For the next half hour I fought off passing out because I didn't know if I'd wake up again.  I was really afraid Id close my eyes and never wake up.  After this time passed I began to feel the effects waning and I knew I had turned the corner.  About half an hour after that I felt fine, this being relative to the condition I was in to begin with.",
      "Total elapsed time, about 3 hours.  This was not fun or enlightening.  This was dead-ass bad news for me and my friend.  Both he and myself thought I was going to die.  To be honest, I took awhile writing this because I didn't want to put the story out in cyberspace-privacy concerns and what not.  In the end I decided to go ahead because I think people should know what they're playing with here.  I wrote it because Id feel horrible if this went even worse (death, coma, who the hell knows) for someone else and I hadnt done something to help."

What did she do?  Had her doctor change her from the evil Ambien to the saintly Ambien CR.  Apparently, the medical profession likes the timed-release route to addiction better than the all-at-once technique.",

Apparently, merely being near an MD makes anyone a medical professional.  My wife has diagnosed me with everything from the Ebola Virus to Legionnaires Disease.  Okay, I exaggerate, but she did have her doctors convinced that my daughters menstrual cramps needed emergency gall bladder surgery.  Thankfully, I stepped in and offered a less invasive cure, 'waiting for her period to end.'  Make me an honorary doctor, I was right!  I add this because all it takes is one person who has the ability to prescribe medicine, and a friend or employee who eats the same free drug vendors' lunches every day, and just like that an addiction is born.",

      "As a full-fledged pothead and psychonaut, I am used to experimenting with substances.  Altering my consciousness is something that I save for special occasions, however, and before my love affair with percocet I had never really considered trying 'hard' drugs.  At this point I had done only the basics: Nicotine, alcohol, psylocibin, THC.",
      "About a year ago I developed multiple kidney stones over the course of a few months.  (Kidney stones, if you've never had them, are hell on earth.  Passing a kidney stone has been described as 'some of the worst pain the human body can endure and survive.')  I was prescribed percocet to take as needed.  I didn't like the idea of taking an opiate-because of potential addictiveness--but after passing two stones in three days I was ready for a morphine drip if I could get a hold of it.  My prescription said to take one tablet every 6 hours as needed.  As I woke with a third stone in the middle of the night (3am) I crawled to the kitchen and retrieved the bottle.  Immediately, I downed four (the amount I would have taken in 24 hours).",
      "I didn't feel the percocet hit me at all--it snuck up from behind and crawled into my body with no warning.  One minute I was in immense pain, and the next I was blissful and calm, the pain still there but somehow unimportant.  I think that I was fully 'high' (though 'dreamy' is a better word) by about 30-45 minutes after I took the pills.  I don't really remember the transition very well--my thoughts were jumbled and irrelevant.",
      "I find codeine is a lovely drug (provided you're not allergic, which many people are), and the feelings I felt that night were less of a dulling of pain than a total forgetfulness of any bodily sensation.  My speech became slurred, and when my mother woke up to get ready for work at 6am (I was home from college for the summer), three hours after I had taken the pills, I was giggling happily while watching the cartoon network.  She told me later that there was a small trail of drool streaming from my chin, but I don't remember this.  I do remember feeling like nothing could hurt me, that my body was wrapped in a warm fleece cocoon, and that the kidney stones could fuck themselves.",
      "I started to come down around noon, and as I felt the drug wear off my body was exhausted and I felt sweaty and itchy (codeine makes me really really itchy all over).  Also, the pain was returning, and nausea was on its way.  I was home alone at this point, and the stabbing agony in my back--which was traveling slowly down to my bladder--was nearly unbearable.  I sat on the floor of my bathroom, my legs wobbly and cold on the tiles, my head resting miserably on the toilet seat.  It occurred to me that I still had 8 more percocet in the bottle, and I thought, what the hell, I don't have to work today.  The come-down was getting more and more intense, and I started to think I might throw up.  Also, I was starting to cry, for no apparent reason.  Panicked, I went into the kitchen and took two more. ",
      "I should note here that even as I took the second dose of pills I felt the percocet coming back on...I found the drug's effects comes in waves, and this is one reason it's so dangerous.",
      "By 1pm I was stoned out of my mind; I remember going to make food in the kitchen and laughing hysterically at the fact that I was nauseated and that my back hurt.  There was no real euphoria, just a calm, tranquil, wise feeling.  I felt like a jolly old gnome.  I felt untouchable.  I thought I was an angel and could save the world.  I vowed on the spot to get my prescription re-filled (though the bottle said in huge letters no refills), inventing more kidney stones if necessary.  Life was grand and I was queen.",
      "I got addicted--I really did have several more kidney stones that summer (one kidney is almost entirely useless now), and getting my prescription filled again and again was easy because my physician was a friend of the family and my ivp's (intravenous pigmentation--iodine dye is shot into your veins and your urinary tract is x-rayed) showed that I did indeed have more stones on the way.  By the end of the summer (2 months after my first percocet adventure), I was fully hooked.  I took percocet to work, popping pills throughout the day as I tended bar and in the car on the way home.  My standard routine was: 2 Pills upon waking, 2 pills by noon, 2 pills after dinner, 2 pills before bed. ",
      "I was functional--surprisingly so--but my health was in shambles.  I couldn't escape the fact that if I didn't get my constant percocet fixes, I was so nauseated that eating was unthinkable and sleep wouldn't come for hours.  The stones hurt, yeah, but they didn't hurt that badly.  I knew I shouldn't be taking so much percocet.  Finally, one night I caught myself wishing for the drugs to work faster and actually chewing a pill whole (it was so bitter) right before a party.  At that moment I realized that the drug was controlling my life.  My mother was getting very suspicious, and my friends didn't really like to hang out anymore because all I wanted to do was take percocet and watch tv or listen to quiet music.  I stopped going out, forgot to shower, and eventually lost my job.  I woke up one day--broke, alone, and feeling like shit--and realized that if I didn't quit soon I wouldn't make it out alive.",
      "So, I stopped.  The stones were agony, but I smoked a lot of weed, and in a way it seemed to help more than the codeine because the come-down wasn't nearly as rough.  The withdrawal symptoms were awful--I wouldn't wish them on anyone...Constant nausea, headaches, tremors, cold sweats, diarrhea, intense disorientation, irregular heart beat, trouble breathing.  Eventually they went away, though, and now I can say that since I quit cold turkey I haven't gone back.  It's tempting sometimes, but I find that cannabis and an after-bowl cigarette really help curb the urge.",
      "One last thing: Never drive while or after taking percocet, and don't ever mix it with alcohol.  I learned this the hard way when I woke up vomiting in my friend's car after having a glass of wine in a restaurant.  The drug is nice, it's friendly, but it's also very possessive and likes to win.  Don't let it--it's just an addiction, and if you want to badly enough, you will get through it.  Friends, light foods, lots of cool water to drink, and calming music in a dark room are a great way to get through withdrawal."

      "About a week ago my friend sold me two tablets of ecstasy. They were small white pills with the letter G on one side and an imprint of a naked woman on the other. Otherwise known as, 'G's up Hoe's down.",
      "This was not my first time using ecstasy, it was my 5th. I had tried other drugs. Marijuana and Cocaine I have used frequently. Heroin is a love of mine but very difficult for me to find lately. I was very excited to use ecstasy again because it had been almost six months since my last trip.",
      "I took one tablet and felt nothing for about an hour. Finally it kicked in. I felt giddy and just wanted to keep talking. But it wasnt enough, so I chewed the second pill and let the bitter powder enter.",
      "About 45 minutes later I was rolling. I just felt so damn good. Its probably the only way I can describe it. Me and my friends went down to my basement and blasted techno music. The strobe light was on and I just kept moving. There was a moment where I just stopped and thought about the way I was feeling. I remember feeling that I had never felt so good in my life and I was upset in knowing that I would never feel that good ever again. My friend asked me if it was worth the cash and I replied that it was, undoubtedly. After she asked that question I kept wondering how much that high was worth. What I would do to be in that moment. It was almost frightening what I came up with.",
      "I spent a little while longer just feeling omnipotent. I was happy and loving, which are not some of my common characteristics. I went around repeatedly telling everyone how much I loved them. I did not just say it, I actually meant it with every inch of my body. My love for life and the world was so intense that I wanted to cry tears of joy. I felt warmth in my heart. I felt as though I could do anything or be anything.",
      "My friends left and I was alone for a little bit. Just pacing back and fourth repeatedly not really thinking about anything. I remembered how good it felt to be touched, when I had tried ecstasy before. So I called up one of my friends to come over and for a quick and easy hook up. He agreed but he could not be here until around 8. So I resumed my pacing back and fourth for a couple of minutes when I get a knock on my back door. This is about 10 minutes before he is supposed to arrive. The knocking continues and I feel a rush of panic. I began thinking of the worst possible scenarios. Murderer? Burglarer? It turned out to be two of my friends just playing a trick on me. When I realized it was them I felt almost a huge pull on me. I had been so excited to hook up with that guy and it was all ruined. However, I let them in despite the hatred I felt for them at that moment.",
      "My friends asked me if I wanted to smoke some pot and I was obliged. (I was still very, very high on the ecstacy.) My friend phoned her dealer and he arrived at my house ten minutes later. My friend invited him in, which I was not very comfortable with. The dealer brought in 3 grams and one of my friends rolled a very fat blunt. We stood outside and smoked the blunt. It was huge and took forever to snuff. When it was finally dead, we reentered my home. I was not planning on getting ripped, but I was beyond that. I was stoned out of my mind. Suddenly all of my feelings of love and happiness faced a swift death. I began to feel the exact opposite of how I had been feeling before the marijuana was in my system. Those that I had told I loved an hour before, I began to see them in a new light. I began to feel an immense hatred towards them. I wanted them out of my house more than anything. However, they did not want to leave because they too, were completely stoned. Every word they spoke angered me. Not only did I feel hatred towards them, but I felt as though they hated me back. I began to feel self-conscious and victimized. Spoken phrases kept playing over and over in my mind. I felt as though everyone was angered by me.",
      "Then came the worst part, the paranoia. My friends dealer was completely belligerent and almost frightened to drive. But of course, I did not want him to stay in my house so we sent him packing. As soon as he left I kept imagining him getting into an accident and all the blame be on me. I kept thinking of the police finding him and discovering all of the drugs he had in his car. And worse, I kept thinking about him telling the police he came from my home. My mom kept calling my phone wondering how I was doing. I did not pick up because I was afraid I would sound as stoned as I was. Normally talking to my mother is not a problem, however this night was strangely different. Every time the phone vibrated and lighted up I felt as though somebody was screaming at me. Not just my mom and my friends, but everyone on the face of the planet. Its not the most comfortable feeling.",
      "My mom was about to come home in about an hour so I told my friends to leave. The waves of paranoia kept rushing over me so I decided to fall asleep. Marijuana usually makes me very tired and helps me enjoy a nights rest. However, the ecstasy was still very strong and would not allow me to sleep. I kept thinking about the drug dealer getting in an accident. I imagined the police pulling up to my driveway awaiting my arrest. I did not actually see the police pull up, I more felt their presence. Every five minutes I felt as though I knew they were there and jumped out of bed in a frantic state. I became so paranoid that I went through my purse and hid my stash in various places in my room. I had much difficulty finding it all the next day. I lay in bed the rest of the night, but did not get any sleep. Just laid there, almost unconscious. There was a few times during the night that I awoke and realized that I had not been sleeping. And then I just doze off again..",
      "I do not know why I had such a bad reaction to the marijuana. I have never reacted like that before. I will continue to use ecstasy and marijuana frequently. Theyre both beautiful alone, just not mixed."

      "My typical workday would include the following: 5-10 10mg morphine pills oraly. 2-3 pills of dexadrine about 30mg oraly. Oxycodone 20mg pill insulfated. Valium 20mg oraly. It took alot of time to build up tolerance to this combo. I would wake up at my apartment and take all the pills described above at once. Somtimes I would cut down on the morphine but typicaly my dose was 100mg.",
      "I started this habbit after I graduated high school. I slowly took opiates mostly oxycodone and methadone only when oxycodone was sold out. It took me a year to get up that quanity of drugs that I took everyday. After a year of perfecting my pill combo I knew there was no turning back. Besides I could buy my stash monthly so I never thought of the draw backs of leading this sort of lifestyle. Opiates didn't make sleepy they would be like pure instant energy and euphoria for the whole day. I took these drugs religously for 4 years. It made my shitty job feel great. When my contacts dried up I was a little scared but I didn't have a problem stoping the dexadrine... that was easy. The opiates and valium fucked me over. I learned very quickly that seizures happen when you withdrawl off of valium I had 3 seizures in one day. Plus the Flu like sickness from opiate withdrawl. I kept all such matters to myself no doctors no days off of work nothing. I have not felt rite at all after them seizures. It really really sucked. Well one day after being sober for 3 months I felt like I wanted jack a pharmacy in the middle night. I'm not that dumb but thats how bad I wanted the opiates.",
      "Well not a few days later I went to a friends house and walked in on him shootin herion. I never tried herion. I didn't even know it was an opiate. I wasn't into needles at all but to satisfy the urge I gave in like a little bitch. I went to go buy needles once at a pharmy and the guy gave me a wierde look and just gave them to me. He wouldn't let me pay. That was nice of him to be concerned and better safe than sorry. After that taste of herion I was hooked all over again. I spent the next 3-4 years doing shooting herion 3-5 times a day depending on how good the dope was. One week an uncut batch came in and it somhow acsidently got sold to the public and 2 of my friends were dead after that week. If I wasn't warned about it I'd be dead too. I was sad I lost 2 friends but that didn't prepare me of the next 3 friends that died the same year. 5 friends in one year flush all becuase of the habbit. Thats when I thought it would be a good idea to see what kinda help is avalible for my opiate problem. I went to a local hospital and tried to sign up for detox. The girl nurse that was about my age did not believe I did such drugs. I am a neat freak always have to be clean dressed I OCD clean all the time even though I feel like droping dead to get away from this habit. The nurse gave me a urine test then sent me home. WTF what kinda detox is that I thought.",
      "Oh my family didn't know of my habbit what so ever until after 2 years on herion. I told my family of what I have been doing the past 7 years and they didn't believe me. I felt like it was hopless for help. It was the worst thing I did to go ask for help like that. Hospital won't do nothing. Methadone clinic was on a 1 year waiting list and the drug supply was drying up. I can always get it but most of the other herion dealers had crap for sale. Time was running out fast and my body was just starting to go to shit becuase having a flu that never went away and just the most horrible sleepless nights possible. You know how it is. The next week after my hospital visit I got a phone call from methadone outpatient place. They said I tested positive for 8 controlled substances found in my urine sample. I had diazepam opiates cocaine thc norediazepam methadone and some bullshit thing called pyote cactus. I never tried pyote intentionaly I guess it was in the weed I was smoking. So anyway the phone call was about an emergency admition to methadone outpatient clinic. Hell ya I thought free methadone everyday was too good to be true. But I aslo had some friends that are prescribed methadone for pain and they told me never to go on the stuff becuase withdrawls from that last months.",
      "I found out the hard way when I got kicked out for having marijuana in my piss too many times. I then wanted a private doctor who could just prescribe me somthing without hanging out at the crackhead methadone clinic. Some people in there were disgustion and diseased nasty. I found a doctor that specializes in opiate addiction and he prescribed me 120 8mg suboxone pills each month cutting the dose down very very slowly. I was excited at first that was before I learned devoted opiate addicts don't get high off suboxone they just 'maintain'.",
      "I sopose thats the idea its been over a year on suboxone and I will say its good and it sucks. I still jones like a MOFO on it. I would prefer a lifetime script to oxycodone. The only good thing is I havn't done illegal opiates for over a year I want to soooo bad. I smoke pot everyday thats a givin. This is one battle I will never win. I'm not the only one losing either. I plan on getting some methadone from my buddy so i can take a break from a shitty year."

    "report": [
      "Let me just preface this by saying I have a very high tolerance to every drug I've ever tried, which includes grass, alchohol, amphetamine, shrooms, LSD, DXM, Ambien, and a wide range of pharms. I don't know why, but I always seem to be able to take and handle myself on a lot more of anything than my friends. I started smoking grass the beginning of my sophmore year, and within a few months I was smoking it in large amounts on a daily basis, which I guess helped raise my tolerance. I would smoke a whole ounce in less than a week. Soon afterwards I tried alchohol for the first time and found similar situations, people around me would get extremely fucked up before I was even buzzed. I could drink half a bottle of whiskey and still feel relatively normal.",
      "Even when I started to get high with my friends during/before school I could still handle myself fine. My friend Max, who would be destroyed after a single joint, used to marvel at my ability to hold myself better than him after having downed several shots of Vodka, Green Dragon, and unprecedented amounts of grass. Needless to say this always made me feel empowered, what's cooler than being able to show how much you could take?",
      "The only person who could ever keep up with me was my friend Matt, who honestly looked much more the part of someone with a high tolerance than I did. He was over six feet tall and was the kind of guy who crushed beer cans into his forehead. He was two grades above me, but we started hanging out alot when I turned him on to grass. Maybe a month later he turned me on to adderal. The first time we did some he gave me two 20 mg in the middle of a half day. I swallowed one and saved one for later. Later came in about five minutes when I basically said 'fuck it'. Being that it was a half day school was over an hour later and I didn't notice anything. I thought that my tolerance had overwhelmed the small amount I took and was somewhat dissapointed. Me, Matt and some other friends decided to go to my house to smoke and drink.",
      "I first felt it coming on while we were walking together. I started to feel intense rushes of energy, and desires to do strange physical activites. I would sprint for a few seconds, leap towards a lamp pole, latch on, then jump off. I got this feeling of supreme physical ability, which I would then prove with ridiculous feats of running and jumping. The walk home from school which usually takes forty-five minutes took only twenty. Everyone besides me and Matt kept complaining about how fast we were walking. When we got to my house I started to construct a makeshift bong. We didn't need one cause I had plenty of papers and even a small pipe, I just felt inspired to build something.",
      "Matt kept coming into the kitchen to ask me intricate questions about the constructions and nature of pipes. He wouldn't shut up, and everyone was cracking up because of it, including me. His speaking was very rapid and extremely intense. It seemed as though when he asked his seemingly inane questions he somehow meant them more than he usually did. Everyone else was just laughing, but eventually I started to feel a mental connect with him, because I understood the process his brain was undergoing. However, my energy was totally devoted to the construction of the bong, and his questions still somehow felt like an intrusion.",
      "After I finished and we drank a few heavy beers and smoked a whole lot of bowls I started to talk. And talk. And talk. I basically gave the entire history of drugs (I am well read in the subject), starting from ancient mystics using physcadelics to the widespread use of Amphetamine by the Nazis during World War II. My other friends were so stoned/drunk that they just kind of sat there spaced out, but Matt was seriously taking it all in. He kept asking me more and more questions, and we got into intense and lengthy conversations about drugs, mostly with him asking and me telling. We would always be midsentence when the other interjected, and we would always then say 'Just let me finish'. We maybe each said 'just let me finish' a hundred times or so in the space of less than an hour. We each felt that everything we said was so important, such an interesting insight into what the other person was saying. Amphetamine is definetly the conversationists drug.",
      "I don't really remember what we did after that, I think we went to the park. All I remember was that the conversation carried into the entire night and when I got home I cleaned my entire room. And I read. And I drew. I did anything that could hold my attention. I didn't go to sleep that night, and I was still pretty wired for the rest of the next day.",
      "Fast forward a few months. Me and Matt popped addies whenever we got the chance. I continued to use marijuana on a daily basis, and I also started to drink hard liquor more often than before. I also started to drink coffee every day before school. For a few months, everyday after school I would have a cup of strong coffee with a shot of baileys irish cream and I think a joint. Amphetamine, although one of my favorites, became harder to come by. The kid who me and Matt used to get them from graduated (as well as Matt). Soon I was alone in my amphetamine adventures, as well as without a connect. That was until I learned my friend Max (the one with zero-tolerance) had a 20 mg perscription for his ADD. I struck gold.",
      "I had so much weed on me that I could afford to trade him a quarter for a handful of pills. I used them mostly in smaller amounts for tests (especially finals). Still, whenever I had a few days to kill I would stock up and do up to 100 mgs at a time. I can only describe the feeling as being an 'Ubermensch'. I understood where the Nazis got off on taking them. If you take enough you feel indestructible, like you have unlimited power. In cases where I used to have anxiety and depression I would have power and ability. The comedown always sucked, the hangover was far worse than that from alcohol. Still, this didn't outweigh it's positive affects in my mind, so I continued to take it. But Max couldn't always give me some, so for a few more months I didn't have any. In this time period I started with Physcadelics, which radically changed my perspective on everything. I started reflecting more inward than I had before. But those are stories for another time.",
      "I started to get really intense anxiety about a large number of things, grades, college, family problems. Not to mention I had lost basically my best friend Matt when he graduated. Besides from being a really good friend, he was also the only person that could match my tolerance. I became somewhat reclusive and a little depressed. I also started to feel occasionally paranoid on grass, sometimes to a rather large degree. I knew it wasn't the drug, but that it was just because that was my general state of mind at the time. None the less It still bothered me.",
      "And then the last day before christmas break, Max brought me two 20s. I didn't even question whether I could handle them because I had done so much more in the past. So I swallowed them before school, drank two or three strong cups of coffee and set about my way. Initially everything was great as usual, I felt confident, powerful, I was articulate in that very tweaky addy sort of way. I had a great time in my classes and I spoke out every chance I got. It felt like the best way to kick off winter break.",
      "But then, the last period of the day, a few trivial events happened which set me off. I was trying to leave one of my classes and people I hadn't seen or talked to in years kept coming up and bombarding me with questions and conversation. Usually on Adderal this is a plus, an opportunity to spread the vast knowledge of the speeded mind. However, I was already late to class and for some reason I felt that getting to class was extremely important. I didn't want to deal with all these people talking to me, so I just split while they were all in midsentence. I felt bombarded from the outside. I got through my last class alright but I still felt a little uneasy.",
      "After school I was hanging out with a few friends on the street by our school and I was watching all the people pass by us and I started to get paranoid. I could tell from the get go that the paranoia wasn't justified (I had experienced similar feelings on grass) but it didn't stop at all. I was very fucking stimulated, mentally and physically. I was thinking at twenty times the speed of everyone around me and I felt energy bristling inside every part of me. Usually these would be positive effects, but with my negative attitude they started to make me feel wierd. My friends were also incapable of deciding where they wanted to go hangout (as teens usually are) and I started to get very impatient and irritated. I felt somehow exposed being out there in the open with everyone from our school around us, and my mind had already built up the idea that I would feel safe and calm if we could just go sit down somewhere privately.",
      "None of this was helped by one of the kids who was there, because he has a negative attitude towards anyone who would even try Adderal. Everytime I suggested we go somewhere (which was maybe every half minute) he would give me a very condescending look and say something akin to 'You're freaking out'. I mean, he was somewhat right but that's a fucked up thing to say to someone when they're becoming mentally unhinged. Anyway, someone came up and started talking to me and when I turned to talk with them the people I was with left, so I felt really alone standing there on the corner by myself. I decided to go home and try to calm down.",
      "Being at my house actually did help a bit, because I live in a really old/big building and it has tons of places to explore that I never had the chance to. I went up and down every staircase of my building, I inspected every nook and cranny, I went on every roof and through every door that didn't have an alarm (and even some that did). When I had finally a flawless interior map of my building in my head it was about 8 p.m., 12 hours after I had taken the 20s. I had mentally calmed down but was still very much physically stimulated. I came home and met my Aunt and Uncle for the first time, which was something I felt uneasy about. Shortly afterward me, my dad and my uncle went to go smoke a joint.",
      "This had been something I had been thinking about for a long time beforehand. I had wanted to show to my uncle how high my tolerance was ever since I had heard he smoked. I also figured a joint would help me calm down a little more. It had basically the opposite reaction on both counts. I was higher than I had been in a long time, which was pleasant at first but quickly turned around. I started to shake and feel very unhinged so we went back to my house and I crawled into my bed hoping to fall asleep. Of course, I didn't. What followed was the worst 24 hours I've ever experienced.",
      "I wasn't any less stimulated than I had been earlier. I was still unbelievably wired in both body and mind. I started to feel really ashamed almost that I had fucked up this first smoke with my uncle. That combined with a general paranoia, fear, and anxiety about everything caused me to shake even more. Now, I've shaken in previous experiences with stimulants and even DXM, but it was always short lasting and it didn't bother me much. But in combination with the mindfuck I was going through it turned into hell. I somehow worked this idea into my head that I had been shaking the entire day. I know this might not seem like a big deal, and in retrospect even if it was true I don't care, but at that intense moment of isolated fear it was unbearable. I tried to write down everything I was thinking for future referrence. Here is a brief selection:",
      "'I have just now understood what has happened today. While it was happening I was too far gone to completely understand the situation. This is not only largely representative of the entire time have I been shaking all this time? For how long? How many people know? How many people think I have a problem because of this? Is this the root cause of the issue? Fear? Somehow brought on by guilt? WHY IS IT HERE? Why can't my mind conquer it? The guilt I feel really is quite self-centered. I feel guilty because I believe my mind is so powerful and so able to fix the world and yet cannot! Yes, yes NO! NO! NO! I can't run from the truth anymore. I cannot stand the fact that because of my masichist subconsious I have manifested my worst nightmare into reality. And the feeling of incontrolability just makes it worse and worse...'",
      "For most of the time I didn't even write. I tried to draw, and that held me for a while, but the anxiety was just so overwhelming that for most of the time I just lay there in my bed, shaking. Eventually, the next night, my Aunt came to talk to me and brought me upstairs and helped me calm down. At this point the Adderal was starting to wear off anyway, but still it helps to have an understanding and nonjudgemental person to help you come down.",
      "Basically what I got out of this is that my general state of mind and well being has a direct influence on any drug I put in my body. When I was care-free and was with good friends who I felt a connection with, I had a great time. When I felt like I was by myself and was anxious and depressed I had a terrible time. Even though I have a very high tolerance, I too can have a bad experience."

      "T+1:00 - (13:50) No effects.",
      "T+1:05 - (13:55) I was urged to finish the dosage, I added and took the remaining 25mg orally amounting to a total of 50mg ingested. Though, after ingesting the remaining powder in a solution, I quickly realized that this power was not baking soda, it has a very, very unique taste to it. It's extremely hard to explain--It's not the taste of isopropyl alcohol (for those lucky ones whom have ventured to taste this wondrous solution), nor is it the taste of honey (as one would not expect). I can say that it reminded me of a prescribed medication without the capsule. Perhaps, something given to kids who cannot swallow pills. You do not want to take this orally, it's enough to make some squeamish people vomit. The taste, while incommunicably horrid, is something you do not want to experience.",
      "T+1:10 - (14:00) No effects, I'm wondering if I will even be affected by this compound.",
      "T+1:20 - (14:10) No effects. Becoming slightly disappointed.",
      "T+1:30 - (14:20) No effects. Still disappointed.",
      "T+1:40 - (14:30) No effects. I'm feeling glad that I actually didn't pay any money for this.",
      "T+2:00 - (14:50) No effects. I decide to go outside (yes in the blizzard) and take photos of plants that are covered in ice. Yes, to answer your questions, I would have done this even without the 'influence' of 4-meo-mipt--if there was an influence that existed. Anyway, back to the story. Nothing at all seems to be distorted even in the slightest of ways, the snow is pearl-white and the plants, well, dead brown (honestly, what did I expect? A rain-forest?). So anyway, I come back in from being in subzero wind-chills. I warm-up, wait for my glasses to stop condensing H20, and finally return back to this chair.",
      "T+2:10 - (15:00) No effects.",
      "T+2:20 - (15:10) (PLATEAU) Perhaps slight effects. I'm becoming hungry (perhaps due to the fact I haven't eaten since 2 hours before the original dosage). I'm not going to say that these are effects resulting from the dosages, but I have felt this way throughout the entire 'ride'.",
      "Just to describe the slight sensations:",
      "I have this awkward feeling in the posterior palette of my mouth. Possibly pre-vomit reflex? I have nothing else to compare this to, sorry.",
      "I have an ever-so-slight rocking sensation. I mean, extremely slight. I can't begin to explain how subtle this is. As I have said, perhaps a placebo effect?",
      "I have slight uneasiness in my stomach. Possibly due to hunger or just perhaps an onset of this drug.",
      "T+2:30 - (15:20) All effects seem to have dissipated. I've eaten a carmel rice cake (shut up, yes it was good) and I doubt that will hinder any effects if and when they do decide to unveil themselves.",
      "T+2:40 - (15:30) I'm going to go lay down as instructed by a peer. I will attempt to remain prostrate for 15 or so minutes.",
      "T+3:00 - (15:50) Though I cannot entirely deny the fact that nothing exists out of the ordinary, I can say that I feel slightly relaxed, tired if you would. On the contrary, while my body seems to be slightly tired, my mind is not at all. I do not have racing thoughts, I do not, honestly, feel any different in reference to baseline mindset up until now. I can't stress the fact that while I've never done any other major chemical compound, no matter it's legality, this is an extremely, extremely subtle one at that. For any of you that have taken Valium (as I assume most of you have), I will make my best efforts to try and compare the two. While Valium makes one extremely weak, unresponsive, and generally relaxed, this compound does do that, but on a very basic, minimal level. I was not entirely expecting an over-the-top 'trip' per-say, but I will admit that I am, in a sense, afraid to have a 'trip' at such lengths, but, what I'm trying to say, possibly, is that I am disappointed. I figured I'd never be the one to say that while speaking of a drug.",
      "T+3:30 - (14:20) In my arm muscles especially, I have a feeling comparable to 1/10 that of Valium. It seems to have the muscles relaxed to where it isn't all-too noticeable unlike the extremely fast 'come-up', more what I'd like to call a 'train-wreck', that Valium brings. I've decided to myself that I am already in the 'come-down.' While I haven't had any extremely noticeable changes since the original dosage, I can assure you that something, yet subtle, exists.",
      "T+4:00 - (14:50) While leaving this slightly disappointed, I've come to understand something about myself. I also understand that this compound is somewhat rare as a result of it's difficulty in making, and I also see that not many reports were written on this specific chemical. I've come to better understand that my body doesn't react easily to drugs (this has been confirmed numerous times.) So, in my best of interests, I'm worried that this could also negate the validity of this report in respect to the effects on the general populous (the effects on the public).",
      "CONCLUSION: Yay! I made it without killing myself or vommiting! In retrospect, nothing in 'me' has changed. I feel the same, I felt the same. There were no concurrent disturbances in for colors, images, shapes, etc. I did notice small vibrations in vision for split seconds. If I'd concentrate on something for long enough, such as this text for example, I would notice small vibrations and extremely subtle visuals. A comparable phenomena would be when I close my eyes as I drift into sleep. The discharges of the neurons in my eyes is basically what I see. Just for the record, I knew I wouldn't, but I did not experience any augmentation of sense, hence, synesthesia. I did not feel any euphoric feelings. Not even for the slightest bit. I know people will tell me, 'aww it's ok, at least you didn't lose anything ... ', well I'd like to agree with that, but that aqueous solution with the MeO was HORRID. I can still taste it *spits*. I'm leaving here somewhat disappointed. I've come to better understand my body and how it reacts with drugs. I've also bettered my English grammar, no thanks to this drug (ok, perhaps that's overshooting)!  Though I am pleased that this particular drug didn't send me soaring into another reality--or plummeting into a metaphoric 'living-hell'.",
      "Just to put it simply, I did come to realize a small feeling of euphoria but only at T+2:20 where I've noted the PLATEAU. Given the small amount of reports circulating, this by far is the longest time taken for someone to realize the effects after taking a dosage. As I have stated previously, it could be a direct result from the fact that I am very unresponsive to medications, I don't know ... I'm not a doctor (nor do I pretend to be).",
      "Basically here, I'm just saying, I doubt this drug has any major, or even minor potentials on harming living things. What I experienced is nothing compared to prescribed drugs, so, personally, I feel that this was nothing but a waste of time. For this being my 1st official 'Psychedelic trip' (yes, notice the quotes), I can say that I'm at least happy that it didn't go wrongly.",
      "14-2-2007 17:02:34",
      "I just put something in the microwave and I noticed as I pushed the buttons that the beep sounds dramatically lower to me. Also, as it finished the 3 consecutive beeps were never that low before.",
      "As a test, I decided to listen to the frequencies on a phone as I dialed my own phone number, I realized that they do sound quite lower. But, things like my mother's voice and my own do not seem diminished nor augmented. I can also admit that throughout this little expedition I experienced today, I did have hallucination of the ears (verb please). I heard little beeps and rings as if the telephone was ringing, but in reality it wasn't. Something I though I'd account for."

      "'I'll take your strongest black. Do you offer Venti espresso cups?'",
      "And the whole thing would by downed in a matter of moments. I made very strong brews at home (about 5 tablespoons per 2 cups of water) and sucked them down as if they were my only source of hydration... and, to be honest, they pretty much were. I'd go on binges of 4 cups in the course of two hours or so, and this would go on for about a week until I got too jittery to walk straight, or suffered too intense of a panic attack to keep playing with my life.",
      "I also really used to enjoy the habitual smoking of pipes, bubblers, bongs, joints, blunts etc. etc. I was really into it, and  it was enjoyable. But! Caffeine FUCKED IT UP! I didn't smoke for a while, and so supplemeted the boring day to day reality with my massive caffeine intake. And then, I began smoking again. Daily. And it was alright at first.. I'd feel a little naseous, though, and I'd get hyper sensitive and have a very high awareness, very unlike my friends who sat, stoned, for hours. I had to move. I had to clean. It was weird, and I bet all my friends thought I was insane for sure. And then, one day, I just snapped.",
      "I had had a BooKoo energy drink, my typical four morning cups, 2 lunch cups, and a lot of sugar earlier that day. We were driving, smoking, and I got this awful tight feeling in my chest. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I HAD to move- maybe the music was just too intense, but I could not stop jiggling and wiggling my limbs everywhere. My breathing became labored and difficult. It felt as though my throat were swelling. My heart also began to beat at an erratic and almost ridiculous pace. I could barely differentiate the separate beats! I made my friend pull over so I could get outside and walk.",
      "I bought a Twix bar because I thought I just needed some sugar and the little caffeine that was in the chocolate. I devoured the whole thing in a matter of seconds, and it helped for a little while. But, then it got worse. I had to keep opening windows, changing positions, massaging my muscles, massaging my sternum and the flesh over my heart.",
      "I had to get out, I was having a full on panic attack or SOMETHING. I popped my head in between the two front seats and said in a quiet voice with 0 conviction: 'Not to sound weird or anything, but I really need to get out. If you could just like... pull over... it would be awesome.' So I grabbed my schoolbag and jumped out, with the other passengers saying shit like, 'Um... ok. Whatever, dude.'",
      "My friends, I guess, just assumed I really was going insane because they did not try to help me at all. I ran to a doctors office (even though I couldn't breathe... it seemed to help bring down the panic aspect in that I felt my heart was racing for a reason) and asked for something to dilate my lungs. My brain was not communicating with my mouth, I guess, because the nurse told me, ' I don't know what you mean by... dilate your lungs!' I have not been diagnosed with asthma, and I'm not 18, so they couldn't do SHIT to help me! I decided to just call my mom, to have her pick me up. This whole time I was going through hell, unable to breathe or form coherent thoughts or sentences.",
      "I honestly attribute this whole ordeal to my caffeine intake, and my anxiety and possible lung problems I think were heightened by the marijuana.  If you have a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety, or anything like that... I would NOT recommend",
      "taking lots of caffeine pills (like, over 6), or ingesting more than 3 servings of an energy drink + coffee in just a few hours, and THEN smoke a lot of pot in a hotboxed car. The whole incident I have jsut described has happened to me about 3 times... and it's terrifying! Just know yourself and your limits!"

      "July had been unusually cool and foggy in the San Francisco Bay Area, but finally on the 31st we finally got some nice warm weather.  And just in time for the Area:One music festival! Some friends from San Diego were visiting, and it sounded like a great time, with a lot of great bands and DJs there.",
      "Now I had been debating whether or not I should try some 5-MeO-DiPT ('foxy') that I had recently gotten.  I had talked with a friend the night before who had recommended that I wait until I was in a more controlled environment to try a new substance.  I agreed that this was a good idea, but everything I had read had indicated that this wasn't too much of a mind-blower, and so I didn't think there would be much chance of a bad scene.  I was going with a few friends so in the small chance that something bad did happen, I wouldn't be in too big of trouble.",
      "So I decided to bring it along with me and see what kind of scene it was.  The festival was at a local amphitheatre, with a second tent set up for DJs and a few techno bands.  We had tickets for the lawn area in the back, so we brought a blanket and set up in the middle of the lawn.",
      "The day was beautiful and warm, and after wandering around the place to see what booths were there and finding some friends that happened to be around, we put on a ton of sunscreen and lay down in the sun to watch Rhinoceros, a cool french band that plays what I can only describe as 'guitar-techno'.  Feeling that the set and setting were pretty good, I poured a pre-measured 5 milligrams of foxy into a little dixie cup, washed it around with a little bit of water and swallowed it down.",
      "One thing first:  5 mg is a miniscule amount of material!  I can't imagine measuring out an accurate amount with a pretty good scale or unless someone used the dilution method.",
      "So anyways, I swallowed the stuff, and it had the bitter alkaloid taste.  I didn't think it was nearly as bad as some people have said.  I don't know that I'd make it the newest flavor at ben&jerry's, but it wasn't anything that a gulp or two of water didn't wash away.  It was 5:08pm, and I laid back on the blanket while The Roots started their set, and waited for things to start.  A minute or so later my gf SMS-ed me a message hoping that I was having a good time at the concert, which I thought was nice and put me in an even better mood. :)",
      "I got the 'alert' at about 10 minutes, at 15 I knew that this stuff was definitely active, and by 20 things were ALL going on!  I found two things...  first I noticed that there was a definite sense of time-dilation.  I'd keep on checking my watch to see how much time had gone by, and it had only been a minute or two!",
      "The other important thing, though, is that this stuff is truly active on the digestive system.  At 20 minutes my stomach was already a little upset.  I was never truly nauseous, but I definitely wouldn't want much to eat.  I had read about this effect, and so I had purposely eaten a light lunch, just a fruit smoothie.  I don't think that a bigger lunch would've caused any problem, but on the other hand some friends came by with some garlic fries at that moment, and I was *not* interested.",
      "After about 40 minutes I was getting tired of hip-hop and wanted to go over to the techno tent. My 'sitter' and I got over just in time to catch the end of Timo Maas's set.  It was amazing, and I no problem at all getting into the music and dancing around.  After 20 minutes or so Timo Maas left and The Orb came on next.  They got all their wacky visual stuff set up, and started their show.  The Orb always put on a great live show, and I was loving it.",
      "At a little past 1 hour, something interesting happened.  I was up near the front, dancing to the orb, with my eyes closed, just enjoying the music, when a girl moved by me.  In doing so, her sweaty arm brushed my sweaty arm, and *WOW*...  I was jolted out of my trance, and thought, 'what was THAT?!'.  It was an incredibly erotic sensation.  I can see where the name 'foxy' comes from...",
      "At 1:30 past  I left to get some water, and discovered that I was hungry.  Actually, I mean: HUNGRY!  The smoothie for lunch apparently wasn't enough, and I was in such a mood for some food.  However, I remembered the 5-MeO-DiPT 'peristalsis' report in TIHKAL, and so I decided that it might be better to wait until later to eat.  It was hard to, with all the food places around.  Anorexia is not a side-effect of this stuff!",
      "At about 2 hours elapsed (about 7:10pm), I'd say that I was peaking.  I was totally engrossed in The Orb, and was having a fantastic time. The strange thing is that it was almost completely physical.  My thought processes seemed only maybe a little different, not at all like the weird speculations that happen on acid.  Although the thought of talking to people seemed a little scary, doing so was not a problem at all.  And while things seemed brighter and more intense, there were no visuals at all.  I get tracers even on half a hit of acid, and so I was looking specifically for something, even closed eye visuals that I have had gotten on low-dose shroom trip.  Nothing!",
      "Soon after this, I began to start coming down.  The Orb finished up, and they were followed by Paul Oakenfold.  I'm not a big fan of Oakie, and so decided to head back to the main amphitheatre just in time to catch the end of New Order's set.  That was a lot of fun, I danced some more, and then sat down with my friends.",
      "At 3 hours I was rapidly coming back to normal.  Talking to people was easy, so I told the few friends who knew what I was up to what a good time I had had.  I was still starving, so I broke down and had a kit-kat bar.  While I may have been hungry, foxy definitely isn't like pot in making everything taste good!  The kit kat bar tasted merely average, and combined with the weirdness going on with my stomach, I didn't even finish it.  It felt good to eat a little bit, though.",
      "At 3:30 hours past, Outkast started their set, and I sat back and listened to the hip-hop.  It was good, I had never really listened to much of their music, and I quite enjoyed it.  By this time I was almost back to normal, and at 4 hours I only had a little bit of tingling in my lips and a slighty queasy stomach to indicate that anything was going on.",
      "By 5 hours I was through.  Outkast finished, and then Moby came on. After that, we left, stopped by In-n-Out, where I got an Animal-Style Double-Double Burger which tasted good.. That night I was feeling a little tired, fell asleep easily and slept well.",
      "My overall reaction? I had an incredibly fun time.  At the small dose that I did, 5-MeO-DiPT doesn't seem to a particularly intense substance.  I experienced a small amount of mental effects, although I've had much stronger effects from Marijuana.  In fact, at the 1-hour point I described it to a friend as 'being stoned but without being stupid'.   No profound thoughts, and with the complete lack of visuals, no profound visions either!  My mood was lifted, like being on a small amount of shrooms.,",
      "The body-effects were something else, though!  Movement was pleasing, and physical contact was incredible.  I really wished I had someone to give me a massage, but suitable person was around. :(  Oh well, I still enjoyed myself thoroughly.  There is nothing profound about this stuff, so I think that it's a lot more suited to personal interaction (especially involving physical contact! :) ) as opposed to the 'meditating in a dark room filled with candles' experience like some other substances do.",
      "I would say that the amount I took (5mg) was a little low, as at the 2-hour point I was wishing that things could go just a little bit higher.  But I think that it was better to aim low than high for my first time.",
      "Bottom line: I would totally do it again!"

      "(ED, excuse the long intro, but it serves to show the lack of thought that can go into an experiment like this.)",
      "- Preamble -",
      "I was 17 years of age and had heard about a plant which would get you high. That fact, the name and what it looked like was about the only information I had on Datura, known to me then by its colloquial name of Malpitte. Typical of my approach to the experiment, mindless, I only registered the name phonetically and it only later clicked that the direct translation of the Afrikaans 'Mal Pitte' to English is 'Mad Seeds.' I live in South Africa, by the way.",
      "Also, some half-baked methodology was told to me of having to put the seeds from the pod into water, this apparently seperated the 'good' seeds from the 'bad' seeds by a process of sinking or floating. The distinction of 'bad' was understood to mean poisonous.",
      "Unfortunately there was no clarity on whether the good seeds would float or sink, so the philosophy was advanced that since the method would leave us with a 50/50 chance of choosing ALL good or ALL bad seeds, it would be better to rather dispense with the method altogether and just eat all the seeds, thereby softening the blow of a possible poison attack. Good work team!",
      "It was an interesting situation the day I ate the seeds. I was a boarder at my school and had a day off school with virtually nobody in the dormitory, this was due to the exam timetable leaving a few days free at which opportunity most of the people went home. My home was too far away to justify this so I stayed.",
      "I made an illegal journey out of the school grounds with a friend to go and buy some Weed but we didn't remember the directions very well and got a bit lost. We happened to walk passed a Datura plant which grows along the way and I remembered that I had some dried seeds in my cupboard at the dorm so the decision was taken to 'try some.'",
      "- The Seeds -",
      "I had half a handfull of seeds approx. on a relatively empty stomach. It was winter. Spent time throwing a large tins plastic lid as a frisbee in the dorm waiting for the effects with friend. First effects, a very dry mouth and the 'off' feeling sometimes accomponied with the flu. About 45 minutes in I decided to walk up to the school to obtain energy drink and pie at canteen. ",
      "First mental effects were like being stoned and I sat on the side of the road leading up to the school to enjoy it. Memory is effected from this point on and I can only give flashes as I remember things. After a blank spot I got back to the dorm with pie and drink but mouth was too dry to swallow either. I discovered a frighteningly shrivelled penis without urination capability when I went to the bathroom as well as eyes without near focus capability. These two things set me worrying and for the rest of the day things took a cold and lonely menacing character. It was about 10:30am.",
      "I still do not know what happened to my friend but apparently he didn't feel anything and drifted off to chill with some other friends, totally unaware of my situation. So negative introspection and isolation were in order and I wandered off to the school sports field.",
      "On the way, and whenever I was walking, my foot seemed to slip through an oil patch with a nasty jerk and I would closely inspect the ground for this oil patch but would not find it. Somehow I registered that because my eyesight was affected by the seeds maybe I could not see the oil patch, that the oil patch might not be real did not occur to me. And so it was with my hallucinations throughout the day, I would take it for granted that they were real, but if it were proven unreal it simply added to the negative menacing backdrop to the whole scene. I would rather attempt to find the reality of the hallucinations than admit that something was seriously wrong with my world.",
      "The next memory is of a gigantic network of insect populations crawling into and out of a shadow which fell across a painted concrete wall. The image persisted for a long while until a banging noise interrupted my reverie and I realised I was actually sitting on the grandstand watching people on the sports field. That kind of thing would occur too, I would lose awareness and float inside a perception, somewhat pleasant, until it broke and the cold loneliness would be felt stronger with each return of it.",
      "The closest thing I've experienced to it is delerious thoughts during sickness or fever, but on a bigger scale.",
      "Somehow I remember the banging noise as golf balls hitting the grandstand(?) I may have attempted sleeping because I remember getting up from a lying position, the stands were metal and ice, ice cold. I was astounded to find that my feet weighed near 8 kilograms each, I think that's about 4 pounds? Very heavy.",
      "Now the memory is flooded with conversations that I tried to add to but found myself talking aloud to no one, an extremely lonely and confusing feeling. I remember a long conversation with a person which was different in that he was vividly real and I am still tempted to think that he WAS real because we talked about the seeds and how I was high etc. it's just that this person had left the school about a year earlier. If it was an hallucination than it was an awesome accomplishment of the human mind.",
      "At some point I was in bed watching my cupboard float up and down and left and right and up and down etc. in reverie again, when I felt the need to chase after a shadow I saw a from the corner of my vision, some quick and sinister thing. Each time I turned a corner it turned some corner up ahead. The last thing it zipped into as I turned a corner was the dark cavity underneath some ones bed, scared shitless I got back to my blankets without looking under that bed. Spiders crawled underneath my blankets up towards my face...",
      "Even with the dormitory so empty and the hostel masters all up the school I was extremely lucky to stay out of trouble. There were signs that stuff happened which I don't remember, like grass down the back of my jersey and posters that were found in the dustbin. Other things I remember: showering and passing somebody shampoo and hearing the bottle hit the floor - nobody in the next stall to pass to - and talking to people who would vanish into thin air, visual ghosts at the edge of vision, and small reveries in emersive visualisations, they all happened in front of that cold aweful lonely emotional background. Even the fright aspects were flat and lonely, cold. It occured to me at some point that I was walking around hell. This feeling left me soul stunned.",
      "- Book -",
      "A little bit of heavan floated down out of the darkness as I was exhaustedly drifing off that night. Some kind of book appeared with impressive clarity, like the ultimate reverie and it wiped all traces of the cold and lonely away, leaving me struck with a fresh smiling amazement.",
      "I remember nothing as to the content of the book, but to read from it was the most satisfying thing in the world. I can't relate any experience to it other then religious ones I've had at other times. But more so.",
      "I could experiment with the book, like looking ahead from the line I was reading to the upcoming paragraph indentations to see if they would be the same by the time I got to them. They would stay the same, though if I jumped ahead the words would appear all jumbled and unreadable. I could think to myself, 'I have to remember what I'm reading, this book has everything I need to know' but as soon as I got to the end of a page, I would wake up with my hand shooting into the air trying to turn the page. I would forget what I was reading instantly.",
      "Some one else I know has also had a similar experience when he tried Datura despite my warnings. (He would have a much worse experience than mine.) But the fact that two people can hallucinate something so similar and be so awestruck by it makes me think that it must be more than just an hallucination. I never told him of the book so he hallucinated it independently of any suggestion.",
      "I think I've made this too long. I'll just say that my eyesight was still bad the next day, and without being able to study the previous day I ended up with 12% for math. If you are going to experiment with anything, be clever, respectful, patient and willing to not do it. My opinion is don't try Datura, try something else. The rewards are not worth the effort and danger. I thought the book was most excellent, but I will never go through that cold loneliness to get to it again."

      "My friend J told me all about Propylhexedrine, saying it was his favorite drug out of MJ, alcohol, salvia/amanitas (ha! - he got 'trapped in the 5th dimension'), and various pharms.  Anyway, I got a Benzedrex and capped up the cotton part.  Smelled like lavender, but it wasn't bothersome yet.  Took them just before 1st period.",
      "An hour later, I experienced an intense euphoric peak.  There were these great pleasurable shivers that ran through my body.  It was as if I was so fast at everything that everything seemed to slow down. I felt speedy all day (very very speedy) and it felt great to do anything.  I took four pages of notes in English on a 20 minute presentation - very out of character for me.  I discovered that scratching or rubbing my scalp produced very pleasurable waves of euphoria. ",
      "After school, I had a few cigarettes with some buddies and picked up another benzedrex, as did M.  At J's house, M ate his, and I gagged mine down, dry heaving every time I tried to swallow.  Up until now, the smell of lavender on my breath and my burps hadn't been too bad.  Suddenly it was the most nauseating smell in the world. This time I tried just eating it in 3 pieces - bad idea. This stuff tastes very very bad.",
      "I felt weird and kept burping, but coming up was fairly enjoyable.  I played with J's dog and had a nice conversation/'rational discussion' about Christianity and 'Organized Religion'. ",
      "I began to feel intense nausea just before every burp, but figured out that holding my nose tightly eliminated most of the lavender part of the burps.  I said 'let's get some MJ so as to relieve this awful nausea.' and immediately threw up into an iced tea container.  That was very conveniently located.  Getting the cotton out of my throat was rather difficult - I had to undergo many throat contractions to get it out.  I felt a lot better, but still a lot of nausea, that's some sort of paradox.",
      "After this, the crash was not great. Until I ate some Spaghettio's at 9:30 (first food all day, only drank some water, iced tea, and Gatorade, all of which were lost when I puked), I felt horrible nausea.  I still feel it, but as the Spaghettio's have taken over the lavender scent, it's bearable.  I believe that my weight may have something to do with my negative reaction to the second dose.  I am 6'1' and 135 lbs, so most drugs affect my body much more than the average individual.  300 mg DXM causes a 6 hour 3rd plateau trip for me.  It was not very wise to take a second dose on the first day I've done a new drug."

      "I have been waiting for the 'right time' since my first experience.  I had tried, without success, knowing it just was not 'right' so all I got out of it was some very heavy laughter the other 2 attempts since my first time.  It did not take me 'down' as it did the first, which was a rather scary experience, not ever doing hallucinating drugs before. ",
      "Today was different.  I was ready.  I went to a Yoga class last night.  I had acupuncture around noon today to 'balance my chakras' and 'karma clearing'.  When I arrived home from the acupuncture appointment, my sitter was waiting.  It never fails that after I have acupuncture from this certain lady here in town (I have been to others but her and I really 'click' because I feel that she has great energy and knows what she is doing very well!)  that I feel VERY clear, cleansed, whatever you want to call it.  She is amazing.",
      "Around 2pm today I said 'Okay I am a little scared but I feel it's the right time' and the sitter assured me it was okay and not to be afraid.  I believe the excitement of knowing it was the perfect time may have what made me frightened a little.  We went into my bedroom where it is extremely comfortable and even sitting on the bed you just sink into it, naturally.  When I sat in the middle of the bed I felt bigger than normal.  I felt like I was on my 'throne'.  Haha - anyway, the sitter sat next to me, ready to grab the pipe and lighter when I was not able to hold it anymore.  She said she felt like the bed was huge, in response to my comment.  I thought that was strange.  I just felt very present in occupying that space.  The acupuncture helped me here I believe too.",
      "The first hit, I was still aware of my surroundings but felt VERY different.  I really liked THAT feeling and hoped my mind could stay in that 'feeling' for eternity.  It was GREAT - was very very aware but of a different reality.  The second hit I coughed it away after holding it for a few.  The high I was in made me laugh at something but I was still 'aware' but the reality had shifted a little bit from the first hit.  The cough must have taken oxygen from my brain.  The sitter started laughing at me for saying something I guess and I pointed the lighter at her and said 'Don't laugh!'.  I was laughing but serious at the same time.  I wanted this high to go higher.",
      "The third hit - I thought I was going to DIE of coughing.  The bowl must have been emptied out on that one as it was not much taste, just an extremely STRONG burned taste.  I coughed and was still high of course but the coughing, OMG.  IT was bad but the thing was, I was still aware, as long as I kept my eyes opened.  I would close my eyes and feel like we (me and the sitter) were part of this whole ONE huge entity, like part of the skin of a being, keeping it all alive, or making it all 'gel'.  We were somewhere around the temple part of the face of this entity we all are a part of.  The reality I knew the sitter to be in was not the one I really knew anymore.  It seemed like an eternity and my mind was trying to figure out which reality was real.  I would close my eyes and feel this place of darkness that does not normally exist when my eyes are shut. ",
      "I looked over and the sitter was loading the bong with 25x!  I got up and said 'oh no', staggering as I'm trying to run to the bathroom because I'm laughing and did not want to pee my pants from laughing SO hard.  I told her she needed to come to the reality I was in and see if she'd want 25x to be snuck up on her!  It was funny.  She was bent over laughing as I'm running to the bathroom.",
      "I sat back on the bed, rather quickly, because I had not really gone where I felt I was going to be taken.  I was not too deep in the experience I just knew awaited me.  The fourth hit - damn lighter!!  I could NOT get it lit for the life of me.  The sitter tried to help but I felt the heat in my eyes and took the lighter back.  Finally got it lit and got the hit to be a very good one! ",
      "The fifth hit - damn lighter again!!  Numerous tries and the lighter just did not want to cooperate with me.  The sitter took the lighter and lit the bowl.  At first the flame was coming up towards my nose and all I remember thinking was 'my nose hairs need shortened a little anyway'.  LOL as I'm typing this!!  That's exactly what my brain was thinking.  How silly!  Finally the flame went down into the bowl and this time the hit was extremely strong, smoky, the sitter's eyes got very big, like OMG and I do not remember anything about the bowl/bong/pipe/lighter after this.  I laid back, shut my eyes and opened them.  I saw the sitter and she was there in that dimension with me but when I closed my eyes again I kept them closed.",
      "It was like this dimension was folded up and a new one appeared as the folding was taking place.  It was definitely nothing I have ever imagined.  The space my subconscious was occupying was its own.  My physical self or my 'ego' had been folded away as the unfolding of my subconsciousness became what occupied the dimension.  I remember speaking with someone and to the sitter but do not know what I was saying (until later the sitter tells me).  My subconscious went to this place.  It was dark and I could feel entities around me but it was like I had a main guide, like a friend, that was with me.  After examining this space for what seemed like a long while I was thinking 'Is this all there is?' and 'Where's the light, where's the ???'  The next thing I know, I was extended through time and space with like an elasticity which I was immediately (in saying 'I' I mean my subconsciousness, not my physical self) taken to a very serene and tranquil setting of a beach and very calm waters.  It was if my consciousness was there for real, seeing the image of a spirit or an angel, as what my subconscious was displayed as.  [Only trying to be descriptive, not at all trying to sound egotistical but in reading this, it does (sorry!)]",
      "The next thing I know I am extended by that elasticity again wherein it feels as if the space I traveled through did not know what distance was nor that it even existed.  These 'elasticity' lines look like rays of sunlight would look if they were colored nice blues and greens but suttle tones, very earthy colors.  I was taken to a place where this guy works, who has told me he may be 'developing' a crush on me and a few weeks later I shared my thoughts to him.  We are both very busy and really never see each other but I still thought it was sweet of him to say!!  I had been wondering all day if I should drop this book by to him, with an excuse to stop by other than dropping the book off, of course, but was not sure if I should.  I guess this was the underlying tone of my subconscious before I visited Sally today.  Anyway, of all places, my subconscious went there and it was like my subconscious was above him and some other guy that was standing there and I 'heard' his thoughts stating 'My name, my name, when is she going to come by!?'.  It is a retail establishment where I get the Sally from.",
      "When I regained my sense of my physical self the sitter looked as though she had been through something herself.  She was amazed at how I was talking to someone while my eyes were closed, some words she could comprehend that I said, some I mumbled.  The one that stands out the most is when she told me I was talking to someone and said 'You mean I can go ANYWHERE I want to?'.",
      "At 2:45 I was back in the kitchen, trying to sip some coffee.  My stomach was a little upset because I had no eaten in 24 hours - this was on purpose.  I wanted the spiritual aspect of visiting Sally.  I want to go there again and hopefully I will have a journey planned out.  In essense, it is the subconscious that was in control here with the ultimate hands on the controls being Sally's.  I totally enjoyed this experience.  I am still not sure if it was 'real' and I was really there, especially at my friend's place, but I do know my subconscious was NOT wondering today what was 'he' thinking.  It was Sally who showed me that.  So, was it real? ",
      "A friend of mine, who is a 3rd generation psychic, said I was astral projecting.  I believe the smaller doses then the larger ones really got me to this space.  I will do it the same way again, when I feel the time is perfect.  Definitely beyond the gridline that I experienced when Sally first took me 'down'."

      "During July of 2006 I was subjected to an over the seas exchange at Oxford, England where I stayed and studied philosophy and psychology at Pembroke. During the duration of the program all the students spoke of absinthe, absinth, absintha, ect. I took great interest.",
      "My friend, and I visited the Duty free shop where after a grin and a quick, 'are you thinking what I'm thinking,' I wrapped my grubby little fingers around Aphrodites neck and escorted her in the most loving and lustful manner. The 50cl bottle of Sebor absinthe cost me about 20 British Pounds (at the time a little less than $40), and the woman behind the counter looked at me and asked whether or not I was heading to the states. I answered yes and she informed me that if found with it, it would be removed from my person, and I would be sent on my way.",
      "Nervous with nothing to lose besides my precious little green friend my friend and I hurried to the bathroom considering the no drinking policy in the airport, and the chance of losing the fairy to the men in blue. I grabbed a handful of sugar packets on my way knowing that the taste was supposedly foul, and we locked ourselves in a stall and nervously tore open the sugar packets and lined our mouths. I cracked it open and took a swig, and pure euphoria over came me, mind you more of from the taste, not the drink itself. I have never been a fan of black licorice, but when the fairy embraced me in her green mist, my mind was immediately swayed eternal. I handed the bottle to my friend, and he took a gulp gagging it down in 3 sips. As I watched him I could literally feel the absinth trickle down my throat, and pool in my belly. I could feel everything in my body as if watching a liquid glowing in an x-ray. After my friend was done I took another swig without the sugar and felt the same sensation. I packed the bottle away and we headed to our planes to part ways for who knows how long. With a firm handshake we said our goodbyes chuckling about our celebration.",
      "As I walked away noticing the airport was steadily warming to an uncomfortable degree. I began removing layers as I was surrounded by a pleasant and most welcomed buzz on my way to my plane. Everything glowed with a warm sensation, as if cuddled up at home with a classic by a warm fire. My mind became stressed with thoughts of being caught and I continuously fuddled with my bags still uncomfortable warm, but intensely happy. You could say paranoid, but with a positive attitude. As I walked past I viewed the tarmac under my plane and noticed it teeming with workers and decided, what a perfect time for a going home snapshot for the family and the album. After I pulled out the camera and prepared to take the picture I realized there was no one on or around the tarmac besides and empty luggage truck being pulled past. I recognized this as my first possible hallucination, although due to the low thujone concentration, a possible misconception brought on by the stress of getting home, and/or being caught.",
      "Once on the plane I awaited take off, and once in the air I felt as if I was one of the astronauts blasting into space. My seat belt was the only thing holding me down and there was no such thing as gravity from my perception. I was soon asleep after 30-45 mins of my absinthe experience.",
      "6 hours later I landed and had another hallucination. I do not believe that absinth lasts this long, for I felt no other effects despite it is very likely it was out of my system. I believe it may have been possible that because I slept the entirety of the trip with body processes slowing/shutting down/changing processes during sleep that maybe it is possible chemicals remained in my system? Just my hypothesis, the same as if you drink, or smoke cannabis, and wake up the next morning still high, or drunk. Anyway, as I was walking through customs I saw EVERYONE being searched at customs, and I began to spas out a little. Walking quickly and as inconspicuously as possible I went into the restroom, changed and secured the bottle in my old clothes slowly realizing my entire bag smelled of anise, as well as my clothes. Customs turned out to be no trouble at all and the line where I had seen everyone being searched was unoccupied. This is a documentation of the final day of my journey as written in my journal riding home.",
      "I have since finished the bottle and have always felt the same feelings, mentioned above whilst lacking in paranoia. Ever setting has been quiet and comfortable more often than not accompanied by friends. In the end I will leave it to you to determine what brought on my hallucinations, and in my concluding statement I will sum up that the absinthe gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling it also gave me a more active imagination, and sweet dreams on the plane ride home"

While not a blithering mess (as demonstrated by my ability to write) I am filled with a wonderful sense of relaxation and cogent but intoxicating sheer bloody mindlessness.  All the secondary thoughts that accompany full consciousness have dissipated, resulting in a calm and strangely clear headed serenity unlike anything else I have experienced before.  While diazepam and temazapam have relaxing and calming effects and can be quite fun taken recreationally I cannot remember the result being as thoroughly enjoyable as this experience.  One particular experiment with diazepam resulted in my lying in a giggling puddle on the lounge room floor, however I do not feel the same body load this time around.  While I am feeling physically relaxed the experience appears to be psychologically distinct.",

I am feeing significantly less cogent now than approximately one hour ago after I had consumed both half tablet-sized doses.  However I do not feel nausea or psychological discomfort.

While not as sexually excited as with previous experiences I tried masturbating, this required a great deal of effort and it took a longer period of time than is usually required to reach climax.  The orgasm felt different than usual with the resulting rush being less intense than I would normally experience.  This is one clear disadvantage of consuming larger amounts of this drug. ",

About fifteen minutes ago I took a Maxalon tablet to reduce my nausea, I had held off taking it for as long as possible so that the amount of oxycodone in my system would have dropped because I did not want to risk a strong adverse side effect, including having the Maxalon itself cause me to vomit.  My mouth is still very dry and I have been sipping several large glasses of water slowly to re-hydrate, again this was done carefully to reduce (a) the amount of movement needed to get the glass of water and therefore reduce the chance of vomiting, and (b) to ensure that I avoided a large sudden influx of water that may have further upset my stomach.",
      "While I am now feeling considerable better than I was two hours ago I am still finding it difficult to shift the focus of my vision, my mouth is still very dry and I am still nauseous although both the passage of time and the Maxalon have helped significantly.  It is quite clear that consuming",
      "- - -",
      "Stage Six.  In the middle of writing the last sentence of section three It is quite clear that consuming 30 mg was inadvisable and the resulting illness is a result of poor judgement, I was overcome by a strong sick feeling.  Retreating into the main room of the house, which is both cooler and more psychologically welcoming (being a large room it felt less physically repressive) I experienced two episodes of vomiting.  Aside from a sharp pain across my abdomen the event was relatively effortless and I recovered within five minutes. ",
      "While I am still feeling light-headed and dizzy my nausea has subsided almost completely.  The intensity of the experience of vomiting has proven to be refreshing and has helped lift my mood. ",
      "It is now five hours and twenty minutes since I consumed the first 10 mg of oxycodone, four hours and twenty minutes (approx.) since I consumed the second 10 mg dose, and three hours (approx.) since I consumed the third 10 mg dose.  Again it is clear that the total dosage was too high.  While it is sometimes easy to say that hindsight can provide an analysis of the likely outcome of a situation not possible earlier, this was not the case in this instance.  I thought that while there was a risk I would have a negative reaction to higher doses (30 mg) I believed that I could handle a higher dose without the most serious side effects, primarily a life-threatening respiratory depression.  This I believe was my key mistake and the one that cost me the total enjoyment of the experience  by focusing on the most serious (and least likely) side effects of oxycodone I had failed to take account of the more likely and uncomfortable ones, a mistake I hope I will avoid again in the future.",
      "- - -",
      "Addendum.  Later that night I vomited once again but recovered rapidly.  After going to bed I slept solidly for approximately 8 hours.  The intensity of the hangover was not greater than that I would feel after consuming half a bottle of red wine in an evening, my bruised pride resulting from the acknowledgement of irresponsibility hurts much more than my head did.

      "Ice Cream Computer, but no Ego Death",
      "I'm not an 'experienced' tripper from the point of having had a lot of intense experiences, but I eat psilocybin mushrooms maybe once a month. Usually on Friday night.",
      "Set: This evening, I am mentally in a good space. Aside from the usual concerns about money, my family is good and healthy, and I've successfully conducted a meeting for a youth group that my youngest son belongs to. These things always give me stress, although it's really 'no big deal.'  I purchased a 12-pack of non-alcholic beer at the grocery store, so I have something to drink. I don't drink alcohol or smoke marijuana, so my system's pretty clean in that regard. All, in all, my 'set' is good. My plan is to make some tea after midnight, then go to bed and enjoy the dreams and vision.",
      "Setting: At our suburban home, in the north-eastern USA, after a storm that has left about 21' of snow. Very cold outside. Everyone else is asleep in the house (7 puppies, two large dogs, four children, and my wife). My youngest son is sleeping in the master bed with my wife as he usually does on Friday.  I'm sitting at the computer browsing and reading the New York Times.",
      "Trip: I decide to mix two species. Because the wavy caps (psilocybe cyanescens) are extremely potent, I weigh out 0.8 grams of wavy caps and 0.6 grams of cubensis (stropharia strain). This doesn't sound like much but there are two considerations: 1) I am a lightweight, I don't take heroic trips *and* 2) I know from experience that these wavy caps are very strong. A friend of my dog's hairdresser cultivated them and they kick ass. The stropharia cubensis are typical strength. Both are bone-dry, so they're more potent on a per-gram basis than might be expected. But yeah, I know that 1.4 grams doesn't sound like much. Supply's not an issue, though, so I take what I need.",
      "At about midnight, I brew the tea. I put the shrooms and a tea bag in a cup.  The tea is apple spice flavor. I pour boiling water from the teapot onto the shrooms and teabag and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then I strain the mix after removing the teabag.  I drink the tea about 12:10 am. In my opinion, 'tea is the only way to go.'",
      "Effects: After 15 minutes, I feel like 'something's happening'. My stomach starts to churn a little bit, and I can feel the energy of the mushrooms begin to flow into my muscles. At 20 minutes, the tiny convulsions start.  Not the tendon jump that I have experienced with Amanita Muscaria, mini-convulsions is about the best terminology for it, kind of like the shivers. I put a blanket over my shoulders, it's a little bit cold in the room, as well, considering that it's about 4 degrees farenheit outside. At 30 minutes, I go upstairs to brush my teeth and go to bed.",
      "While I'm brushing my teeth, I can tell this will be a fairly intense trip, for me. I literally feel like I'm on autopilot when I'm brushing my teeth, rapidly and perfectly brushing. I look at a tibetian buddhist poster on the bathroom wall while taking a piss and it's not moving, so the visuals haven't begun at this point. But my perceptive center seems to be shifting.  My point of view is moving around within my brain is the only way I can describe it.",
      "After I lay in bed for a while, the effects begin to take hold. Firstly, there's the nearly overwhelming feeling that my mind is melting. The sensation that somehow, everything that I know will be lost, as the synaptic connections are erased. I 'know' this is not the case but it's somewhat disturbing. I can feel the psilocybin washing through my brain and as it does, the holographic representation within my head is distorting and 'melting.'",
      "I sense that this is the threshold of what people refer to as 'ego death'. I'm fearful of this happening. I don't want to freak out and wake my son or my wife, since they don't know I'm tripping. So I continue to ride it out, and to reassure myself that the relatively light dose that I took ensures that I'll be able to maintain. Like I said, I'm a lightweight, and given my personal situation, I'm not ready at this point for 'ego death' or to go beyond a level 3-4 trip.",
      "About 45 minutes after drinking the tea, the visions start. I remember from experience that I can control the trip at least to the extent of keeping it positive, so my fear begins to dissipate.",
      "For me, the best visions occur after ingesting fresh wavy caps (psilocybe cyanescens). With fresh caps, lots of times I see the Green Man, with really beautiful organic visions. With dried wavy caps, for some reason, I have a different trip. The metaphor that creeps in is 'the Ice Cream Computer.'",
      "The visions on these dry caps soon become extremely intense. In the dark, without my glasses, the objects in the room are all moving and swaying. My son and my wife are sleeping next to me, and when I look at my son, he looks 'normal' but I can sense my overwhelming love for him, and for my wife. But the visuals with my eyes open are getting pretty wild, so I close my eyes and get in a comfortable position in bed.",
      "The CEV's are incredible. Three dimensional, incredibly intricate patterns, many colors but blues, purples and greens predominate. Moving, evolving, three dimensional patterns. The sense that 'these are structures/machines/technology/art?? that intelligent beings can create' is imparted upon me. The fear that these visions, as they pass through my mind, will wipe away my memories, returns, but passes.  The visions are three dimensional, living, machines, folding and unfolding and evolving in continuous cosmic evolution. Incredible, raw intelligence. I have the feeling that the mushrooms open the mind and that external intelligence flowing through my brain. My normal thought patterns begin to distort, and it's a strange feeling to observe this happening, and again, I begin to wonder if it will be permanent. But that fear, too, passes.",
      "These aren't any specific images, nothing recognizable, but fantastic, complex patterns. I remember when I was young, seeing CEV's after smoking marijuana or good hash. These visions are orders of magnitude beyond that.",
      "The part that always amazes me is that the images are so consistent, although infinitely variable at the same time. It also seems to me that the wavy caps have their own character and psilocybe cubensis have theirs, although I haven't eaten enough of the stropharia cubensis to form an opinion about that.",
      "I need to write some of these thoughts down at the time, sometime, because the experiences are so damn interesting and I feel, extremely beneficial to my overall mental health and outlook. I can't say that I've met external beings, or experienced ego death, or brought back specific knowledge, but the feeling I get, in these late night visions, is that there is indeed a beneficial intelligence and beauty that permeates the universe, including human beings. We don't perceive it all the time because if we did, it would be difficult to function in the day-to-day world. However, it is there, and the mushrooms, help me in my own life, to experience these aspects of reality.",
      "I don't know if this is of much interest to the reader, but for me, this is fairly typical for a psilocybin trip. Originally, my plan for the evening was to take 2.4 grams of cubensis. However, I started to think that the wavy caps might be getting old, and decided to use some of them to supplement the cubes. Maybe next time, I'll go for the 2.4 gram cube trip.  I'm curious at times, that the experiences that I have on mushrooms don't seem to be typical as compared to many of the reports that I read. However, for me, they're really a tool for relaxing my mind. In the relatively low doses that I take, I still maintain control as an observer. To be honest, I'm afraid to 'lose control' but at the same time, I feel that a good brainwashing every once in a while is truly a benefit to my health.",

      "My friend introduced me to getting high off computer duster.  He said that the chemical was harmless so I tried it on good faith.  I quite enjoyed the experience and every time we got together drinking we would cap the night with some hits.   The normal experience was just a head rush type feeling with pulsating sounds and darkened vision.  The good thing about it was it was a quick rush and didn't last too long.",
      "Today I was off work and bored so I bought a can to enjoy at home by myself.  Holy S**T.  I took a deep hit held it in, then let go.  The pulsating noises started.  I took another deep hit and started to drift away.  Suddenly my friend was there (not really) but I really thought that he was.  He said 'look how you feel now, imagine if you do another' so I did.",
      "Into another reality I went.  It was like a paranoid dream and my imaginary friend was really messing with me.  I came back to reality and was so facinated although a little horrified I felt that I must try it again.  Deja Vu, same exact dream took place.  I repeated this about four times trying to figure out what it all meant but as I would come to I would forget most of the event although it seemed to be the same.  I couldn't figure out how I could be so insane as to forget that I was just hallucinating again after each hit.   I really would think these things were happening in a matter of seconds.",
      "I called that same friend at work and we did a few together over the phone.  Nothing, just the head rush.  It seemed like only when there was nothing to concentrate on I would fade out.  But I figured hey why not try this with some porn.  Now there is about 1 hour of my life that I really don't remember.  I was so into it I don't think I would have stopped exept for the fact that I threw up on my living room floor.  The can was almost gone and I was pretty screwed up for several hours fading in and out of reality.  I became rather depressed and almost suicidal but after talking with some friends I seem to have snapped out of it now.",
      "I am just glad I waited to get home before I started.  I really think it should be avoided all together because anything that could do that to me so fast must be doing some damage."

      "This story is being composed in hopes to help anybody who might find themselves in similar situations while experimenting with hallucinogens.  The story begins...",
      "I was 17 at the time, and I had just finished high school.  I was in high spirits with it being summertime and all.  I have an Uncle from California (I live in NJ) who usually visits every summer.  He has always been great with me, so I try to spend as much time as I can with him for the short time that he's here.  Well, this was a time I would NEVER forget!!!  =)",
      "While my Uncle visits us in NJ, he stays over my Grandmother's (his Mother's) house.  So I decided to stay the night over her house to hang out with him, talk, listen to music, play guitar, or whatever, because he is really great to be around.  It must've been around 8:30pm as it was just getting dark.  We decided to go for a walk to the store to get a drink on that warm summer evening.  As we were walking back to my Grandmother's house, he suggested that we should 'trip' tonight.  I was a little surprised, as I wasn't aware that he had any LSD with him.  I told him that I had never done it before, and he seemed shocked.  He said 'Oh man, George!!!  We've gotta trip tonight!'  He seemed really big on the idea of it being my first time, and him being the experienced mentor.",
      "We walked back into the house, and upstairs to where the spare room was that he and I would be staying.  It was around 9:30pm now, and my Grandmother was in her room across the hall getting settled to go to sleep.  We closed the door to the spare bedroom, and discussed how much I should take.  He was fumbling around in his suitcase, and I told him that I thought I should only take one hit, since i'd never done it before.  He waved his hand at me as if to blow me off, and said 'Ahhhh, you'll be fine with 2!'  Now, you must understand that through his eyes, 2 hits of today's LSD IS nothing, because he comes from a time, the 60's of course, where people were taking 10 hits of much stronger acid, usually in the 400-600 ug (micrograms) range.  However, I reluctantly decided to place all of my trust in him, as he'd never done me harm before.  I took the 2 small tabs out of his hand, and put them in my mouth.",
      "He suggested that we go downstairs to watch some TV, as there would be a little time before anything would happen.  I followed the leader.  I was laying on one couch, and he was on the other.  We were flipping through channels, not really saying a word to eachother.  I was finding myself absorbed in the TV, but otherwise fine, not really feeling any different.  My Grandmother has a sillhoulette in the living room, which was right behind the couch I was lying on.  It had been about 1/2 hour since we initally dropped the tabs, and I was looking through the sillhoulette now, and noticing small colorless kalidescope like patterns all over it.  I blew it off as it just being the way the light looked behind it, through the silky material.  But I noticed that I couldn't help but to keep staring at it, and my body felt energized, electrically charged.  I suggested to my Uncle that we go back upstairs to the room, that I was starting to feel weird.  He must've not been feeling it yet, because he said to me 'Are you sure?  Already?'  I told him yes, and thankfully he agreed, and we walked up the stairs, and opened the door to the bedroom where we would spend the rest of the night.",
      "It seemed as though the moment we opened the door and walked into the room, it was like stepping through the door to another dimension, much like Alice going into Wonderland.  At this point, I realized that the trip must be in full bloom.  'I must be peaking now..' I thought to myself.  The lights were on in the room, and I decided to sit on the bed and play around with my acoustic guitar that I had brought over.  I passed that idea quickly when I realized that I could hardly play a note; the guitar somehow seemed foreign to me now, and felt very awkward in my hands.  I put it down, and sat back, talking with my Uncle.",
      "For some reason, my Grandmother came banging on the door.  She seemed to be mad about something, but it was hard for me to hear her with all the whirring and swooshing noises going on around me, or was it in my head?  =)  She walked in, and I broke out in hysterics!  I was laughing so hard on the bed at the mere sight of her!  She looked tired, with one eye open (obviously we had woken her up) and her hair seemed to not be attached to her head!!  It looked as though each single strand was an energy bolt of sorts, and was extending out, alive from her head!  The thought and sight of that caused me to double over in laughter.  Now understand, that this was strange for me.  This was the first time where I wasn't able to control myself.  I'd always prided myself on being a person able to deal with any situation that may arise while I was on drugs.  I had smoked pot many, many times before, and never was unable to control myself if I had to, whether it was near parents, cops, whatever.  Now, here I was laughing perhaps harder then I ever had, right in my Grandmother's face!!!  She was yelling something about us having the windows open in the room while she had the central air going.  My Uncle, obviously experienced in having to deal with situations while tripping, quickly patronized her, shut the windows, and rushed her back to bed.  We closed the door behind her, and decided to be a little quieter.",
      "We turned out the lights in the room, and went only by the street lights shining in from outside.  This was sufficient lighting to see each other and find things in the room.  I was really spinning now, I had a million thoughts going through my head at once, almost as a slideshow, but in a split second.  My Uncle decided we should listen to some music, and we chose the Beatles' White Album.  (For anybody that wants good music to trip to, listen to this!)  I laid myself back on the bed, and my Uncle sat near in a chair in a corner adjacent to the bed.  The music was strange and alive, and although I had heard this album numerous times, I heard things in it that I never had before.  My Uncle and I weren't talking at all now, just enjoying the music.  Well, at least he was.  I was far too caught up with what was going on in my head and in front of my eyes.  What was strange was how any sound I heard produced a corresponding hallucination.  I kept feeling as though I was slipping in and out of consciousness, but during the times of 'unconsciousness', I was fully aware of my being unconscious!  My eyes seemed to be closed, and I saw millions of patterns of cobweb and honeycomb like visuals, which would spin towards my field of vision, rotate, fade out, and then the next one would begin.  All the time, they would be changing color as well.  I remember green being a very dominant color in the entire experience though.",
      "I seemed to have 3 separate points of consciousness;  My main awareness, which knew that I was on acid, was at my Grandmother's in a room with my Uncle, and knew that I was lying on the bed tripping out of my mind.  Then the 2nd one, which was dealing with all of these images coming at me, and a 3rd which was completely emotional.  That part is the most memorable;  I remember going through every state of emotions in turn, in sequential order.  Each seemed to last only a few seconds.  I felt happy, then sad, then frightened, then angry, then depressed, and then it would begin all over again.  It was almost like a wheel turning, and at any given point on this wheel lay a state of emotion, which I would experience with each turn of the wheel. All 3 of these seemingly separate consciousnesses co-existed, harmoniously and accordingly.  No one interfered with the other; yet I was fully aware of all 3 at the exact same time, with my full attention devoted to ALL 3 together. At the points where I would seem to wake, or slip back into consciousness, I would look around the room, and the plants would seem to ooze, or melt.  I would close my eyes for a second, open them to look at the plants which would appear normal, and a couple of seconds later the oozing process would begin all over again.  This amazed and intrigued me!  Then something really strange happened;  I can only decribe it best as an out of body experience, for lack of better words.  I noticed that I was no longer on the bed, but rather in a far corner, suspended in mid air, watching the entire scene as if an observer.  I saw myself lying on the bed, with a cloudy greenish hue surrounding me.  I saw the entire room from where I was, and I saw my Uncle talking to me on the bed.  I saw myself answering him 'Yes', 'Yes', to whatever he said, although I knew that 'I' lying on the bed had no idea what he was even saying.  I could no longer comprehend language, only thought had any substance now.  At some point I found myself back in my body, but in a state of unconsciouness again.  Now I saw my life literally flash before my eyes, in all of 2 seconds, like a tape rewinding, but at a tremendous speed.  I acutally saw an embryo inside a womb, which I knew was myself.  I thought I had died.  This thought, though, was not at all unpleasant.  I felt content with whatever was happening, because I knew that I was useless in trying to fight it.  The time after this is blank, all I remember is my Uncle talking a whole lot to me, and me not understanding a word he was saying.  I remember that I just kept saying 'yea' and 'yes' to everything he said.  He didn't argue, although I was probably not making much sense.  He probably knew that I was far out, and decided to let me enjoy it and find my way, map my own realms.",
      "In an instant, I felt almost 'normal' again; something, which I can only describe as a great intensity, was no longer there.  It had been there a second ago, and like a flash of light, it was gone.  I could hear normal again, see normal, speak, and comprehend.  I didn't feel completely 'myself' though, and I knew the trip wasn't over, perhaps only the peak.  I felt detached, but this didn't bother me.  I felt enchanted, or mystified.  I felt as though I had figured out the keys to the universe, the answers to the unanswerable, and that I was almost God-like.  I knew I still wouldn't be able to fall asleep, as so many things were running through my head.  Not as they were before, but rather I was thinking about the things I had thought up before.  Everything now, though, didn't seem quite as baffling and perplexing as it had an hour before.  Either way, I felt as though I had been through a war, and came out victorious.  I had 'myself' back again!  I felt reborn, like a new person.  I felt as though my spirit had been cleansed, refreshed.  My Uncle suggested that we go outside on the porch and smoke cigarettes.  That sounded like the best idea i'd ever heard! About half an hour later, we retreated back into the room and I laid myself down to rest.  I knew I still couldn't sleep yet, but I started feeling worn, physically, and mentally fatigued.  My Uncle had CD's playing very softly now, and I lay on the bed as the morning sun rose.  I was awake to hear the very first sounds of the day.  Birds began to chirp, people were waking up and starting their cars to head out to work.  Everything seemed a little more crisp, with more life then ever before.  This was a nice thought to me.  I slowly drifted off into a peaceful sleep.  I remember my dreams that morning being more vivid than ever before in my life, and probably even up until now.",
      "I've tripped on LSD dozens of times after that, and on many more doses then the 2 I took that night.  But never did I have a trip again like I did with my Uncle.  Perhaps it was because I had complete trust in him, and because of that there was no paranoia.  Or perhaps I never had a trip like that again because I became so interested in LSD, I did months and months of research on it, and came to know almost everything there is to know about it.  Maybe because I knew exactly what to expect now, learned all about 'set' and 'setting', purchased the 'Psychedelic Experience' book, that I ruined tripping for myself?  Not to say I never had fun again on it, but it never had that magic it did that night....."

      "Set: Meditative, quiet, and annoyed at myself for not taking initiative often enough to explore these worlds. I probably felt like Terence McKenna when I got myself into this.",
      "Setting: My room, quiet, mid-day, no one else home",
      "An unsuccessful sublingual dose, characterized by a frustrating 20 min meditation period which yielded nothing more than meditating with no botanical assistance at all would have, led to my smoking approx. 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of shredded/ground leaf through a water pipe with chilled water and a torch lighter. I didnt get to finish the first inhalation before the green hypnosis began, but I somehow managed to inhale 2-3 times.",
      "Somewhere between here and forever seems to be a plane of utter nonsense. Strangely enough, it seems to make more sense the deeper into it one wanders. Strange ancient-Asian-styled buildings which open up at the corners to pull the traveler in: into hallways of mahogany, history and hieroglyphics from every age and man, horizons and skies which light up with a kind of eternity that Earth has always envied, creatures which defy biology and spirits which defy theology: I found myself observing the motions of a rolling steamroller dragon, which seemed to be of a neutral demeanor. A brilliant entity of divine design, which itself dwarfed the feelings of human-dignity and exclusive-human-divinity: A concept which my species has been clinging to for far too long. And what was it doing? Well, it was just hanging out. In hyperspace, no one has to do anything. The process, the mother, the cycle is everything. It exists independently. It provides for itself, it recycles itself, it is its own source of energy. It is the ultimate computer, and it has a self-updating device for its software. In this case, the engineer is the computer itself.",
      "Heavens! What would the entirety of man do if he were faced with this kind of reality check? Would he surrender to the omnipotent force of what hes always naturally been part of, and sacrifice the sickened self for the perfect whole, or would he rigidly claw his way back to the shadows and remain blind and in denial? What a paradise it would be to exist in a world which is self-realized. A world which has literally torn down the gates to heaven by allowing it to exist both in and outside of them. THE STEAM ROLLER DRAGON IS EVERYTHING. He is his own force, and yet he is nothing more than that which he is part of.  He is dependent on nothing, and because of that, he is content and whole. He is nothing more than a reflection of eternity, and therefore: He is eternal.",
      "The vision of the steam roller dragon was gone in a flash, and I soon found myself sinking into a forest-spirited vision of intricately styled tile surfaces, which seemed to be of Aztec or Amazonian design, acting as ceilings and walls as I was shown a piece of technology which man has yet to synthesize for himself. A prototype of something which was, actually, about as prototypical as Carbon Dioxide to the inhabitants of this world. It was some kind of traveling device, such as a plane or a car. It was hidden underground in this hieroglyph-decorated storage room. It was forged of a material which would not be entirely visible to the human eye, and it did not well reflect visible light, but it was there nonetheless. I was informed by a voice (I say voice as a reduced simplification of vision for the ears,) that it was called Venus _______. By the end of this experience I had forgotten the second part to the name. It was something to the extent of Wallum.",
      "The most memorable part of the experience was the most easy to explain. Unfortunately, the way I see it, this renders it the most self-synthesized portion of this experience, which makes sense, as it was the last vision before I awoke in my room again:",
      "After having been pulled through a void of structures and pieces of reality which would make even the most conservative-minded skeptic scoff at the likes concepts like Newtonian causality, and make a mockery of 20th century physics, I found myself in a much more grounded environment, which  had a designated up and down. I had met with an unpleasant entity who seemed to be crucified at the time, having the head of a cybernetic rabbit, which rattled as it cackled demonically. The fear I felt from this was only momentary, and I was soon feeling what could only be described as, however unreasonable it may seem, sexual excitement. I found myself walking around on the surface of a planet which could almost be deemed animated, although not in a human cartoon way. Planets glowed on the horizons in the distance, under purple skies, which illuminated a bluish ground surface on which I walked. I was drawn to a bright glowing opening, some distance ahead, which seemed to be a cave going underground. As I approached it, I became aware that this glowing opening was positioned between the legs of a female figure, not quite human, who was laying on her back. I couldnt make exact sense of her physical proportions, but I decided to walk inside of her/this thing.",
      "Inside, I found myself in, more or less, a bar. Not an after-work solace for the blue collar American, but an intergalactic sex joint. The place was run by faeries. Not as they are depicted in pagan art, nor were they reflective of the plastic, G-rated Disney persona. They were illuminated with vibrant lime-green light. They had no obvious faces, but human facial form could be made out upon close reflection. I had the sudden feeling that Id stumbled into the Hooters of a world in which Id never been. There were booths to sit in, which provided every means of sexual gratification that one could imagine, and all from faeries or parts of faeries. One would sit in these booths and be literally pushed into sexual ecstasy. It was impossible to sit there and not be getting off.",
      "Soon, I seemed to be having (passionate, but strangely detached) sex with every faerie in this joint. I had sex with the cave opening. I was in the booths. I was passed around to every faerie present. I was met by their queen. She was a forest goddess.  She carried a scepter, and wore a robe. Her hair was undecidedly composed of leaves and vines and pulled back. All of these faeries were not working at this place. They were not members at some club. They were daughters of Mother Nature. Even the queen was only a physical depiction of this botanical force. These beings were not selfishly motivated leeches: Rather, they were direct branches of a tree which was everything. It was a completely feminine force, and it spread by being impregnated by that which is masculine, therefore putting a high premium on male travelers such as myself to attain seed. I look back at this now, over a year after this experience, and I find this hilarious in a cosmic way that is divinely subtle. There was no nonsense about this desire. This femininity was fertile, and was on a diatribe to reproduce.",
      "Without getting into further detail of the sexual endeavors of this strange and foreign custom, I soon awoke in my room, on my bed, after having been in a half-trance. My turbo powered trip down the rabbit hole had emptied into unconsciousness. To be honest, halfway through this Cosmo-faerie fantasy, I began to come back from the trip, and proceeded to force myself out of the default third dimension back down into whatever world this was, because in all fairness, my room as usual doesnt hold a toothpick to elven orgies. Hence, I cannot be sure that at least the end of this experience was completely valid and brought on by the primary chemical assistance. But what is valid!",
      "The funny thing is, if someone were to read this, I have a feeling they'd say, 'Wow man, cool. That's like, Alice and Wonderland stuff! I've got to try this.' But the thing is, during this experience, there was no separate 'I' experiencing it all. Ram Dass said in BE HERE NOW, 'You have to give it all up before you can have it all.' All of this looks like a real wild trip on paper, but by the time you get your ticket to admission and take off into these worlds, the experiencer dissapears, and there's no distinction between the experiencer and the experienced. It all just sort of **is**."

      "Hello, I am here. Not much going on, how about you?",
      "That is pretty much what 2c-t-21 says to me when I take it. No great insights to speak of, hardly any psychedelic effects other than a very mild brightening of colors, headspace is pretty much everyday reality with a slight shift to the paranormal but nothing with much personality like other 2c-X chemicals. Stimulation is the most noted effect I have thus far discovered, and even it is mild. It isnt a",

      "you might be able to get to sleep but probably not, and why would you go to sleep anyways?",

      "Sort of a stoned feeling I guess but I imagine I could still get around to stuff. Stimulating as in I dont particularly want to sleep, stoned as in even though I cant sleep I am not particularly driven to do anything. Music sounds about the same as ever, perhaps a bit clearer? Taste seems about average. Touch feels softer but it sure isnt blowing me away.",
      "Nice compound and worth a try but it is far from my favorite phenethylamine. I think this  substance would do well with a person who has never tried a 2c-X compound before, provided they dont take a lot of it as I hear in higher doses it can be a bit more pushy.",
      "I will do it again I am sure. I think it would be a great drug to take for a relaxed yet stimulated sexual experience with ones significant other (although maybe only morning sex as sleep will no be easy.) Also a great drug for school or something, eye dilation didnt seem to be a big thing for me. Although my eyes are perma-dilated (I have big pupils naturally), and I have not used this enough to look at my eyes in the mirror frequently in order to remember eye dilation as being particularly bad or not so bad. But I dont recall it as being very bad at all. If my eyes are dilated I want to know why because the visuals are next to non existent =P.",
      "It is worth noting that I have been pretty much abusing psychedelic phenethylamines for the past week, 2c-t-2 every other day, 2c-e once or twice and 2c-X in the morning, so I am sure I have some (probably large) degree of tolerance.",
      "For all I know if I stay week for two weeks and try this again it will be much different. But some part of me doubts it for some reason."

I sucked in as much as I could from the first canister and held my breath as long as possible.  I breathed out and immediately felt giddy.  My mind was fairly clear, I could easily think.  My body felt sort of drunk, I was stumbling, and I found this very amusing.  Talking to a friend online, typing was very difficult because my fingers kept hitting the wrong keys.",
      "I breathed in some more Nitrous from the other can, and this is when the strongest effects started.  My body and lips instantly felt tingly and numb.  I was once again stumbling.  I felt completely Euphoric and laughed at everything.  Everything my friend said I thought was hilarious.  When he said things that normally would make me concerned, I was able to respond normally and express concern, but in reality I was laughing uncontrollably.  Hence the name, Laughing Gas.",
      "The numbness went away within a couple minutes, much sooner than I wanted it to.  Unfortunately I was out of Nitrous.  I can see the addictive potential of the drug, the high is short and very nice and I definitley want more soon after.  I felt euphoric and giddy for about twenty minutes after, and then I felt a sort of hangover.  My head felt very heavy and it was hard to hold it up.  I felt very slow and typing was difficult.  I no longer felt euphoric, but I didn't feel bad, the hangover was actually a bit enjoyable.",
      "As I type this the next morning, I have a light headache, but no other problems. I'm glad I tried Nitrous and I'll do it again, but with caution to avoid addiction."

I continued to take the pills when I felt I was 'coming down' until about 3 am. At about 4 am, I became so physically sick I had to stop doing my assignment. I decided to go lie down and try to sleep. Unable to sleep, I had a sort of panic attack and sat upright in my bed, rocking back and forth. I was convinced that if I fell asleep right then I would die, and that if I lied down I would fall asleep. I thought at that time that I had the ability to end my life at any moment simply by lying back down. After some amount of time (I have no idea how long this continued for), I went to sleep. I was sick the next morning and had a 'caffeine hangover' for three days."

      "I experimented with Sage Goddess Emerald Essence on three occassions in 2003.  This is a report of my experiences on those three occassions.  To give you some background, I have practised various meditation techniques since 1990, and have had the occassional interesting and 'meaningful' dream experiences and 'visions' which I attribute to particularly successful meditation sessions.  I am attracted to the philosophies of Advaita, Buddhism and Zen, which describe the phenomenal universe and the sense of self as illusory, with Awareness being the sole underlying reality.  I really do not have much of a record of experimenting with drugs, hallucinogens or entheogens, except for using pot sporadically, and a sole LSD experience on top of a hill in the forests that was entertaining, but not particularly coherent or meaningful.  In other words, all my so-called 'meaningful' experiences have been either spontaneous or meditation-induced, not substance-induced.",
      "Salvia Experience #1 (sometime in 2003):",
      "I was on the floor of my bedroom at night.  I squirted a couple of dropperfuls of Emerald Essence into my mouth and held the stinging, bitter liquid in my mouth for about 20 minutes.  I spat the liquid out, and feeling very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep.  Something was conscious of a very loud, deep bass thumping sound, and an enveloping darkness.  I say 'something', because I was not aware of myself as a human or an embodied, self-aware being, in some sense, I was the sound.  But yet paradoxically, 'I' was aware of the sound.  The sound was extremely loud and I could not figure out what it was, nor was I making any attempt to discern its cause.  Why would I?  I was just aware, with no motive.  I could hear every nuance in this sound.",
      "Slowly, awareness of self returned.  The source of the sound suddenly dawned upon me, it was my heart beating.  I was now aware of myself as a tiny point somewhere deep inside my body, in total darkness (my eyes were closed), and I could hear my heart beating deeply, loudly, as if it were filling a cathedral.  This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as I opened my eyes and the effect wore off, my sensory perceptions returned to 'normal'.  In retrospect, the experience did not feel like a hallucination at all.  Instead, it felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience.",
      "Salvia Experience #2 (sometime in 2003):",
      "I was in the same setting as in the previous experience, on the floor of my bedroom.  After holding the Emerald Essence in my mouth for about 20 minutes, I spat the liquid out, and again, feeling very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep.  This time, 'I' was conscious of a very loud, rushing sound, and an enveloping darkness.  Again, the sound was extremely loud and all encompassing, and as before, you could say that I was the sound.  I could hear every nuance in this sound.  When my awareness of self returned, the source of the sound suddenly dawned upon me, it was my breathing.",
      "I was now aware of myself as a tiny point somewhere deep inside my body, in total darkness.  My body was still asleep and breathing restfully.  I could hear every nuance in the sound of my breathing with a heightened perception.  Think of being in a giant wind tunnel and hearing the wind rush by.  This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as I opened my eyes and the effect wore off, my sensory perceptions returned to 'normal'. Again, the experience felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience.",
      "Salvia Experience #3 (sometime in 2003):",
      "On this occassion, I was alone at home in the daytime.  If I recall right, I took a larger dose than on the previous two occassions.  After holding the Emerald Essence in my mouth for about 20-30 minutes, I lay down with my eyes closed.  Soon, I started seeing visuals, strange geometric patterns and colors that I perceived to be 'trivial' and mildly annoying.  At some point, my sense of self dissolved completely.  I suddenly felt I had become a set of buildings, roads and vehicles in the neighborhood I grew up in as a teenager.",
      "I was not a human or organic being anymore, I was a set of insentient objects.  There was simply no memory of my past existence as a person.  What's more, I wasn't one, I was many.  This was the weirdest sensation of them all.  We are normally used to being or identifying with one thing or self, not a multiplicity of things at the same time.  While the imagery associated with this feeling was a typical hallucination, the experience of being many things at once is apparently within the capacity of the mind, otherwise I could not have experienced it."

      "It was the end of the day, and my friend had just dropped off a colorful bag of drugs to my pocket. Most prominently among them for me at that time was a single hit of white, unperfed blotter LSD, folded neatly in an empty gum wrapper. The periods of the school day passed by in anxiety as I drew closer to the last period, the very time in which before I put the hit of acid on my tongue.",
      "One hit? I said to myself. This should be pretty good, but nothing too memorable. Of course, I was completely wrong in all respects. I have experience with plenty of other drugs, and thought myself experienced enough to tame the LSD experience, but at points it stretched the foundation of my very being thin. Just a few minutes after I dropped the acid tab, the fire alarm ushered the sitting children out of the school, where I then met with my friend who had given me the acid in the first place. An old friend, but he seemed in a very spaced-out condition at that point, probably because the acid had shifted complete gears on the foundation of his brain the night before.",
      "Itll probably hit you in forty-five minutes, he told me. Youll be peaking around 4:30.",
      "The alarm ended, and we went back in our classrooms. The rising intensity of the LSD wound its way around my arms and neck like a snake searching for an empty piece of an apple to snatch from my grasping hands. And by the time the final bell for school rang, I was plenty glad the day had ended. But as I left the back school doors to walk home, the experience just begun.",
      "A female friend of mine, Z, and I began twisting our way through the woods, and I told her I had just dropped a tab of acid. You did not! My permanent grin gave it away. Then she revealed to me that she, a virgin in the land of LSD though experienced with mushrooms, was also planning on trying acid this weekend. A friend of hers appeared ahead of us, and I called him over to smoke a bowl of medium-grade cannabis. By now the blotter was already beginning to make me feel permanently happy, but little else was happening. A grin etched itself into my face that simply begged to be filled at all times, and it took a lot of restraint and will power to keep me from smiling like an idiot after the cannabis was all turned into smoke and ashes. Pretty soon I bid X farewell, and restrained myself in order to walk through the middle of town to end up to where I needed to be.",
      "Every depressing thought was used as leverage to keep my countenance firm, until a sort of nihilistic underlyings of a fatalistic trip began. LSD does not like to be imposed upon. It is not a kind and loving substance like marijuana, and you cannot choose when to laugh and when to breathe and when to think on LSD, because you are operating at levels where all of these functions blend into one. Music sounded beautiful as soon as I reached my house, and thoughts of four-dimensionality and the flesh of the gods both raced through my mind as hallucinations started to obscure reality.",
      "By 3:00 it had begun to show itself in full swing, yet my parents were also home, so I did what anyone in a position of compromising authority would do and resigned myself to the woods. They were a mere five minute walk from my house, yet by the time I got there time was already ceasing to be meaningful. The LSD bloomed or exploded here, so that by the time I first set foot in the forest, an eternity would pass in a few moments.",
      "My back was still open to the woods, the houses, all of civilization across the street, and no matter how fast I walked up into them, they were still there. Had I moved at all? Was I just going in circles? I pushed myself farther and farther back into the woods until the hallucinations began to become so overwhelming I couldnt discern left from right or up from down. In fact, my only mark in this period of the journey after leaving the signs of civilization was the sun.",
      "The sun had been facing me coming in. Now, I was hallucinating so badly all that all I could see where a series of trees, underbrush and plant merging into one single writhing entity with the sun as its own god in the sky. At times, the sun literally felt like an omnipresent, and oftentimes malevolent, deity. I tried to escape civilization at first, continuously walking farther and farther back into the rays of the sun in order to leave all the people I had known behind. But I couldnt leave them behind. In fact, I lost all sense of time and space during some periods of this journey, yet I distinctintly remember that there behind my back during all the periods were rows of people from civilization, there to watch my intensely strange, possibly lethal first time on LSD.",
      "A leaf on the ground in front of me blew in the wind, and I picked it up, holding it up with the trees, who were all bending in to face and bow to me, and seeing its rhythm.",
      "The leaf lost all the dried plant material around the stems, gradually eroding into the vague outline of a dead series of stems. Then it magically regrew to blossom into a green sapling before turning back into the limp brown leaf sitting in my hand.",
      "Ticks and spiders here became a massive paranoia of mine, albeit in reality the ticks and spiders were probably not so much the cause of the paranoia as the LSD shifting gears on me. During many times I sat down on the leaves, completely lost and seeing people appearing from behind the trees in the woods, alone there to write a few sentences on my experience. Here is a sample of those ramblings:",
      "This was a foolish use of any land as a proud native chief. How many damn waves of consciousness do I have to wait for? Were there. Calm down. I can see the red of the blood in your veins. The LSD man, as far as you know him, is forever gone in an outrageous rage of being with the Lord. I cant really communicate for the deep joy and compassion it will give my heart for this eternity to be fucking frozen over.",
      "In fact, it continues like that for pages, as I would sit down on the leaves and simply write whenever I was on the verge of giving up. I was completely lost. My senses were blown so out of proportion that, for all I knew, I couldve been in my own backyard and I wouldnt have been able to know. The hallucinations made everything appear to stretch endlessly, and the trees went off into the distance, waving and blurring together, surrounding me like an evil wall of consciousness.",
      "Veins appeared to burst in my hands and arms as I peaked here, undoubtedly my blood pressure peaking due to the strenuous activity of the hike and the intense, sweat-drenched fear of the LSD. The sun stood on my shoulder as I tried now to get back to civilization, but I had gone too far. Which way was it back? Should I just wait here for the sober self to take us back?",
      "Planes roared overhead, and I knew they were searching for me. Man lost in LSD frenzy, found alone in woods, hallucinating while speaking about the sun standing on his shoulder and invisible spiderwebs wrapping around the trees. Headlines like that only began the paranoia that would peak a lifetime later.",
      "I saw a tick on my hand, and brushed it off, an intense fear and recognition now scarring the precious acid landscape. My physical body was in harm here, ticks and spiders. Maybe this acid wasnt acid at all. Maybe I was having a heart attack.",
      "I sat down on the leaves, trying to take a few deep breathes like the Buddha would. The forest blended into the Tao around me as I closed my eyes in a frenetic wave of rainbow colors, but the paranoia did not leave.",
      "Was I actually dying? This would haunt me for the rest of the trip, but while peaking on LSD, I didnt know if I was dying or not. The end of my life could be my next breath, and I realized this in all its full gory detail. This is the real part of the LSD experience that changed me. The intense fear, the knowledge of death, being chased by figures too dark to imagine, always blending into the woods behind me. And most of all, I had completely forgotten where I was going in these endless woods.",
      "Put the sun at my back, I told myself. Just walk back the way I came. But nothing seemed familiar, every time I looked into the woods around me, there were fifty hallucinated branches for every real waving branch in the far-off regions of my eyes. If I got close, the hallucinations would stop and I would see the forest as it really was, but the ground and the forest around me would still remain the same. No matter how far back or forward I went, it seemed I would always be stuck in this reality, lost.",
      "This seemed a very weird, eternal version of the salvia trips I had experienced in the past. LSD was much more spiritual and life-confirming than any salvia trips as I attempted to escape the woods, escape the imaginary spiders and ticks that clung to my skin as I fought my way out, and it seemed like it would never end. I knew I would die in the woods, alone, tripping on LSD, never having accomplished anything in my life.",
      "Finally, roads appeared in front of me, and I grappled on the cliffs, undecided as to whether I should go down on the road and walk home or stay in the woods. Every time I tried to go back in the woods to find the way to my house, as this road was obviously not where I wanted to be, invisible spiderwebs would loom across my vision, and I would hesitate. I do not have an intense fear of spiders, but constantly walking through their webs, huge black venomous buttons of claws were not happy issues to deal with in this state of mind.",
      "So I found my way to the roadway, and walked back along the streets of the town. Here, the hallucinations began to wear off, but the paranoia peaked like never before.",
      "Synaesthesia, the experience of walking and the sounds around me combining into one entity in my ears. I couldnt tell what was real and what wasnt. Then, when I got close to home, I began hearing it.",
      "Well call myself Hofmann here. Hofmann! Hofmann! The voices of my mother and father screaming in the park. I looked down into the park below me. Dogs, police cars, people. They were all looking for me. My time was up. Run back in the woods, quick! Hide out there like a leech infected with too many poisons just dont let them find you.",
      "What? I yelled into the park.",
      "Hes here! Hes up there! But did they know I was here?",
      "Youre surrounded!",
      "God, the LSD was a horrendously cruel beast. The people in the park were all cops screaming orders at me. Get down! Turn yourself in!",
      "Hofmann!",
      "A car drove past me, and for a moment I thought it had the long attenae of a disguised cop car. I was sure that a cop was going to pull right next to me, jump out of the car and arrest me. The United Police States of America.",
      "Instead, I simply went home, only a couple dilated pupils and a ringing in the ears as a sacrifice for the journey. At times, I had surely thought myself dying, poisoned, stung by spiders, prodded by ticks, about to be arrested, completely surrounded with cops. Now I was home and free. The LSD began to dwindle down as the sun, at times throughout the journey my friend and my enemy, finally set into the horizon."

      "I was probably only like 13 or so back then, and I was hanging out with one of my friends. Well anyways we were getting tired or just smoking butts to be cool, and we didn't know anyone who sold pot, so we just headed over to my neighbors tool shed and grabbed a can of gasoline. Anyways the first few huffs from the can weren't anything spectacular, just lots of weird noises and everything looked as if it were being zoomed out like on camcorder. We were in the woods so we didn't really have to hide from anybody, and it was pretty cool to see all the trees sliding back and forth so I kept on huffing.",
      "After about 5 huffs, the effects started to get longer. The first few times they would only last about 30 seconds and my mind would be somewhat foggy and confused for about 5 minutes. Seriously, during those 5 minutes, I couldn't even remember why I was in the woods, it was as if I just wandered out there and got lost. Then on the 5th hit from the can, I began to see in double vision and I could hear a buzzing sound like a chainsaw and it sounded like someone was screaming my name off in the distance somewhere, it really began to freak me out. But when I came to, I just shrugged it off and thought it was cool.",
      "I probably huffed it about 5 more times that day, and that was the last time I ever touched it. Back then I didn't know of any of the dangers, but immediately after doing it, I began looking into the effects and dangers. Everything I read basically scared the living hell out of me, and I never touched it or thought about doing it again."

      "I did not eat all of these drugs at once, however they were consumed over about a 5 hour time frame. I began the experience at approximately 10:00pm and it consisted of taking 15mg of oxycodone and 15 mg of hyrdocodone. About a half hour after consumption I began feeling threshhold effects and they began to intensify rapidly.",
      "Over the next 4 hours or so I dosed continually, taking the promethazine, norflex and plenty of other pills of vicodan and percocet. I have consumed many a hard drug in my day and I can honestly say this is probably the most fucked up I've ever been in my life. I was lying down in my bed for most of the time enjoying the utterly orgasmic feeling these pills produced. I was so high just after the aforementioned initial dose but for some reason I continued to do more and more pills as though I was trying to overdose. And that is exactly what I thought I had done at a about 3:00am.",
      "At this time I was starting to get a little worried not so much with the amount of oxycodone or hydrocodone I had consumed, but more so with the ridiculous amount of acetaminophen I had consumed. I went on the computer and tried finding out the signs of a acetaminophen overdose and I had shown signs such as yellow eyes and an excrutiating headache. I could barely read the screen on the computer as my eyes were unable to focus and my head was spinning like you wouldn't believe. I told myself that I was going to stay up because I feared that if I fell asleep that I would definetely not wake up.",
      "However of course I did end up falling asleep because with that much drugs in my system its nearly impossible to stay awake. I woke up at about noon the following day thankful to be alive and I was also still absolutely blasted. By this time though it was a much better high and I felt like the definition of relaxation for the rest of the day. The only negative comedown effects that I felt was a pounding headache for the following two days. Other than that it was a fantastic experience.",
      "I must warn anybody interested in trying drugs such as percocet or vicodan that these are extremely addictive as I am currently on 45mg of vicodan. They are without a doubt the most addicting drugs I've ever done, with the exception of maybe demerol."

      "I had one of those nights last Friday that teaches you to distinguish between a hard night and bad night. Breaking up with a girlfriend, thats a hard night. A bad night is one where youre at a party with a group of friends youre trying to break into, one of which is the attractive girl youve had your eye on, when your world starts to spin you black out and wake up in the hospital.",
      "I was trying to break into this new group of friends. You know  get to know them ... make some new friends, expand my dating pool. So I do the normal party thing. Some White Russians, a couple of shots of rum, and a few beers. Then I head outside and we hit the pipe a few times. Five maybe 6 hits of some type of pot they were calling cheese.",
      "Id estimate that about fifteen minutes later my world starts to spin. Things start moving as tough theyre out of a bad drug movie. And then my world disappeared. This is when I can only recount what strange thought processes went through my head and what I think happened.",
      "I passed out on the chair and was having a nightmare. I was dead or at least thought that I was experiencing death. My penultimate fear in the world is death... more exactly the unknown beyond it. This scares me out of my passed out state and I grab my glasses with both hands  pull them off my face and scream a long guttural scream as though trying to press through some incredible pain. I black out again.",
      "I recall being in the hallway crouched down with Amanda, the girl who was having the party. This part is really hazy and my field of vision is almost as though I can see my eyelids cutting off the top and bottom of my sight.",
      "Was that  that epilepsy? Amanda asked.",
      "I mumbled incoherently as I shook my head no. Then one of the other few familiar faces from the party comes by. The person, who brought the weed, Bill, walks into the hall and leans in.",
      "Was it a Panic attack? He asks.",
      "I blearily nod yes and Im gone again.",
      "I come to in the garage. By this time though my visions must have started because all I really remember is begging Bill not to leave. I remember the concrete floor and the single overhead light. I just wanted bill to keep me from slipping back into the terrifying lack of consciousness and bizarre visions I was having. But I was gone again.",
      "This is when I start to remember my thoughts. Time was violently ramping up and down. Forward and backward. I was begging the slow moments to come. They were my chance to escape. I thought I was dead. I thought that this was what life was really all about. That it just started over and that the past and future dont exist. Just the moment that youre currently trapped in. The slowest moment, and when that moment would end it would all start again and start at a rapid pace until you got to your next moment which was slower then the last. I knew at that moment it was how life worked  like a giant slinky connected at the ends and when you finally reached your slowest moment the moment when you really die you start the whole thing over again.",
      "The worst part about the fast parts was that it was like falling through everything you knew or ever will know. And you know that by the time you get back to your current moment youll forget it.",
      "Theres one line from my visions that I remember clearly. And now I know exactly what its really all about. I screamed it to myself as the thought raced by. I wanted to hold onto that thought. And then I was in the bathroom. Things in there get really strange.",
      "I remember asking to talk to Amanda. I think I thought she was an ex-girlfriend of mine named Tammy. I remember talking to a guy I met there that night named Air. I kept talking about TV shows and I think I was getting kind of touchy feely with him, which is when I think I thought he was a different friend of mine named Paul, who happens to be gay. I only remember talking abut the TV shows House and Nip/Tuck with him  I think I was trying to ask for a doctor. I tried to write something down, but it was totally incomprehensible. I knew it while I wrote it to but I just need somebody to help me.",
      "I slipped again... back to the time shifts. I remember thinking about the parallels in life  Life and Death. Black and white. Pleasure and pain. I felt an excruciating pain. Like a pinpoint of light boring through my body. I thought about vomit. At least three times that night I remember vomit going through my head. The next day I didnt have that puke taste in my mouth or throat so I dont think I did, but Id swear I did.",
      "Back in the bathroom  sitting on the counter my hair is wet. My reflection. Thats me! Gone again. Slipping through time getting back to the new moment. Wait. Hold on a second. Amir, the bathroom  why have I been there more then anywhere else. Those are important get back there. GET BACK TO THE BATHROOM! GOD FUCKING DAMNIT GET BACK THERE! AHHHHHHHHH!",
      "Next thing I know Im spitting at an EMT as Im being restrained in an ambulance. That god awful oxygen mask. Get that off me  Were not taking that mask off. Youve already spit on us twice, said the male EMT. I wont  ... not again, I manage to blabber out. I can remember the side of the ambulance but thats it. And black.",
      "I remember being moved to the hospital bed and calling a nurse fat and then shoving the woman who was giving me an IV away. They made me drink charcoal. After that I was gone and remember very little.",
      "The doctors told me that from the way I was acting they think I had some X or Acid in my system. I dont remember taking either. Maybe someone dropped some for themselves and drinks got switched  maybe I picked up a shot glass someone used to spike a drink and got some leftover. Maybe the weed was laced and I just reacted badly.",
      "I know I was VERY agitated. Very aggressive, but I knew not to hurt anyone. Amanda at one point offered or me to lie down in her bed. I refused because I knew if I went in there Id try and do something stupid. I was on the offensive the whole time. Trying to fight off paranoia, this in retrospect is probably the most basic form of paranoia. I also remember being very apologetic, I was sorry for running the party It felt like every bad drug trip youve seen in a movie.",
      "When I finally was lucid at the hospital I realized that I had my wallet, but was missing my phone, keys, glasses, shoes and my right sock. After they discharged me the next morning I took a cab back to Amandas house to get my things. She was terrified of me. I went to hug her any she skittishly jumped away from me.",
      "I was a long night, and the first BAD night of my life."

      "My girlfriend and I had decided to take a weeklong camping trip to the New Jersey shore over the summer.  We had been together for a year and I had become closer to her in that time than I had ever become with anyone, and because I felt so comfortable with her I figured that she would make the perfect tripping partner.  Accordingly, we brought an eighth of mushrooms along for a daylong beach excursion.  Neither of us had tried any sort of hallucinogens before (our experience with drugs having been limited to marijuana at that point), so our jaunt promised to be quite an adventure.",
      "When the day came for our trip to the beach, the sun was shining and fluffy white clouds floated gently in the bright blue sky overhead.  The temperature was warm, but not uncomfortably so.  I was pleased that the day was so nice and considered myself lucky to be tripping during it, as I had read extensively about mushroom use prior to this event and understood the benefits of tripping in a good environment.",
      "I drove us to the beach and parked in a very wealthy residential neighborhood that bordered the beach.  We split the eighth in the car, eating them with chocolate on the advice of a friend to mask the taste.  When finished, we grabbed our beach towels and sauntered down to the shore.  It was still early (a bit before noon) and I was happy to see that there werent too many people on the beach.  I had read about trippers becoming overwhelmed by being in the presence of too many people, and was quite wary of having a bad trip despite the excellent setting, company and relatively low dosage.",
      "We laid our towels down, applied sunscreen, and awaited the come-on with trepidation.",
      "About 20 minutes later I was feeling a bit strange and lightheaded but completely coherent.  My field of vision was taking on a different quality, but the change was too subtle and intangible to lay a finger on.",
      "Then I realized I had to go to the bathroom.",
      "I cursed at the bad timing, told my girlfriend Id be back, and headed off towards the boardwalk.  As I walked along the beach I looked into the distance and it slowly dawned on me just how far I had parked from where the bathrooms would be.  I could see some rides and shops a significant distance from myself that didnt seem to come any closer no matter how much I walked.",
      "As I continued, my anxiety began to grow.  My feet were sinking uncomfortably into the sand as the hot sun sapped my strength, and the strong coastal winds seemed to pick up strength and reverberate loudly in my ears.  As the wind (seemingly) picked up, I felt as though my walk was building towards something monumental  as if I were trudging towards something explosive that was bound to go off any second. ",
      "I smiled and tried to shrug the feeling off, though with only limited success. ",
      "Finally I stopped walking, realizing my goal was too far in the distance to reach without leaving my girlfriend behind for a significant period of time.  Considering this was her first tripping experience too and I thought she might become frightened if I disappeared, I didnt want to do that, so I decided to turn around and just go to the bathroom later.",
      "As I turned I noticed a large cloud of tiny black birds floating on the strong breeze.  They didnt seem to be flocking exactly, but rather drifting on the wind.  This swarm of silent minuscule birds glided overhead, over the sand dunes and soon wafted away to land on nearby houses.  To this day Im not sure if this cloud of birds was real or in some way hallucinatory, but I was certainly impressed by the unusual nature of the flock.",
      "Though I had momentarily abandoned the anxiety I had been feeling earlier when I observed the birds, when I turned around I was astounded by how the beach had filled with people.  I must have been walking for some time, I decided, and was now worried I wouldnt be able to find my way through the throng back to my girlfriend.  I had nothing on me  no cell phone, no wallet, no keys, nothing except my swimsuit  so I was nervous I wouldnt be able to find her and had no way to contact her.",
      "I suddenly realized the extent to which the mushrooms had set it.  The crowd of beachgoers walked around disjointedly and looked as though they had arms for legs, though I couldnt seem to focus on this effect to completely confirm it.  I found this physical deformation of the people who surrounded me as somewhat unnerving.  To add to the confusion, the sounds of their shouts, squeals and laughter merged with the ocean breeze to form a peculiar and somehow alien wave of noise that assaulted my ears. ",
      "I began to walk again, but my mind started to play tricks on me, momentarily making me believe that I hadnt turned around at all and that I was traveling opposite the direction I wanted to go.  I immediately dismissed the idea as crazy because I had access to an enormous land marker that made sure I was going the right way  the ocean, which was now sparkling in the sunlight.  The waves took on a brilliant glow, as if studded with diamonds, but my eyes couldnt seem to focus on any particular quality of the water that would make it illuminate in such a fashion. ",
      "Despite the oceans interesting and nonthreatening features, the disorderly crowds of people and screaming children, as well as the anxiety of not being able to locate my girlfriend, was really getting to me. ",
      "Thats when I saw it.  At first it was just out of the corner of my eye, but despite my better judgment I completely turned my head to get full view of a corpse sitting in a beach chair staring back at me. ",
      "The human cadaver was incredibly detailed and chilling, it was shriveled and brown, as if it had been in the sun for several days, with its arms curled up at its chest and desiccated legs drooping lifelessly onto the sand below.  Its left eye was gray, dulled and unmoving, but its right looked as if it had popped from some intense heat, and internal liquids had dribbled down from the open socket.  Its face was withered and wrinkled, drawing its jaw into a tight sneer, above which an empty dried up hole served as a nose.",
      "My heart leaped in my chest.  I quickly averted my gaze and rapidly walked passed. ",
      "Im not getting freaked out by that, I muttered silently to myself over and over again as I began to search for my girlfriend with much greater apprehension. ",
      "I was completely aware that what I had seen was a hallucination brought on by the mushroom trip and not a real corpse, and I think it was that understanding that kept me stable as I hurried on  very intentionally not looking behind me for a second glance.",
      "When I caught sight of my girlfriend lying comfortably on her towel, a profound wave of relief swept over me.  I smiled and happily plopped down next to her, giving her a very sincere kiss on the cheek as greeting.",
      "I told her that I hadnt made it to the bathroom because of the distance, but held off on telling her about my negative experiences until after the trip had expired because I feared I might freak her out and cause her to have a similar experience. ",
      "We lay there for a while and watched the clouds float about peacefully and the dune grass blow in the wind with no strong hallucinations but with a definite alteration in reality.",
      "I felt completely at peace again and in time we picked up our stuff, put it in the car and began the long walk towards the boardwalk.  During this walk we had a great time, grabbing some ice cream from a local vendor we joked about this and that (the mushrooms having made us rather giddy) until the conversation slowly turned to more serious matters.  Though we differed on certain issues, I found that the mushrooms had brought out an incredible empathy in me and I completely understood and respected her points of view.",
      "I felt very connected to the world around me and was able to reflect on its goings-on in a far more objective way than I think would have been possible without the mushrooms.  I thought about the state of the world we live in, and how ultimately everyone is just trying to get by as best they know how. I thought about how we should all place a greater emphasis on communication with our fellow man and renounce much of the finger pointing and violence that separates peoples, countries, and cultures.",
      "During this reverie I felt a unity with things around me and with my companion, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying her experience too with her giggles and similar introspective reflections. ",
      "By the time we got to the boardwalk the trip had all but expired.  When I finally got to the bathroom, the last vestiges of the mushrooms effects were tapering off, the final visual stimulation I experienced for the rest of the day were the patterns on the stall walls slowly shifting and moving around  which I found somewhat interesting.",
      "Even with such a (relatively) low dosage (having consumed half an eighth) I found the trip to be a fascinating experience, despite the extremely unnerving encounter with the corpse."

      "I was really bored one night and decided to try huffing gasoline for the first time. I have heard so many bad things about it, but I thought they were all scare tactics. I thought to myself, 'How can it do that much damage?'. So, I started out by getting a 2-liter bottle and putting a little bit of gasoline at the bottom, I began huffing it madly, for about 40 seconds to a minute. I sat back and waited ... within seconds, I had a buzz that was really dull. It gave me a heavy sinking feeling, as if I was being pulled into the ground. No visual hallucinations occurred, and no auditory hallucinations either. The buzz lasted for mere minutes, and then was gone. It was certainly not worth it, and I will not be doing it again. I don't recommend it either, the buzz is dull and does not last long at all. Find a better way to amuse yourself..."

If I don't maintain a tolerance level for alcohol it can drop to the point where one beer will have a noticeable effect, to get stoned I only need a few drags. My previous encounter with LSD was one dud hit a few years back which effected me more then anyone else.",
      "I was back in my home town after a few months away. I had moved to another city where I was busy failing college. I had not maintained a tolerance level for alcohol. I was depressed. In the new city I had found it difficult to make friends I could relax with because my previous friends and I had built one of those internal logic systems of humour and unspoken philosophy without branching out enough.",
      "In the new city I had become introspective with too much time and too much Spliff. Smoking Spliff was making me paranoid. My life had fallen into rituals of image maintainance - fake smiles and laughter. A shit life. I fucking hate fake smiles. When I got back I couldn't click with my old friends, things had changed, cocaine had come into the group and they didn't want me to know about it. I got an immediate inferiority complex and started shutting down. I got a stiff-in-my-joints-while-sitting-because-movement-might-betray-my-awkwardness kind of awkwardness. Also, I was feeling guilty for going off to visit my friends without really saying hello to my family.",
      "We were parked at some arb place in the city and there was to be a party at an old friends house which I found myself dreading. Why can't I enjoy this like I'm supposed to? What the fuck is wrong with me? I thought constantly. I was passed beer in a quart and I found myself getting embarrasingly drunk. I was constantly relating what I was actually doing and saying to what I should've been doing and saying, like some one would ask me a question and I would mumble something inane, the person would move on to find a better vibe quite quickly and I would be left thinking about what I could've and should've said etc.",
      "Not a state in which to smoke a Spliff but when it came around I could not face the task of explaining why I didn't want any. I got bad stoned.

And some what might be called dirty hippies I guess, I think they were junkies. I feel I was way too analytical in noting these distinctions, but I was in that frame of mind, trying to quantify, understand, reduce.",

      "'Uh, yeah.' I said and gave the money. I looked at it, put it in my mouth and swallowed it down with beer.",
      "After Id swallowed I realised I would much rather be far away from those people, in a bath, reading some really nice book. Escapist thinking. It came on quite quickly, within twenty minutes I was feeling it, and an hour later I was completely wrecked. Everything I wanted to escape from had a crotch which was rubbed in my face.",

      "I realised I was going to die. The nakedness of the realisation was total, no abstraction whatsoever. You Are Going To Die One Day. It might as well have been within the hour.

      "My internal organs were there right under a thin flat of skin. This freaked me out. These Guts Will Rot One Day. Fuck. My friends were laughing, delighting in the wonder around them while I was a million miles away. My Mom Will Die Before Me And Rot. Fuck. Your Body. My fucking body will die? Dead? Me? What the fuck am I? What The Fuck Am I? I just didnt have a clue. I tried escaping to the bathroom.",
      "Oh God the mirror in the bathroom. I didn't see myself in the mirror at all, nothing of me was there. No familiar face that Ive seen each day without concern. How I was moving this was a mystery. It was horror. This covering, thin thin thin covering of skin. And that dripping red flesh moulded onto a white bone skull. A knife could easily peel that away.",
      "(I just want to point out that there was no danger of me harming myself even though I was completely wrecked on LSD. Im quite positive of it.)",
      "The physics of being able to peel your face off easily are obvious, but I realised the full implications of this possibility. You Can Physically Dismantle a Human Body Into Various Parts. What?? And digging through the pile of guts, 'where are you?' would reveal no little silver glowing orb that was consciousness or spirit.",
      "I realised that right that very second someones body was being sliced open by a murderer. Someone was being eaten alive by a wild animal, face ripping off, the thing fucking roaring with as it does it. No Mercy. Although I dont know if it was anywhere near the real horror, I couldnt imagine feeling any worse if I was watching a mauling first hand. Maybe the difference was duration, I would get flashes of the total feeling that I was somewhat able to recoil from.",
      "I got back to the crowd and theyd moved outside into the freezing cold. My fear of opening up and talking kept all my unfolding revelations inside, and from the outside I suppose I was just a strange person who was completely off his face and worried looking but otherwise calm. My eyes were probably looking in two different directions.",
      "I didn't want life, I didn't want to be stuck in this sensitive pile of guts. Who the fuck would stick you in a pile of guts and leave you to rot away? What sick joke was this? Then my heart dropped, it suddenly hit me that it's entirely possible that we are a mistake. That human consciousness is anomolous, evolution fucking up. For thousands and thousands of years no one has been able to conclusively prove otherwise.",
      "God? The word was a noise the mouth makes with air and gristle. Religion could simply have evolved through natural selection to keep humans sane and motivated to the end of their lives. What a sick joke. What a legacy. Stuck in a pile of rotting guts to die. WHY? What If I Didnt Want This? Where Is The Choice?",
      "Everything was life or death and my friends were giggling and opening things and eating things, I felt nothing for them, no love. Visuals were constant but they were meaningless. The cloudy night sky was a misty inner dome of a dark cathedral with hundreds of carved gargoyles staring out of the gloom. Friends faces were simultaneous layers of skin, flesh and bone. I saw piles of guts, stomachs, livers, breathing lungs under rib cages. I lost the abstractions. Spines jutted from the back of jerseys and elbows were just protrusions of the underlying skeleton. Thin paper skin covering these. It seemed everyone was just ignoring these obvious betrayals. 'High cheek bones' and 'beautiful knees' but they are just skin covering bone. I stared at my hands and they freaked me out, they were pads. If we had three fingers since memory then we wouldnt think anything of it, I began seeing everyone with three fingers.",

      "Personal Thoughts",
      "This analogy just came to me: An uncontrolled release of pressure is an explosion. Which damages the vessel. Fuck. But a controlled release can be entirely beneficial",
      "I think these kind of experiences are necessary for a person, even the negative ones. But I think mine was too much at the wrong time. In my opinion it should not be dick around stuff, but a controlled and regulated event. It just makes so much sense to me. Naked blasts of truth and there isnt a religious use for it? Please. Because what happened to me was too much of a burn, Im now pretty much scared shitless of facing any truth again, Ive gone back to my escapist ways. What I propose to myself is a sorting out of my mental negativities, face my fears etc. and then try LSD or some substance again with a braver outlook. If I can crack that then I will write up on the glory, which Im sure exists in equal quantities as the hell but Im yet to experience it fully. Ive had glimpses on odd Spliff revelations, but nothing full on convincing.",
      "I need to be convinced. Faith based religion does not really work for me, so I need to find a person who has gone into these experiences and come out with some kind of map towards compassion, who has some kind of useful systems/techniques in place and who treats these events with utmost reverence and respect. Because to not feel love for my friends was fucking aweful. (I see this as a five to ten year plan, nothing to be taken lightly. My soul on the line type of thing.)",
      "Although this blasted me into an existential nightmare with lingering effects and what it uncovered has not been covered over again, I think its better I deal with it now than perhaps after I die? There where there might be less footholds to return to. Though it was the cause, I dont think LSD was to blame for the bad experience, it just accelerated and amplified what was naturally residing in my psychology.",
      "Thanks for letting me share this, it has helped me. I never realised how bad it actually was."

      "I've also had to be careful about alcohol. I can't start out with hard liquor too fast or else I will crash and become an emotional mess. I've never known the feeling of being drunk without being on Setraline so I don't know if what I experience is normal. It is normal for me. I have to be even more careful than other people with alcohol because it can make me euphoric or it can make me crash.",
      "And another thing: I love Hydrocodone (Vicodin)for it's ability to ease my back pain. I only take it on a rare occasion, though, and only take half a pill. I haven't had any adverse affects with take them both together. Vicodin does make me feel like I am drunk with lightheadedness, dizziness, and general lack of coordination."

      "I consider myself to be a highly experienced psychonaut, I've had hundreds of experiences with 2C-I, 2C-E, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DOC, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MiPT, mushrooms, ayahuasca, LSA, amanita mushrooms, yopo, and I was looking forward to this new tool to add to the bag.",
      "The powder itself was composed of a very fine, clay-coloured texture.  I was somewhat saddened all that is available is fumarate salts, my suspicion is that its used as a cutting agent to add weight to the molecule.  It also makes it more difficult to determine proper dose.  After adding up the molecular weights, I determined the powder was 66% ethocin freebase by weight, so 21mg fumarate = 14mg freebase, and I'd heard that ~15mg is appropriate.",
      "I've now experimented with this a few times, enough to gain a good understanding of what the experience is and what it has to offer, as well as good dosing strategies.  The experience itself comes on about 1.5 hours after consuming it, and the peak continues for approximately 3 hours.  The experience it produces is highly conducive for meditation.  It's not a warm feeling, but its a loving feeling, the connections felt with other people aren't so much physical or personal, but rather spiritual.",
      "One of the highlights of this compound is the visual nature it produces.  Its rich with both CEV's as well as OEV's.  The OEV's come on strong after 15-16mg, after that, there is a steep dosage-response curve.  The OEV's take the form of energy currents and distribution.  Shadows appear and disappear, and a steady strobing effect is present in the peripheries.  I wish I could remember more about the tracer-factor this drug produces, but they seemed to have a unique characteristic to them that made them different from 2C-E tracers or mushroom tracers.  All things seem to meld together into a single form and then stretch.",
      "The CEV's are highly colored, geometric, complex, and synaesthetic.  One night, I felt myself slip into a meditative trance, and with my eyes closed, I slipped out of my body into infinite space.  I was curled up like a fetus, and the world around me was composed of digital grids.  As I moved further down into it, I saw two hearts beating in the grid, and I descending down between them.  As this was happening, I was aware of my breathing becoming slower and slower until it had stopped completely, and as I got right up on the figures, my cat had made his way over to me and was frantically trying to get my attention.  As soon as I re-opened my eyes, he lost interest and walked away. ",
      "Another characteristic of this and similar compounds my friends and I have found is that they seem to have a special ability of attracting non-physical beings/energies.  It constantly feels as though some sort of entity is present, what I can't say is whether or not they seem hostile.  I've never felt threatened by them.  It almost seems as though they're interested in what we're doing, they're just standing around observing us.  In a way, it feels like the visions are a production of their presence, a form of mental communication.",
      "There isn't really any body-load experienced during any of the trips.  The closest thing is leg tremors.  The experience doesn't feel sinister, either, like 4-AcO-DMT.  The visuals are mostly friendly, warm, and entertaining.  It makes everything look so modern and plastic, like its vibrant.  And if I focus my attention on any one spot,  I can make it do almost anything."

      "On Thursday morning at about 8:30 AM I was injected with a drug [BZ]. I felt no different at that time, about an hour later I felt very restless and I wanted to get up and walk around but the nurse said I had to stay flat on my back.  I have no idea of when I fell asleep but it must have been between 8:30 and 12 noon because I cannot remember eating lunch. In fact, I cannot remember eating or drinking during the entire test.",
      "I will now describe some of the dreams I had.  There was supposed to be an inspection in the barracks by a general and I had just come back from leave.  I was trying to get ready for it.  The only difficulty I had was that I could only find one boot so I put on a pair of shower shoes.  When the general saw them he asked why I was wearing them and I told him that I was under orders from a doctor not to keep my feet enclosed but to let the air at them.  He believed me and left the room.  In this same dream I had a girl waiting for me down the hall.  I wanted to go out and see her but the nurse wouldn't let me so after trying to fight my way out and failing I called the MP's who promptly arrested them.  After that I found out that they were going to beat me up so I tried to make friends with the one who appeared to be the leader.  It must have worked because I don't remember a beating.",
      "In another dream I remember that I kept falling down.  I told everyone that I had lost my balance but I really felt that something was seriously wrong with me.  I remember taking only one fall that really hurt me, the others weren't very bad. In another short dream I can remember red lights blinking on and off but that's all I can remember about it.  I can remember no written tests or anyone taking blood.",
      "Another effect of the drug besides being restless was a slight headache and a feeling of being very light-headed and having trouble focusing my eyes.",
      "To the best of my knowledge [the other subject] was in the room when I fell asleep but when I woke up he and his bed were both gone.  I can remember eating a meal, I don't know what meal it was but it consisted of beans, cold cuts, and for dessert I had peach ice cream.  [This was Sunday, Feb 10, 1963]  I seem to remember Mrs. King and Mr. Stearn being there for a while, about what I don't remember.",
      "In another dream I met a girl whom I had known for some time.  We had been going out quite a bit together but then I broke off with her.  She didn't look right to me and I asked what was wrong but she started crying and wouldn't tell me.  Finally she admitted that she was pregnant. I didn't ask her anything else and then the dream ended.  I could not understand why, she was always so careful not to go that far.  This girl I speak of is [--], a girl I went with for about 2 years.  I stopped going out with her all together [sic] in June of 1960 but in the dream I wanted to go back and take her out again.  If there were any tests taken while I was under the drug I don't remember them at all nor do I remember eating or drinking anything except for the one meal that I described before.",
      "I do remember refusing to take orange juice and getting mad at whoever tried to give it to me.  I also remember trying to break out of a room, probably the one I was in but I'm not sure.  I tried to rip some of the walls or padding off.  Another incident I remember was sneaking out of my room and going for a walk.  Also, when I woke up this morning I noticed that there were white sheets on the bed but before I was injected there were green sheets.  No that I think back I can remember blood being taken once.  It seemed to be very, very painful.  I also remember my hands and feet being red in color.  At one time I seemed to have a very sore throat, it was then I asked for and received a drink of water.",
      "[Note: Ketchum's book includes a detailed transcript of what occurred in the real world simultaneous with John's subjective report. The subject showed typical symptoms of BZ intoxication, alternating between stuperous slumber and incoherent delirium. The experience lasted for about 85 hours, and occurred in a special medical testing facility in Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland.]"

      "I have been using poppy seeds for approixmately nine months now. My use has ranged from every day for a few days in a row to once every two weeks. I have extensively experimented with a wide range of drugs and almost all commerically available opiates, not including heroin. Poppy seed tea is no joke. The first time I read about it, I managed to make a mess, spend 10 bucks, and get nothing out of it. I tried it again using seeds for a different store, and got a noticable but fairly insignificant buzz. After narrowing down which suppliers have the best poppies and the correct recipe, I have managed to get seriously high for approximately $2 a hit and not make a mess in the process.",
      "To make poppy seed tea I get between 8 oz to 32 oz (.5 to 2 lbs) of poppies per person. I put the poppy seeds in a trash bag and pour water over the seeds untit it gains a soupy texture (I can feel it through the bag). The optimal mixture is just enough so the poppy seeds can freely move through the mixture but not so much that I'm forced to drink a pitcher full of tea. I massage the mixture for about one minute or two, and then get a needle or earring and a pitcher. I poke holes in the bag so that the water can escape without allowing the poppy seeds to escape. A slow drip is preferable to a fast one. If I want to accelerate the drip, I put air in the bag, seal the bag, and use the air to push the water out. T shirts are o.k but 1) the shirt absorbs some of the alkaloids, 2) you lose the t-shirt, and 3) it tends to make a mess. I don't add lime juice unless I want the taste, it has no effect on the potency of the mixture.",
      "The two indicators of strength are color and taste. In general, the darker, the stronger, and the more bitter, the stronger. Bitterness is always 100% correlated with strength, color I would say 90% of the time. I would liken the effects of the tea of 8 oz. of strong poppy seeds to eating 20 mg of oxycontin, with the added 'trippy' effect of morphine. The effects can last a long time, up to 12 hours per dose. It calms my nerves, numbs pain, makes boring things more interesting, and allows me to socialize with more warmth. The risk of psychological/physical addiction is the same as any other opiate.",
      "If your seeds don't work, you probably got bad ones. I would say that at least 50% of store bought seeds don't work. My experience is:",
      "1) If they are expensive, they probably won't work.",
      "2) If you can only buy them in 4 oz or 8 oz packs, they probably won't work",
      "3) Co-ops and health food stores typically don't have good seeds. I have only gotten high potency seeds at farmer's markets.",
      "4) Seeds follow a 'when it rains, it pours' pattern. Every store might have great seeds for a month, and then all of the sudden, you can't find any anywhere. I'm sure this is due to regional distribution and supply patterns."

As usual, Jer was in search of some weed, and I was usually the guy who sold it to him. But, I had quit smoking weed for three months at this point, because I wanted to improve my OCD and bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, I ended up finding it for him anyway, and I could resist the temptation of smoking a cone.  It was especially tempting because I wanted to see how my latest prescription, Imovane, would react when combined with cannabis use.",
      "It was now a only  little while after taking my nightly regimen, that was to include a combination of the following: 2000mg Divalproex, 250mg Fluvoxomine, 2mg Risperidone, 45mg Mirtazapine, and the more recent addition, 7-15mg Zopiclone. Tonight I had only taken one and a half of the 7.5 mg Imovane tablets.",
      "After A while of sitting on the couch in my medicated daze, I began to obsess over the small amount of reefer that I had pinched out of the bag for myself. With in a matter of minutes I had rolled one up and was smoking it. Soon I was completely fucking blazed. Everything was fucking amazing for a while, and I felt like I had taken a small amount of mushrooms, smoked weed, and drank a bit of hard alcohol.",
      "Eventually I ended up in my bed, talking on the phone with my ex-girlfriend for about an hour. She told me that I sounded all doped up, and she also asked me if I was okay. But I felt absolutely fine..",
      "The suddenly, a wave of unbearable nausea came over my whole body, an my mind when into some kind of trance, sort of like the k-hole. I then felt like I had to take a shit and ran for the bathroom. I sat on the toilet and pissed out of my asshole for a while. Afterwards, I went back to lay in me bed but this time brough a garbage can to throw up in, and I did. I puked up the most acidic mixure ever concocted. This fucking shit burned my throat and mouth. This phase lasted about an hour and a half.",
      "When the whole thing passed I still felt like a can of smashed ass-holes, and I couldnt get to sleep. I decided to take another Zopiclone, and It was good night for me. I will never smoke weed again as long as I am on these medications. The consequences of doing so were not worth it. I blame it on the Depakote mainly, but who knows? I dont want to go through that shit again."

      "I just brew up a batch of GHB today and because there wasn't any detailed report of a GHB experience on the forum yet, I decided, in the name of science to take a good dose of GHB and take notes. I always make my GHB myself, and always with the same recipe. I always makes liquid GHB but don't know the amount of GHB dissolved in the solution. But because I alway use the same recipe I am familiar with my own GHB. I always take the same dose, 5ml. Beware that other GHB might be a lot weaker or a lot stronger if it's liquid, so don't judge according to my dose. I also have to mention I drink some wine during my experience. Combining alcohol and GHB can be very dangerous, for some people even in low doses. Don't drink any alcohol when taking GHB unless when experienced. Here is my experience:",
      "T 23:11 I drank my glass of GHB dissolved in apple juice.",
      "T 23:21 I am feeling the first effects, they are getting stronger pretty fast. The main effect I feel now is sedation. Meanwhile I am enjoying a good glass of South-African red wine. When on GHB I always get snack munchies. I only enjoy snacks while on it, not anything sweet. The same happens when I am on opiates.",
      "T 23:31 I am now really sedated and my legs are starting to get warm and glowy, this is a really nice feeling. I am also pretty euphoric now. I am going to get another glass of wine and something to eat, snacks of course.",
      "T 23:38 I have just made 2 slices of bread with garlic butter which I am really enjoying, and I also poured himself another glass of red wine.",
      "T 23:41 I think I am on my plateau now. I feel pretty sedated and euphoric. My legs still feel warm. I am going to make some more slices of bread with garlic butter because I am hungry.",
      "T 00:11 The effects have grown even stronger. I am feeling even more sedated though I am not feeling more euphoric. The wine has amplified the sedation with a factor of two.",
      "T 00:21 Feeling even more sedated, the wine has definately contributed a lot to this amplification. I am going to brush my teeth so I don't have to do this later. When I'm done I'm going to continue reading on online about GHB.",
      "T 00:31 I have just brushed my teeth. I am still pretty sedated though also tired. I am going to sleep in 5 minutes. This has been a good experience, like it always is with GHB for me, only a bummer it has such a short duration.",
      "T 00:41 My legs are feeling warm again, actually a lot warmer than it had felt the whole night. This feeling is very pleasant and feels somewhat like opiate warmth but more intense and just local.",
      "T 00:51 The warm feeling has grown even stronger, my legs are almost burning of warmth, though the feeling is now even more pleasant than it was earlier this evening. I am also even more sedated than I was earlier this evening and nodded out a few minutes ago. I am really going to sleep within 5 minutes.",
      "T 01:01 I am still feeling somewhat euphoric, though the euphoria has largely subsided. I am feeling pretty sleepy so I'm going to get some well earned rest.",
      "T 01:17 Admitted experience report to the forum. I am going to sleep now, nighty night."

      "SET AND SETTING:",
      "I had gotten about 1,5g - 2g of dried ecuadorians from a friend of a friend, as everyone of course, and I wanted to trip n daylight. Previously I had taken a gram to see my threshold. This was a good idea as I spent the night laughing and exploring my room. But nothing extraordinary, probably resembling being stoned. This time I had a higher dose. I also wanted an another person to be around me when I'm trippin so I would see how I react to them.",
      "I picked a girl I had known for months and with whom I was in good terms. She lived in an apartment and her father was away so we had the place to ourselves and she was interested in mushrooms. So I thought that it would be a learning experience for us both. and indeed it was. I ate the dried shrooms in chocolate pudding but amazingly the shroom taste was still there.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED:",
      "She was behind her computer and I was lying on the couch. We were talking and soon I had forgotten I had even dosed. I followed the advice from a wise shroomer to 'never expect anything and work with what you get WHEN you get it.' I asked myself how do you know when you have begun to trip? As I was talking to her I stared at her wallpaper. It was twirly and with nice texture. Colour was red & orange. As I stared at it I kind of saw it expanding from one place and then moving from another place. I asked myself 'Am I imagening this or is this really happening?'",
      "The longer I stared at the wallpaper the harder it started to warp. Soon I saw that the lines on the wallpaper were really bars and behind it was a huge submerged city, probably atlantis. I stared at that as you would watch TV. It seemed casual and so normal I didn't even say anything to her and just smiled. She looked at me and anxiously asked me what I saw but I sayd 'nothing.'",
      "What I thought was that people that never use LSD or shrooms can't understand what you see. They expext you to see aliens and pink bears coming out of the ceiling but for me it was different: everyday objects were so twisted and new to me like I've never seen them. I didn't realize I was hallucinating - I just saw things.",
      "Soon I stood up and stood up and started looking at the wall. I realized I could lose myself into the wall if I looked long enough. But this time I wanted more than breathing walls. I was somewhat disappointed that breathing walls was all I saw so I ignored it and acted normal to my friend.",
      "As I explored the wallpaper I started down and saw the tiles on her floor. They were wood imitation and jesus christ what I saw made me grin a whole lot. I tapped on my friends shoulder and was serious and sounded cautious: 'You know that scene from FEAR & LOATHING in the lobby with the carpet warping? Well, I hate to tell you that it's happening right now. Do not be alarmed - it's not carying us away.'",
      "She just stared at me blankly and was kind of freaked that I was so out of it. I didn't realize that I was tripping hard and not even peaking. Indeed - I could have sworn with my hand on a bible: the tiles were flowing or accelerating. And I stood on it. I even touched the tiles with my fingers and the visions didn't stop. I told her I'm having a serious time believing that she's lived in the room and never seen what the tiles do.",
      "'Are you aware in what sort of a room you're living in?'",
      "She stared at me like a mental patient. I was conscious enough to see that she didn't know how to react. I didn't think I was hallucinating either. She then asked me calmly about the room and I said 'Jesus, the room seems to be tilted to the right because the tiles are flowing to that corner of the room. And yet I'm standing on it. how can I be hallucinating if I'm standing on it?'",
      "She just started laughing so hard and so did I. I realized I had whispered this to her because if I said these things out loud then I would somehow lose my speech. Then I told her 'I can't say these things out aloud because the vibrations of the walls are so awesome.'",
      "I had to turn away from the walls because they were warping out of the yahoo now. I laughed and said I didn't even have to look at the walls to know what they're doing.' She sat with me and I started talking about everything. I knew I was tripping so I tried to communicate myself as well as possible. I also didn't want to scare her. nothing worse than having the imprint of a crazed dope fiend imprinted on your mind. I calmed down and said 'Okay, I'll just sit here a while and you do your thing.' In reality she was typing everything I did into notepad. That was very thoughtful of her a I now have an observers record of the event as it went along.",
      "And I have to tell you: sitting was never that exhilirating. I described it to her (in earthly terms) as the kind of a feeling that you get when you're sitting behind a red light in a BMW and as the light turns green you accelerate. The BMW goes smoothly but fast into acceleration and your body, for a second, gets pushed gently into the seat. And it was exactly like that. She laughed at this and I said 'This is the easiest way of explaining it: it's hard to describe if you never have been accelerated. You are like an eskimo in a sense that if I would try to describe this to an eskimo you would both look at me like a crazy man. You and the eskimo have never been accelerating so I can't explain it better.'",
      "She laughed so hard again and I felt I should wind down. I noticed that my mind was racing before my speech. Like an echo of an echo of an echo. So I said I can't say what I mean because I hear someone talking. Then I REALIZE that I'm the only one talking and I start LISTENING to what he has to say and then I start mumbling. This was extremely funny as I was caught in it several times.",
      "I stood on the tiles again and this time but wasn't surprised that they were flowing. I explained that this felt like being on the end of a cruiser: you stare at the water foam from the back of the boat and then it seems like the water is moving and that you are standing still.",
      "Then the real trip began.",
      "I asked for a glass of water. Previously I had refused to go to the kitchen because the fridge did a wonderful humming noise. I said that if I ever get to the kitchen I honestly never may come out because I'll stay there forever to listen to the good vibrations. Then she brought me water. As I started to drink I couldn't.",
      "I stared at my hand with the glass and asked her what I was doing. She laughed and said that for ten minutes I have been starting to take a glass of water. I laughed and asked 'Who?'",
      "She said 'You, man. do you want it or not?'",
      "I laughed and asked her who she was talking to: my eyes or the hand that was holding the glass. From there I really got puzzled: if I wanted water then why was my hand holding my glass? And if my mouth said I wanted to drink then why had my hand stopped drinking and why were my eyes seeing my hand and mouth arguing? Then I realized that I had to co-ordinate my mouth, hand, lips, arm and my WHOLE BODY to get a sip of cold tap water. After a half an hour (I literally couldn't concentrate enough to move my hand) I took a sip and I was BLOWN AWAY how the water went down my throat. It was the most amazing thing ever as the cold water poured downwards.",
      "From there on I discovered that I could remove these 'hand/mouth/body' conflict by going on autopilot. Not to think about them and just doing them because every time I was thinking about moving myself my mind blew away at the possibilities.",
      "Well, it's hard to remember everything as I was literally thinking of EVERYTHING. As this has been a bit long of a raport I'll translate some lines from my friends notes. They are scrambled, therefore accurate description of what I was acting like:",
      "Every time I start talking someone else starts talking too. Like an echo of my words before I even say them. Especially the long vocals. Your computer buzzes nicely. I should get some of that white fuzz noise into my computer. It reminds me of angels singing in heaven. Turn it up.",
      "This room should be illegal. Have you looked out the window? Jesus Christ, I know smoke shouldn't act like that but god as my witness that smoke from the chimney is on turbo and getting faster. How can it be? Is this normal?",
      "We should get these shrooms in the summer. Go to a park. Watch a puddle of water or the grass grow.",
      "Hahaha, I got my sweater back on. Thought I'm so tripping I can't even put clothes on, right! Haha, cleverer than you. I'm actually understanding that I'm tripping and that's fine.",
      "Well I see that an arm is holding up this glass of water, but who is holding on the arm? That is the REAL question here *a fit of laughter* (this idea haunted me 'til the end: if the hand is holding the water then WHO is holding up the arm?)",
      "Jesus, shrooms should be illegal indeed. Some punk may start driving a car when tripping and do god knows what. Forget that: THIS ROOM SHOULD BE ILLEGAL *laughter*",
      "A note apperas out of context here: 'I can't see that he is tripping if I didn't know about it before. Acts normal, pupils fine, doesn't stagger. But when he starts talking he sounds so fucked. Starts a sentence and forgets to finish it. Mumbles, stares at the wall for long periods of time and says it's staring him back.'",
      "I'm sitting here and I am NOT hallucinating. YOU're hallucinating. Ever wondered what its like to be tripping on shrooms? Well think about everything what you are able to imagine: flying elephants, pink rainbows, the standard stuff. And the FORGET about it. And after you have forgotten that and you have nothing left your mind will explode and you start seeing how things are. You wouldn't be able to live in this room if you would see whats going on right now.",
      "This is about it. What I mean is this is what I can REMEMBER when coming down. It's been a few hours after I sobered out but the shrooms are still in me.",
      "CONCLUSION:",
      "As for my second trip it was extremely fantastic. My friend says that she was like also trippping and watching me was like being in some weird dream. I would want everyone to experience this experience at least once in their lives.",
      "I'd rate this a level2 trip but what a trip it was. I would do it again in a heartbeat if the conditions and the mood are fit for it.",
      "In the end words aren't enough and I know shroomery is the place that is full of people that grasp that."

      "My whole life growing up I always talked down on drugs.  But starting about my 10th grade year of high school (I am now 2 years out of school) I started to experiment with drugs.  I had already had alcohol before and I never thought it was a very bad thing. ",
      "At 15 was when I took my first hit of marijuana, which I never really cared for, but still was pulled into the 'glamor' of it.  It seemed that everyone around me was smoking and it would be uncool for me not to.",
      "A lot of people like to say that marijuana is a gateway drug, but I don't believe it at all.  Sure maybe it seems that people start smoking weed before moving onto harder drugs, but to me its because its more accepted as well as easier to get.  After I started smoking I started taking all sorts of pills at school as if it was uncool not to. ",
      "I've grown quite a lot since then, but that doesn't mean I've stopped using.  I don't do drugs anymore to look cool or because I feel peer pressured into it.  I have just grown into a life style of being surrounded by different narcotic substances. ",
      "I started snorting cocaine the end of my senior year because I was curious what all the fuss was about.  Little did I know that I would like it so much.  At first we would be able to let 1/2 a gram last a night between 2-3 of us. ",
      "The coke high was the best feeling I had ever gotten from any kind of drug.  Most would make me either drowsy and less coherent, but would just make me feel 'fucked up.' My body so light and relaxed that I was in a state of euphoria.  There was and still is nothing like the first line of a night.  With my heart beating faster and my muscles relaxing more and more, I felt like I should be on a cloud. ",
      "The high was so amazing, but the end of the night I would be wishing I was dead because my head would be so stuffed.  Breathing through my nose was a joke, and trying to make the throbbing headache go away was impossible.  Over time I learned other drugs to take in which would help me with my come down.  Tylonel PM works wonders as well as Benadryl. ",
      "If I tried doing the amount of cocaine that I had once started with today it would just be the biggest tease ever.  Imagine  being able to smell your favorite food, the craving you get for it as your mouth waters and your heart beats with anticipation.  Today to get me high it usually takes about 1/2 to 1 gram of coke to achieve the max feeling.  I try to stay away from it as much as possible because I know how much I love the feeling of it but somehow my friends and I are still constantly trying to get our hands on it, even if we cant afford it.  It's true that I love cocaine and if I could afford it, I would probably always have a supply on me.  Thankfully I am not an addict though, unlike some of my friends which have fallen into that path. ",
      "In my opinion the worst thing that could happen to a user, is become dependant upon it.  The craving for more almost eats at my insides because the come down creeps up on me.  Over time, experiencing a come down only happens if I've been on yay (coke) for 3 or more days straight.  but sometimes if it's 'nail polish' as my friends and I like to call it (really bad, unpure cocaine). ",
      "After I decided to experiment with coke, everything followed.  We started railing (snorting) oxycodones, black tar (a form of heroin), suboxone, and the most recent for me, crystal meth. ",
      "I have definately done quite a lot of things that I regret, but I would never take it back for the amazing highs of these drugs.  From pills like xanax, valium, and oxy's, to much harder drugs like cocaine, meth, and heroin.",
      "I am so glad that nothing has happened to me over the course of my experiences, but seeing close friends overdose made me take a second look at my life and what I was doing wih it.  I plan on quiting all drugs completely, eventually, but for now I still feel invincible. ",
      "I can feel myself being pulled into the downward spiral little by little as the drugs, especially cocaine, become the main focus of my life.  The more drugs I do, the more numb I feel, and the less I care."

      "This was my first experience with a psychedelic drug, and I choose magic mushrooms because they were reported to be more pleasant and of shorter duration than an LSD trip, and were also freely available.",
      "One summer day back in 2005 I was out in London with my girlfriend at the time and her friend down camden town. This was at a time when Magic mushrooms were totally legal. In camden the hippie district of london I was amazed that more than a dozen people had set up mini stalls openly selling many different strains of mushroom. Come to think of it they were not just selling mushrooms they had everything from fly agaric, san pedro all the way to salvia. Curiosity got the better of me and 2 weeks later I decided to pay a visit to one of these stalls and pick up some mushrooms. I decided as I did not have any past experience with psychedelics I would start with the relatively weak 'Mexican' strain. It came in a tiny transparent plastic case and sold for 10 per 10 gram. When I got home I decided I would dry them out to preserve them for when I was ready to trip. I placed them on a ceramic dish and turned the oven heat to 200degrees for faster drying. I removed them nicely dried from the oven, and saved them for when I was ready to trip which happened to be latter that night.",
      "When it came to 11:00pm I opened my box of partially dried mushrooms which later had became moist and decided to ooze blue liquid. They didn't taste bad at all just like regular mushrooms actually. Waited...waited.... and nothing, 45 minutes passed and no clue to any trip about to begin. That night passed without success so I decided I would go back the following week and purchase the more stronger 'Thai' species. I took these home and followed the same procedure I had done with the Mexicans. Still 45 minutes passed and I went to bed dissatisfied. I was totally gutted that I failed on 2 accounts to trip.",
      "I decided now I would ask an expert what they thought about my high tolerance to mushrooms, and she suggested that it may be because I needed to have a completely empty stomach in order to feel the full force of the trip, and that everyone has a unique chemistry.",
      "'Alright then' I thought. I'm obviously a hardhead when it came to mushrooms so I decided to purchase the 'Hawaiian' which happened to be the strongest mushroom available. I thought this has gotta do it for me. This time I didn't bother to attempt to heat them coz I figured this had been destroying the psilocybin and preventing me from getting a trip.",
      "I read of the importance of 'set&setting' in governing the possible likelihood of a good trip, so I cleaned my room as best I could and had a relaxing bath to relax my mind. At around 12:00am I decided this was the time to begin ingesting my Hawaiians. They were really small and thin compared to the huge mushrooms I had previously encountered at the stalls. They also tasted quite bad as mushrooms go they had a dry texture, the taste of which can only be compared to dirty socks soaked in muddy water. I got through the mushrooms fairly easily however I till had the earthy taste in my mouth. I went to the bathroom to wash out my mouth and saw that the backwash had a blue colour to it. I figured that these were the real deal since psilocybin containing mushroom stain blue when damaged.",
      "Tripping time",
      "30 mins after ingesting the mushrooms I just layed on my bed waiting for the come up. Out of nowhere I felt my self rise up suddenly then return to my original position. I thought 'What just happened? Did I imagine that?' Then the same feeling hit me again this time it was stronger than the last sensation, this is when I thought things are really kicking of now there was no going back. I decided to go with the flow of things and try not to panic if things got too intense. The next clue that my trip was starting was when I looked at a dark patch of my room with some wiring. A shadowy hand stretched out and this made me jump. The visual part of my trip was now starting.",
      "In the darkness of my bedroom static began to form in my visual field, I decided to close my eyes to see if I would get any CEV's and as I did I saw a really faint but definite mosaic of what appeared to look like bacteria. This faint image then formed into a still faint image of clusters of diamonds which shimmered a rainbow of colours. I decided the best thing would be to keep my eyes closed for the duration of the experience and enjoy it. The images began to grow stronger and soon I got lost in these. At first they were colourful 2-dimensional images which I'd describe as pictures which compromised red geometric shapes which morphed into figures which had an Mayan theme to them. Later the closed eye visuals became more and more 3-D as time passed. At first there was an myriad of highly decorated brown rug or curtain like images. An hour and 30 mins into the experience I soared toward the peak where my CEV'S became fully formed images of temples, palaces and other ancient landscapes.",
      "I now felt as though my spirit had completely left my physical body and I was now drifting through ancient rooms decorated beutifully in fine rugs, and vividly coloured ceilings. There were people seated in these rooms who seemed to be partaking in some type of meeting. As I floated across theses rooms I smelt a powerful scent of incense. It smelt so wonderful I felt as though this couldn't possibly be a hallucination.",
      "The people in my visions looked quite cartoony now dat I think of it but they still looked really human. I'm of African descent and this people were African in appearance, tall,wearing long colourful robes and head ties. I was now watching a scene of three tribeswoman enter the doorway of an old temple carrying some type of large flat object. I now saw an image of a tall grey eyed tribeswoman who seemed to be luring my astral form further into the visions as she drew her hand and guided me further into the journey. This woman to me was like some sort of spirit guide as unlike the other people I had seen she appeared to be aware of my prescence. She was dressed elegantly in a purple robe wearing a headress, and it occured to me that she must of been a royal member such as a queen.",
      "3 hours had now passed since I ingested the mushrooms and I was now coming down. The visuals were now growing weaker and were less consistent compared to the peak. At this point I opened my eyes and had a look around my room and reality began to return to me. on first opening my eyes I thought I was lying in an ancient palace and the windows had a distinct eastern look to them. I also perceived a faint image of an open courtyard leading out to some ancient gardens which had a deep red hue to them.",
      "I decided to lay back down and close my eyes to absorb the final part of my journey. At this point the visuals now more resembled dreams. My imagination was still vividly exaggerated to the point that I was having visions of me performing a song on a swanky looking stage complete with neon lights and ladies. 3.5 hours later the visuals had ceased but I still had that stoned feeling you get when the experience is just beginning. This gave me a chance to reflect back to what I had just experienced as I couldn't yet settle down to sleep.",
      "In conclusion, most of the trip was enjoyable even the peak were I thought I was really starting to loose my mind, and couldn't concentrate due to the loud tribal drums being played so loudly in my head. Now that I'm writing this report magic mushrooms are totally illegal in england as a class A drug, so I doubt I will ever be using this again as much as one more trip would have been highly enjoyable. I will just have to experiment with other psychedelics such as salvia or find an appropriate alternative."

      "The pre-ramble:",
      "Though back in my clubbing days, I was no stranger to a smoking a little crystal meth to get a good vibe going, I had never been attracted to speed. Lately I changed my mind, let me make it clear that cannabis has always been a good friend to me, however lately it had been putting me to sleep. I wanted something that made it easier to concentrate not ponder nothing thoughts to come to the conclusion 'well let's smoke another bowl'.",
      "Due to a massive amount of studying demanded in a minimal amount of time, my energy being non-existent and the 'for the hell of it' factor, I decided to buy a gram of speed.",
      "Study date:",
      "The granules were large and had to be chopped into snortable form with a bank card. After a rolled up dollar bill aiding in the snortage of three fat lines. I decided to hit the books.",
      "Political Science, several chapters of. Speed and concentration I found worked very co-operatively together. Listening to music, I bounced up and down (movement was to nice to resist) while I read and made notes. This went on undisturbed for several hours. Stupidly I thought I could crash early (around 3 to get those oh so important hours of rest before the exam). I hadn't planned on staying up all night, but I found myself unable to think of sleeping.",
      "Day 1: another two lines in the morning",
      "Morning came nicely, I sat in bed thinking...trying to meditate...rest the body and still the mind. Which is as close to sleep as I could give myself. No appetite plagued me, tried to eat some protein for the sake of not comming down too harsh when I did.",
      "Snorted a bit more the morning of the exam, and went off thinking 'what a beautiful morning'. And enjoyed a full day, including a lot of physical exertion running about and getting things done like it was my last day on earth. Successful day, that night it was a little hard to get to sleep but when I finally did it was light, and I woke up at 5am the next morning raring at the day.",
      "Day 2: cut off",
      "Running around thinking I could pull another hyper active day without snorting any more (though I had a lot left I cut myself off).",
      "Later that morning I decided that I was flustered and too moody to subject anyone to myself. So I stayed in my PJ's, cancelled all my meetings for that day, and spent the day laying in bed, watching TV, eating a bit, and relaxing. I took a 'come down' day afer a speedy day.",
      "Day 3: 2nd day cut off not winning any congeniality awards",
      "Moody. That just about sums it up. A little bit of concentration problems, wandered away several times while writing this. Snorting some more is tempting, but not being able to sleep at night is not cool unless I have something good to do. Personally I don't think I'd do speed at a party or club. I was too straight, the physical was there, but not in a creative happy way, more in a: this is what you have to do, and this is how you do it way. Robotic and computer like, feelingless. E is so much more sociable and lovey, my drug of choice for going out. Though I am not an agressive person, I felt that on speed I could become hostile.",
      "All in all:",
      "I found it a positive, empowering experience. The energy felt good and gave me the courage I needed to get through. Though the come down is so bumpy, up and down, snapping at people and feeling frustrated. Not nice at all."

      "I am 22 years old, and I am in good physical condition (I practice 2 martial arts and I play soccer as well) The fact of the matter is I thought I had reached a point of invulnerability when it came to alcohol. I would almost mix it with any other drug I was taking at the time because I felt confident I was able to control it. It is also true that I always kept a good relationship with alcohol, meaning I never felt the urge to drink and I would never drink by myself or during the week, period. The truth is though, that my friends and I were real monsters on the weekends. Even when I drank A LOT, I was able to puke and come back into the drinking without feeling the need to pass out. Throughout the years I built up my tolerance to the point that I would drink entire bottles of liquor by myself and make it through the night in pretty decent shape. But let me tell you my friends, this feeling of immortality was an illusion, and I almost paid the price BIG TIME.",
      "The doomed night started at about 8pm. I got to my friend's house and I walk into a shot marathon. It seems one of my friends had just gotten arrested for possession of a controlled substance, and my friends decided the best way to deal with it would be to start pounding vodka shots on his name. We went through a bottle of vodka in 20 minutes on 3 heads. By this time we were feeling tipsy enough to make sloppy decisions such as cracking open a bottle of Jim beam and starting pounding more shots. We killed half the bottle in another 15 minutes (this was a 1.75 litter big momma)",
      "We then decide to go to a bar. Me and one of my friends race with a pretty big Long Island Ice Tea. As soon as we finished (literally as soon as the big glass touched the table) my other friend comes with a round of Liquid Heroin shots. After that my stomach rebelled big time. The time was around 10pm. I got up to go to the bathroom in order to vomit, and the room started spinning brutally. My thoughts were racing in my head and the word 'puke' seemed to echo in my mind. As soon as I hit the bathroom I vomit convulsing violently in the sink (the stall was occupied) I feel a little better to I walk back to our table.",
      "After a few hours my friends and I go back to their apartment with some girls (I had no idea who they were or what their names were) As soon as we hit the apartment I start taking shots with one of the girls (who was morbidly obese by the way, although I didn't seem to care at the time) My friends, the girls and I went through the rest of the Jim Beam and an extra bottle of Absolut. The time was now around 2am. This seemed like a good time to play beer pong. After losing 3 consecutive times with the grotesquely fat lady as my partner I went into the bathroom and I puked for the second time in the night. At this point I felt for the first time that I just might have been losing control over the situation. I lost sense of time while sitting by the toilet bowl, and I remember being worried about my hands shaking too much. When I left the bathroom it was almost 3am according to the stove digital clock.",
      "All the drunk retards applauded my return to the party, and although it was my intention to pass out, they managed to persuade me to stay up. I would say half an hour later I was doing peach cagna shots (this is a 48% alcohol drink by the way) This is when memory becomes blurry. I remember taking at least 2 shots of cagna. My friend told me the next day that he saw me at some point dancing with the bottle of cagna in my hand. There was an Absolut loss of sensitivity at this point. I remember punching my own thigh just to check if I still had it. I apparently got into a fight at some point as well with one of my good friends (I woke up the next day with a lump on my forehead and an injured knuckle) So far this felt like a REALLY bad drunk episode, but little did I know that chaos was still to come.",
      "For some reason we all decide to go for a walk, but not without first eating a slice of watermelon spiked with Everclear (for those of you not familiar with this wonderful beverage, it's 97% alcohol and it's banned from certain states) This is when it all went seriously wrong. I absolutely had no control of myself and I only remember bits and pieces of what I did from then on. I will now tell what I did according to my friends.",
      "It seems I started getting very violent with one of the girls and one of my friends had to pull me off of her and take me for a walk. All of the sudden I sprint across the street and I jump on top of a stray dog that was feeding on garbage. Then after laying on the sidewalk for 10 minutes I get up and I punch my friend in the face (and fall in the process, hitting my head against the concrete) Apparently my friend (a true saint) dragged me back to the apartment.",
      "I remember vomiting very violently for a long time. It seemed it was never going to stop. As I'm puking I start crying for no reason and my knees give in and I fall by the toilet. I must have stayed there for an hour at least until I managed to sit up once more and puke. That when bile and blood started coming out. All I know is I woke up the next morning on a bed with a severe bitter taste in my mouth. It seems I started puking blood because in the process of violently sticking my fingers down my throat I managed to seriously hurt it. My friends carried me to a bed at around 6:30am.",
      "I would say this was one of the worst experiences of my life. I've been in K holes and bad acid trips and let me tell you, they were nothing compared to this nightmare. Granted there was no psychological problems... but I did think I was going to die that night, I thought my body was giving up on me forever.",
      "Since then I have not touched a single alcoholic beverage. Whenever I want to relax with my friends I just smoke a bowl and I tend to stay very still and just listen to music. I don't think I'll be drinking for a LONG time, and I will definitely not get wasted like that ever again. All I have to say is... don't underestimate alcohol just because is socially accepted. It is a VERY potent drug and it can actually KILL you."

      "I remember the taste of nothing. The seeds I had chosen from the hardware store had no labels letting on that they had been treated, so I took them as such. I noticed no chemical flavor. They tasted like nothing at all. In fact, I added ground salt for just a pinch of spice.",
      "After an hour and a half or so, the trip started coming on very hard. I was vacillating between the den inside and the back yard, partly because I was unsure what was happening to me. I had only one mushroom trip to my experience. I would find that I was completely unprepared for what would happen next.",
      "At the onset of the trip, at first, colors took on an aural sheen to their periphery. I remember staring at a brass sun wall decoration and seeing the diminishing daylight ricochet, refract and split into rainbows in the area directly in front of me. Following this, aural hallucinations began to creep from behind me to filling my mind with cackles and laughs. As the sun set outside, I began to see imaginary lines of my reality shoot out in front of me and vanish into perspective. From their extensions beyond me, the lines I saw began to bend until they broke. At the epicenter of their union, what I thought looked like a portal opened up. From the tear in my imaginary sky, demons, the ultimate source of the laughter, fell into my plane. Needless to say, this freaked me out beyond words and I decided it would be for the best if I went back inside.",
      "My thought processes slowed down. I could not operate a remote control to turn on my television. My brain felt stupid. My inner voice was gone, replaced with an overwhelming static and my thoughts came slowly. When my dad asked me how I was feeling, I could not answer him. I had no words. I was beginning to lose my mind.",
      "I remember watching the television and changing the channels non-stop. In my brain, I could not focus on a single point of thought. There was a violent ebbing of feeling in my mind. I began to fixate on the words from that seminal masterpiece of writing, A Scanner Darkly: There are no weekend warriors on the D. Youre either on it, or you havent tried it. Paranoia took hold. I knew this was only going to end badly.",
      "I curled into a ball on the floor. In my mind, I was convinced that instead of taking a simple seed, I had instead taken Substance D, from the movie. I remember going through my house but I did not feel like I was moving. I can not remember any physical sensation, actually. I informed my dad, watching TV in another part of the house, that I had taken Substance D and, having done that, began to cry. My mother took me to the emergency room not long after she found out.",
      "I remember lying in the back of the car with my eyes closed. I remember the voices of my mother and my aunt but I can not recall their conversation. In my mind, other happenings took precedence. I imagined that the sum of my high school anti-drug education was subliminal messaging that these seeds, my Substance D, were going to fry my brain. I saw myself (impossibly, but remember that Im out of my mind right now) retching on the seats. I saw myself as a vegetable at the conclusion of my trip, due to my fixation on the movie. I expected to be in a waking coma, extensively brain damaged and permanently retarded. My brain felt like it was on fire.",
      "I was almost to the hospital when the demon appeared. He told me, baritone and emotionlessly, that the car ride I was on was actually my death and I was now on my way to hell. Perhaps now my sheer panic is evident as the car door opened and I was escorted into the emergency intake ward at the hospital. Much like in A Scanner Darkly, peoples faces (especially the doctors) were oblique and cartoon-like. I remember trying to explain why I took the seeds, but to no avail. I wanted to say that I felt inspired by my favorite authors: Allen Ginsberg, Philip K. Dick, Burroughs, and Hunter S. Thompson all had their flings back in the day, experimenting and trying to revel in new consciousness but no words came. I felt ashamed. I felt busted.",
      "The trip was beginning to subside in intensity, but I would feel its effects on my brain, especially the paranoia and feeling of injury, throughout the night. Sleep did not comemy brain still was revving high and hotly. The entire night, I feared I had caused permanent damage to myself. My consciousness waned and for a few minutes, I was asleep.",
      "The next day dragged on harshly. My mother dictated directions to me, but my brain was still recoiling in horror from the previous night of hell. I had no short-term memory. I had no memory at all. Words would not come and my conversations were short and terminal. I was convinced at this point that I was brain damaged. As the day progressed and I attempted to rest more, I started to feel better. By the end of evening I was able to eat solid food again, but just barely.",
      "It has been over a month since my tragic miscalculation of dosage. I am back up at my university and I am still attending my classes. To my overwhelming joy, I have suffered no lasting ill effects. I realize now how much substance I actually took in, and I feel like I lucked out. I can not imagine how my trip could have been worse. Besides the terror, my family found out about this particular drug habit. But I am glad that my suffering was negligible. I have sworn off psychoactive drugs and everything except marijuana for my future. I even plan to kick the green eventually.",
      "Never, EVER do what I did. A crash dose of LSA will likely give voices to inner demons you were previously aware of. I included many of my hallucinations but its not nearly all of them. The paranoia alone is unsettling and bending. Know from this story that horrible things happen when one loses all touch with reality. I have a new respect for those seeds (producing those little blue flowersget it now?) and how they made me insane, for a day."

The next day at school I took just 2 medium sized, almost completely red leaves with just a bit of light whitish-green around the outside. They were very beautiful looking. I rolled them up and carefully stuck them in my backpack for when I got home.",
      "I took a couple fairly big leaves just so I could see if there were any effects at all before I went smoking large amounts.",
      "When I got home I broke the leaves up into pieces so they could be dried. I took an oil incense burner and took the bowl off the top and replaced it with a sheet of tinfoil (tea candle underneath, tin foil held up about 3 inches from the candle. I put the pieces on the tin foil, rotating them every once and a while. Once all the pieces were dried out I put them into a container for about an hour until I was ready to smoke it.",
      "When I was ready I rolled an L-Pape style joint out of it which came out to what would have been a NICE sized cone for a one person marijuana session that would get me pretty high.",
      "I proceeded to smoke the joint. After the first few pulls I noticed that my heart felt like it was going to explode out of my chest. It wasnt racing, just felt like it was beating REALLY hard. It kind of scared me because I'm a big guy and I was worried about a heart problem. I quickly calmed myself down and watched my chest vibrate as I finished the joint.",
      "At first I was kind of disappointed because I didn't think it was working. If anything I had a slight contact high like one feels when being around a lot of stoned people.",
      "The next little while was strange... after about 5-10 minutes while I was reading something my vision went a bit blurry, like when one looks at a computer screen for a really long time, but I had only been looking at it for a little while cuz before hand I was busy with my coleus smoking. Upon looking around my room I noticed that it wouldnt go away.",
      "At this point I was excited because it was starting to kick in. After the next 10-15 minutes I started to feel extremely happy, and my body was all FUZZY (thats the only way to describe it). All I could do was smile, and the whole time I felt like laughing, but I couldnt. I just had that pressure feeling in my throat like when Im about to laugh. on top of that, EVERYTHING had an aura (a glowing color around the object), and everything had a different one. And to my eyes, my skin looked blue and green around the edges of my limbs.",
      "After the effects set in I decided it was a good time to watch Beavis & Butthead and enjoy my high. While watching this, the effects kicked in even more. my computer screen started to warp, and shift around as if it were but a puff of smoke. not to mention I couldnt focus on anything, and when I tried I'd zone out and go cross eyed, but the main thing (usually beavis/buttheads face) was clear as day. At some point I called my friend, it made me realize how messed up I was I was talking like I had just smoked a blunt to my face.",
      "The high lasted for a good couple hours, fading out slowly. But the annoying blurry vision stayed for a while. All in all it was a really fun experience."

      "Preparations: I spent two days fasting and meditating to clear my head of a lot of mental baggage.",
      "9:00 pm: I dosed my first hit in the break room of my job, it is about half an hour before work is over. I cleaned up and sat on the steps waiting for the store to close down. The acid was just starting to have its preliminary effects when I left the store about 1/2 hour later.",
      "T+1 hour: I felt 'out there' but not fully tripping, I decided to take a walk up  to an apartment that my two friends live in. We go for a walk to the wharf to smoke a blunt and the sights, sounds, and smells of the city are nearly overwhelming to my acid-addled senses. I find the urban environment is very provocative when I am tripping... there are so many stimuli I can easily become lost. The walk back seems very surreal, we had a conversation with a man walking his dog and I couldn't tell if the dog was real or imaginary.",
      "T+4.5 hours: I take another hit of liquid. At this point I noticed a peculiar feeling of being a 'pilot in a ship.' That is my mind and body seemed to be separate, I had a sensation of existing within my body rather than it being a part of me. This is not the first time I've noticed this effect, a very dramatic demonstration of the mind/body interface.",
      "T+8 hours: I leave an apartment with friends after smoking heavily for several hours. My psychedelic effects are at their most intense, everywhere I look I can see rainbow auras shifting and glimmering. We decided to do a walking tour of Boston and set off to explore. We took a path leading through Beacon Hill's historic architecture down Commonwealth Avenue towards the campus of Northeastern. Along the way we admired huge glistening skyscrapers, temples, churches, and all the other idiosynchratic architecture of Boston. I felt my mind was primed to appreciate beauty in its rawest forms. The early morning breeze was extremely refreshing and as the sky began to gradually get lighter all the birds began to chirp. This feeling of nature awakening from slumber filled me with a good feeling, I reflected that after a tough New England winter the glories of spring were nearly upon us. At this point my mind turned inward and the rest of the trip I walked in silence contemplating the simple pleasures of life. I began to go over elements of my life and sifted through what is important to me. It was then that it dawned on me how my life is oriented and grounded through the relationship I built with my girlfriend. This filled me with an intensely pleasurable feeling of peace, serenity, and love. The world seemed to beam with an inner light, everything seemed wonderful.",
      "T+10 hours: I returned to my building with my friends and we went to watch 'Caddyshack.' The movie was simply hilarious. I mean, it's a funny movie but the whole vibe of the acid was so overwhelmingly positive it just seemed like everything was extra enjoyable.",
      "T+12.5 hours: I crawled into bed and took out 'Obedience to Authority' which is a psychology book about an experiment conducted by Dr. Stanley Miligram at Yale. I felt like my mind was devouring the information and encoding it into my brain with ease.",
      "T+16 hours: I awoke from a doze to find myself still lightly tripping. There was a slight feeling of things being just different. My carpet continued to have shifting patterns but otherwise there was no more visual element to what had been a decidedly visual trip. After eating a light lunch of salad I felt very good. My mindset was extremely relaxed and upbeat, and all the overwhelming problems from prior to the trip took a new and less dramatic perspective. The trip gave me a chance to really prioritize and think about what makes me happy. I felt it was an excellent introspective journey, as well as giving me astounding visuals at some points, and a greatly enhanced appreciation for the city around me.",
      "Well, the effects have more or less completely subsided now at 3:45 the next day. I still have slight distortions in my visual field when I unfocus my eyes, but they are diminishing. This trip was a rare treat and I only wish most of mine could be so wonderful. I've never had a bad trip, but then again I don't always have SPECTACULAR trips like this one either."

      "The first time I experienced this drug was at a friends house with a whole gang of people. I and about 8 other people took the same amount by snorting it. Let me tell you straight off, this stuff has probably the worst drip I have ever experienced.",
      "After about 20 minutes or so pupils started to dilate and hearts began to race. Some experienced nausea but only 1 or 2 actually vomited. However shortly after experiencing this everyone began to experience the trip.",
      "In my personal experience I snorted 25 milligrams and waited about 25 minutes when I started feeling the nausea. This was however light and didn't effect me much. When I started feeling it though I had no clue what I was in for. I started experiencing a strong visual trip at first. Geographic patters and just about anything else that popped into my head bounced around in the darkness. It seems the best place I found to sit was a corner piled with soft pillows. This makes you feel amazing.",
      "I soon found myself alone in front of a computer on the game WoW, underwater with my character for about an hour just watching the waves surround me. Once that faded though, I started feeling very hyper and felt an extreme happiness. Overall this took about 6 hours for the drug to run its coarse but in the end I felt no side effects whatsoever.",
      "Seconds Anyone?.......................................",
      "The Second time was probably just as if not more interesting as the last. This time I had 30 milligrams. I had received this batch with a few friends, and when we took it we decided to go our separate ways for the night. Seeing as how we'd already experienced it and now knew we could handle ourselves in an open environment. \r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "I took this and went home for a good hour as it was kicking in. Yet instead of what I experienced before with the visual trip, this was making me think about a million things at once. Then, searching the web and looking at far off places just made me more and more optimistic and energetic. I soon found myself in my car driving around feeling like I was on top of the world. Almost as if I had just won the lottery and all my problems in my social life just ceased to be. Its really unexplainable except to say it was similar to ecstasy but a bit more of an intense feeling to become something bigger. The entire trip only lasted about 4 hours but I will remember it forever.",
      "Third Times a Charm....................................",
      "This wasn't the last time I took Ace but it was the last time I had gotten a hold of a solid batch. It was Halloween and a party ensued. I and 5 others took it. This time I had an upped dose of 35-37 milligrams, and was smoking marijuana and had been drinking moderately.",
      "This started off as the others with the nausea and heavy heart beating. This time though, it was a mixture of a visual trip and a thinking trip. The night had its ups and downs but in all was pretty fun, but unmemorable at times as I somewhat blanked out on occasion. This probably was caused by the alcohol, but I can't be 100% sure. I ended up falling asleep during hour 4 or so, but continued to see things in my sleep. When I awoke, my friend was ready to go home and I went with him. At this point I felt a lesser version of my second trip, including a warm and fuzzy feeling. This trip was in all about 6-8 hours long."

    "report": [
      "After scouring all available resources, I have realized that while millions of people have experimented with mescaline found in San Pedro and Peyote cacti, there is little to no information on the cactus trichocereus bridgesii, a cactus as equally abundant and possibly more mescaline laden than it's famous sister, San Pedro.  In his book Psychedelic Shamanism, Jim DeKorne suggests 3 different preparations for San Pedro: the ingestion of a dried powder form, the boiling of the cactus into a tea, and the preparation of a spagyric tincture.",
      "For the sake of expediency and ease, I choose to go with the dry powder form, substituting t. bridgesii for t. pachanoi (San Pedro).  The two of us, P and myself, each purchased our own 12 inch cuttings of t. bridgesii and returned to our respective abodes to prepare.  Rather than bothering to de-spine my cutting, I decided to chop it as one would a carrot or green onion, and then went back and cut these star-shaped pieces into smaller chunks.  These chunks were placed in the freezer overnight and thawed the next day in order to aide in the breaking down of the cactus's cell wall.  Although probably not necessary, I repeated the process of freezing and thawing another 2 nights.  Next, the now slimy chunks were placed in a blender a handful at a time and blended on liquify until a light green slime that reminded me of avocado frosting was achieved.  This part was particularly painstaking, owing to the ancient blender I was using.  Ideally a high quality food processor would have ben employed.",
      "At this point, P and I decided to combine our efforts, due to the fact that I own a dehydrator.  Next, the sludge was placed in a food dehydrator and dehydrated at around 130 degrees Fahrenheit for around 24 hours.  Had I not had access to a dehydrator, the next option would have been to place the sludge on sheets of plastic wrap in a well-ventilated room in direct sunlight for a few days until it was completely dry.  Once it has dried, the slime takes on a light brown to yellow coloring and looks a bit like dried cannabis sativa when bits are broken off of it.  Some areas, where the substance had been piled thicker on the dehydrator, were a much darker brown and looked almost burned.  The sheets of dried cacti were then easily broken into chunks that I placed in a well-cleaned and dried coffee grinder in order to form a powder.",
      "Our 24 inches of trichocereus bridgesii had now been reduced to about 105 grams (3.75 oz) of powder.  Owing to clumsiness along the way, I believe we probably lost upwards or 10 grams of material to carelessness (dropped raw material, spilled slime, and scattered powder).",
      "At this point we got a little experimental with the preparation.  After attempting to make a drink using the powder and water and realizing the resulting mixture was perhaps the most ungodly bitter taste known to man (worse than ayahuuasca in my opinion), we took the entirety of our powder and mixed it into a large jug of lemonade.  The lemonade made the drink slightly more bearable and theoretically the acids should help pull the alkaloids out of the powder, making it more potent.",
      "I managed to drink somewhere between 2 or 3 cups of our bridgesii-lemonade and after about 2 hours of disappointed waiting decide the mixture was bunk, smoked a bowl of cannabis sativa, and went to bed maybe 30 minutes later.  No sooner had I turned off the lights and laid down, I began to trip harder than I had ever tripped to date.  I could see someone/something moving inside of my ceiling, causing it to bulge and morph and saw technicolor flashes of light.  I seem to remember one or two occasions when I was convinced there were demons in my room and refused to open my eyes lest I see them, but it's hard to tell how much of this was happening consciously and how much was subconsciously created.",
      "To be honest, my body was exhausted but my mind couldn't possibly go to sleep, putting me into a hellish limbo of half-dream hallucinations and severe disorientation to the point that I would forget that I wasn't actually standing up but in fact laying in my bed.  Had I been better prepared, I believe that this drink could have provided me with a great journey into Inner-space, but at the time I was exhausted and even more naive than I am now when it comes to that sort of exploration and utilizing such a great learning opportunity."

      "It was a Monday night in February, President's Day to be exact.  I had had an interestingly intense weekend so far, so I was looking forward to maybe staying in for the night and getting some sleep.  The night before, I had stayed up late doing DXM with my friend S, and I was considerably wiped out from the experience.  Even so, when my friend E called and invited me to a small get-together at her house, I decided that there would be little harm in going.  After all, I had spent the day napping and was feeling fresh and fine by the time she called.  So I made my way to her house, made introductions, and had a couple glasses of wine.  So far, it seemed to be just another little party in my little college town.",
      "I began talking to J and T, two acquaintances of mine, about my strange experience with DXM the night before, its closed-eye visuals, time distortion, and what not.  They asked if I liked it and I told them I did, and at this J asked if I had ever done mushrooms before.  I told him no, but Ive been curious about it for quite some time.  He grinned at this, said he had about 1/8th of mushrooms left at his house, and offered to trip-sit for me if I was up for it.  I instantly told him that I was, and as the party wound down, J, T, and I left and started walking the blocks to his apartment.",
      "In retrospect, this may not have been the best idea.  It had been a long weekend, I was tired, slightly tipsy from the wine, and a bit burnt out from the drugs I had been doing all weekend.  Even as I considered these things, something in my gut told me that if I didnt do it now while the opportunity presented itself, Id lose my nerve and miss out on the experience altogether.  So I decided to go through with it.",
      "When we got to Js place, he went to his room and brought back a bag of wrinkly, dried mushrooms with blue bruises on them.  It turns out theres a little bit more than an eighth, so the rest of it can go to you, he said to T.  T had said earlier that he didnt really like the mushroom trip, but hed go for it anyway.  After T had eaten a couple stems, he passed the bag to me, and I began to eat.  Even though mushrooms are one of my favorite foods, I expected these to taste horrible.  I had heard from many people that they do, so I was surprised to find that I actually liked the taste of them.  Similar to shitake, but with a slightly bitter yet not unpleasant aftertaste.  They would easily go well in a risotto or on a pizza.  But I digress.  As I ate, J and T called a friend to acquire some weed, and we began the walk to his apartment.  As we walked there, J told me about the first time he did mushrooms, how beautiful the experience was, and how much I would enjoy it.  I smiled, said I was nervous but excited, and waited anxiously for the effects to kick in.  We arrived at Xs house, were invited in, and sat down to smoke and talk.",
      "The time passed by, and I started feeling odd, like my cheeks were colder than normal.  I took this to mean that the trip was coming on, and I was about to see exactly what these little fungi could do.  I stopped participating in the conversation and started focusing my attention on different things around the room, the hardwood floors, the posters and tapestries on the walls, and the brightly colored couches my friends and I were sitting on.  Things didnt seem to be too different, but my body was telling me that something was definitely about to happen.  A few minutes went by, and my eyes started itching.  I rubbed them for a few seconds, and noticed that as my hand fell away from my face it had a trail behind it, as if I was waving it in front of a computer screen.  I felt my eyes open wide, and I waved my hand in front of my face for a few seconds, and noticed that J was looking at me and grinning.  He gave me the thumbs up and continued his conversation with the other guys there.  I began looking around again and noticed that the bright, multicolored couch I was sitting on was breathing.  I was both amazed and ecstatic, and couldnt wait to go out into the night to explore.  J, T and I soon left to do just that.",
      "As we walked into the night, J exclaimed, Welcome to the real world! and I looked around.  The naked branches of the trees were splitting off into infinite fractal patterns, fading to normal, and doing it all over again.  Evergreen shrubs that looked softer than cats seemed to wave to me.  Cracks in the sidewalk looked infinitely deep and complex.  The streetlights were beautiful beacons in the night.  I was filled with an overwhelming sense of wonder and amazement unlike anything Id ever felt before.",
      "Its like Ive stepped into a dream. I said quietly.",
      "You have stepped into a dream! said T.  Lets check this dream out!",
      "We began walking around, moving closer and closer to the college campus.  I passed a brick building and pulled bricks out, watching them slide back into the building.  I saw a plastic bag floating in the wind and laughed hysterically.  Trees seemed to be made up of thousands of little creatures as the textures of the bark took on an almost human appearance.  I swung from trees, giddy as a child on a new playground, and ran around as the dream world got more and more intense.  After a while, J suggested we go to the store.  I was a little apprehensive, but he said that it would give me some great insights.  So I agreed.",
      "As we made our way into a grocery store, I began to feel more and more tense.  I looked around the store, wondering why people would ever go to these garish, ugly, unnatural things to get food.  As J bought an orange, I looked at the magazines on the counter in amused disgust.  Everything looked so fake.  I couldnt help but feel sorry for people who had never experienced something as real as camping in the wilderness, people who lived vicariously through magazines, through TV, through the internet, without ever actually experiencing life.  We left the store and walked along the river, and I couldnt stop talking to my two companions about how I never wanted to be satisfied with living vicariously through the media ever again.  They agreed as we walked along the river that passes through our town.",
      "Eventually, our exploring had to end.  T said he was very tired, and I agreed.  I was getting cold from walking around outside so much, and since we were close to my apartment, I decided it would be best if I retired to my room to ponder life and go through the rest of this trip alone.  I thanked J for the wonderful time and headed home.  I was quite happy.",
      "As I opened my door, however, my happiness soon changed to anxiety.  I hadnt cleaned the apartment in a long time, and my roommate never cleans the apartment at all, so the place was absolutely filthy.  I made my way to my room, trying to ignore how anxious I was about the state of the apartment and how much I resented my roommate for not doing his part to keep the place clean.  As I got to my room, however, these feelings only increased, my room was in a sorry condition as well.  My laundry was all over the floor, there was garbage scattered around.  Add to that that it was about time to change the litter in my rats cage, and my room seemed like a wasteland.  I decided I couldnt change the cage in the state I was in.  Even though it was 2 hours after I had eaten the mushrooms, I was still coming up.  I did however change the water in the cage and let the rats out so that they could play for a while.",
      "I dont know if it was because I hadnt changed the cage in a while or if I felt guilty about not playing with them as much as I used to, but the rats looked extremely sickly and skeletal.  It was about this time that my anxiety turned to a throbbing fear.  After changing the water, I put them back in the cage and tried to calm myself down, telling myself that I was on a drug, that I had nothing to worry about.  I had taken off my shirt in an effort to get more comfortable.  However, I began to look at my skin and I was horrified, it was pulsating from normal to a sick, withered, wrinkly state much like the skin of a raisin.  I decided to go to the bathroom, relieve myself, and go straight to bed.  I was peaking pretty hard right about then, and when I went into the bathroom, I caught sight of myself in the mirror.  I looked as unhealthy and skeletal as my rats had earlier, and my pupils seemed to take up the entire space of my eyes.  I looked strung out and, even worse, completely insane.  And thats when I went from being afraid to being terrified.",
      "I needed to get out of that apartment, back into the natural wonderland that I had experienced earlier.  So I threw on some warm clothes and made it outside again.  But the beckoning trees that once looked inviting now looked threatening.  The wind spoke an endless stream of rapid-fire nonsense syllables as it blew.  I decided that I needed to face the apartment or I would surely die in this wilderness.",
      "I went back inside, turning off all the lights as I went, not wanting to see the chaos and mess that was my own life.  I crawled into bed, nearly sobbing with fear, and closed my eyes, hoping for it to end soon.  After my eyes were shut, I was flooded with rainbow-colored visions.  Sometimes I would see animals that looked like they were drawn by ancient people on cave walls.  I felt myself spreading out, and I knew then that I was going to experience ego death.  For some reason, this one small though brought me out of fear, and I felt more calm and comfortable than I ever have on any sedative.",
      "I laughed at myself and the hilarity of my fear, but knew that the mushrooms had taught me something valuable: I needed to clean up my life.  Not just my apartment, but many other aspects of my life as well.  I need to take care of things that needed to be done without putting them off until they became overwhelming, and I needed to take better care of myself.  With this thought, I felt myself slip away and become one with everything, my rats, my roommate, the trees outside, fear, wonder, and everything in between.  Then I fell asleep.",
      "The next day I woke up and immediately cleaned my room and started working on the rest of the apartment.  I didnt talk to many people that day, only when I picked up my car from Es house, and didnt speak once of my experience.  I reflected on how beautiful the world really is, even without fractal visuals and beckoning trees.  I realized that even though the mushrooms brought me to a level of terror that Id only experienced during the most intense of panic attacks, they had shown me much, and taught me to look at the world with wonder.  I will definitely consult these fungi again, but next time will be done with more preparation and appreciation for what they can show me."

      "A BRIEF BACKGROUND:)",
      "Well to start I am 20 years old. At the age of 13 I experimented with marijuana and became a pot head. By the time I was 14 I did ecstasy about a dozen times and 1.7 grams of mushrooms. (Over a spread out time of course)  When I was 15 I was sent to a rehab for a year. After completion I stayed clean till I was about 18. I began drinking after 3 years of completely being clean of drugs and alcohol. I never became addicted to alcohol like I did marijuana. Anyway I wanted to do mushrooms once again, finally at the age of twenty I got my hands on them and decided to take them with a friend.",
      "MY PRESENT LIFE ON THE NIGHT OF MUSHROOMS:",
      "A couple months ago (from the night I took mushrooms) I broke up with my girlfriend because of my personal reasons. I stopped hanging out with most of my friends because of my differences with them. I was upset by this. I tried to talk to my ",
      "x-girlfriend in person. My girlfriend said she would meet me in person to talk. We spoke and it didnt go well for me. I drove home from her house SLIGHTY upset. Not to mention that I was reunited with my old friends and I was having a tough time with all this.",
      "(THIS WAS THE SAME DAY THAT I TOOK MUSHROOMS, THOUGH I DIDNT KNOW I WAS GONNA BE TRIPPING THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I GOT THE SHROOMZ LAST MINUTE//sry for caps)",
      "THE GOOD STUFF:) ///the trip on January 3rd 2007",
      "Now the reason you heard my sappy personal life is to see HOW THE PRESENT SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE CAN AFFECT YOUR MUSHROOM TRIP. About 5 days before I took the mushrooms I called my friend up and told him to find me some shrooms. He was unsuccessful.until he calls me up on the night of 1/3/07 and says he has some caps and stems for me.  I buy a quarter ounce and split it with a friend who is a first-timer. I only knew I was gonna be eating mushrooms about an hour before I ate them. I didnt have a day to mentally prepare myself. The first time I did shrooms which was 5 years ago, I ate a half 1/8 and had a nice pleasant mild trip. Anyway We decided to eat a whole 1/8 each. I had a sore throat and didnt eat anything but a PB and J at 3:00 pm that day.. I ate the shrooms straight at 9:00pm, on a very empty stomach. I was not gonna let a sore throat stop me from tripping. We walked out to the woods by my friends backyard and sat around a fire. My other friend who was straight edge was there to see the trip we were about to have. At 9:15  my legs were tingling up. My eyes were dilated and the porch lights began to look very bright and had trails. I honestly wondered if they were always that bright or if it was the shroomz. I was loving it. I had a huge smirk on my face and I couldnt  wipe it off. THEY HIT QUICK",
      "Eventually my friends mom walked to our wooded area behind the house (a mother Ok with son and sons friends on shroomz, isnt she great!). She asked me how was your visit with your ex-girlfriend , suddenly my friend asked me you saw your ex-girlfriend today He was very surprised because he knew of our troubles. I felt as if they were analyzing me and they all knew of the rejection I faced from my ex-girlfriend. THEY WERE ALL JUDGING ME I THOUGHT THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. I knew I was feeling it now. They went back in the house and I felt better. At 9:40 my friends and I proceeded to grab some soda and water from the house and grab some logs for the fire. By this point I really felt the shroomz. I felt great, I walked in the house grabbed some water and the lights in the house were extremely bright. Then at like 9:50 we all walked back outside and I was looking at the full moon. I thought it was beautiful, I was trying to walk around and look at the moon from a different angle. .",
      "After a couple of minutes of doing this I realized it was impossible. I then laughed at myself and realized how much fun I was having. (My friend who was tripping with me ate his at the same exact time but he seemed to have a nice mild trip) We eventually grabbed some logs and we got lost for about a minute in the small woods we were oh-so familiar with. I thought it was hilarious. By now Im feeling euphoria and everything looks so vibrant with all lights looking bright. 10:00 , now Im getting a little restless and the shroomz start really kicking in. I insist that we go back in the house. We did so and as I went in side, I looked at a hardwood floor and the grains in the wooden floor seemed to be rising up from it. I was like holy shit. While looking in the mirror I saw a beauty mark on my face and it began to move around on my face. My face also looked very lizard like almost like it had scales. My friend noticed this too. I was laughing hysterically and panicking all with in minutes. My clean friend said that it looked like I was having fun, but was feeling something completely different on the inside. He was completely right.",
      "I kept pacing around the house like a lost puppy. 10:40, I am sitting in my friends living room with my two friends (one-tripping and one not) and his mother and sister. They had fun bugging us out by saying completely random things. They brought up the subject of  my ex-girlfriend. That made me uncomfortable and I almost called her up ready to completely breakdown to her on the phone. I stopped myself, we were listening to the song little red riding hood by the rolling stones. I found it very scary. 11:00. I am now bugging out of my mind at this point and everyone can see. Races of thoughts were running through my mind and I dont even remember what I was thinking. I remember that it seemed like 45 minutes where I was very panicked and I dont know what about. I know this was my peak because I remember feeling fucked up and then the next thing I know I came down A LOT. 12:30, my face again looks normal and the grains in the wooden floor were not coming up out of the floor. My other friend still maintained a nice mild mellow LONGER trip than mine. I guess he ate a normal amount of food that day. My guess is the mushrooms burned right up in my stomach and thats why my trip ended after 3.5 hours.",
      "I laid down and just rested only to throw up at like 2:00 in the morning. The next day I just took it easy. Mushrooms are fun but really shouldnt be taken when something significant is going on in your life. Death of a family member, illness in the family, break up. You get the idea. Mushrooms arent like most drugs that will numb your emotions. Mushrooms will make you stare your emotions right in the face.",

      "I dropped my first two tabs right as my mom was going out. I held them in my mouth and sucked on them for a few delicate moments. They didnt taste like anything, just like paper. I waited and I waited for effects, but didnt feel any. I felt a bit happy though. About an hour after dropping the acid I saw these little yellow bubbles on the wall, nothing pronounced, just moving patterns. It was pretty, but not very strong. I dropped two more tabs. It felt like I was dreaming. I was laughing alot and just felt good all over.",
      "About 15 minutes after dropping the other 2 tabs I looked over at this painting of two sailboats on the wall. I was in the living room on the couch. they seemed like they were melting, like the water was blending together, like it was all just merging. It wasnt truly hitting yet. When it hits, I discovered, you just know. I kept staring at the picture trying to see, something.",
      "Then it hit. It hit me so fast and I wasnt truly ready for it. My mom had been home for a while and was upstairs asleep. I looked around the room. Everything had changed. My world had changed. The way sound traveled had changed. The way light moved changed. My world was turned upside down. I felt like I had reached something I could never recover from. It was completely black, with no steps back to reality. I was more scared then I had ever been in my life. But I realized I was on drugs, and that I would be fine in a few hours. I wanted to run upstairs to the arms of my mother, to be close to her. and im a 17 year old boy. We just dont do that.",
      "I tried to calm down. I laid on the couch and hid my head in the pillows. If I had a benzo I would have taken it right then and stopped the trip. I laid there. I heard all these loud noises from upstairs. Like someone was moving things or breaking things or some shit. It was very odd. I was wondering what the fuck was going on up there. But I didnt move. I felt like those pillows were a bottomless pit. I felt all different sensations on my hands. I was feeling textures and fabrics that werent there, and the sound on the tv sounded so weird. I sat up. It was almost hard to move. I didnt feel like moving at all, yet I really wanted to. I pulled up my shirt and touched my chest. I felt like an alien. I was cold, I felt lifeless. I decided to walk around, outside and smoke a cigarette. I was just standing there next to the box I keep my cigs in for a long time.",
      "I put on my shoes and walked outside. I felt like all I needed to do was protect myself. Anything to care for my body. I wondered if I was gonna be ok. I tasted the cigarette. It didnt taste like smoke at all, just clean air. I continued on my walk and realized that no matter what was gonna happen that night, I still had people who loved me and they would love me no matter what. Love was the most important thing in the world. I looked up at the stars through the trees and they had never looked so brilliant. They were beautiful colors too. I thought if I stared at them too long I might fall into them so I looked away.",
      "I wondered why everything I did was to hurt my loved ones. I then went into the bathroom and the wallpaper produced moving patterns. I was very intoxicated. I didnt want to have sex like I usually do, just hug and be close to someone. The shower curtain morphed into a Victorian dress. I then went to my room to try and sleep. I could hear the cat rolling around on the floor, and the faraway ocean purring and the waves crashing right in my room. I could never hear the ocean like that before. Then I went into my moms room and slept next to her.",
      "Acid can be beautiful, I know it."

I was really looking forward to the hallucinaginic properties it was supposed to have, so we went to Walmart and bought a couple of containers of nutmeg.  They were about 2 ounces each and cost a just a few bucks.  Then we went to get some food.",
      "4:00 pm",
      "My friend got a soda and went to a bathroom stall with it and his container of nutmeg to attempt to ingest some.  After I finish my food I proceed to the bathroom to see how he's doin' only to find him nearly gagging with a mouthfull of the stuff.  We switched places.  He took a break and went back out to sit down and it was then my turn.  I took of the lid, tipped it back and filled up my mouth and chased it down with some SoBe.  It was fucking disgusting.  I figure I ended up eating about half of what I had (about 1 ounce or 28 grams) when I decided to quit.  It was just too awful.  My friend was not so successful in trying to choke it down.  He gagged a time or two and ended up spitting some of it back up before eventually throwing the rest of his container in the trash.  I figure that he ate about 3/4 of an ounce or so.  Then we went to his house.",
      "4:30 pm",
      "I still had half of my container left so then we decided to make tea out of the rest of it.  We were really determined to feel what the effects were, so went weren't ready to quit.  The remaining ounce or so made two cups of potent nutmeg tea.  My friend had a slightly bigger cup since he hadn't eaten so much earlier.  He said it tasted kinda good, but I thought it tasted like shit.  It reminded me of having to choke that stuff down and made me sick to think about it.  After we drank it all my friend had to go to work so I left.",

      "9:30 pm",
      "I woke of with extreme paranoia.  I was feeling REALLY sick and dizzy.  I felt the need to vomit so I got up to go to the bathroom, but this was not an easy task.  I was soooooo fucked up.  Right when I got to the toilet I threw up and did a little dry heaving afterwards.  I didn't feel any better though.  Everything was spinning.  I went back to bed and ended up laying there with a lot of pain in my stomach for a long time before I got to sleep around 11:00 pm.",
      "Needless to say I called in sick to work the following morning.  Plus I was in bed for the entire next day.  I also had diarrhea for the next 2-3 days.  That's about it.  It sucked.  I'm not doing it again.  End of story.",
      "My friend, amazingly had a fairly good experience.  He never got sick.  He just told me that he just felt really happy for the rest of the night when he was at work and continued to feel the effects for a few more days."

As for the second night, nothing happened for around 2 hours while we were sitting on the couch chilling, and then as soon as we got up and made plans to go out, my mood and feelings start to steadily rise and then I peaked for around 2-3 hours. Fantastic. Not quite as overwhelming as E, but similar speedy and euphoric effects, along with the need to dance and move and talk a ton. Definitely better than the feelings available from alcohol."

I've also synthesized it but I find that route is more trouble than it is worth for someone working with OTC chemicals (basicly I got shitty yields of poor purity and had no desire to flash it through a column).  I have recently improved my extraction work-up greatly, and as a result am able to obtain great yields of damn near pure product (clear needles recystallized from pet. ether).  So this brings me to my story.",
      "I've smoked dmt countless times and have had great experiences.  After reading the section in TIHKAL, I decided to try an IV injection.  I figure you use half the product and get twice the experience.  In TIHKAL, they mentioned some study long ago where a DMT HCl solution was used.  As HCl is the acid I had on hand suitable for use to make a salt, that is what I used.  I eyed out what I hoped was close to 20 mg (I only wish I had a scale that would measure milligrams).\r[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See related article]",
      "I mixed a HCl/dH20 sol. to about pH 1.5.  .5 cc was pulled into an insulin syringe.  The DMT freebase was placed into a spoon and the acidic solution was squirted on to it.  Much to my dismay, the crystals did not dissolve.  I stirred with the plunger, it did not dissolve.  I tried heating, which merely melted to crystals.  It smoked a little, smelling strongly of DMT.  I was starting to get irritated, and quickly mixed up a stronger HCl solution, pulled .2 cc into the syringe and mixed it in the spoon.  Some of the melted crystals actualled dissolved, but not everything went into solution.",
      "I placed a cotton into the spoon and sucked up the solution into the syringe.  An insulin syringe is generally 1 cc, so it was damn near full.  I tied off, found a vein, and began to slowly inject the solution.  In about 10 seconds my heart was pounding and a became very anxious.  It takes forever to inject that much solution from an insulin syringe, and after about half of it was in, my hand started shaking.  The needle slipped out of the vein, I started to notice a swelling at the injection site, at which time I removed the needle. ",
      "The effects were minimal and included pupil dilation, some stimulant like effects, and slight visual disturbances.  There was also pain at the injection site.  The dose I was able to administer was only threshold level.  I would not try this again with the hydrochloride salt, it is just to much of a pain in the ass to obtain a solution.  I would love to know which salt Shulgin used.  Anyway, that's my story.  I don't think I could recommend this."

I found that things on TV and conversations with friends became a lot more funny to me. Not to the point where everything was hysterical and I found myself giggling like a complete fool but just to a point where it was alot easier to appreciate the humor and laugh. Everything became a lot more interesting as well and overall I had a great feeling of well being.",

Forgive me as I don't remember the exact times of the night... We took our doses at about 8:30 - 9:00 pm.  For the first hour or so there is mostly a slight stomach discomfort, with a bit of giddiness. The next stage there is a feeling of being real lazy, yet content.  This lasts anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.  During this time, I realized that if I wanted to, I could 'snap out' of it and become very active. ",

Conversations tend to start out as two different things, only to be mended into one concept about halfway through.  (We call this tree branch effect. Two trees start out as saplings planted apart. But as they grow, their branches intertwince and meet, forming a single outline/shape.) This makes these for me a substance I do as a group.  Sort of a mental X. My mind races for the rest of the night, well on into morning, around 5:00 am or so.  I only sleep 2 hours after these things, so burnout is a major problem.  The next day all I can do is sit around and nap.",

      "Alright, well I will start by saying that I looked through alot of info I could find on Phalaris grass and it did not look very promising. This is not actually really a report, but I will share this easy recipe for extremely cheap mild ayhuasca.",
      "Let me first point out if for some reason you dont know this already, that phalaris grass is a reed grass that grows in damp conditions. I would go more into what kind of phalaris to use but look it up online. Anyway the most active parts are the leaves, and specificly the new leaves.",
      "So find a big patch of this grass, and pick about a ziplock freezer bag full,(less will work) and bring it to a full boil in a nice big pot for 3-4 hours, maybe turning it to med after 2 hours. You can add lemon juice or another source of acidity to help get the alkaloids from the grass, but keep in mind if you are going to drink it.. well you know. It may look like you need alot of water for your grass but you do not need that much beacuse it shrinks with the heat.",
      "What I do is boil it down to a thickish tea (obviousy after straining the grass), and then take a 1/4 to 1/3 of the tea and pour it back into the pot (maybe a smaller pot). Then cook it down until it is a small enough amount to fit easily on a plate, but still liquid enough to pour. Pour it onto a plate, and have your oven preheated to 225 F. Turn off the oven and put the plate in and wait untill it is a goo/crystal mass solid enough to scrape off. Roll it into balls like hash and dry it in the sun or on a Heater.",
      "If you are in need of money (thats probably why you are using this method) then go get some passion flower extract, or some herbal sleep aid that uses passion flower as the main active ingredient.",
      "Now you can take a fair amount of the passion flower, and wait about 45 minutes to 90 mins. Drink one or two cups of the tea hot with a tea bag and sugar, (they say it may change the effect but I think it will just help it become absorbed faster into the blood stream) and wait around 30 mins. At this time I usually take a small bong hoot, but if you do not want to alter the effect then just skip to the next step. Take a good amount of the now completely dried resin and chop into small peices of break it up then put it on top of some cannabis or some other leaf. (Iv always thought a salvia leaf would be a nice twist though never tried)",
      "Take the whole bowl which will probobly take around 4 big bong hoots or a few more pipe hoots, beacuse it burns quite slow. You can see it start to buble up and slowly melt and kind of burn. I really suggest using a bong and trying to take as big of hoots as you can. Hold them in for about 10-15 secs each, and you should be pretty good. I found while I didnt acheive the likes of some reports of dmt or 5-meo DMT usage, I obtained a VERY strong sence of euphoria, a strong buzzing, a floating flying like feeling, and mild open eye and closed eye visuals. This usually lasts about 5 minutes, but with the tea lasts alot longer.",
      "Let me add that I have purchased all the ingredients for a strong Ayahusca potion and I will submit a real report on my journey into my mind. I have always had excellent experiences with psychoactives including LSD, P. Mushrooms, DXM, MDMA*, synthesized mescaline, salvia, and morning glory seeds. Probably more. I know that if I treat the spirit of Ayahuasca with great respect I will get the deep metaprograming trip that I seek.",
      "PS. my Brew will contain B.cappi, Mimosa spp, dream herb, and a small amount of amanita muscaria. -Truely a powerful brew.  ",
      "* I do not condone the use of MDMA and although it can be fun I think it is vasltly overused and is eating away at the minds of a whole generation."

Being the dumass I was I took 15 100 mg pills in the space of about 2 hours.  This was around 8 pm.  I didn't feel anything for awhile, just high from taking bong hits.  I stayed the night there and it was the worst night of my life.",
      "I woke up and I saw my friend Clark standing on the steps with a device that I thought he was trying to kill me with.  I looked up at the ceiling and a giant net was coming down over my head, controlled by my friend of course, and I started waving it away.  I looked over and Clark wasn't there anymore.",
      "The next day is still a blur to me.  Apparently I started rambling about how everyone was out to get me and I wasn't safe anymore.  I was smoking lots of pot to try to calm down but it wasn't working well.  Clark called a doctor and he said I was suffering from schitzofrania.  Later that day I calmed down enough to go home.",
      "I have never been the same since that night.  I hear voices in my head and sometimes I'll see someone and then their not there.  I hear people calling my name all the time, but their not.  I have the symptoms of a paranoid schitzofranic and I blame the zoloft.  I wish I could go back and undo that terrible night, but I can't."

      "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to the cops while you're tripping? Have you considered what it would be like to be abruptly interrupted while minding your own business in the middle of an intense trip by a lengthy police interrogation? Terrifying isn't it? I've been there, read on.",
      "The night began around 8:30 pm, with the ingestion of the hit of blotter acid and about 2 grams of mushrooms.  I had just finished smoking a blunt and my stomach was nearly empty, so the trip began in about 20-30 minutes.  My companion for the night had eaten about the same amount of mushrooms, but no acid. I had never combined LSD and mushrooms, so I didn't quite know what to expect of this trip.  We began by watching TV, waiting to come up and trying to subtly urge my roommate and a few mutual non-tripping friends to leave the room so the trip could really begin.  I find it quite uncomfortable to trip around those who aren't.  Even though they are relatively experienced psychedelic drug users I just feel awkward, inappropriate and just plain goofy around non-trippers.  They were in the process of getting drunk, and thus they were glad to leave us be and go play pool or something.  I'd like to note that one of the friends, who I'll call Steve, left about eight beers in our fridge.  Remaining alone with another tripper, in retrospect, was perhaps not the best of ideas.",
      "However, at this point in time I was starting to trip pretty hard, and the combination of effects from the two hallucinogens was interesting and strange.  The visuals were less intense than usual but much more detailed and intricate than any I had ever experienced before, the walls of my room seemed to be an intricate lattice of colors and figures that extended miles beyond my sight.  The universe seemed to break down into thoughts and ideas rather than objects and processes, I pondered to what extent reality was merely an artificially constructed set of ideas and perceptions rather than a physical, solid, definable universe.  After spinning glowsticks and listening to music at a high volume for an hour or so, I had another friend of mine roll a joint on my desk and the three of us went on a drive to smoke.  The marijuana enhanced the visuals greatly, as has always been the case when I trip and smoke.  Big mistake #1 was a few stems and seeds left on my desk, and the bag of pot left in the drawer. ",
      "Being outside, away from the music and glowsticks and confinement of the dorm room took the trip in a new direction.  I became grounded in reality to an extent.  I could envision the entire universe as an enormous self-perpetuating machine, in which every bit of matter played an intricate role in the greater workings of our existence.  I pondered the extent to which I could control my place in the machine, and the extent to which the machine would control me.  Little did I know, at this point, the extent to which I would get stuck and nearly caught in that machine.",
      "We arrived back at the dorm building and went back into the room after socializing with a few people in the pool room downstairs.  I was feeling a bit more social now, but I didn't stay for long.  We smelled strongly of marijuana, but that was nothing that normally concerned me.  I'll call this big mistake #2. Once back in the room I started to spin glowsticks again and we turned the music back on.  The music was at a fairly high volume, but nothing that would normally cause any trouble in the building.  Everything seemed to be going great at this point.  I was having an intense, thoughtful, fulfilling and unusual trip with no concerns to keep me from really enjoying myself.  This is exactly the point where everything goes wrong.",
      "Two of the building RA's opened my door while I was spinning, and at first I didn't have any idea what was going on. There was a male RA and a female RA. They told me that my music was too loud, and they walked in and immediately spotted an empty beer bottle.  They told me they would have to search the room and that I should go ahead and get rid of any other alcohol.  We complied and emptied out all of Steve's beer in the bathroom, and at this point they spotted the stems and seeds on the desk.  They told us we smelled strongly of marijuana, and accused us of drinking and smoking in our room.  We told them we hadn't been drinking and they believed us immediately, we obviously didn't look drunk.  The male RA stayed upstairs and told us the cops were already on their way, while the female RA went downstairs and called the cops.",
      "I still didn't comprehend the seriousness of the situation at this point, I was very confused as to exactly what was happening.  The male RA tried to gather up the tiny amount of stems and seeds, but without either of us noticing it my co-tripper had thrown them behind the desk.  He took one of my paper towels and asked me to sweep them up and hand them to him.  Much to my own confusion, I swept up mostly dust and a few very tiny green particles.  I was under the impression that he had already picked up the stems and seeds that he had seen.",
      "He took us out into the floor lobby, and while we waited for the elevator my co-tripper said he had to use the restroom.  Unbeknownst to me, he stashed his glass pipe on top of a ceiling tile above the toilet.  While the RA followed him into the bathroom, I went back into the room and grabbed the bag of pot. They had already told us that they would be searching the room, and no consent was needed because it's university property. I stuffed it into my pocket and came back out, where the RA decided that we'll take the stairs.",
      "Walking down six flights of steps gave me a moment to collect myself and finally comprehend the seriousness of the situation.  I tried to clear my head as much as possible, and assess what I needed to do to.  My mind seemed to instantly sharpen, my basic survival instincts kicked in.  We arrived downstairs and the RA told me to sit in the RD's office and wait for the police officers.  I told him that I needed to use the restroom, with the intention of flushing the pot down the toilet.  However when I got into the bathroom, I encountered a good friend of mine taking a piss.  My mind seemed to work instantaneously, I shoved the pot in his pocket and pulled my car key off of my key ring.  I whispered to him, 'Put this in my car, I'll explain later.'  Just as he walked out of the bathroom, the RA poked his head in the door and told me not to flush the toilet.  I probably would have already flushed it by then, but the closeness of the situation made my heart start to pound.",
      "It should be noted, at this point, that I was fully aware that none of them had any idea that I was tripping.  Though I'm sure my pupils were the size of flying saucers, they had no idea what state of mind I was in.  I sat down on the bench-seat facing the RD's desk next to my co-tripper, and the cops entered.  This was one of the most intense moments I have ever experienced.  The cops were assholes, trying to accuse us of this, that, and the other.  They told us condescendingly that they were getting high just smelling us.  We told them that we hadn't been smoking, but rather we had just been in the car with some friends.  It was quite obvious to all four of us that we were lying, but I managed to stay on top of the cops' mind-games.  We kept our story straight, made up some names of the people who were actually smoking pot in the car. They were some old friends from high school, we didn't know their phone numbers, addresses, etc.",
      "He told us to empty our pockets but did not pat us down or search us.  He kept insisting that they wouldn't leave without locking somebody up, giving me the impression that I could go to jail at any moment.  I did not allow myself to be overrun with this fear, but it was terrifying nonetheless.  I thought, at that point, that the cops had a few stems and seeds in their posession.  I had no idea what was going to happen, I had no idea what they could do to me for stems and seeds.  It eventually became apparent to me, as much as the officer tried to suggest otherwise, that they weren't interested in my stems and seeds.  They wanted a bust, and we weren't going to give them what they wanted.",
      "They tried to talk circles around us, mix us up, catch us for anything so they could go back to the station with a couple of freshly-cuffed stoners.  The whole ordeal seemed to stretch out for hours, but we were really only in the room for about 30 minutes.  Everything said to us seemed preconcieved and phony, it was all just a big show being put on for us by these assholes whose salaries are paid for by my taxes. I instantaneously analyzed everything the officer said to me, carefully trying to determine the motives behind questions and reading between the lines.  By the end of the interrogation I felt as though I could predict what the officer was going to say to me, based on my perception of his motives and my internal analysis of what he had already said to me. ",
      "Finally, they gave up on us.  'You're free to go,' he said so nonchalantly.  I went outside and smoked a few cigarettes, still quite overwhelmed and trying to piece the situation together in my mind.  I couldn't really comprehend what happened for a while.  My co-tripper and I had a lengthy conversation, which helped me put things together and figure out the things that I didn't know.  We talked to a few friends who helped us further understand why our room had been raided in the first place.",
      "As I started to relax more, I began to trip harder again.  Suddenly I felt the most immense happiness.  Freedom! We had escaped! There were so many close calls and things that could have gone wrong, but we came out almost entirely unscathed.  I would say entirely, but I'm sure I'll get a dorm-building violation and probably have to write a paper on drug usage or something.  I fell back into the trip, and thinking back on the night overwhelmed me with profound happiness.  This was probably around 2 am.  The whole ordeal seemed to fit perfectly into the trip, the way the great machine of society tried to force its will upon us while we tried our hardest to resist.  It felt like we had been through a monumental struggle, and the feeling of coming out on top was incredible.  I pondered the contrast between the great happiness I was feeling and the intense terror I had experienced mere hours earlier. ",
      "This is one of the most profound lessons I learned from this trip, everything seemed so much better at that point because of the hardship I had endured.  Good times and bad times are all relative, good exists only in its contrast to bad, and vice-versa.  Glowsticks won't glow unless you surround them with darkness.  A constant supply of good will lend one to stop appreciating it, thus leading to bad. Good cannot exist without bad.  And suddenly the universe is balanced--black and white, good and evil, chaos and order, yin and yang."

      "I finally received the methylone that seemed like took forever to arrive.  I currently have no MDMA experience so I was hoping this would feel pretty amazing since I should have zero tolerance.  I picked a pleasant evening after work.  The night felt right and I was experiencing little to no stress.  If anything, I was feeling a little more tired than usual but nothing to write home about.  It had been 6+ hours since last meal.",

I should have no interruptions.",

      "T+1:00 Wow, I am really feeling some major jaw clenching so its time to find some gum.  While up, I check the mirror and notice my eyes are a little dilated.  I can feel noticeable energy coming on.  Also, music is sounding much more clear and clean.",

Its fun to just close my eyes, smile and think about anything.",

It feels great to just lie down and do nothing.  Really great even.",

Still feeling good but time to change to some more mellow music to see if theres any difference.",

      "T+2:30 Music can definitely kill the feeling.  Switching back made a world of difference.  Euphoria still present but seems like it might be starting to wear off.  Eyes still very dilated.  Still zero worries.  I could rob a bank and not feel bad about it.",

      "T+3:15 Euphoria continuing to dwindle.  Music is still sounding more crisp and clean than normal.  The enjoyment of touching and being social are not near as noticeable.  I'm becoming mentally tired very fast.",
      "T+3:30 Sleepy time.  I'm now really concerned about the after effects for tomorrow.  But what a trip I had tonight!  Thats all that really matters.",
      "I had no problem falling asleep so it seems the amphetamine aspect of methylone is not as strong as one might expect. I slept light, but it felt good as I was still feeling some of the effects.  Waking up was a challenge but not too bad.  Getting the motivation to go to work was another story however.  Throughout the day I was very lethargic.",
      "Now, it wasnt the type of feeling of being hung over from alcohol or the zombie like feeling of taking too many over the counter sleep aids.  It was a feeling all on its own.  It's a feeling of just being 'down and out.'  My body seems normal but my mind just isnt there.  I could fall asleep at any time and I really just dont want to do anything at all.",
      "The next morning began the same way but throughout the day I could feel the depressed type feelings fading.  By the end of the day it was pretty much back to normal.",
      "Summary:",
      "The night was very enjoyable.  But it doesnt seem like the super energetic and social type experience as its bigger brother.  I no doubt will try it again with the same dosage or a small amount more.  I think I'll try it with my roommate or my girlfriend as well.  Having someone close could enhance the experience I believe.  I was most worried about the after effects but it was very manageable.  Overall, it no doubt exceeded my expectations."

If I don't learn something from a drug experience but just feel 'good' from it I feel I'm damaging myself for no other reason than to experience a brief moment of happiness and euphoria that in the long run will affect me negatively.",
      "One thing that I got from my past experiences is that ecstacy is a very powerful therapeutic tool. That is not to say I condone taking it, and in fact this might not be true for other people, but in my case I found that one experience on ecstacy had positive effects in the long run. Not in a physical sense, but in a way that it helped me analyze myself and discover my own thoughts and feelings without being burdened by neuroses and insecurities, to the point that I believe that the positive outcomes outweigh any negative effects that it might have on my system. That is not to say I will continue taking it. In fact, last night's experience will be my last (except maybe somewhere far down the line in a couple of years when I feel I want to address other issues).",

On one pill that I took several weeks ago the effects came on very suddenly (albeit after a long time) while on the one I took last night the effects came on slowly and smoothly, like a plane taking off on a runway and in fact that is a very appropriate metaphor, as I liken the feelings to my emotions slowly welling up inside me and building up until suddenly, they're up in mid air and I'm flying (peaking).",
      "I found that the ecstacy 'feeling' is not like I envisioned it would be. After reading various reports and articles about it, I thought it would feel like a shift in consciousness (similar to marijuana except for the paranoia). The fact is, I felt no shift in consciousness. I felt more lucid and excrutiatingly happy at some points, but I still felt like myself. Just a more positive version of myself. I heard some people experience more vivid colours and their senses being expanded, and while I did experience this, it wasn't that profound. Not even close to the intensity they can get on hallucinogenics.",
      "The feeling is nothing spectacular and in fact, I've felt it at several points in my life before. When I got a promotion, when I see a loved one I haven't been close to for years, when I am successful in persuing someone I'm attracted to, and even though I've never had children, I have heard someone compare it to the joy of seeing your baby being born. It feels like a warm inner glow that emanates from your heart, kind of like your heart is expanding beyond the confines of your body. Quite literally I felt like I was glowing.",
      "At some points this made me rather uncomfortable as there was a sense of artificiality about it. In normal day to day lives when we experience these happy moments they come and go in waves and our mind has a way of regulating them. Here, I felt it was constant and I wasn't getting any respite from the happy emotions. Logically, I felt that this was bad, but frankly, I felt too good to care about it for too long.",
      "Ecstacy has a way of dissolving my insecurities and complexes, and this is an understatement. It absolutely demolishes them. I tend to be rather nervous around people sometimes as I have a bit of social anxiety (not that much but enough to cause me some problems on occasions). After ecstacy, its like it never even existed. I feel I can talk to anyone, and I do mean anyone, on their level. Making connections, even with people you would not normally make connections with, is not only easy, it is pleasant.",
      "While alcohol makes social interactions easier, ecstacy absolutely erodes any traces of discomfort that might have ever existed. With alcohol I find that after getting a bit drunk, approaching others becomes slightly easier, after ecstacy there is not even a thought of whether its hard or easy, I actually want to approach people. Anyone I see in the place I am at I have an overwhelming desire to communicate to. Most of the time I find that it has a positive effect on other people as well as they can sense a kind of comfort and warmth coming from me and they react positively. I've made more friends on ecstacy in one night than in one month without it.",
      "I don't believe it's the drug that actually stimulates empathy. It felt like the drug stimulated extremely positive emotions, which broke down all the barriers and filters in my mind that were causing altered and incorrect perceptions of other people and situations, allowing me a glimpse of what people are truly thinking and feeling. In other words, we all have it in us to feel that kind of empathy once we break down these barriers, the drug is just a catalyst. I believe this because even weeks after taking the drug (the previous time I did it) it had a permanent effect as it broke down some misconceptions and I could more easily sense people's feelings even without it.",
      "I find it is also important to take it in the right setting. The previous night, while the overall experience was pleasant, the setting was not ideal. I can now fully understand why raves and dance parties are the preferred forum for this drug.",
      "My friends ended up going to a club full of belligerent assholes. I walked in and could see other guys sizing me up with a kind of territorial attitude. This caused a kind of dissonance in me, as on the one hand I felt an overwhelmingly positive and happy attitude towards humanity, but on the other hand we were at a place where others did not feel like that. When I was at the bar buying a drink, some dude attempted to brawl with me. This was extremely confusing as I could not well up the anger and appropriate emotions to deal with the situation, all I could feel was love. It's like wanting to hug a wolf that is sneaking up on me growling, about to attack. Very confusing.",
      "I also found that ecstacy erodes any sexual feelings. As a guy, whenever I go to any place and I see a girl I find attractive, there is a 'hunter' attitude that takes over. I try to flirt, to pick up. On ecstacy, rather than trying to pick up, I just want to bond emotionally. Sex doesn't even come into my mind (except maybe later once the pill starts wearing off). That's not to say the idea of sex is bad, it's just that it doesn't come into the forefront of every situation. This can make persuing someone you like easier as you come across as less intense or desperate making success more probable in the long run (but this would really depend on the situation).",
      "There is a sense of clarity about everything making judging situations and my own actions a lot easier. Some people claim that it can make you take more risks as you feel more comfortable about taking them, but because of its empathogenic effect, I felt more empathetic to myself in the future tense, knowing that if I do anything risky or silly now I would regret it later. So while I wanted to do certain things, I had enough sense to stop myself. Stopping myself was not difficult because whatever I did, I felt good. I didn't 'need' to do anything as I was comfortable and happy doing anything. Just sitting back for a while and relaxing was exremely pleasurable.",
      "Finally, onto the come down effects. This is not pretty, and if I had to name the primary reason why I decided not to take ecstacy again (at least for a long, long time) it's the come down. The secondary being the fear of causing myself any sort of permanent damage (the studies on that seem to be inconclusive). The come down effects begin coming in waves a few hours after initial ingestion. These are waves of discomfort and paranoia, like a feeling of impending doom, even if I'm in an environment I would normally feel safe in.",
      "At one point I realised I wanted to run away. These must be the feelings of 'flight' I heard about when animals sense danger. Since my serotonin levels were depleted, I guess there was no control mechanism to tell me everything's ok. I'm not a scientist by any stretch of the imagination so thats more of a musing. Every situation felt uncomfortable, and my body felt a bit odd. It's difficult to describe the feeling, but the initial warmth that I felt when I was peaking on ecstacy was now replaced by a kind of chill. These initially come in waves so one minute I'm feeling great, another I'm feeling danger and paranoia, then I'm feeling good again. So it is gradual, not sudden, which I guess is good as this is an initial sign that its time to go home. Sleep is not difficult after a night on ecstacy (at least not on the pills I had). Ecstacy isn't really that kind of stimulant (unless its mixed with other drugs like amphetamines). It's an emotional stimulant but not a physical one. So sleep is not impossible.",
      "The next day the come down effect lasts until late afternoon, when finally I'll feel it wearing off and myself returning back to normal (very gradually). Eating a good meal helps in this regard. But during the 'hangover', I feel absolutely horrible. Not physically, but emotionally. I wouldn't say it's that much worse than an alcohol hangover, just different. So maybe I just haven't developed coping mechanisms for it yet which at first made it seem much worse.",
      "For one, I can't sit still. This might be the 'flight' response. Again, its not because of a stimulant effect (like after coffee), rather, sitting still feels horrible. I have to move. I have to do something. I usually just end up walking around my house and thinking about things, putting my thoughts back together (as they tend to get erratic during the come down). I also start questioning my actions from the previous night, wondering if perhaps I was inappropriate at any point. It doesn't seem like I was since in retrospect I got mostly positive responses, but I still find myself questioning it. I wouldn't describe the come down feelings as 'depression'. At least not right the next day. Rather, it feels like I'm riddled with conflicting emotions that feel rather intense and I can't 'relax'.",
      "So that's basically it in a nutshell. I tried to be as thorough as I can be. For anyone considering taking it I would urge precaution. I read a LOT about it before I took it for the first time and took every precaution suggested by more experienced users and also by researchers."

      "Here's a biggie, but very juicy in details. I have done morning Glories many times. My friend was a newb, only having done marijuana and alcohol, so I decided to prank him after he wanted to try LSD but couldn't get any by giving him a first time dose of 400 seeds. Bad move. I thought he had small packs with 5-10 seeds apiece, so I tell him about 35 packs will be enough. Only not till I get home I realize each pack contained 65 seeds.\r[Erowid Note:  2275 morning glory seeds is considered an extremely high dose, see morning glory Dose Chart]",
      "No wonder he thought our teacher was purple and shit was trying to eat him. Me and two friends had to hold him down on the floor for him to clam down! He also tried swimming in the toilet and uncovered the meaning of life, though he wasn't quit able to tell me. His pupils were fucking bigger than his iris!! I stayed up all night praying to God he'd be alright. He just fell into slight psychosis for a few days.",
      "ANYWAYS...me being the dumbass druggie I am and feeling bad about what I did I decide to do the same myself. In second block at school I decide to pop about 25 packs of heavenly blue and flying saucers seeds.\r[Erowid Note: 1625 morning glory seeds is considered an extremely high dose, see morning glory Dose Chart]",
      "Shit was alright for awhile. Soon I started getting a 'poisoned' feeling like I get with diphenhydramine HCL. About 45 minutes after consumption (~11:30AM) colors are flashing, I'm having slight talking trouble, tachycardia, same shit as usual. I feel like I'm about to puke my ass out.",
      "Around 12:30PM after eating lunch I go to ISS - In school suspension. The very reason I picked this day for the experiment as the teacher is a dickshit. About this time my hands are red when I hold them below my heart and white when I hold them above my head. When staying still for a few moments the tips turn blue. My mind was getting very loose, and I was going into deep thought. Seemed similar to an LSD trip. About 1:45PM (T+2:15) walls were purple and occasionally had a watery 'ripple' effect. Like they were crying. I would giggle at the stupidest shit like a fly landing.",
      "Soon enough the bell rang at 3:40PM and I got on the bus to go home. I felt completely fine and sober. I mean, all that was happening was me seeing light flashes. Along with trees being golden, the sky purplish blue, and grass being cut into perfect 1x1 foot blocks. I get home and go to my room to put on some Hendrix. This shit was awesome. Shit I never really noticed before stood out. Little screeches in the background, whispers, that shit. So the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock track comes on and this is where the real fun begins. I COULD FUCKING TASTE THE MUSIC!! AND SEE IT TOO!! My senses kept switching over and stuff, I can't explain it at all. Kinda like my tongue was vibrating to the music but I deciphered it as sound.",
      "Soon that got old and I decide to do one of my favoritest things to do on drugs, have sex. Unfortunately no girls were around and I'm not into guys, so I pull out the 'ol lotion and a wad of tissue. It felt fucking great, like first I could feel every part of my dick and balls and shit. Then it got weird cus I started thinking about how were just animals, wads of cells cooperating for survival. What's the purpose of life? I was sure there was a God, but in a way it didn't make since. Then I snapped back to realty and realized I wasn't jacking it. So I start thinking about my hot girlfriend and then thought about life came back again and how basically she was just a monkey out for survival. Talk about turnoff. If I wanted that I might as well pick up a picture of Barbara Streisand. Fuck that.",
      "So I turn on the TV and stare at info ads about bodybuilding and how cool it was. But then I was like this is gay, and it's fucking sick how humans will try to take such advantage of others especially when it comes to religion and self-confidence. I think about how much I need to change the channel, but my body was too lost in time to reach for the remote. So I reach for my dick again. This time instead of my dick feeling it the feeling went to my feet, then face and spread to my whole body. Then I started hearing the feeling. I keep spankn the monkey and soon the normal relaxed feeling came over me, just reeeeally extreme, until I splooged, then it felt like my eye was splooging.",
      "After laying on my bed for what seemed like a few minutes, I look at the clock and its 8 PM!! I go outside and sit in my car and think how lucky I am to be alive and prayed and thanked God for letting me be alive. I noticed my heart flying, I couldn't count straight but estimated about 230 bpm, and it wasn't even beats either, but I paid no heed as I remembered my friend who did about 500 more seeds than me, plus I've been in far more shit than this.",
      "I look out the window and I see the sun high in the sky, blue at that, and am amazed at God created. Around 9PM I realized it was just the streetlight reflection on the other cars window, but am still marvelled at it. Around 8:30PM I look at my hands and am happy I have them and never realized how big they were or that they could move they way they did. Then I realized I DIDNT KNOW I HAD HANDS!!!! Especially ones that changed colors. I looked in the mirror and saw my pupils were about the size of a pencil eraser. I touched my head and it felt like I had just fallen out the sky and landed unharmed on the ground standing on my feet. My coarse hair felt incredibly soft and long.",
      "A friend came over, along with two other friends to watch over us, and he and did the equate shit and we smoked some 'dro. Shit started getting scary here. My heart felt like it was about to give up and kept skipping around to really fast to dangerously slow, and it was always uneven, constricted beats. I thought the trees were gnomes out to get me, and I reassured myself that it wasn't like that, the trees were normal, it was the gnomes behind the trees that wanted to eat me. Peoples' voices sounded orgasmic, and I felt really, really happy when hearing music, especially positive trippy shit. My friend was freaking out thinking the devil was out to get him and how the walls were crying (he took like 15 50mg Equates and the weed) and how he seriously needed to get home before 11PM or he'd be in trouble.",
      "I go inside to get a snack, but was disgusted when I saw the hamburgers, thinking about how meat was animal organs, flesh carved out of a cows side. So I settled for iced tea. I did forget to mention I had cotton mouth like a mother fucker. All day and the weed made it almost unbearable, in fact my spit tasted like blood. So I'm in the car with my friend and 2 watchers, and they're saying I'm good to drive. I'm saying I'm seriously fucked up and can't drive, and they convince me to try, chiefly after one offered to drive, the same kid who drove off the rode when my other car broke and we were pushing it to a service station at like 1mph, but that's another story.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "So I start backing out straight, and they yelling STOP! STOP!! And I'm like chill man! Then I hear a THUNK! And look behind me and saw I hit they're fence, meaning that rather than backing out directly straight, I went at about a 90 degree. And it was at about 30mph when I thought I was going 5. So we chill a little longer and half an hour later (11:45PM) I slowly back out again, this time to success. overall I was alright, I just drove slightly off the rode once.",
      "When we got back (me and the 2 watchers) at 12:12 AM, I went directly to lay down on the bed. The ceiling was spinning and the popcorn paint was dancing and popping around. Television screens and monitors flashed a lot and had lines running through them, and my body felt like it was 3000pounds yet weightless. Soon enough I passed out and had weird ass dreams I can hardly remember.",
      "Overall, it was pretty fun. I tripped incredibly hard, and it's a damn good thing I had watchers. The next day I had a small hangover from when I woke up at 9AM to about 11AM, and sporadically saw light flashes and colors for about a week after. Also I couldn't shit for 2 days then it was massive diarreah that was hard to get out."

      "The next day, I took three (they contain 100mg each) and, after two hours or so, felt a nice very mellow stimulant feeling.  The mood lift and expansiveness of cocaine or methamphetamine, but without the push.  It lasted a few hours and faded away.  This effect is consistent but inconvenient, given the very long delay in onset.",
      "Later, I tried plugging it (ie in solution into the rectum) since that's as effective as snorting but can handle a lot more volume.  I loaded 300mg into the (needleless!) syringe in 5ccs of water.  But alas, nothing, not even the aforementioned warmth.",

      "I should begin with a brief history of my drug experience, I've done salvia, coke, adderall, and ambien, all only once and am a daily smoker of marijuana.  This report is on my first experience with Mushrooms.",
      "I began the day by listening to positive vibe music, Sublime, Bob Marley, etc.  My friend G had told me that a lot of how your trip will go depends on your state of mind.  By the time my friend s R and J came over I was on very good vibes.  Any negative experience in the past few days was gone and I was in the perfect mood.",
      "R and J came over around 1ish. After this point time is pretty much lost because I didnt keep a clock on me.  The following report takes place between 1 and 6pm.  We discussed the plan of attack, which was to take a walk in the woods near my dorm.  For winter it was the perfect day outside, around 30 degrees and sunny with a little wind.  We ate our mushrooms, each taking about 2 grams, in my room and then headed out into the woods.",
      "Ive heard a lot of people say they get a little nauseous but I felt fine.  Maybe I was focused on what was going on around me or something but I noticed no ill effects.  We took a walk on the paths going through the schools woods and just talked about random things, past mushroom experiences etc.  We decided to find a bench we knew of in the woods to take a break.  As I sat down on the bench I noticed one tree a head of me seem to expand and contract very slightly, almost unnoticeable.  I asked R and J if they noticed it but they said no, so I think I can claim this as the beginning of my come up.  I decided to lie down on the ground.",
      "As soon as I did my entire perspective changed.  I could really see the clouds and see the different shapes presented by them.  The shifts in appearance were slower than normal.  I felt so wonderful to be looking up at the sky.  I felt like if everyone could take this perspective all the worlds problems would be solved.  I told R and J to lay down but they didnt believe me.  I kept insisting and laughing at how good it was.  Finally I got up, and then they both laid down immediately.  They had it planned all along.  Just to spite them I laid back and we all discussed the worlds problems and such.  We all agreed that if everyone in the world stopped what they were doing and laid down on the ground like we were everything would be all right.",
      "After awhile we decided to walk again and came up on some relatively deep snow.  R said something about how cool it might be to just fall backwards into it.  Having no fear at this point I looked at her, turned around and I just let myself fall backwards.  Words cannot describe the feeling of falling and the gentle cushion of snow.  And to follow it all up the new perspective I felt before hit me as soon as I looked up and saw the sky.  I felt completely and utterly content.",
      "Somehow during my fall my arm got underneath the snow.  R and J repeatedly asked me (semi worried which told me they were coming up too) where my arm was.  Somehow I got the idea that slowly moving my arm out of the snow would look really cool to them.  As I did it they both laughed at how weird and creepy it was.  We were all feeling pretty good at this point.  I convinced R to take the fall into the snow.  She agreed that it was defiantly a worthwhile adventure, but J didnt want to because he figured if he laid down again he wasnt getting back up.",
      "At this point we were getting kinda cold because our cloths got a little wet.  We decided to head over to our friends on-campus apartment and chill out there till we warmed up.  This is really where visuals started to kick in.  There was a poster on the wall with a gnome smoking a pipe underneath a small plant.  I could see the smoke rising from his pipe and occasionally he would tap his foot.  Although the gnome looked really sinister I wasnt freaked out by him at all, in fact I was almost comforted.  I wanted nothing more than to join the gnome and share the pipe, which I assumed was full of marijuana.",
      "At this point our friend G and L came in.  They had eaten their mushrooms slightly after we did so they were still coming up.  I remarked to G how much I wanted to be the gnome in the poster.  He responded with You are him dude.  This was my first major breakthrough of the trip.  I realized that no matter what we are all connected in the universe.  When I closed my eyes I could see the connection.  It didnt matter if the distance spanned a few inches or a few light years, we were all one in the same.  All our energies flowed together, both everyone in the room and the entire universe.",
      "After I came to this realization I decided to just sit there and think for awhile.  At first I drew a blank.  I didnt really know what to think about.  I stared back at gnome poster.  While I thought I wanted to be the gnome it dawned on me I was completely content where I was.  I then looked around the room and realized there was nothing in this world I wanted, I was completely and utterly content.  This was my second major breakthrough, I realized that wanting things was purely selfish and that only brought around suffering.  Yet here I was free from all desires and I felt completely euphoric.  I seriously couldnt be happier.  I laid on the couch just laughing and realizing how good I felt.",
      "Then L asked a simple question: she wanted to know if we wanted to smoke a bowl.  Laying there I looked at L and wondered if I did want it.  I realized I didnt, that regardless if I wanted it actually achieving it didnt really matter.  And the feeling of selfishness returned when I contemplated actually wanting the bowl.  At this point I announced to everyone that I couldnt want anything in the world and that the actual word want bothered me when it was used.  I couldnt possibly want anything.",
      "Everyone laughed about this, and though I felt a little out of place, I didnt mind the laughter.  I was still so content.  We smoked one bowl and just chilled out for what felt like hours.  We all did different things during our trip and here are just a few in no particular order, because to be honest I completely forgot the order they occurred in:",
      "In the gnome picture there was a drop of water barely clinging onto the leaf above the gnomes head.  While all other visuals were occurring, that drop of water refused to fall.  For all of us it would drip down lower but never actually fall.  I looked away for a little bit and notice R holding a large glass of water.   I realized what was needed and told R to dip her finger in the water, place the finger in front of her face over the drop on the leaf.  Doing this R actually saw the drop of water finally fall and we were all relieved.  R commended me on my good idea and thats where I came to my final breakthrough: sharing was the best way for me to escape feelings of selfishness and continue to be content.",
      "In the room there was an origami ball that one of the guys had made.  I picked it up and admired the colors.  I saw how glorious it was and knew I had to share it, I passed it along urging everyone to take a look.  Shortly after that I realized that my necklace would have to look really sweet at this point.  I took it off and looked at the center pendant, which was a small mushroom inside a larger glass mushroom, with some really cool dragons on the outside cap.  It looked so amazing that once again I had to share it.  Sharing everything I could just felt amazing.  It itself was a drug and I had to get more.  Yet I knew there would be no negatives to sharing and that made it all the better.",
      "At one point G and L left the room.  R, J, and I suddenly heard L yelling at G that she couldnt handle him anymore (she was laughing hysterically so we knew it wasnt serious).  She came into the room grinning and told us if we wanted to know what that was about just to spend 10 minutes with G.  We all sorta looked at each other, and then I decided that G, being the most knowledgeable about shrooms would be the perfect person to hang out with for awhile.",
      "I went into the other room and just layed down on the floor next to G.  We discussed the uselessness of language and that to try and communicate what we both were experiencing was useless, we both knew what was going on and too actually talk wasnt needed.  I closed my eyes and got swept into a dark vortex.  I felt like I was falling down a long shaft, yet I wasnt scared at all.  It just felt like I was growing longer and no bottom would come.  I opened my eyes and just played around with opening my eyes and closing them, experiencing the shifts in visuals.  After a few minutes of this I left, knowing that the group at this point was the better choice then to be off doing my own thing.",
      "As we began to peak I realized that I just needed to hold something.  Not that anything bad was happening, but I just knew I loved the feeling of holding something.  I grabbed the nearest pillow and just cuddled with it.  I felt so wonderful, nothing could take me away from the cloud I was on.  The pillow wasnt so much a security issue as it was just good to hold on to.  Id say I just sat there holding onto or playing around with the pillow for a good hour.  At that point we were all out of it so we each were doing our own thing.  Some of us were playing with water and some were just staring at the visuals we were experiencing, it was really quite fabulous.",
      "As I felt myself comedown I found I wanted to be by myself more.  Not that the group was negative, I just wanted some time to myself.  I took off and laid down in another room and just experienced everything I could.  The music was flowing from the other room and just added to my general well being.",
      "The comedown wasnt too rough.  Not till I was completely sober did I really feel any effects.  At that point I felt like I had gone on a camping trip and came back: I was really tired and a little brain dead from all that had happened.  Looking back on it R and I realized that the only thing we had done that day was take a walk and then lay around, but it had felt like we had done so much.",
      "After it was all over I was really confused.  I wanted to tell someone about all that had happened, but when I tried to think about it I really couldnt form what had happened into words.  I also didnt want to be around anyone.  Not that I was in a bad mood I just needed some time to think about everything."

I took the pills with a glass of water and soon after drifted off to sleep.",
      "Im not sure if I can really explain what happened that night, but I can try..  My dreams were intricate weaves of gold, shimmering and letting me fall endlessly down a tunnel of fantasy.  The dreams were detailed, the feelings intense, and the experience just indescribable.  Although I never became lucid (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) it was still an amazing experience.  But ive found that a large glass of milk before bed can induce a similar experience!!  So the question really is, is it a placebo effect?"

      "I got off work on a beautiful July morning in 2005. I got home and did my usual routine of taking my beautiful little Pekingese, Kong on a short walk in the park across from my home on Sunset. I got home from the walk and took my multivitamin and an Ambien 10mg.I had been taking Ambien for approximately 7 years without incident until that day. I then took a warm shower and put on my pajama pants and tee shirt and down on the couch to watch some TV before crashing. I was already feeling the wonderful relaxing effects of the Ambien. I learned over the years of taking Ambien that if I fought going to sleep, I could have a wonderful little 'Ambien trip'. I would feel this warm sensation in my chest and feel my whole body relax and my mind would totally disconnect from reality. This was always an enjoyable side effect of Ambien until this day.",
      "The doorbell rang and it was my neighbor and I invited him in and I asked if he would like some coffee. I made a pot of coffee on Ambien and did a pretty good job of it. I remember sitting there while my neighbor rambled on about his love life with a girl that was just using him. A really boring story. I took a second Ambien because I thought the effects of the first Ambien were diminishing. Anyways my neighbor left about half an hour after he arrived. At this point I can only remeber parts of what happened next. I remember taking two more Ambien and calling a friend of mine who was at work and laughing and falling on the floor and I remember my friend asked me to please get in the bed and to not smoke in my house and he would come by and check on me at lunch. \r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "I remember thinking lunch sounded really good, so I got my keys and my Pekingese, Kong and drove to the local hamburger joint and pulling up to the drivethru and pulling to close and backing up and pulling forward and scraping the side of my car against the building. Well there was an LAPD cruiser behind me with two officers witnessing all of this maddness. I was asked to pull over for questioning. I submitted to a breathilizer test blew a 0.00. I then submitted to a field sobriety test and failed it miserably. I remember being really embarrassed and scared at the same time. I was then promptly arrested for DUI and went to jail for the day. I bonded out about nine hours later and my friend picked me up. I remember I took an hour long shower when I got home and I also remember feeling depressed and horrified of what took place that day.",
      "The next night I was so depressed and scared, I drank a couple of beers and took two Ambiens and I attempted to drive to my friends house because I was so scared and depressed and now I was totally drugged out of my mind from the Ambien and the beer. I was driving down the wrong side of the road and hit a palm tree. I was sent to the hospital that I worked at and was treated for minor injuries and was re-arrested for another DUI. I really fucked my life up in two days from abusing Ambien. I lost my nursing license and had to pay an attorney $14,000.00 to defend me. I had to pay another $30,000.00 in rehab treatment fees and counseling fees. I am now free from Ambien, but still miss it, but I know that I can never take another one or there is not telling what would happen next."

      "To begin, I want to say that I am not on any medications, and that I had not taken any medications at least three days before this experience. I am also a usually happy person, and I was definitely happy about going into this experience. I didnt have a negative mindset the least bit. I surrounded myself with people I love and trust, and I was overall content with my life. To give you an idea of where I was during this experience, I live in a dorm, and my dorm is softly lit from one corner. I also have a comfy carpet, and an overall nice, soft, living space.",
      "These times are just estimates because I wasnt watching the clock all night.",
      "T -3:30",
      "I crushed up 15 Ololiuqui seeds (LSA), and  of a gram of Syrian Rue seeds (MAOI), and put them into a tiny jar with about an ounce of water in it. I shook the jar every once and a while to mix it up.",
      "T -0:10",
      "I took two Dramamines so I wouldnt throw anything up.",
      "T 0:00",

      "I smoked a bowl of MJ with a friend from across the hall, and we were both feeling really stoned. I had a strong body high, and I was really tingly all over.",
      "T 1:20",
      "The feeling of the LSA first started to overpower the MJ, and time started to slow down. I was eating a pretzel, feeling myself breathe, and I noticed it was taking longer and longer to chew the pretzel and to take one breath. The people in my room started to talk slower also. I decided to open up the clock on my computer to watch the second hand move by, and it was moving about twice as slow as it should have been moving, which was really weird.",
      "I was a little scared at first. I thought maybe I shouldnt have done this combination of drugs, but I went over it in my head, and I knew I had done my research, and that I was going to be just fine. I was a little worried about the MAOI, but I knew I put only half a gram in for a reason. I was also a little worried about the Dramamine, but I knew it was perfectly fine for me. After I rationed my way through that, I felt fine.",
      "Spatial hallucinations started now, too. I turned around from my computer and looked at the people in my room. They looked huge, and I felt huge with them, like we were giants, and then I noticed my room looked different too. I looked at the back corner of my room, and it looked like it was miles away. I decided to get up and go to the room across from mine. The people playing video games on the floor looked huge, but the back of the room was miles away. I noticed as I was walking around that my body started to feel a bit heavier, and the LSA was taking more control over my body. I think the drowsiness of the Dramamine was also kicking.",
      "T 1:35",
      "Only ten minutes had gone by, but it felt like I was across the hall forever. I put on Colin Hay, and I decided to just lie on my bed for a while, I closed my eyes. When I laid down on my bed, I started to reach the peak of the experience. I started to twitch all over my body. I wasnt convulsing, but just twitching everywhere. My body would twitch in patterns and waves. My hips would twitch up, and that would send a wave down my legs and up by torso, it was weird.",
      "My thoughts were also going wild. I would think about everything, like my mind was running around uncontrollably. I would think about how I ate the pretzel earlier just as long and importantly as how much I loved my friend. Time was also slowed down a lot. I had my hands on my chest, so I could feel myself breathe and my heart beat. It felt like an entire minute was in-between every breath, and my heart would beat every 5 seconds. I knew that my lungs and my heart were probably acting normally, just time was slowed down a lot.",
      "Another neat thing happened with the music that was playing. It sounded like I could hear everything in the music equally, like every note in a chord, and every instrument, loud and soft. Because time was slowed down so much, it felt like I had enough time to analyze every little part of the music individually. I only put on one song, so it ended after what felt like a long while, even though it was only about three minutes long. When I went to bed, everyone moved into the room across from mine, so all I could hear were the muffled voices from across the hall.",
      "T 1:45",
      "This was the peak of the experience. My body was still twitching in waves, and my thoughts were still running everywhere. Time was still going very very slow. I started to have audio hallucinations now. I could hear the people across the hall, but it sounded like they were talking through a megaphone or a walky-talky. Then their voices would begin to chop up or turn into droning, and all of a sudden their voices would stop and all I would hear was electrical noises.",
      "There were a lot of different electrical noises, like electrical noises from a movie or something, it wasnt just a consistent buzzing or droning, it changed a lot between droning, buzzing, zapping, or any combination of those. The sound of the people across the hall and the electrical noises alternated back and forth about ten times, and then the electrical noises never came back. I was still twitching all over, and my mind was still running.",
      "T 1:55",
      "The peak was now fading away, and I looked at my clock and noticed that only 17 minutes had gone by since I got into my bed! It felt like at least three hours had gone by. The twitching stopped soon, and I was able to sit up in my bed. I could tell I was tired from the Dramamine, and my body still felt a little on edge from the LSA. I still felt all tingly from the weed, too. My friend called when I sat up in bed, and I was able to hold a conversation with her, but I still felt really weird and my mind was still trying to run everywhere. There were still remnants of the spatial distortions too, my bed seemed huge, but my door, which is on the other side of the room, seemed like it was miles away. After I got off the phone with my friend, I just chilled out for a while.",
      "T 2:15",
      "Time isnt going as slow as it was during the peak, but its still going as slow as when the LSA first started to kick in, it went this slow for the rest of the night, but I got used to it. The special distortions were gone by now, and so was the twitching, but my body was still a little achy from it. I decided to take a shower, and it felt great because I was still stoned. After my shower, I talked to a couple people around in the hall and a couple friends in the room across from mine, and then went back into my room, because I found that I didnt like being around people and in the bright light.",
      "T 3:00",
      "Me and my friend smoked another bowl of MJ to chill out for the rest of the night, we felt awesome.",
      "T 3:15",
      "My friend called back after she had gotten ready for bed, and I talked to her until she got tired and wanted to go to bed. My thoughts werent running now, so I could hold a conversation with her just fine. Then I just chilled out with a couple people in my room until I went to bed. It wasnt hard to sleep because I was really stoned, and still tired from the Dramamine.",
      "Conclusion:",
      "In conclusion, I liked doing Ololiuqui. I wouldnt say it was a really fun or desirable experience, and I definitely wouldnt say it was a bad experience, but I would say it was really cool, and neat. I dont think I would spend money for shipping only for Ololiuqui seeds, Id have to be buying something else that I need first. On the other hand, if I need some more Syrian Rue or Fly Agaric, I would definitely throw in some Ololiuqui seeds.",
      "A couple things I would do differently: I think if I ever do this again, I would not do it high. I think the tinglyness of my body was too much during the peak of the LSA. I would also only take one Dramamine, because two of them made me tired, and I think one would work as far as me throwing up. The weed and the Dramamine together also made my mouth really dry, which isnt fun when youre eating pretzels."

      "Before I divulge my few experiences with Salvia I'd like to explain a bit about myself. I'm 14, and I'm not just some dumb kid who is recklessly going about trying various substances without thinking my decisions through. I consider myself quite experienced with marijuana, and I have had experiences with alcohol, Ritalin, Benadryl, PCP, Codeine, Vicodin, Lorazepam, and Ambien.",
      "I first heard about Salvia last August when my friend Josh told me about it, and said he wanted to try some. I told him I had never heard about it, and I decided to look it up. I had recently taken to researching different drugs and their effects, I find it very fascinating. I spent hours reading experience reports and reading information about the legal herb on various websites. A few days later, coincidentally, I was with a few other friends, and we were trying to buy me a pipe, on the Ave. All the head shops on the street rejected us, so we walked towards Thomas house, but noticed on the way one more shop. We walked in, and I noticed that all the pipes were over 20 dollars, which we could not afford. However something immediately caught my eye, a sign labeled Purple Sticky Salvia, sold here.",
      "I inquired and the man working there gave me package of it, the 5x extract in a round purple disc. He asked for ID, and I told him that my car had gotten stolen, and he pretended to believe me. We purchased the package and left. I told Josh that whenever I got any, Id save it to smoke with him. A few of my friends left, and I slept over at Thomas house. I could barely sleep because I was so excited about it. When I finally woke up I decided to just try it before I met up with Josh. I loaded up a relatively large bowl into Thomas glass pipe, and took one large hit holding the lighter over the bowl the whole time. I held it for about 15 seconds before I coughed it all out. I felt nothing so I finished off the bowl in one last monster hit. I exhaled after about 10 more seconds and felt nothing. I decided that it was just a useless overrated legal high, but with some doubt since so many strong experience reports were on the internet.",
      "We left the house and met up with our friends Michael and Sam. They both had heard about Salvia and wanted to try it. I told them that it was supposedly very intense and they had to hold the lighter over the bowl the entire time, and hold the smoke very long. Michael took a considerable hit and held it for quite a while. He exhaled and put down the pipe slowly. He looked around suspiciously and I asked if he was okay. He said that he felt something but it was very strange. Sam reached over to grab the pipe and Michael cringed backwards. Afterwards Michael could not explain what had happened and said it was very subtle but interesting. I told them I wanted to save the rest for when I met with Josh.",
      "-Experience One-",
      "I got on the bus later that day and walked from the stop to Joshs house. When I arrived he was in his room listening to music. I told him I had a packet of salvia and he freaked out. We went to his backyard and made a pipe out of a can, since we didnt have a real one. His backyard was a sort of Zen garden, his Mom is into meditation and such. It was a sunny day and I felt nice and relaxed, kind of doubting the herbs abilities, considering my experience that morning. I loaded a considerably sized bowl onto the can, and lit it up, smoking the entire thing in one hit, and holding it as Josh counted.",
      "I loaded another small bowl as I was holding the smoke. I exhaled the monster hit when Josh got to 30. It was not very harsh like it was in the morning. I immediately took another semi-large hit from the new bowl as I exhaled. I held it for about 15 seconds this time, and lay down on the gravel. It was very rocky, but I soon felt comfortable.",
      "I dont remember how, but I was pulled into a white area, where I could see a blue fuzzy maze of thoughts, and I flew to points in my own head every time a thought crossed my mind. It was a strange sensation, almost like being reduced to the size of a pinhead, and swimming inside my own brain. Josh asked me if I was okay, and I told him to go away and said he was ruining it. I sounded quite violent, I remember, but I didnt want to hurt him at all, he was just pulling me out my salvia-space.",
      "As I opened my eyes (which I didnt remember closing) I saw the trees leading up to the sky in a sort of octagon shape, and this turned into a dark red and ominous circus tent. I was transported there, where I saw the robot-devil from the show Futurama. It sounds far fetched, I know. There was a door on each side of the octagonal room, and the devil exclaimed in his whiny and obnoxious voice PICK A ROOOOM, ANY ROOOM! I wasnt confused, however I was completely oblivious to the fact that I had taken any drug at all.",
      "Inside the first room was a memory of me making a dream catcher with my father when I was about the age of two. There was no way for me to remember this in sobriety, but when I later explained my room in the apartment, which we only lived in for a few months, she said that my description was very accurate. Something told me how this event has affected my personality, but I dont really remember how. I found myself back in the tent, with no devil to be seen. I explored the other seven rooms, and found more memories and their effects on my personality. I cannot really remember what they were, Im not sure why.",
      "As I got back to the tent after the final room, the devil was there yet again, and told me Shhhh, and disappeared. A mysterious old black woman, much like the one from the Matrix trilogy, grabbed my hand and flew me through the top of the tent. I saw all of the trees surrounding yet again and looked at Josh. I had no idea what had just happened. I got up and didnt talk for a few minutes, as I regained my bearings on reality. I felt pleasantly drunk, and explained what happened vaguely to josh.",
      "He was eager to try, and we loaded him a bowl and he smoked it in one hit. He lay down and kept his eyes open the whole time. He told me he saw acorns raining from the trees but disintegrating as they hit him. He looked over and saw little kids playing in his tree, laughing together. I proceeded to take another last hit, finishing off the salvia, but this time I just felt more disoriented, and I did not get pulled into another world. We sat in his garden and thought for a while, and since we were out of salvia, we smoked some weed and watched a movie.",
      "-Experience Two-",
      "One night a couple months ago, my friends Dave and Garret told me they had Salvia, so I snuck out to meet them. They also had weed and some Mikes Hard Lemonade. I drank some of the Mikes, and then sat down to smoke a bowl of the weed with them. As soon as it was done, I told them to bust out the Salvia. I was a bit anxious to try this in the dark, as I had done it in the daytime before. I took a big hit, and held it as long as I could before exhaling. Nothing happened, and I told him to load a bit more. I took another big hit, and exhaled, but this time I didnt clear the bowl. So I took one more big hit and got some nice hot ash in my mouth.",
      "I felt like I was being pulled down, but that feeling soon passed as I saw the horizon turn into multicolored lines, much like the ones of the maze in my first experience, but this time it was on a black background instead of a white one (Night and day?). I began to feel like I was surfing on the lines, almost like flying in a dream. These visuals soon managed to turn themselves into a blank blue wall, on which there was a diamond shaped wooden object protruding from the walls with space in the middle. There was a hamster or a mouse or something representing myself inside it, and soon the blue wall turned into a sort of coal mine like area, and the diamond shaped object began sliding down the mine, and I hit a wall.",
      "I felt as if I was going through the seven stages of grief. These are Shock, Denial, Bargaining, Guilt, Anger, Depression, and Acceptance. At first I was quite wierded out and not believing this was really going on at all. But soon I just began denying to myself that I had taken a drug and this was just a dream, and I broke through the wall. The diamond kept sliding down the mine, and as it did something began talking to me. I told it to let me go, but it wouldnt, and I felt like I made an awful decision for taking a drug at all. I was angry with myself and feeling very trapped and like Id never come back down.",
      "But as I broke through the second to last wall, I felt a ray of hope, and realized that I'd some down eventually. I hit the last wall, and nothing happened. I waited, and talked to Dave and garret while this was going on, even though all I could see was the mine. Soon the wall broke open and I saw them yet again. I was amazed and shocked at how intense that experience was. It was almost like grieving for the death of my own ego.",
      "We left, and started walking towards our friend Phils house. I felt like I was on autopilot, very numb and my mind was clouded but happy. I had a burst of euphoria and stared at a streetlight and ran around in a four-way intersection, then hugged a stop sign, thinking it was the only thing that I could really connect to. Soon after this we decided to part ways and I walked home. I got in fine, even though I was quite stoned and still feeling the salvia.",
      "-Experience 3-",
      "Today, I had the most profound Salvia experience Ive had, and it is what prompted me to write all of this in the first place. I was with a few of my friends on the Ave again, and I decided to run over to store I got the first salvia package at and grab a disc of the Purple Sticky Salvia 5x again. I purchased it, and went home. It had been waiting in my drawer for about a week, and I told josh I had another pack of it.",
      "This morning I slept in quite late, until 2:00, and I was drifting in and out of vivid dreams. I called josh, and he came over a half hour later. I felt at ease, and told my mom we were going to get a bite to eat. She left, to my surprise so I called her and asked when she was going to be back. She said she was taking my sister downtown and wouldnt be back for about an hour. Josh and I decided to just smoke it undercover in my backyard, which was very visible and not such a great idea. I loaded a small bowl and I knew that I was about to experience something big, but I did not hesitate, and something told me to just smoke it.",
      "I pulled in the smoke fast and hard and I didnt even feel it burn at all. I held it in for about 20 seconds before I exhaled hard. Josh asked if I felt anything, and I said yeah, go over there. I pointed to the opposite side of the yard. I realized it was raining, and I laughed and said oh yeah you dont want to get wet, when he just scooted over under the cover. I proceeded to say Holy shit Im about to be fucked up! Everything became quite wavy and weird, and I lost my sense of self. I suddenly found myself watching a very hard to explain person living, and I kind of felt like they were me, but soon I sort of zoomed out and saw that my hands were touching a large mysterious circle, and I was standing on a grass hill.",
      "I saw that there was another person standing quite close with his hands touching the circle. I realized I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. I was intrigued and looked deeper into the circle. I soon realized that everyone was connected to the circle, and their futures all come together in the center of the circle. The center represented something like the end, or maybe god. Either way I was scared beyond words and I could not bring myself to look at the center itself, for fear that it would essentially be a spoiler of my future.",
      "I found myself back with the people on the outside, but things had changed. I was now in a warehouse with many little worker type things connected to everything. I saw them all and they didnt know how to help a panicked thing like me, and they ignored me. I looked over at Josh, who was laughing at me. He was the first thing I could remotely make up that was in reality. I saw his nose become the very point of the body of time or space or material. I moved closer to it, and his faces became numerous and were bestowed upon the many workers.",
      "I then noticed a void between his nose and upper lip, where a worker was absent, and a switch was not flipped. The surrounding workers laughed at me, knowing I was going to discover the void. At this time, my neighbor pulled in the drive way (I was not aware), and Josh got up and tried to get me to snap out of it and come inside. All of the playdohey workers began turning into more than just faces, and I felt workers grow where my mouth was, and I suddenly took a large breath. Josh grabbed my hand and it was slightly wet, and I felt all the water workers appear around me. I was being pulled into reality a bit too quickly, and I was very disoriented and afraid of what Id just seen.",
      "He brought me into my house, and I sat at the kitchen counter. I was very out of it, and trying to make sense of what I had seen, and what I was seeing at the time. I had lost all sense of sobriety while in salvia-land, and I felt like I had been ripped apart into a puzzle made of the workers, and someone else came and put the workers back. However many of them were out of place and I didnt feel the same as before. I tried to recount my experience to Josh, but I could not explain it very well. I asked if he wanted to smoke some and he said sure, so we went to my bathroom since the neighbors were home, and as he was getting ready to smoke it, my dad pulled in the drive way. Talk about everything going bad fast.",
      "We put it all away, and started listening to music. I just thought for a while, and it was quite a strange feeling to be back in my own mind again. I still have a feeling that I was ripped apart and put back together, sort of like the movie timeline, where the characters are ripped apart and put back together in order to transport them through space and time. I then went to dinner with my family, and josh went home. I came home and decided to write this report, and here I am now."

      "Part of me despises my need to put things into words, for fear of overlaying something profoundly indescribable with a limited definition. On the other hand I want to do what I can to process and absorb it, and writing it down is my way of thinking it through.",
      "And there again, thinking it through seems the wrong way to go about it, too. The rational mind cannot compute the idea of opposites being simultaneously true: being and not-being, for example.",
      "To evolve, we need to be able to understand things in a way that is not confined to the rational perspective. But I can only start with thinking, and writing.",
      "There was no emotional content: no reassurance, no ecstasy. Nor any terror or danger. Nor was it the void. This was a place beyond either love or indifference.",
      "I was being pulled and drawn through patterned fractals. They were visible in an endless curving procession, leading into infinity  identical patterns, as though the same layer was strobing. I knew that this had been happening for ever and would go on happening for ever. I knew that I had been moving through it for all eternity, and always will.",
      "I was dimly aware that back in our dimension, on my right-hand side, my best friend was holding my hand. At the same time, and this astonished me as much as anything, the physical sensation of being twisted and pushed  upwards and around, following the curve of the fractals  was overwhelming. It was as strong as feeling a comb being pulled through me, travelling up my spine. I felt a brief anxiety about being split and torn apart, with part of me attached to something on the right and the rest of me being so forcefully extruded. Then I was simply there, moving swiftly, unaware of my hand any more.",
      "Looking up Mandelbrot set on Wikipedia this morning, I found an image that approximates what I saw (although the patterns were different, and you have to imagine everything curving and a strong physical sense of being twisted, forced through and along. The article has some amazing pictures  shame I have nofuckingidea what they are talking about!!!",
      "I felt as though each fractal represented another plane of reality that I might have stepped out into. But the relentless, uncontrollable forward motion meant that I kept moving through and past each fractal plane before having a chance to integrate. It was as though I could have incarnated at any of these points, but the onward motion was too pressing. Part of me felt dismayed by this. There was a sense of wanting to stop the ride and get off somewhere, a desire to be somewhere more familiar, or at least with familiar energies around me, not this endless, tireless procession of replication. The exact-sameness of it unnerved me slightly. It was very different from the volcanic diversity that I become aware of on mushrooms.",
      "Sometimes Outlook Express doesnt open straight away, and then when it does I get a few Outlook windows on the screen all at once. This was like that, only multiplied infinitely, and the sensation of it was rather like wanting to go into Outlook and instead being unable to stop the millions upon millions of Outlooks constantly opening on my screen before I had time to do anything with them.",
      "I gradually became aware that in a little bubble of brightness over on my right was the tiny illusion that we call reality, with my friend sitting on the sofa in it. I knew that when I opened my eyes, I would be drawn back into this illusion and it would start feeling real again. Although I was not happy where I was, I felt there was an element of helpless capitulation in returning to this bubble and accepting it as real. It seemed so insignificant. It also felt self-constructed. I identified strongly with it, but in the way that you might be reluctant to sell a picture that youd spent a long time painting. I had a sense of this clinging and reluctance being a human idiosyncracy that traps us at a lower level of evolution. But I was afraid to let go of my attachment to this world, in case I never came back to it.",
      "Such a paradox, feeling unable to let go of something that I now understood to be insignificant! I was unable to think or feel fast enough to deal with this dilemma. It was too much. Part of me just gave up, something along the lines of What the hell, I may as well go back, I need time to work this out.",
      "When I did open my eyes, everything was the same and not the same. Everything was intensely still. Things looked bigger and heavier. The silence was heavier. The words we spoke were slower and heavier. When I finally moved, I felt heavier. There was no doubt that this was the world I had left ten minutes ago. Yet, although nothing had changed in it, and it gradually settled back to normal, in some ways it will never be the same again.",
      "My investment in and attachment to the illusion of this dimension seems to be what perpetuates it, making it seem real and solid. I wouldnt have thought I was capable of creating and sustaining something so complex and convincing, but this doubt seems to be the only obstacle to grasping the power to generate a whole lot more besides.",
      "Out there, I had the sense of other intelligences having managed this transformation long ago. There is a lot of catching up to do.",
      "But then, since time and space have no meaning, there are no other intelligences and the catching-up was done long ago. For all of eternity, I have been, and always will be, both able and unable to exist as pure creative consciousness.",
      "I must still be out there now, except that the words still and out there have no meaning.",
      "Thinking it through, this morning",
      "What was this experience showing me? There was something plant-like about it (like being the sap travelling within roots as they push into the soil?), and yet I am human. I wondered a little about the fact that salvia is an unusual plant, cultivated mostly from genetically identical clones and whether this explains, on some level, the repetitious patterning of the consciousness that this plant shares with us.",
      "Or is it that the entire universe is not unique, but replicated ad infinitum? In which case everything I ever grieved to lose, or hoped to gain, is meaningless. Behind me are universes in which everything is already complete. Ahead of me are identical universes in which everything thats ended here is only just beginning.",
      "A lot of this information is not welcome. It will take a while to adjust to it. I dont embrace it with delight. I feel some resistance, which in itself will take me a while to locate and fathom out.",

      "Husband (L) and I had a pleasant experience with 5 HBWR seeds each a few weeks ago and decided to up the dose a little. I am more experienced with psychoactives than my husband. We were both well rested and had no other plans this weekend other than this trip. I misjudged how many seeds we had in the pack and realized we only had 6 HBWR left each so we decided to add 20 Ololiuqui (Rivea Corymbosa) seeds to up the LSA dosage. All seeds were obtained from vendors online and were organic.",
      "Preparation:",
      "We scraped the coating off of the HBWR seeds with our fingernails the best that we could - which took a little bit of time. I added the 6 HBWR seeds and then the 20 Ololiuqui seeds into a coffee grinder and ground it as fine as possible. I did one dose and then the other so we had the same amount of material. We then put the material into a large shot glass each and added a shot of Absolut (vodka) Peach to each glass. We have had very positive results (no nausea, no cramps, no ill effects) doing the HBWR the same way both times we've tried it. We let the shots chill in the fridge for 1 hour before we injested the concoction.",
      "T 0:00",

Sparks huge conversation on the nature of time in a very Kurt Vonnegut sense (watching the same episode of the Flintstones while you're a child while watching it as an adult and both episodes are touching each other). Both of us agree we are tripping after this conversation. Feeling the time dialation very strongly.",

Time has slowed down and seems like we've been watching the TV forever. Decide that we want to change the mood and light candles, turn off all other lights in the house, and turn on TV. I know this is weird but we turned on a music channel called 'Soundscapes' which is new age music channel, muted the sound so that we could only see the slide show of pictures which were basically mountain, lake and nature scenes.",
      "L takes out his guitar and I pull out a strumstick (another stringed instrument) and we spent the time while we were peaking jamming on the instruments. We also had fun while L played music to match each of the silent pictures that were coming up on the muted TV screen. Much singing and laughing. Both of us notice that the candles are leaving an after image and I experience some trails. Both of us see patterns and we're definitely in a very creative space. Lots of laughing.",

We did not have any ill effects at all with the HBWR and both of us commented on the fact that if this preperation works we shouldn't deviate from it.  We both had light headaches the day after trip. Creative ideas that we had during the trip have become projects we will be working on. L has commented on the fact that he feels that he had a creativity breakthrough in terms of the guitar and this has helped his approach his recording a little bit differently.",

      "This report focuses on how St. John's has helped my depression an unbelieveable amount, but if you don't really suffer from depression St. John's is a great calming drug just for the experience as well.  I occasionaly will given my roomate one, and he always mentions that he notices that he feels really good, extra-calm, and happy...  I've taken two at a time for fun, and there's an especially nice happiness and relaxing sensation (I have not tried more than 2 at once).",
      "After reading many online reports about St. John's, I kept contemplating back and forth about whether to try it or not...  One day I had an issue come up that I knew would send me into a depression, so I knew it was time to give it a shot.  I bought a bottle of 300mg capsules from a local grocery store and just followed the directions on the bottle (which were to take one tablet 3 times daily). So I started with that and have been taking it faithfully (except for once) for about 4 months now. ",
      "For as long as I can remember I've always felt isolated from the world and incredibly hesitant about things like talking to people I don't know or being in new situations.  With St. John's I feel much more at ease and less worried about most everything (what I imagine a 'normal' person feels like).  Example: Before if I'd said something weird to someone (not mean or cruel, just something I looked back at and thought was weird), I would get mad and stay mad at myself for a long time for being 'not normal' and be afraid of what they thought of me.  St. John's has calmed me down significantly and allowed me to finally actually relax. ",
      "Looking back, I used to see everyday things as almost a hassle to have to go through and derived very little real enjoyment from them (classes, work, watch tv, etc.).  Now I do most of things I've always done, but I actually enjoy doing them significantly more.  I've had a noticeable difference not just in my personal feelings, but multiple people have said remarked on how I've become dramatically less worried/guarded and more friendly and talkative.",
      "After about a month of taking it, I decided to stop for a few days and see if I could do without it (just because of the desire that I didn't want to be dependent on something).  In those days I became nervous about everything and twitchy like i'd always been before (well slightly worse, probably because I actually knew more of what it was like to feel normal as I hadn't before).  As I said, I used to get mad at myself for doing a simple weird thing, but unlucky for myself during these days I actually did do something pretty stupid.  Instead of the old 'pissed off at myself' attitude, I felt totally and completely worthless, one of the worst days I've ever had mentally...  After my failed experiment to see if I had been 'cured', I swiftly went back to the suggested regimen and will be sticking to it for the forseeable future.",
      "After taking a capsule, I would say the effects slowly fade in within 30 mins-1 hour or so, 'peak' at 4 or so hours, and are starting to fade away by the sixth hour.  The directions on what I bought say 3 tablets daily, and that's a pretty accurate timing-wise.  I take one in the morning with breakfast, one at lunch, and one at dinner (and one later in the evening if I plan on staying up late)...  I still feel a little depression: a slight bit some mornings before the St. John's has a chance to kick in, and random other ocassions like when i can't keep my schedule of taking it.  But these times aren't that horribly bad, as I know that within just a little while of taking it those feelings will fade away.",
      "I really can't believe how I could have suffered from depression for years and a great help was sitting next to the Tylenol in the grocery store and cost about 10 cents per capsule.  There isn't a 'cure' for depression in anything or anyone, but for me this has been an amazing way to help control and dramatically improve my everyday life.  If I had only have found this 4 or 5 years ago... but since I can't go back in time I'm just glad I discovered it when I did."

      "The trip I am writing about was my first trip with any psychedelic. It took place more than five years ago. I am writing about it because it changed my life more than anything I have ever done. Before the trip, I had been severely depressed for four years. I attempted suicide twice and had other suicide plans that I was unable to carry out. I wanted to die, and the primary reason for the trip was a hope that it would either reduce the depression or that it would be so bad that it would help me end my life. It was a long time ago, so the times are just rough estimates. I do not remember all of the details.",
      "T+0:00 I thoroughly chew 12 seeds and swallow. The taste is horrible, and stays around for a while.",
      "T+2:00 It has been a couple of hours, and I am not feeling much. My vision is altered in a way that is hard to define.",
      "T+3:00 Definitely feeling altered and the nausea has gotten worse. Everything looks different. I feel terrible, mentally and physically. I would not call these effects psychedelic, just fucked up in a bad way.",
      "T+4:00 Around this time the nausea hits a peak and I vomit. After that, I start to dry heave. This continues for maybe 15 minutes.",
      "T+4:30 I feel so bad. I want to die. My body feels poisoned and my mood is one of despair. I want this to end now. I am going to try to sleep.",
      "T+5:00 I can't sleep. The lights are out and I can see the visuals now. They consist of multicolor blobs, similar to a lava lamp. This is the only trip where I saw this type of visual. The nausea has subsided, but the despair has intensified. I now feel as if I am going insane. I feel intense regret over how terribly I have been treating my parents and anyone else I have the chance to mistreat. I have said the most horrible things to my parents daily for the last two years. It is not because I hate them, I have just been so miserable. I wished my mother would have had an abortion, and I have told her that. The tears of sorrow keep flowing.",
      "T+5:30 I feel worse than I ever have before. I want to kill myself. Time is moving so slowly. The last 30 minutes seem more like 30 hours. I look at my watch expecting to see that an hour has passed but find that it has been only a minute or two. Time has never moved so slowly, before or since. I feel nothing but disgust with myself. I deserve to suffer. I am a horrible person.",
      "T+6:00 Time is still crawling by at an unimaginably slow pace. I feel that I am permanently insane. I fear that I will be stuck in this hellish state for eternity. I feel a mix of mostly negative emotions. Regret, fear, self-hatred, hopelessness. Guilt for treating my parents like shit. I also feel love for the few people I am close to. I usually cant feel that. This is the closest thing to hell I have ever felt. If this lasts forever, I feel it will be what I deserve. The temperature feels uncomfortably cold. There is not a moment of comfort in this.",
      "T+8:00 I can feel it starting to wear off. This is a great relief. It won't last forever after all. I still feel like shit. I still feel the sorrow and regret. I want more than anything to change. I want to be a nicer person. I want the depression to go away. I can't see anyway to change, and that is something I can't take.",
      "T+9:00 Feeling a mixture of negative emotions and peacefulness. Even moments of euphoria.",
      "T+10:00 The deepest peace and well-being has washed over me. I have never felt like this before. I am crying again, but this time it is tears of joy. I know I can change. I feel like things will get better. This is the first time I have felt hopeful in years. Tomorrow, I am going to apologize for the things I have said and done. I can't change the past, but I can make the future better. I will not continue to treat people so badly. I feel like this will last.",
      "T+11:00 The peacefulness and well-being are not as strong now, but I still feel good and I feel that things have changed. I am tired, and soon I will sleep.",
      "T+12:30 This is around the time I got to sleep, still feeling peace and comfort.",
      "Next day: I feel very good. There are some feelings of regret over my behavior the last few years, but overall I feel good. The depression has lifted for the first time in years.",
      "For over a week, the depression was completely erased. It did come back gradually after that, but never as bad as it was before the trip. I have also treated people much better since the trip. During the trip, I was able to empathize with others much better than usual. It has been over five years, so it seems the improvement was permanent. This was probably the most important night of my life, and definitely the most important trip. I don't think I would be alive today if I had not found something to alleviate the depression. I still use psychedelics, and they will usually get rid of the depression for 2-4 weeks after use. I have tried a variety of antidepressants. None have worked. Psychedelics are the only things that have helped.",
      "I have recently started using piracetam and choline. That seems to be helping. I notice a mood lift after dosing. At the time of writing, it has been over a month since a DPT trip, and the depression is still gone. I dont know if it is just from the DPT, or if the piracetam and choline are helping."

      "I've had a love for pills since I was in the 5th grade.  That was the solution, or rather the postponement of all my problems and depression.  I was just an occasional user at first, no one does dope when they're 11, so I just stole diet pills and painkillers from my family members when I got the chance.  I loved the way they felt, the world became beautiful and I felt love for people in a way I had never dreamed about.  This occasional use continued until I was in the 8th grade.",
      "It started out innocently enough, I asked a friend for some of his ritalin one day.  I got that rush like I had gotten from phen-fen, but it wasn't as cold or empty.  It was pure pleasure.  So I took a few ritalin tablets a couple times a week for a while.  I was hanging out with my good friend T, his brother and his brother's friends, who were seniors in highschool and this one guy who was a little older.  I saw them snorting the ritalin I brought over and with reluctance at first tried it.  It was so much quicker and much more intense than taking the pills orally.  I started doing this everyday and my tolerance built up fast.  I started snorting 9 or 10 pills at a time after that.  I was very lucky, several of my friends were perscribed ritalin and they gave it to me for free.  So I had a seemingly endless amount of it.",
      "8th grade was one big stimulated party.  I had all of these great friends and a great girlfriend who brought me a very fufilling sex life.  Then I started falling back into my depression that still haunts me today.  It was reset by that girlfriend who broke it off with me when I was out of control on many different chemicals.  I forgot to say, I had been doing lots of different pharmecuticals, smoking pot and drinking considerably, but my love for ritalin eclipsed all other drugs at that time.  When she broke up with me I went on a binge that lasted two more years with intensity and is still visible today.  I got over her eventually, there have been many other girls since, that was like the match that started a forest fire.  I started doing Adderall and dexidrine with alarming regularity.",
      "Amphetamines make me feel like I'm invincible for a while, but after a few sleepless nights they make me a victim in every way conceivable.  I experience horrifying hallucinations that aren't restricted to vision. I heard evil, I looked evil in the face, I felt evil crawling under my skin, I had become evil.  It was paralyzing.  I did horrible things to myself and other people with no apologies.  I had become depraved.  Self-inflicted scars from this time are still very visible all over my body.  I didn't feel real at all, so I pushed the level of my psychosis to the limit as far as pain and inhumanity went.  During this time I was in 9th grade and rediscovered drinking, and started doing coke, crank and oxycodone.  But the amphetamines were always by my side, in my stomache or up my nose.  I was found out by my parents and was sent to counseling 3 times a week once they discovered the extent of my problem.  I was later diagnosed with a severe depressive disorder and borderline schizophrenia (I am currently on the maximum perscribed dosage of wellbutrin and 10 mgs of Zyprexa a day). ",
      "In the 10th grade I gave up on friends completely and spent all of my saved money on amphetamines from countless dealers and bored classmates.  I put my parents through so much hell.  I told my mom I would kill her if she touched me, even hugged me.  I made her cry on a daily basis.  It sent my dad into depression, he is now medicated too and we are doing so much better.",
      "I still do pills sometimes, but limit myself.  I smoke pot occasionally and drink quite a bit, but I'm content.  I'm not hurting anyone or myself anymore and I found the medication combination that is right for me.  I still feel guilty for all of the inhuman things I did to people and I fear I will carry that guilt for the rest of my life.  Don't let speed get a hold of you, EVER.  It is the most sinister drug out there and will turn you against everyone in the world, even those who love you; the ones you can't feel love for when your hooked."

      "The following is a recent experience I had with Dramamine. Due to my inability to recall all that happened in this long endeavor, I've been filled in on some major events by a sober trip sitter, 'H.'",
      "Setting: About 8p.m. Good mindset. Took 600mg of Dramamine the previous night, but did not reach desired effects. Decided to take 18 pills [900mg] with 'L.' Accompanied by 'H' who remained sober.",
      "T+ 0:00 Ingested 18 pills with L. Horribly bitter. Both of us take them on empty stomachs. Stupid as we are, we carelessly tossed the empty pill sleeves aside. [Keep this in mind for later.]",
      "T+ 0:20 Starting to feel first effects. Feeling very heavy and 'drunk.' I make an attempt to walk up the stairs and stumble numerous times. I was shaking pretty bad.",
      "T+ 0:30 We all decide to take a walk outside. It was a cold fall night, so we all start layering warm clothes. I tell H and L to wait for me, because I had to go to the bathroom first. I walk into the bathroom and sit on the toilet. I immediately forgot what I was there for. I looked around. I sat for a couple minutes. I was also chewing gum at the time and I found it very hard to multi-task. I began to pee, but forgot I was chewing gum, and it fell out of my mouth. I had to stop what I was doing, pop the gum back into my mouth and finish peeing. This was a difficult excursion.",
      "T+ 0:40 We're finally outside. This is where I starting experience my first open-eye visuals. We walked down L's driveway and I looked up the street. I saw two grown men on children's bikes, barreling down the street. They were wearing business suits, their ties flapping wildly behind them. I shouted to H and L 'Bi-cyclists! Watch for the bi-cyclists!' half laughing, half serious. I looked at H and she just laughed. This was very, very confusing. I looked back up the street. The cyclists were gone. I wasn't really noticing the drunken stumble feeling anymore, although Im sure it was there.",
      "T+ 0:55 We walked around the block a few times. I wasn't seeing many visuals, and I didn't FEEL really messed up, but I'm sure by then I was. L was also feeling strong effects at this point too. At one point, L shouted 'COPPPS!' I forgot how messed up L was, and I actually believed that there were cops coming after us. My first instinct was to run. It felt like I was running faster than I ever had before. For some reason, sober H ran with us too. Trying to 'evade the cops coming after us,' I took a sharp right into what I thought was L's backyard. It turned out it was her neighbors' yard. Convinced it was L's, though, I started trudging through the piles of leaves and rocks looking for the door. A couple minutes later, L came into the neighbor's yard and said 'Hey, the house is over here, let's go.' I felt extreme relief, knowing I didn't have to stomp through the yard alone, looking for the door anymore. I grabbed L's hand.",
      "T+ 1:30 I have no idea what we did for a half hour period or so after getting to L's house. I do recall us all going outside for a smoke. I really didn't comprehend that I was smoking, but I did anyway. My cigarette just sort of dangled between my fingers, and I ended up taking only about 2 drags before it was down to the butt. With H's help, I lit up another. I walked inside the house and H shouted 'Hey, no smoking in the house.' Without responding, I stuck my arm out the door, but kept my body inside the house. I thought I was so clever for coming up with this, though I'm sure I looked ridiculous. All I recall other than this was L shouting 'Kitty!' [her cat Kitty was inside asleep]",
      "T+ 1:45 - 4:00 We went into L's room and I laid down on the bed. L was on the floor, and H sat on the edge of the bed. At this point I just sort of drifted into a dreamlike state. Hours drifted by. But time was gone. I was having the most vivid hallucinations ever, and I honestly thought the things I was seeing were real. I was talking to myself too. L was gone into a dreamstate too. But H listened to everything I said. I remember having telling her in detail how I had to 're-vacuum the floor six times' and how 'the dishwashers are creepy.' Several times I'd begin a sentence, then forget what I was talking about. I'd stare blankly for a couple minutes, then remember what I had started to say several minutes before. Everytime this happened, H would just say 'What are you talking about?' and giggle furiously. This was almost frustrating. 'Why doesn't she know what I'm talking about? Am I speaking gibberish or something? I don't get it!' I often found myself thinking.",
      "Perhaps the most vivid of hallucinations occurred when I saw a phone appear in front of me. It was floating and ringing. I reached out and answered it. It was 'my mom.' I had a good 5 minute conversation with her. It felt so real. She explained how she would pick me up the next morning and we'd go run errands. When I hung the phone up, it disappeared. I blinked numerous times, and ran my hands across the bed looking for it, figuring I had dropped it. I asked H to help me find it and she just raised an eyebrow. I looked away and decided to stand on the bed. Talking to no one in particular, I inquired, 'Where'd everyone go? The dishwashers were here a second ago.' There I was, going on about dishwashers again.",
      "Soon after, my eyes came in contact with my hands. My hands! I could see each individual cell! I began counting them, losing count after about 7 or so. I had to show L. Who was still laying on the floor, looking at the ceiling. I believe our brief conversation went like this: 'L, look at your hands! Look! At the cells!'  'There are baby spiders,' She replied.  'No, look at your cells! You can count them!' I explained again. 'Woah, radiator, was her only response.",
      "I laid next to L and looked at the ceiling to see what she was going on about. The radiator was sliding around on the ceiling, forward, backward, around. As if it was teasing me. I shouted to H to 'fix the fucking radiator!' But little did I know, H had left the room and gone to bed quite some time ago.",
      "T+ 4:30? Time was still lost. I had no idea what else I had been doing during these hours, after H went to bed and was no longer accounting for my actions. I'm assuming I just sat on the bed, having conversations with people that weren't really there. I'm sure if I was in this mental state out in public people would think I was a schizophrenic crack whore. I do remember closing my eyes at one point, and picturing the Dean of Discipline from my school appearing at Ls house in her pajamas and a sweatshirt, knocking on the door because she knew what we did. This seemed very real, and for a 5 minute period, I really did think the Dean of Discipline was waiting outside the door for us. I tried to remain quiet. The anxious feeling subsided quickly.",
      "T: 5:00? L's mom, who had been working the late shift, arrived home. As stated at the beginning of this account, we had carelessly tossed aside the empty pill sleeves. So it came as no surprise that L's mom stormed upstairs, gripping the sleeves with a confused look. L managed to tell her mom that she had found the pill sleeves sitting in the backyard and just threw them away. But L's mom wasn't stupid. She asked L why she was shaking so bad [apparently the shaking feeling we experienced at the beginning of the trip never subsided] and why her pupils were so big. Fucked up and confused, L came clean. L's mom then approached me and shook the empty sleeves in my face. 'And how many did you take?' she snarled. Still tripping hard, the room suddenly transformed into a quiz show like setting. I raised my finger and said, almost with a smile, '18 pills as well, Mrs. _____'",
      "T+ 5:20 L's mom told me to call my parents. I didn't realize how screwed up I was until I actually tried to hold a conversation with my own mother. I was stuttering, forgetting what I was saying. All I managed to say was 'Mom, some shit went down and M's house, you have to come over now.' She asked me why I wasn't at L's house. I realized my mistake and corrected myself. 'Mom, I'm at L's house and you need to come over now.' She asked me what happened and I just kept telling her it was a long story and I'd tell her when she got to Ls. Needless to say my mother was confused, I had just woken her up in the middle of the night telling her to come pick me up. I handed the phone to L's mom and she finished talking to my mom. I heard the word 'overdose' several times. I paid no mind. When I made my way up to L's room, she was furiously ripping drug posters off the wall, hiding things, ripping things apart. All I could manage to say was 'Oh, shit. But for some reason, I didnt feel scared or anxious that we had just gotten caught. I dont think I fully grasped the situation.",
      "T+ 5:50 When my parents arrived, we all sat down at L's kitchen table. Our parents discussed whether to take us to the hospital or not, and decided against it since the pills had probably fully absorbed into our systems anyway. My parents were trying to talk to me, but I was completely zoned out. Numerous times I tried to text my other friends 'Oh shit, we got caught.' I'd type the whole message and look down to see I wasn't even holding my phone. My parents would ask me things, and I'd just stare blankly. L later told me she had been 'watching TV in her water glass the whole time, until the news came on and she turned it off.' All of us sat at the kitchen table for a good hour or so, our parents just watching us as if we were gonna drop dead.",
      "T+ 6:45 When my parents decided to take me home, I almost felt sober. But I was far from it. Whilst walking to the car, I looked across the street at some large oak trees [which I realized several weeks later, were not there to begin with]. I squinted, and saw my friend K scurry out from behind the trees. For some reason, I said 'Good, she's escaped the wrath.' My mom just looked at me as if about to cry. The car ride home was an awkward and long one. Ten minutes into it, I broke the silence with a spastic 'Yakkkk!' noise. I believe this was due to a hallucination of an animal walking in front of the car, and yak was the first animal I could think of.",
      "Upon arriving home, I went straight into my bedroom and collapsed onto my bed. I have no idea how long I laid there before falling asleep. When I did finally fall asleep, it was a deep deep sleep, interrupted occasionally by lucid dreams.",
      "When I woke up the next morning, I felt sober, but shitty. It wasn't really a 'hangover' feeling, but it was something. Something wrong. I walked to the door and attempted to open it. It felt like my hand was sinking through the door. It had been a good 15 hours since ingestion and I was STILL not completely back to normal.",
      "Overall, I think the Dramamine experience was totally stupid. It seemed fun at the time, but it left me so totally inept and incapable of doing anything it's ridiculous. Since the experience, Ive had a friend [K, the one who I previously described as scurrying out from behind an oak tree] go to the hospital from a Dramamine overdose [1200 mg]. Of all the drugs Ive had experiences with, Dramamine is definitely the one that left me the most out of it. It is no way a social drug, and if I had to put it in a category, Id describe it as a dissociative hallucinogen, with periods of time similar to a Ketamine k-hole and a heavy mushroom trip, mixed with temporary mental retardation."

      "I wieghed out 20mg each (we wanted to start low)",
      "L snorted hers first. By the time I had wieghed out mine and snorted it, she was already lifting off.",
      "One note about snorting DMT, be sure it is really clean. Ours was snow white and glistened. Looked like crushed up glass. Purity is important. Who wants to put garbage up their precious sinuses?",
      "L and I layed on the bed for a short bit. I could feel it rising up. Then, like some one flicked on a light switch, it hit.",
      "I do not have a solid recollection of all the events that transpired, but I do recall L saying I looked like an Alex Grey painting. I laughed and then she did as well. How amazing that he captures this experience so well in his art.",
      "about 15-20 min into the experience, L and I locked eyes. At first if was as if they were negotiating some sort of network connection, then they just locked completely.",
      "At this moment, the whole scene around me dissolved into colored lines all seperated in black space with just a single set of eyes in the middle. They werent hers or mine, just eyes observing the ever-present now.",
      "This must has lasted for about a minute before we disengaged and reclaimed our own perspectives in our own bodies.",
      "I confirmed with L that she had the same experience as I did. We were both truely astounded by this.",
      "A little bit later, L told me she was confused and lost and needed help. I gently held her, helping to ground her and allowing her to relax and let go of whatever it was that was bothering her. The energy passed and we both rested until sleep came.",
      "We woke up feeling well rested and quite hungry.",
      "All in all, it was a beautiful experience.",
      "Though there is very little literature on the subject, DMT is definitly active when snorted. The burn is pretty bad but it subsides quickly. We both had some residual sinus sorness the next day but nothing horrible (I've snorted far far worse)",
      "I hope to experiment some more with this method, employing higher doses. I'm curious to also try 20mg again with out LSD, as I'm wondering how much of a difference it will make. Seems like LSD potentiates DMT quite a bit."

      "The first time I took the stuff, I had a modest habit. I could handle an oxy 80, I could handle almost half a bundle of dope (that's 5 bags). I put 8mg suboxone under my toungue, melted for half an hour, and got wasted. I was nodding out while I was standing, for christ's sake. I never barfed, as I had grown such a tolerance to the nausea by then.",
      "The strange thing about bupe, it's bioavailibility via the sublingual route seems to be subject to change based on environmental factors. It appears that smoking or chewing tobacco before the melt process hinders absorbtion. Also, talking durring administration seems to have a negative affect.",
      "Suboxone doesn't give me much euphoria. Especially after the first dose. Taking bupe every day makes the euphoria disapear. I was on the clinic, and after the first or second day, my buzz left..Snorting the tablets works, and much much better. I never beleived it until I tried it. I thought the naloxone would make me sick, but it didn't. I prefer to snort this drug, despite it's icky taste.",
      "Injecting the bupe works. Again, the naloxone does nothing. I've tried it, many many times. I watched others do it first, and could not beleive it. I thought for sure the naloxone would give me withdrawals.\r[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.]",
      "Here's a story of what not to do. I was on the bupe clinic for 9 months. At the end, I had relapsed on oxies. I had peddled some bupes away to get drug money, and was short on my pills at the end of the month. I went four full days without the bupe and was sick as hell. I knew that all the bupe was out of my system, so if I took some, the euphoria would come back. I got my refill, and I proceeded to take 5 8mg bupes (snorted one and melted 3) and I mixed it with 10 mg of klonopin. I got really high, so high in fact that I nodded out for the first time in years. I almost puked. I got heartburn from respitory depresstion. I got the opiate hiccups. I could actually feel how shallow my breaths had become, and it scared me.",
      "I feel as though my use of the drug lead to me having a more viscious habit."

      "Im a middle aged male, passionately interested in psychoactives.  Ive taken on psychedelics as a personal study and have worked with many different substances.  I have also experimented with other psychoactives, but I am primarily drawn to psychedelics for the benefits they bring in the way of personal growth and enlightenment.",
      "Im going to provide a brief account of a 2C-T-2 trip I took on the weekend, but first, I want to talk about rectal administration of psychedelics. Perhaps you wont want to hear about it, dont want the details, its yucky  or perhaps it somehow compromises your sexual identity? Well, I guess the first thing I would consider is this: If you are reading this right now, you probably have an interest in psychedelics.  If the idea of administering a drug rectally makes you squirm, or blush, or feel sick or embarrassed, perhaps a few more doses of psychedelic medicine might help you get beyond those fears. Seriously, Im not trying to be a smartass here  there are just bigger things in life to worry about. If you enter into this field of research and self discovery for any serious length of time, leaping over invisible barriers like these is inevitable, and who knows, if you read on, it might be as beneficial for you as it has been for me!",
      "Your first question might be: Why?",
      "Well, a few reasons: rectal administration (also known as plugging, which is a word that provides an un-necessary connotation in my opinion) involves inserting the dose through the anus, where it is absorbed via the epidermal tissue of the rectum. This method avoids the first pass metabolism in the gut, and therefore presents a few potential advantages.  Many people, including myself experience far less body load with this method as well as a much shorter come-up time. I find a significantly smaller dose is required as well, thus using up less of my valuable substance.  Accordingly, one should start low when dosing this way for the first time.  I find a 50% smaller dose than the oral route is a good starting point.",
      "I got into using this method because I suffer from debilitating body load.  I often get nauseous, shaky, crampy, grumpy, you name it.  The 2C family is the worst for me, and I was almost going to swear off them forever until I discovered this administration method via some online research.",
      "With a serene mental set, I put 12 mg of 2C-T-2 powder into a shot glass, dissolved it in about 4 ml of warm water and drew it up into a syringe (no needle!!!).  I then got on my back, leaned upside down against the wall, and inserted the syringe, ejected the dose, and that is it.  It is a bit uncomfortable at first, feeling as if I have to go to the bathroom, but that passes after about 15 minutes or so.  No other ill effects are noted.",
      "First alerts were experienced in about 15 minutes, and I was into a full-on but moderate plus three experience at only about T+01:15.  Typically with 2C-T-2 orally, I am usually peaking at about the 2-2.5 hour mark, so this was a welcome change.  It beats pacing the floors anxiously waiting for the trip to come on.  Most important though is the lack of body load.  I was able to venture out into public and stroll around all day with only minor fatigue.  My typical position while on a 2C family chemical is flat on my back, on the couch, dealing with stomach cramps, muscle tremors and body aches throughout the trip. This day I had little to no nausea, no cramping, only very light tremors/speediness  damn, it was wonderful!",
      "I was aiming to have myself a museum level experience as I believe Shulgin referred to it, and accordingly I went to the local art museum with my awesome psychonaut girlfriend (my sitter on this day) to see how it would all work out.  Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a bit more than a museum level experience.  This 12 mg trip was significantly stronger than a previous 20 mg oral trip, so I was pretty glad I didnt take any more than I did.  Coming up on the train on the way into the city was a bit unusual and trying, but Ive got enough experience now to weather those situations reasonably well, and I had my trusty lover holding my hand through the whole thing. ",
      "Once in the gallery, I found it hard to keep a straight face while the floor was undulating in a sea of waves, and bright chromium flashes of light rippled across the artifacts and paintings.  The effect was a bit strong for gazing at paintings, because I was unable to process the meaning and symbolism behind the artwork, something I enjoy doing.  It was all too complicated for my tripping mind, but the accentuation of colours and the morphing of faces in the portraits was interesting to say the least.  I enjoyed the artwork more after about T+2:00 when the peak began to roll off, and I was able to process my thoughts more clearly by that time.  Apart from a small amount of fatigue my body felt quite nice  slightly numb, and tingly.",
      "This mystical substance opened up my heart fully and allowed me to perceive the artwork to a much deeper level. At one point, while sitting and admiring a huge blown glass piece by William Morris, I was reduced to silent tears, overtaken by the subtle beauty of his work.  I found myself welcoming tears many times that day, wallowing not in pity, but in absolute emotional bliss.  I was nearing baseline by about T+04:00 and smoked a little weed outside, hoping to extend the trip a little.  As we walked back in for one last go-round, I remarked to my girlfriend how much art and psychedelics continue to stimulate my mind, and allow me to sail beyond the storms of everyday life.",
      "After we left the gallery, and a little sad to be embarking on the final leg of my journey, we went down the street for some sushi, and enjoyed some very emotional and stimulating conversation. I almost always experience my most important psychological breakthroughs during the comedown of the trip, after the strong psychedelic effects have begun to dissipate.  I find 2C-T-2 to have tremendous therapeutic benefits. I feel grounded and peaceful after I return to consensus reality, and more in touch with my own true nature. ",
      "This was perhaps the best 2C trip I have had to date. It was a beautiful day.  Thank you for reading. I hope someone out there finds this description of this less used administration method most helpful."

      "I'd always been fascinated with acid, ever since I was 13 or so I'd wanted to try it. Up until then, my drug experiences consisted of smoking weed, almost every weekend in my senior year of high school, and a few times a month since I was 14. As far as alcohol goes, I'd only been drunk twice prior to that, can't stand the taste enough to get drunk easily.",
      "The friend of mine that hooked me up with acid got 2 cubes, one for each of us, but he decided not to dose, so he let me have both, each one was from a different supplier as well. The night I decided to do it, he wasn't there, but I was in my house with my two closest friends. I was in my room, which I can only say is PERFECT to trip out in.... posters and all sorts of stuff covered every inch of my walls and ceilings. My dad was still awake, but for some reason I decided to take the first sugar cube. About 45 minutes passed, and I was starting to get pissed, nothing was happening. I decided, what the hell, I'm gonna take the other cube. Let me just tell you, eating a cube of sugar tasted like shit. I was almost gagging, but I managed to swallow it down. About 2 minutes after taking the second cube, the first one started to kick in. Oh shit. I'd just taken two hits of acid for my first time.",
      "I immediately started smiling and giggling like mad, my walls had started to 'breathe'. I recall looking at this calendar I had, the picture that month was of a field of red flowers, as I looked at the picture, it was if a wind was blowing through the field making the flowers move.. it was quite beautiful. Kelly, who had tripped 100's of times was trying to fuck with me... but it wasn't working, i was just giggling and talking about all the stuff in my room. My anime posters seemed to be starting at me, but it wasn't frightening, because I knew it was only the effects of the drug... \t",
      "For the next couple hours I sat around looking at my walls and talking to my friends, at one point I left my room and was talking to my sister and my dad and watching the wooden cabinets swirl... the whorls in the wood had taken up a life of their own. I remember talking to them and in the back of my mind I was thinking 'Whoa shit, the wood is swirlin'.' I'd managed to make it downstairs. I sat on my computer for a while listening to the Beatles white album, Helter Skelter was playing and I was eating canned fruit, the fruit tasted quite normal... but Helter Skelter was a tad bit scary, so I decided to go upstairs again, at this point I was peaking, it must have been around 2-3am...",
      "I talked to my friends until they fell asleep, and around 5:30am, I sat on my bean bag watching the sunrise from my bedroom window, it was intensely beautiful. At that point I felt an overwhelming presence of God. Not Jesus/personal God, but a divine energy sort of 'God'. I felt as though for a moment in time I'd experienced the presence of something far bigger than myself. I just clearly remember sitting on the bean bag, with my 2 closest friends sleeping on my bed, watching the sunrise, feeling this presence.",
      "At that point, I decided to take a shower, my peak was over, and I was feeling the drug wearing off.. my shower curtain was rippling, it felt as though a wind was caressing it... I fell asleep that morning around 6am, a different person."

      "A friend and I each swallowed a gelcap containing the methyl.one at approximately 10pm.  Initial effects were felt within 15 minutes.  Build to peak was slowish.  With MDMA., once the initial effects are felt, I am usually deep into peak with 5 minutes.  Methylone instead took about 20 minutes to build to a peak which then lasted about half an hour to forty five minutes.  I was initially disappointed by the short duration of the peak.  During the peak however I found much less jaw clenching, a more relaxed incarnation of the 'mellow energy' that MDMA provides.  Very enjoyable.",
      "However within 5 - 10 minutes after the end of the peak I felt this wave of energy come over me, and within seconds my muscles were tense, my jaw was clenching and I had the most ridiculous burst of energy reminding me of my days of using Methamphetamine when all of the sudden I would fearfully realize how tweaked I was after hours of trying to get high.  A hint of paranoia surfaced as I checked my pulse, but it seemed to be rather normal.  As I enjoy stimulants, I much enjoyed this state as well, which turned out to last about 2 hours.  Conversation flowed at an incredible pace, never running out of things to talk about.  Empathy was felt but not anywhere to the same degree as that of my initial MDMA experiences, however probably in line with my more recent experiences. ",
      "Suddenly it's as if the energy just ran out.  Neither of us had anything more to say and ended up just sitting quietly muttering a comment once in awhile.  And this is how is stayed for the come down.  Thought process were in almost a stoned state, slowed down and not quite coherent.  Still feeling the positive body effects.  Similar in a way to the later tired stage of MDMA when it's on it's way down but I'm still too stimulated to sleep.  Comfortable to just sit there for hours on end.",
      "Physical symptoms: ",
      "I did experience a lot of dry mouth, and frequent desire to urinate.  Several failed attempts, eventually was able to relax the muscles enough to empty my bladder.  This occurred several times and while familiar with this from earlier MDMA experiences, I found this compound to be a much greater degree of difficulty.  Nowadays I am unaffected by that particular side effect with MDMA.",
      "Sleep did not come.  About 4:00 am I decided to lay down and attempt to sleep.  Still feeling much more stimulated that I would have at that stage with MDMA.  Sleep did not come, although I was very comfortable and didn't feel the need to get up except to urinate about 6am.  I then lied there until about 12:00pm, packed my stuff up and went home.",
      "Throughout the following two days I encountered this frequent urination, the second day at a diminishing rate but still more frequent than normal.",
      "All in all I would say it's fairly similar to MDMA in body high yet weaker in it's empathic / spiritual effects, with the qualitative differences as mentioned above.  I found it harder on the body than clean MDMA but manageable.",
      "All in all this is a good one, and if this had been my first empathogen / entactogen I may have come to a different conclusion, but my personal opinion is that this one will not provide the same level of insight, empathy and emotional clarity of MDMA."

Its more of a marijuana body high, in that I feel a complete body calm/relaxation. Combined with this relaxation was an incredibly alert state of mind. I found that the Strattera appeared to be helping my thinking process. At first, my friends and I discussed politics, and I was able to think about the ideas from both mine and my friends perspective. The thoughts and points flowed articulately from my mind to my mouth. And the beautiful part was that as soon as we were done talking, my mind and body went back to a very relaxed state. Excited by how well it is going, I decide to take one last 40 mg pill.",

Just as before, my mind is as sharp as ever. Knowing that I am able to think more clearly than before, I purposely start a religious debate with my friends girlfriend. In the 35 minutes that we talk, I talk for about 25 minutes, but I barely notice the passage of time. My friends alert me to the fact that Im talking incredibly fast, which surprised me because I was consciously trying to talk slowly. I would believe that this was the peak.",

      "Overall, I had a very enjoyable time. This is the kind of substance that would be ideal for a mundane school day, as it does increase focus with fun side effects. I can definitely see why this would be prescribed to kids with ADD, as it slows down everything while keeping the mind sharp. I would definitely consider doing it again. I believe the addiction potential is there because it is a pleasant feeling that I already, a day later, wish to experience again."

      "So I was pretty run down from drinking too much wine the night before and having a lack of sleep. After I put my son down I decided it was time to try LSA (Morning Glory Seeds). So I had 150 of them which I ground up and let sit in a jar of water for 2 days. So at 7:30 after I put my son down I drank and ate all the seeds. I felt a bit nauceus and decided It might be best to smoke some cannibis to smooth things out.",
      "Well I smoked that then at about 9:00 the onset was coming at full blast. I was really tired but couldn't sleep and I got really fidgety almost like a coke addict gets, I kept moving around and kicking and decided it might be best to take a bath as I was shivering and freezing cold. It was in the tub that I noticed my eyes were a big as a full moon. So I thought I better think of a deity or someone to channel to make this worth while. I thought well hey how cool would it be to call upon a goddess like Aphrodite or Eris.",
      "After much discomfort and not being able to sit still or relax I got really sensual feeling, I had all my clothes off and was just wrything around in my bed. I was initially playing some Dead Voices on Air on the CD Player but that procedd to be FAR too dark, so I decided to listen to Download's 'III' as that is my all time favorite record and the ethereal techno beats would sail me away. That's when she came to me I thought it was Eris but perhaps it was Aphrodite, and it was amazing she was EVERY beautiful woman, she kept changing her appearance.",
      "I just kept having visions of a beautiful woman who would morph into another beautiful woman, she was every nationality and every color hair and look. So It was like I was making love to her and it was SOO sensual but I couldn't climax. I felt EXTREMLY sensual but alas despite all the images and get feelings I couldn't climax, I could almost get there but then just couldn't finish.",
      "She said something to the effect of 'I take it if I need it' If not I don't, and right now I don't.' I don't know what she meant, possibly an orgasm, but then afterwards she said, don't think you get all of this without some sort of lesson.",
      "So I said well what is my lesson and she said 'Stop fucking around'!!! Stop all this constant experimentation and trying to figure out the universe and all it's secrets. She basically was telling me I was selfish and that my main priority is to be a father and a hero 'To that little boy in the other room' and to learn that I am wrong it's not all about your own individual experience, it's about love and teaching. So that I was too filled with lust, lust for experience, women, recognition, adventure, etc.",
      "That night it was black out sleep, not recalling anything after that, The next morning I was really shaking and felt upset. I felt especially close to my little boy and decided to go wake him up and play with him. After that I dropped him off at daycare, came back home and called in sick, as I felt drained and really needed to have the entire day to really reflect on what the hell happened to me and to work on my priorities."

      "11:15am half blotter, 75ug, gummed",
      "11:40 possible alerts, light head, vague feeling of pull at back of neck, very common first alert for me. Jumped up after a half hour of deep breathing & meditative thought, rinsed out some clothes & hung 'em up in the sunshine. Looking forward to a solo walk in the park later, Sister Moon has dissertation work to do today, & gets trapped indoors with hayfever anyway, this time of year. Besides, I am the one who tests completely novel RC's before I let her have a look. I now return to my previous horizontal state to continue to await further effects & to contemplate.",
      "12:15 One hour since initial. Blotter chewed & swallowed. First alert may have been placebo. Little activity if any from half blotter at this point. I'll give it another half hour then the next half goes in. There may be somethng here, I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but I do feel kinda chilled, relaxed. I have no idea if this is a result of the chemical, my fully rounded personality or simply the relaxation techniques employed ;)",
      "12:45 still uncertain of the nature of the effects, but still think there's something there... Ate a ripe peach, a bread roll & a bag of Cheese & Onion... as well as another half tab. Well I gummed it again, to be entirely accurate, & now back to meditation & breathing. Drying hoodie is making amusingly entertaining drip splat drip sounds nearby. See, definitely something there...",
      "13:00 gradual increase in & building of effects noted now. Still extremely subtle but I may have caught some imprinting when glancing at & away from a monochrome fractal poster on my wall. There seems to be a little more red, pink & orange in my visible spectrum that might usually be present. I continue to kick back, occassionally fielding psychedelic queries from Sister Moon, her dissertation investigating the psychedelic elemments in the music of Bauhaus. Still very comfortable, mentally & physcally, a very nice, relaxing way to spend a gorgeous summer Saturday",
      "13:15 this may sound strange, & I am proudly naive to opiates, but I'm feeling a vague, distant & familiar sense of codiene-like contentedness. Still not alot in the psychedelic department. Due to my extreme financial hardship & the fact that I only got three of these, I suspect I may have to call it after this latest half, for fear of not having a chance to share an adequate dose with my gf in the near future. I'd also like to give tolerance a longer opportunity to set in, as it's only been 7 days since we enjoyed a park/pizza trip on Al-Lad, Friday before last. My first session on Al came less than 7 days after a weekend on psychedelic Phenethylamines & after a 10 day break I noticed an obvious, general increase in effects from the Al.",
      "13:30 visuals are picking up a little & my mind is less clear now, foggier, heavier. Hand eye coordination has also been affected slightly, typing is slightly trickier than it was 15 minutes ago. The appearance of tracers & other common visual activity has increased.",
      "14:00 Effects have increased now, so time to chew up the blotter. Also, I feel like a challenge, so I'm gong to cex to buy a couple Sci Fi DVD's",
      "15:00 Wow, fully immersed now. This shit is a slow-burner, & it's reminding me a little bit of a Doxx type experience. Took a walk through my busy town centre in search of cez & some Sci Fi DVD's. Met incredulous stare with 'hayfever'. How else can I explain DVD purchases on the hottest, sunniest day of the year? Came home to find Captain Pickard elbows deep in a borg corpse, which was interesting...",
      "15:45 Might still be building! Quite facinating so far. Relaxing but powerful psychedelia, deeper & stronger than Al-Lad, so far. Much slower aproach from LSZ than from Al-Lad is noted. This is without question quantifiably different to Al-Lad, as unique as all these remarkable compounds tend to be! I am certain that with little more than one or two more goes on this stuff I would be able to tell it apart from damn near any other psychedelic drug I've ever tried. I've had scorn poured quite recently on my ascertion that even after decades (my last dose of LSD was summer 1996! & yes, I remember EXACTLY what LSD is like, you don't trip 30 or 40 times & f*cking forget what LSD is like, ever!) I can tell the difference between Al-Lad & LSD itself. I stand by that!",
      "16:30 still pretty busy here. Heading back outdoors for a spliff in the sunshine with Sister Moon! It is FUCKING hot out there today. I LOVE it like this, it's not even that humid. Kinda reminds me of Ibiza today, except Ibiza is humid! I think the effects peaked about half hour ago, I feel as though I might be on the downslope now. Not certain or anything, if this is anything like the orginal L, it's bound to ease off in waves, much like it started of course...",
      "20:30 still around. I thought things were tailing off a bit, & I do find it easier to type now. But this stuff is still around. Plenty of classical psychedelia, reminiscent & tantalisingly similar but distinctly different to it's better known molecular cousin(s). Once again, a brand new experience has outstripped the previous. I wonder what the stability of this molecule is compared to the unknowns or doomful prophecies of Al-Lad? If this compound is more or likely to be more stable it certainly provides an equilibrium of effects. Duration of a single 150ug hit is unknown to me so far, but I'd say from what's gone on so far today that LSz outstrips Al-Lad as an all round +++ psychedelic. I suspect with equalised tolerance, & going purely on this one experiment, 150ug of LSz will take you deeper, longer into the realm of psychedelic effects than you might visit compared to a single 150ug dose of Al-Lad. Once again, I am basing that conlusion after just this one experience!",
      "While I had a shower my gf tried to distract me & caused some uncontrollable hilarity by pointing out that Ned Flanders would probably call these things er~giggly~ergoloids or something...",
      "Anyway, this has been a thoroughly unique & facinating endevour today. It's been about 5 hours I'd say, since the effects were certainly established, until now where they remain steady but waning... I supect to be clear within two hours, tired & capable of sleep. There was probably more ergot in my morning toast today than on my blotter, & probably an awful lot less on my blotter than is in the average pint of beer. Er~giggly~ergoloids are just so supremely well tolerated in man, I'd be simply gobsmacked if there was a single unhealhty aspect to what I've spent my day doing, enjoying the sun with a smile on my face, a relaxed step & a very serious gleam in my eye!",
      "21:30 Definitely easing off now I expect to be completely baseline by 22:30 I expect easy sleep before midnight.",
      "Another very interesting molecule!"

      "I began taking Effexor 8 months ago for major depression and generalized anxiety.  From the beginning, I noticed that it gave me a compulsive feeling that I hadn't had before.  I began smoking a lot of cigarettes (not just with a drink anymore) and wanting to consume caffeine to increase the rush and hyperness that the Effexor gave me. ",
      "Before beginning the drug, I consumed alcohol a few times a week and cocaine maybe once a month, cannabis also once a month.  I had not been having too many negative effects from those drugs except for an occasional bad hangover.  The first time I partied after I had been on the medicine for a couple of weeks, I got so hyper when I drank and did cocaine that my boyfriend and friends were all worried about me.  After that, every time I had anything to drink I would be wasted after one beer and very hyper for the rest of the night.  I was never ready for the party to end.  My boyfriend always worried because he said it was like I became a different person all of a sudden. ",
      "This all culminated one night when after drinking and doing coke, I went home with my boyfriend and our roommate and they went to bed.  I wasn't ready for bed. I found someone with coke and left the house at 3am, drove very drunk and continued to drink and do coke all night.  The next day I returned home, threatened to commit suicide while hanging my legs off our apartment roof, and was subsequently hospitalized.  Granted, this could have happened without the Effexor, but in years of occasional drug consumption, I've never behaved in a manner even close to this.",
      "I've successfully quit the coke for about 5 months now. I am trying to quit drinking again now because of how I feel like I can't control myself when I drink with this medication.  When I stop drinking now, I crave alcohol and I smoke a lot of weed (used to make me paranoid) in the same compulsive way.  I feel like I just can't get intoxicated enough once I start drinking or smoking or doing coke. ",
      "I enjoyed some recreational drug and alcohol use before Effexor, but my behavior was in no way like it has been since I started taking the Effexor.  Another note:  Since beginning the Effexor, the 'rushy' feeling that it gives me causes me to feel like I don't need to eat. I've lost about 15 lbs. since I began it."

      "This was my second actual experience with Morning Glory Seeds.  I am under 16 and VERY interested in the 60s and psychedelia.  My first experience with Morning Glory Seeds was spent with a friend of mine, and the entire time I felt very happy, everything seemed great.  My friend threw-up in the beginning, and I felt sick towards the end.  I also felt a bit depressed the day after, but felt normal after a few days.  All in all that experience was one to remember, not to mention it was my first time ever doing any kind of drug in my entire life.",
      "With this experience I was not so fortunate.  While I am very glad that I experienced this trip, it was not what I had been looking for the night I had done these seeds for the second time.  For preparation I simply ground up the seeds with a mortar and pestle and put the ground up material in gel capsules to swallow.  This saved me from the disgusting taste of those seeds, however I later found myself in regret for swallowing the large amount of capsules turned them into a large amount of gel in my stomach, which I was spitting up most of the next day.",
      "The day I took these seeds was a great day.  School was not as boring as usual and today was the day a most annoying character was moving, which lifted my mood a lot.  This took place on a Friday night, I had the whole next week off from school as well, seemed like a great time to try these seeds again.  I spent the whole trip inside of my house.",
      "I swallowed the pills and shortly after I felt nauseous, which I had not experienced in the beginning of my last trip.  I spent this time of nausea on a bed, and it eventually passed.  By the time it had passed I felt very excited and began to walk around the house.  I stopped in the bathroom to look in the mirror at my dilated pupils and well I was there I enjoyed looking at myself in the mirror.  I did not see too much of anything, however if I stared at my face it would look as though my mouth was opening, however when I blinked my mouth would still be shut.",
      "I sat down and began to listen to Jimi Hendrix (One of my favorites) and when Third Stone From The Sun came around things spun out of control.  For those of you that have heard this song you will know how weird it sounds sober, but tripping made this song take on a completely different dimension.  I felt like Jimi was talking to me through metaphors in his song. ",
      "I began to get tired and lay down, however I could not sleep.  Time seemed to slow to a halt.  At first I thought it was rather groovy looking at my clock at what seemed like every 30 or so minutes, which actually ended up being about 3 minutes.  Later into the night my trip turned sour.  I remember I got up and went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face, and when I came back to my bedroom I had no idea if I had just gotten up and gone to the bathroom.",
      "Luckily I had asked my brother earlier to watch over me, and he assured me that I had actually done what I thought I did.  This repeated many times, I would get up and do something and when I came back I wouldnt know if I did what I thought I just did or not.  This made me feel INSANE.  I began to become scared, and I felt my heart and it was beating extremely fast.  I kept thinking I was hearing birds all around, and at one point I thought that I might wake up as somebody else on some beach.",
      "I was worried that I might never come down, for it had seemed like many, many hours had passed since I took the seeds. ",
      "I was afraid to do anything for fear that I might suddenly wake up and be doing something different.  At one point I think my cat wondered into my room, and when I went to go pet it felt as though it were made out of wool, like a stuffed animal.  I was afraid to do anything more that entire night, and I spent the rest of the night lying on my couch reassuring myself that eventually everything would be fine.",
      "I was sweating bullets and everything in my room seemed wrong.  I remember I would feel my face and with one had I would feel sweaty skin, and with the other I would feel dry skin, this was a bit weird I thought.  I felt like I had been plundered into Wonderland, my Peace flags covering my windows looked as though they were huge and bent inwards, and my chair in front of my computer looked bent at strange angles.  I was very scared and I thought that I might have even been dead.",
      "After what seemed like 5 hours I went in the bathroom to check my pupils, and they were still dilated, and it had barely been an hour.  I went back to my couch and tried to get to sleep.  I finally fell asleep and when I woke up I was shaky, for I had been scared out of my mind a few hours earlier.  I spent the next day sleeping, the entire day, and by that night I felt much better. ",
      "Overall this is not an experience I would go looking for again, however I am glad that I have now experienced both ends of tripping.  Many things that I felt during this bad trip I cannot put into words, the only thing I can say about it was that at the time it was terrifying to say the least.",
      "I will be trying Morning Glory seeds one last time.  I have already started to prepare them by putting them in a pepper mill and grinding them up and soaking the powder in water for a little over a day.  I then filtered the liquid through a coffee filter and threw away the seed matter and filter.  I am currently waiting for the water to evaporate, which will leave me with a gum that I will soak in alcohol and then filter once more and finally drink.  This will probably be my last experience with Morning Glory and I will soon be trying Salvia Divinorum. ",
      "I am not sure what triggered my bad trip, but I feel as a result of it that I no longer feel the dreaded bad trip and my experimenting with drugs could go much farther than before.  I have learned that the old proverb Time solves all problems is very true in our world.  I have also now experienced one more thing, and experience is everything for many things. ",
      "I am not one to try a drug to be fucked up.  I try drugs in hope of expanding my mind, gaining experiences, and reaching a higher level of conciseness.  Thank-you for reading this, and happy tripping to all!"

I had never had acid like this, I felt very good though, and was laughing at everything. One of my friends and I had ventured to the 'Chill-out Tent' and sat in there for a while, laughing our ass off at the funny patterns on the floor, the people around us talking about what seemed completely stupid, yet they were probably in the same state of mind as us. When they dimmed the light in this tent, we proceeded to leave as quickly as possible. We greeted our other friend who was still in the car. He was querying over the fact that a parked car with it's hazard lights on near us was not in fact a car, it was a spaceship. All three of us came to the general conclusion it was a spaceship, as near it we saw several people walk past with glow-sticks covering their body. This was a very laughing matter to us, as it concluded how fucked up we really were. We decided to venture to the other musical zones at the rave, as the drum and bass stage was only playing shitty breaks music, which none of us enjoyed.",

Usually, I enjoy psytrance when I am sober, but the state of mind I was in, I would rather of taken the piss out of everything and anything not related to drum and bass.",
      "At one point of the night, stupidly, my friend Pat spent $5 of my friends money on a glowstick. Alan and I were EXTREMELY hungry, so I thought as a joke to attempt to refund the glowstick to the mini-shop they had set up at the rave. I went to the shop and promptly stated: 'Yeah, Hi, Ahh, My friend took a shitload of acid, and hes fucking out, and he kinda took my wallet and spent my last $5 on buying this glowstick which I really dont want, and the money was to buy my tea.' The lady running the stall was so wasted herself she actually refunded it. I hadn't laughed so hard for ages, this was so funny to me.",
      "At around midnight, we heard the breaks DJ come off, and a mile of clapping. I was un-sure if this was appreciaton that the DJ did a good set, or more the fact that all the drum and bass fiends were stoked he was leaving and a decent DJ came on. I ran full speed to the dancefloor, so I wasn't to miss the openeing track. Lucky I did.",
      "Subfocus - Special Place",
      "Oh what a track. How brilliant. What more of an intro to a drum and bass set than...",
      "'Most of us have a special place we like to visit, because we actually feel good being there. What we hear in that place, has alot to do with it. If the sounds are soothing, our muscles relax, our pulse rate drops. We feel at peace. All too often though, when we listen to great music, we settle for sound thats only... average. What music needs, is full deep bass to give it warmth.'",
      "This made my night. This one track opening the set. I loved the track since Ram Records released it. A brilliant job, I knew this DJ was going to be hot.",
      "After an hour or so of good dancing with some other friends from another town I had met to great songs I knew very well (that always makes my night) I ventured back to the car, thinking I was hovering over the long wet grass, as I could not see my feet moving beneath it.",
      "We decided to go for a drive. Usually, I don't drive at all. I don't have my license, or anything. I can't drive a manual at all. Until tonight. What thought overcame my two friends to actually let me drive his manual car, on acid, up a very dangerous gravel road with a cliff on one side. This was one of the most fun experiences of my life.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "We drove every now and then for the rest of the night, sometimes with me standing on the roof. Even though we were only moving at around 10kph, I still knew this was a silly and immature idea, but it was still amazingly fun. My friend at one stage also lost my ipod in the middle of a massive grass paddock, and then found it (Don't ask me how). I proceeded to drive back to the rave, steering the car with my teeth. We laughed at how stupid this was, yet fun.",
      "But anyway, back at the rave, my friend Pat (He was on BZP himself) decided he wasnt leaving the car, so we left him there. I persuaded my other friend (Alan) to join me on the dance-floor, and after much persuasion, he joined me. At this stage, I was having very vivd hallucinations, and hysterical laughter followed every stupid story I told.",
      "The laser light on the dance floor was amazing, and my friend Alan, opposite to what he thought, was having the time of his life. He couldn't stop dancing, like myself. We danced for hours.",
      "Daylight came, and the music stopped. The DJ walked out and shook my hand, and asked my name. He said he was amazed at my stamina to dance for so long. I was myself also. I am a smoker, and half the time was dancing with a cigarette in my hand. The comments from fellow raved made me feel very good about myself like: 'Woah, these kids are insane! Look at those two!' and 'Fuck, I wish I could dance like that'. I was a very happy chappy.",
      "After this, we drove home, and prompted to sleep. I woke up at 7am on monday morning, ready for school, feeling good about myself and refreshed. Great acid, great raves, and great people surrounding me. A good weekend indeed."

      "Purchased a 2oz container for a few bucks at my local supermarket, a little excited about what could be in store for me, but not expecting much. My mindset most of the day was pretty melancholy, just another day.",
      "Went home, rolled a few joints of it, smoked one before going into work around 11pm.",
      "The first joint didn't do much except give me the feeling *something* is different, images seemed a little sharper, and a few minutes later I felt like I was coming down off a small pot buzz.",
      "Well, after work, I decided to try making it into a tea. Emptied out a rather large teabag, (made quite a mess) filled it with about 2 or 3 grams of catnip, I don't have a scale so I couldn't measure it, but it was a pretty good bit of 'nip. Used a 24oz glass to pour the water into & make tea. I boiled the water, poured it in the glass, put the teabag in. Let it seep for a few minutes while I made food, since it was too hot to drink, I put some ice in it, along with sugar to sweeten it up, and chugged it at 6:10am",
      "6:15 am - Noticed a calm chilled out feeling, quite nice, it's getting stronger.",
      "Got the idea to write a report while I'm going through this catnip trip, and so I did.",
      "Reminds me a bit of chamomile tea.",
      "6:20 am - Effects getting stronger. Noticing a slight headbuzz coming on, feels like something is pulling me up to the top of my room. It's quiet in here, so I'll turn on some nice relaxed music, and finally get started on eating this food. I keep typing slower and slower.",
      "6:30 am - Images almost seem sharper, and lights brighter. I feel a bit up now, but relaxed at the same time, it's an odd feeling. Definately feeling anxious, like the feeling you get after taking acid, before the tripping starts. Feels like SOMETHING is going to happen, but it's not quite happening yet. Maybe it's time to smoke a bowl or two of catnip?",
      "6:40 am - Smoked a bowl of catnip. Effects seems to be intensified only slightly. I feel a slight tingle sensation on the inside of my right arm, warm and chilled out on the rest of my body. Seems like it's taking a lot to get a little bit of effects, but they're not unpleasant at all, kind of nice. I feel pretty lazy now, but at the same time, I feel more up, a bit more anxious.",
      "6:50 am - Started talking to my ex over instant messenger, the conversation went well, and I was pretty talkative. Feeling very bored though. The effects are slowing down, maybe I'm just cruising on them, or I've hit the peak, unsure. My sinuses are nice and clear though. All of my motor functions seem fine, though it's slightly harder to type than usual. I feel a little itchy now, it's a bit annoying.",
      "7:00 am - I feel chilled out, slightly stoned. But it seems like I'm starting to come down now, seems so soon. Wondering if it was all just placebo, or if it's just not strong at all. I think its time for bed."

      "A bit about my background: ",
      "I'm a 42 year old white male, professional education, married with two boys, aged 13 months and 2 months.  I frequently used psychedelics and cannabis in my late teens and early twenties.  I spent about 12 years from my mid-twenties to mid-thirties in a 12 step program, completely sober.  A very good experience, actually.  I drink moderate amounts of alcohol these days, though it did take a couple of years to adjust my body and I did drink fairly heavily for a while after leaving sobriety.",
      "Medications:  I do take prozac between 20-40mg for depression/anxiety, propanolol 40 mg (beta blocker) also for anxiety, adrenaline blocker, and a statin for cholesterol.  The prozac and propanolol needed to be monitored and adjusted during this experiment.",
      "Reasons for trying cacti:",
      "I have been having a considerable amount of trouble dealing with work, marriage, fatherhood, etc., and was becoming very bored with work and dissatisfied with myself.  I was later to learn why this was.",
      "Preparation and dosage:",
      "4 oz of peruvian torch incense was purchased and 93% isopropyl alcohol was used to perform an extraction over a period of a week.  The resulting extract was scraped and rolled into 10 small balls, the size of small marbles.  I estimate the extract was yielded about 1000mg of mescaline.  1/2 half of extract was consumed about 11:30 a.m. on a Friday morning, the other half at around 12:30 p.m. Friday afternoon.",
      "The experience:",
      "Initial feelings were slight nausea and fidgeting, excess energy and nervousness.  The nervousness evolved into panic and the nausea evolved into extreme stomach discomfort (probably the alkoloids) by 2:00 p.m.  The panic lasted for the rest of the experience, as did the stomach discomfort.  I had excruciating pain in my lower back the entire experience, most likely related to stress. ",
      "Other than 1 small glass of yogurt smoothie at about 3:00 p.m., I ate nothing and only drank water and milk for the entire experience.  The cactus itself sufficiently wore off after about 20 hours after ingestion.  I did not sleep however for nearly 48 hours.",
      "The brain chemistry effects noted include severe anxiety and nervousness, constant paranoid thoughts, and continuous schizophrenal and/or schizotypal audio and visual hallucinations.  I experienced very notable time dilation, especially while listening to music.  Music listened to from between 4:00 p.m. and about 6:00 p.m. consisted mostly of old latin salsa, latin rumba, latin jazz and contemporary salsa.  Because of the time dilation, listening to any music was extremely taxing and uncomfortable.",
      "I had a recurring strong desire to smoke cigarettes, but because of prior habitual smoking of both tobacco and cannabis, avoided tobacco smoking during the experiment.  The result would likely have been strong euphoria, increased visual hallucinations, and noticeable pain and discomfort to my lungs.",
      "I would like to have had a glass of wine at some point, but for a variety of reasons chose not to.  First and foremost, my stomach was in extreme discomfort.  Second, I had nothing to eat in my stomach which would cause alcohol to enter my blood stream too fast, either causing a craving for more alcohol or causing dehydration, headaches and stomach cramping.  As stated,  I stuck to water and milk.",
      "Though the most strong visual effects (which were extremely interesting pastels of various shapes and organic patterns like wall paper) generally became manageable around 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m., effects did not become totally manageable until around 5:00 a.m. or 6:00 a.m.  As previously stated I did not sleep the entire next day and maybe got 1 hour sleep at best around 7:00 a.m. Sunday morning.  Lingering anxiety and panic did not subside for at least 72 hours.",
      "A very interesting phenomenon experienced is what I'll label as gnostic thinking.  I had a very firm belief that the entire world was created by evil and exists as evil, all permeating, the substance of all relationships, animals, persons, clients at work, my family, wife, my sons, even the musicians playing on the CDs I was playing.  All observable reality was really an illusion used by beings (human, animal, spirits, ghosts, devils, etc.) to manipulate others in order to increase their own gnostic power.  Life and death were only a complex game, a means of instilling fear and consuming other's souls in order to amass psychic power.",
      "I nearly reviewed the entirety of my earthly relationships while under the experience through the lens of gnosticism.  For about 17 hours of the experience I wanted the experience to be over, but of course, the cactus extract takes 12-14 hours to metabolize.  In my case in took longer, probably due to the amount of the dose and the presence of an SSRI in my bloodstream. ",
      "Conclusions:",
      "The experience was mostly mentally and physically uncomfortable and disturbing.  One thing that I did conclude was that a great deal of my regular day to day thinking bore a remarkable resemblance to the disorganized, paranoid and delusional thinking experienced during the experience.  This has obviously given me a better idea of what thought process, judgments, conclusions, and analyses I use on a daily basis that are flawed.  At least for the short term, I've adjusted my attitude towards my wife, children, business partners, friends and neighbors, and of course myself.",
      "I drink alcohol less, eat less, sleep in bed with my wife more, clean up the house more, make the bed more, wake up in the middle of the night to feed the babies more, work harder and more efficiently, drive slower and safer, and act more respectable towards my co-workers.",
      "I do not recommend cacti to anyone, especially in high doses, to be used as a euphoric or recreational drug.  It can cause very disorganized thinking and cause the user to experience mental illness-like thoughts as well as audio and visual hallucinations.  The bodily discomfort can be very painful.",
      "I will likely not use cacti again for a long time, though I cannot say I would never use it again.  It did have the benefit, at least this time, to allow me to see and understand many of my unpleasant characteristics and behaviors so as to provide me a reference point to adjust my thinking and behavior to be less narcissistic and less prey to my own irrational insecurities and fears."

      "My partner and I spent a month in a Shipibo village along the Ucayali River in Peru undergoing 'therapy' for a variety of health issues.  I'll focus only on my own experiences during our stay because to try to detail how it was for both of us would be far too much.",
      "The first few times that I took Ayahuasca myself I didnt have strong visions, and only light, passing body highs, although I threw up like there was no tomorrow (an experience that was rather enjoyable while under the influence).  My trips would be interrupted by mosquitoes, conflicting energies that I sensed in the people around me, and most prominently my worry for my partner, whos first trip consisted of rolling about on the ground screaming and crying for over an hour.  The Ayahuasca manifested itself to me as a feminine spirit and a definite other that got inside of me and went to work on cleansing the toxins out of my body through vomiting and diarrhea and lots and lots and lots of peeing, not only when I was on it but all the time.  Ive never peed so much in my life.  I saw the plant spirit in many incarnations, most notably as a snail moving through my innards.",
      "The second half of our stay I had been physically cleansed enough for the plant medicine to reach my mind, and I began to experience powerful visions and intense body highs.  For the most part they were exceedingly personal and dealt with the symbols that had been prevalent over the course of my life that created my poor self-image.  The Ayahuasca seemed rather impatient to me, and would metaphorically slap me in the face telling me to forget forget forget forget forget everything that I had ever, ever been told, and to start completely from scratch, listening to no one and nothing but my instincts, and to trust trust trust trust trust that the universe was going to provide for me and all I had to do was to not fight against its natural course, which spoke through my instincts, and all would be well.  I would get this sense of things while being shown very crystalline images of quite beautiful things for the most part, as my body was smashed into the earth and stretched out and I was left as a formless being.  I swam in the ocean with sea creatures, with the sky as some untouchable, noisy dome above me, pressing down upon me hard, feeling as though I was gestating in the warm womb of the goddess. ",
      "Even when on my last experience I completely abandoned my body as it was divided into many little pieces and scattered about the room."

      "This report is more of a glance back on the times I have taken Morning Glories, about 5 times now. Some trips have been successful, others worthless, most uncomfortable at one point or another. Most of the trouble comes from my inexperience with them, so I am working throught the trials. I feel these seeds have great potential.",
      "The first time I dosed was largely a mistake. I had gotten 10 1.5 gram packages on a Sunday (by the by, all the seeds I have taken have come from the same source and are the same brand) and I was pretty eager to trip. From what I had read 200 seeds was pretty light, so I decided to try 178 (hand counted) at 5 after a light dinner. I ate about 30 seeds at a time, thoroughly chewing and following each nasty mouthful with a big gulp of water. It was stupid, it being a Sunday and all, but I figured the experience would leave room for sleep around midnight or one, when I usually go to sleep anyway. Was I wrong or what...",
      "I remember laying on my couch, watching some tv, waiting for the trip, when I started to notice a twinge in my legs. I didn't really think anything of it but I started to pay more attention to my body and mind. I came to notice that my vision was flickering, not unlike an old movie reel does. That grew in intensity until it was undeniable but not too annoying. This all was about a half hour after ingestion.",
      "I got up to get a drink and my legs jsut about gave out from under me. I had a HORRIBLE pain in my legs, and walking normally was quite difficult. I was a bit scared but I'd read about the vasoconstriction and I had an idea of what to expect. I also had experienced similar pains on amphetamine binges that ultimately turned out all right, so I used that fact to reassure myself.",
      "I retired to my bedroom upstairs and waited for the trip, which came beautifully. I'll keep it short. Basically, enhanced coloring, undulating carpets, breathing walls, silent motion (you know, when things move far away and then back over and over...), trailers, tracers, the whole nine. Intensely mindraped me. Describing it to a friend who has done acid (I haven't) he said it soudned like a 2 blotter trip. Take that as you will, like I said I haven't done it before. This must have been a strong batch of seeds, or the dosing information I read applied to extracts and not the chew-chug method I used. Either way, that was the strongest experience I have had on the beauties.",
      "I must also mention the intense discomfot I experienced on parts of the trip, mainly at the end. I simply could not find a comfortable place to sit, lay or stand. I was constantly moving, looking for that comfortable place, but it wasn't there. Finally I said the hell with it and laid down on my carpet and watched it swim and I just exsisted, my thoughts very disconnected from where I actually was. That is where I was the next morning when I was either awakened or had my attention drawn by the alarm I set every morning. I don't know if I slept, there are a good 4 hours of that night I don't remember. The positives, for me, far outweigh the negatives.",
      "Between that trip and the last one were a few unnotable experiences, much weaker than that first one. I always allowed at least 2 weeks between experiences as is generally recommended, excepet once when I only went 2 days. That is not long enough for the tolerance to abate, fyi, at least it wasn't for me.",
      "My last trip was an eventful one. I took approximately 240 seeds (I have found that every 1.5 gram package I get has around 60 seeds) and settled in for a fun evening. The odd thing about this trip was that I got little of the lag cramping on previous trips, I would say it was about a 1/4 as abd as usual, which was interesting. It did also turn out to be a fairly weak experience on its own. Which brings me to waht I really wanted to talk about-Nitrous Oxide.",
      "I had read in numerous documents and user reports that Nitrous could work wonders on a trip but I was always a little skeptical. This time I was having a pretty uneventful trip, and I had about 4 whipped cream cans in the fridge. 'What the hell?' I said, and I got one. I took all the air off the can in 2 or 3 big inhalations and waited a second. The world slipped into a mass of swirling shapes with colors I have never even experienced before, and my entire body was lost in that Nitrous tingle, which seemed not to be confined to my body but spreading out through infinity. I can truly say I had no body for a minute that night. Next trip I will be ready with a cracker and balloons, to do it right."

Setting is the most important factor in controlling these.  Pictures on the wall of actions, such as a flock of geese landing in a pond, music, nothing heavy as it can freak you out, and company, make sure you have good friends who won't freak out as that can get to you too. Make sure that you don't watch a gorey movie as you could start to think about that and anything you think about could be turned into a vivid hallucination, especially at higher doses. ",
      "OK.  I'll start with my report. I bought one 4oz bottle of Robo Max. strength cough.  This has a little over 300mg of DXM I believe, it also has guifensen which can make you sick.  Upon return to my house and rooting through my cupboards, I came up with another partially full bottle and went into the living room, or the trip room as it was.",
      "I made sure that the CD player had some good techno, not too loud, not too fast, but a good beat to it.  I dimmed the lights, I have the wonderful reaction of pupil dilation, be sure to watch out for that if you're going to go out in public.  The first bottle went down pretty easily after about two to three shots of Schmirnoff.  The second, my dose is approximated because of the 'partially full' bottle, needed a little help.  A good idea might be to keep some Altoids near by because if you chew on about five of them, you can't taste anything for a while.  But the second was down and the vodka felt nice and warm.  I sat down and relaxed on my sofa, flipping through the channels to find something worth my time, theres never any trippy shows on when you need one... ",
      "The first effect was noticed about thirty five minutes after ingestion.  My balance was slightly off and the ceiling was forming interesting black and white patterns, I have a 3D ceiling with lots of random patterns in the plaster.  This made walking around the room very interesting as everything seemed more interesting.  My mind was almost more clear, like the drug was pushing out all the dust and opening some unused area of my brain. ",
      "The second effect, possibly called the first plateu (I think its supposed to be somewhere around ten times the effect of marijuana), was a dropping away of all worldly cares.  Extreme euphoria made everything O.K., but locomotion was extremely hard.  I had to crawl back to the couch.  Anything over 300 mg might be impossible to do out in public. ",
      "The third, and expected, effect occured about an hour after ingestion.  I glanced up towards the ceiling and almost hit my head on it, well, it looked like it was just inches from my face.  The picture on the wall, a flock of ducks instead of geese that were landing in a reed surrounded pond, and I mean that they were at that moment landing, swimming out of sight and coming around for another splash landing.  This was possibly the most interesting thing I noticed.",
      "During the hallucinatory part, my sense of hearing seemed to come and go.  I would notice that there was music playing, but forget about it moments later.  The same for the TV.  I would look at it and see a black screen, then suddenly, the show would be back, until I lost interest and it turned back into a black screen. ",
      "The biggest error I have ever done while tripping, is not locking my two cats in another room.  One of them sleeps on the couch and although seeing him there was only mildly interesting, when he yawned, I had to fight to keep control of the trip.  Seeing his teeth had a terrifying effect on me even though I understood that it was just a yawn.",
      "Control regained, and the effects wearing off, I tried to go to sleep.  I think I fell asleep about five-thirty am, ingestion was at eleven-thirty, and awoke to my alarm clock at eight-thirty.  The ceiling was still only inches away from my face, but no other serious hallucinations were experienced.  Although walking still had a trick to it, it was almost fun just to take a few steps in one direction and then in another.  Footfalls both before and after the hallucinations were slightly set apart from the actual placement of the foot on the ground, I felt it after I knew I should have.  Ther were no long lasting effects, but I became very tired at the end of the day.  Upon awakening I felt no traces of being tired, possibly due to the continued presence of DXM in my system.",
      "I must conlude that DXM is a very 'heavy' trip.  Although lower doses could be good for ametures, I must say that higher doses should be stayed away from if you don't know what to expect or how to control yourself.  The best part is, its legal, which DOES NOT MAKE IT SAFE, but does make the procurement slightly easier.  Just be sure that there are  no other active ingredients, or make Agent Lemon (extracted DXM from Robotussin).  Its not the DXM thats so terribly dangerous, its that acitominiphen and antihistamines, yes I know there's a whole lot more, are very dangerous in large quantities.  So do your research before you do your drugs!!"

      "Take heed and bear witness to the truths that lie herein. For they are the wisdom gained from a mind that had slipped and made its own track.",
      "In the lazy summer days after ninth grade I learned that a friend of mine had come into possession of three ounces of Psilocybe Cubensis, and a rather potent strain at that. I had to work at the time I learned it, and after a 6 hour shift I sped quickly down the road in my 92 Oldsmobile (I call it the Grandma model). I rang the bell, he let me in and found he only had one quarter left! I bought the lot of them, he just gave me what was left, it rung up a little over a quarter, 7  grams and only $40. I also bought a small quantity of Pot from him for $20, that was also rather potent.",
      "I had to plan my trip though, I was no novice at the time. I had read all the literature my grubby little paws could find on hallucinogens in general, but specifically mushrooms. Also I had a wonderful experience with an unknown strain my Sisters friend had come across. Some admirer was hooking her up for free and she sold pot anyway so she hooked me up with an 1/8 free. I swallowed it by myself in some blue Kool-aid (it was all powdery, like the bottom of some HUGE bag). All I can remember is LAUGHING. It seemed hours! Somehow I ended up in my shed smoking pot with my friend, trying to explain why I was laughing so hard, I just told him to call the girl and hook him up. Boy we had fun.",
      "Anyway, I digress. I waited a few weeks, worked and such, I smoke pot everyday and had for 2 years at the time, so I went through the pot I bought far before I took the shrooms. I was a busser at a local diner. The one with loud clapping and singing for birthdays ,) you know the place. God that job sucked. But I had money to keep pot around.",
      "One day I got impatient and just ate the shrooms in the woods between my neighbors house and a gas station. BIG MISTAKE: I was sort of nervous, and by myself. I ate about 4.5 grams, more than Id taken in my single previous experience. I sat there for awhile and got the urge to smoke some pot, but my lighter was dead. I walked tot he gas station and as soon as she rung up the lighter I felt the anticipation. Like I was waiting for something bad to happen. It was odd, but I read it was fairly common, even in good experiences.",
      "I went through the woods again back to my street, but the walk felt wrong somehow, like the woods were no longer my beloved haven but its very spirit was displeased with me. Still I ignored it and walked to my house, I just remember looking back down the empty street, it has a few small hills and the seemed like waves sort of, but stuck, frozen in some static field. UH OH: My mom was home, I sort of had a panic attack, for no reason either, she doesnt mind that I smoke pot, and wouldnt be too pissed about some shrooms. She was a hippie, and did acid a few times, my father taught me not to trust the stuff though. I went inside just long enough to tell her I was going for a walk. I knew she knew something was up, I looked in the mirror and my pupils were huge.",
      "I floated through my backyard to a neighborhood behind it and sort of walked to a local ghetto where I knew Id find some of my friends. To this day I dont know why I knew Id see them. It was such an off chance. I kept looking behind me the whole walk, like paranoid, like something or someone may be stalking me elusively. I went up and rang the doorbell to the house of a friend who had long since moved out. I rang the bell, thinking the person still lived there, and when someone else answered the door, I remembered they didnt.",
      "I apologized and the person looked at me in such a way, I just burst out laughing in their face. I quickly ran a ways down the street, realizing what I had done and having another little panic attack, those kept happening though the whole thing, just like my chest was expanding to wide, or it was caving in, or I wasnt breathing right or something.",
      "I stopped at a corner for some reason and looked up the street, it was a pretty steep hill and something dark was tumbling at me. I thought I was just hallucinating, but it got closer, and I realized it was a person right before it sort of hug tackled me, I NEARLY DIED, I thought I was being mugged in my estranged state, but I soon realized it was my friend! Somehow the cosmos had flung us together at this time. Behind him walked my previous shrooming buddy! It was serindipity sure. I just laughed and tried to tell them I was tripping, but they knew as soon as they saw me, were all sort of hippies. We walked to the nearby forest to smoke some pot. We crossed a field and although I kept freaking out, it was the most beautiful sight of my life. I still remember with sparkling clarity how blue the sky was, each insect, the butterflies and bees, even mosquitos and gnats, and the grass OOOOHH. SOOOO GREEN.",
      "Smoking pot just intensified my paranoia, and the bowl would wiggle and misshape when I brought it to my face. It was weird, my buddies were sort of awkward, like watching me trip, they knew my experience was going badly, but neither offered help. I had not made a nice home for the shroom spirit, and it didnt like me in this trip. I thought for some reason, when we reached my friends house and got water Id be all better, it was very hot after all. It was a 15 minute walk from where we were and everything was steaming, people seemed to know I was tripping, like everyone was watching me and hated me. I kept thinking when we got to My buddys house, Ill be fine.",
      "We got in and it seemed ICY cold, his blue plush rug was waving like trees in the wind from 1000 feet up I drank some water, didnt feel better and REALLY started freaking out. I just started saying, I have to go, something is telling me to go, I walked out his door, didnt close it, and I still had the water filled cup in my hand. I made it about 100 feet without notice, ran back, said something like,  I forgot this and threw the water over my head, threw the cup at my friend on the couch and ran away, without shutting the door again.",
      "A ways down the street I forgot that I had poured the water on my head and another panic attack hit cause it felt like there were two giant boulders on me, one on my chest and one on my back. I finally lifted my shirt in an attempt to breathe, and all anxiety would leave for a moment when the wet shirt wasnt touching my skin. So there I was, walking down the street, with pupils the size of nickels holding my soaking shirt from my quivering body.",
      "I look like a stoner to begin with, Ive got long curly brown hair that goes in my eyes all the time. My eyes are that washed out green color most of the time, but they turn grey, blue, and when Im on drugs they are green near the pupil and have a blue ring around the edges.",
      "I got in my house, and immediately ran up to my room, my other haven, and locked the door. I sat on my queen size comfy ass bed and tried to watch good ole Spongebob. I swear I couldnt follow the story line for the life of me. And I tried too, hard. Id just forget what had happened in the previous scene in the midst of re-explaining it in my mind.",
      "My brain was a separate entity from me. Random thoughts would just pop out, and anything my sane mind would try to come up with would just slip out of my head in mid-thought. I layed and tried not to move but I was so nervous it was impossible, I kept sitting up, or jerking my leg or something. When I would sit still it felt like my muscles were relaxed, but my bones were tense, it was the weirdest sensation.",
      "My body was light as a feather, then everything was so heavy even my hair and my teeth weighed my face down. I tried to calm down in a cold shower, but I just felt every drop and it seemed I was tripping harder. Somewhere around the time I got out of the shower another one of my friends and his little brother came by. I opened the door and a circular rainbow covered the little guys face and his older brother wanted to see the rest of my mushrooms or something. Man word spreads fast about those things. I just sat down and the cracks in the concrete formed pictures. I showed him my other bag and said I was troubled and had to go in.",
      "The feelings started to fade, but every time I smoked pot for days I started tripping again. Even though it was horrible, I really learned a lot about myself, and hallucinogens."

      "In fact, at this time, I feel that I can only allude to the incredible nature of my experience. I will present evidence that supports the reality of my experiences as something that extends far, far beyond a marginal, odd or unique drug trip. Indeed, what I am attempting to report to you is a series of experiences, that started directly on Easter weekend of 2004, but that has roots extending as far back as 2001.",
      "Well, I shall begin.",
      "Without attempting to describe, explain or otherwise describe the exact nature of what has occurred, I shall state very plainly that I have experienced a state of mental activity that is incredibly different than any I had experienced before. Through my own inquiries, I have been able to find descriptions of experiences that seem closely analogous with my own, yet none that I have been able to identify as being identical. Many of these similar stories were interpreted in ways that were unfortunately vague, mystic or otherwise untenable when subjected to serious reflection. Inquiry into neurology, or psychology also yielded little information regarding directly correlative experiences. My quest for understanding has not been fruitless, as it has allowed me to understand and assimilate my experiences a little better. It has taken almost three years to finally feel that I have acquired enough of an understanding to begin serious discussion.",
      "I am twenty-three years old, and male. I was born on the twelfth of March, 1983. I have been so profoundly impacted by these experiences, that I have enrolled in a Universitys Cognitive Sciences program in an attempt to understand what has occurred and share it with the world. I live in Canada. I have several friends, including my fiance who have supported me through these events, and their psychological repercussions. They are willing to validate any accounts, or aspect of my experience, as they were active participants in my life during the most intense incursions into this altered mindset of which I speak.",
      "I will, as briefly as possible, try do outline some of the key events. Exacting detail, at this time, is impractical as the events have unfolded over a period of several years.\rPart 1 - Prehistory",
      "-In the years 2000-2003 I was an active and often times heavy user of psychoactive substances. I displayed a particular affinity for psychedelics, though most often mixed several drug classes. I have extensive experience with psychoactive mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, PCP, mescaline and opiates.",
      "-In early 2003 I began serious inquiry into theories involving complex systems. This inquiry -though unstructured and highly informal- became something of an obsession in the year to follow. \rPart 2 - Precursor Experiences\rPart2A- The First Experience",
      "On Easter weekend of 2004, while on vacation with a friend in Montreal, I had my first relevant experience. My drug use had begun two nights previously, in Ottawa, with LSD and MDMA. The LSD had the Illuminatis pyramid. The MDMA was not pure, and contained quantities of stimulants, suspected to be methamphetamine. On Thursday, I stayed awake with friends and consumed one tab of the LSD, and one pill of MDMA.",
      "When I arrived in Montreal on Friday, I again stayed awake the entire night. My friend and I went to a rave, and I consumed only MDMA, although my friend had brought some of his own. I consumed two of my pills, and two of his. His contained some variety of hallucinogen, supposedly 2-cb.",
      "On Saturday, we stayed in. I consumed two more pills, and two tabs of LSD. Several hours later, the LSD had yet to take effect. I consumed 4 more tabs, but still found no observable sense of being on LSD. Convinced I merely found a dry spot on the sheet, I consumed several more MDMA pills. There was no observable sense of LSD intoxication, merely a mildly hallucinogenic quality to an otherwise unremarkable MDMA buzz.",
      "The next afternoon, after having slept for perhaps 6-8 of the previous 72 hours, my friend went to sleep. I was still unable to rest, and laid on my hotel room bed with my eyes closed. I started to contemplate an aspect of my inquiry into systems theory, and set my sights to a visual model I had been thinking about. I found my ability to manipulate my visualizations extraordinarily enhanced. It had been about 15 hours since my last does of LSD, and about eight since my last tab of MDMA. I felt relatively lucid.",
      "As I contemplated my visualizations, I suddenly found my model changing with remarkable speed, and branching into extraordinary realms of complexity. I had a breakthrough, and epiphany, and it was so sudden and large and inescapable that I was left trembling.",
      "The nature of the epiphany is unimportant at this time, though I am willing to describe it in greater detail. What is important is what followed.",
      "Shaken, I woke my friend and started talking excitedly to him about concepts of scale and scale-ability of systems. Finding him, of course, completely unable to follow my train of thought I simply imparted the magnitude of what I felt I was occurring and gave myself to the experience.",
      "The revelations didnt stop. My thoughts coursed from one topic to another, with incredible fluidity. Every thought sparked another, every question answered promised to lead to another, greater epiphany. Walking out into the world, I found that every action appeared as a descriptive metaphor for what I was thinking. I couldnt stop thinking, and I couldnt stop coming up with answers. Systems theories are heralded as a means to unite the splintered factions of science on an unbiased and neutral framework. Systems theories are intended to calibrate existing understandings with an awareness of complexity. In the time that followed, I would apply my intuitive understanding of complexity to every topic I could consider.",
      "Stepping away from what I was thinking, and examining what I was sensing, I found that I was able to watch in detail any item in the periphery of my field of vision, as though my eyes  were trained on it directly. Indeed, my peripheral vision became the visual realm I came to occupy during that time. I felt no need to look directly at anything.",
      "I was immersed in a world of stunning visual clarity and indescribable intellectual understanding. I was immersed so completely, that I was almost unable to speak. The thoughts wouldnt stop. Neither would the constant stream of descriptive visual/situational metaphor. Neither would the strange awareness of my peripheral vision. None of it seemed hallucinogenic. It all seemed, shockingly, startlingly clear.",
      "I should at this point mention that this state persisted -though I experienced a gradual decline in intensity- for a full three weeks.",
      "I was unable to be around people for any length of time, for their peace more than mine. I would sleep little and try and communicate my thoughts constantly, desperate to etch some sort of record of the thoughts I was having, but unable to write quickly enough. In a few days, I decided to (though I should perhaps say, was inescapably compelled to) meditate and fast outside for a week. During that week, I slept outside, and subsisted off of salted tea and a zip-lock bag of dried rice. I lost 6 pounds.",
      "I wrote extensively, though mostly the writings were socio-political. Mostly I meditated and tried to work through the conflict between wanting what was occurring to continue, and needing it to stop due to my overwhelming exhaustion.  During that time, I discovered that I had developed an incredible ability to maintain complicated rhythmic patterns. I was also able to write quickly and legibly, though not perfectly, forwards, backwards, upside down and mirrored with either hand. My meditation skills were dramatically improved, and I was able to perform such bizarre tasks as to make objects I was looking at disappear from my field of vision. This last aspect was particularly interesting, though I will describe it in more detail another time.",
      "All of these skills faded, as the fugue-state as I would come to call it, subsided. This was the first experience I had with the fugue-state. It was the longest in duration, though I would come to understand that this particular experience of it was still very different from the state of mind that would eventually evolve.\rPart 2b - Aftermath",
      "The months that followed were chaotic and strange. I was driven, and intoxicated by this experience. It was several orders of magnitude greater than any intoxication I had ever felt. Nor had it felt like intoxication, in the sense that it is usually characterized by difficulty in performing normal functions, or understanding information. The experience of the fugue state is, in my own description, an experience of searing lucidity.",
      "I cannot necessarily claim that I handled this first experience with grace, as I had yet to learn that while some of the thoughts I would have were in fact startlingly accurate, many others were misleading and confusing. Some of the ideas and theories that I literally thought up without having any significant prior understanding proved to closely mirror contemporary theories. This simultaneously had the effect of bolstering my confidence that something of great significance had occurred, while reducing the level of scrutiny I applied to the other insights I had gained.",
      "I became convinced that I had been granted insight and understanding that was unparalleled in the realm of normal human experience. I also became convinced that the cure to the confusion that followed from the weeks of explosive mental activity, was to be another incursion into the fugue-state.  The idea seemed sound enough, as it quickly became obvious that I had no real way of expressing my thoughts to others, or assimilating the ideas I was having into my daily life. It seemed to me that if I was to experience it again, but this time with purpose, that I could fill in the missing information that would make everything else that had happened fit together and make sense. This would not be the case.",
      "Months passed, and during those months I engaged in the most frequent psychedelic use of my life. A good friend of mine purchased a thousand lot of acid, and I began to dose 2-3 times a week, occasionally taking as many as nine hits simultaneously. The LSD on that sheet was excellent, but I was unable to repeat the experience that began in April of the same year. My highs were the same as any other LSD high, a state that I am very familiar with and can navigate without any difficulty. The were characterised by all of the hallmarks of LSD intoxication, fractal patterns, tracers, time-shifting, increased alertness and energy.",
      "After months of seeking, and dosing LSD and MDMA regularly, I began to ease my use. I began to believe that what had occurred must have been an isolated experience. As the months had passed, the memories of the experience began to become relics, and I began to doubt their authenticity. Perhaps, after all, I had been imparting a false sense of relevance and value upon my perceptions. Perhaps I had merely triggered a schizophrenic episode, and in my confused state had, for the first time, become completely unable to distinguish imagination from reality. As the months dragged on, I began to let go of my faith in the relevance of the fugue state. I then resolved to mark it as merely an interesting chapter that, even if it was a false and maddening experience, had granted me insights of incredible value. I came to believe that I any benefit I had drawn from what had happened, I had drawn from the process of healing from madness.\rPart 3 - The True Experience",
      "I shall let you know in advance that to describe the sensory experience of what occurred next will take significantly more text than I will dare to write here. I will, of course, describe what it is like to experience the fugue state itself at another time. Here, I seek only to present the chain of experiences that revealed this state of mind as a real, and incredible thing, and not just a drug-frenzied decline into madness. In fact, it has since been revealed that drugs are a tool with which to access it, though it is quite a separate mental process. Drugs are what revealed the fugue to me, but are themselves, not the fugue.",
      "I will also clarify, before I continue, that the chaotic and difficult behaviour that is so tightly interwoven with this story is a result of the difficulty in assimilating the experiences themselves. The first experience lasted, somehow, three weeks. I have never relived exactly what occurred during that time. The following experiences were much shorter, with after effects dissipating in a couple of days, yet took the better part of two years to integrate fully. I have since learned how to experience the fugue, without being traumatized by it, and will soon begin further explorations.\rPart 3A - The X-Box",
      "I experienced the full, undeniable fugue state sometime in October of the same year. I am not certain of the date, as the next few months were maddening and incredibly complex.",
      "I was visiting a friend of mine, on two hits of the same LSD I had been abusing for the entire summer. By that time I was so familiar with the high, that others wouldnt even notice I was intoxicated until I told them. On this particular evening, however, I felt like I was on something else entirely. The high was unfamiliar, intense and uncharacteristically confusing. There are some important qualities of this setting that I must identify. One is the arrangement of her living room. The other is that she was playing a video game.",
      "The room was dimly lit, with candles spread at curious and asymmetrical intervals. She had her television stacked on some milk crates, centered spatially in the center of the room, so that it appeared as a pillar in the middle of the floor with a television on it. She was playing a video game on her x-box. I dont know what game it was, but what was important about it was the following: it had a first-person vantage point, a floating point cursor in the center of the screen, and the level she was playing had the character advancing through mist.",
      "I was watching her play, but noticed immediately that the game didnt make any visual sense. All I could see was fractal or recursive shapes that would re-orient around the screen as she moved the character. Whenever one of these shapes moved to the center of the screen, and she advanced the character towards it, the shape would extrapolate more fully, and then very suddenly it would appear on the screen as an easily identifiable object -a flower. I would then hear a munching sound as the character ate the flower for health. I asked her to explain the game to me, and she started to describe the rules of play and storyline. I quickly stopped her and pointed to the screen, and asked her how she was even navigating! All I could see was recursive-fractal shapes and occasionally a flower that would appear in a startling and comic fashion.",
      "Confused, she simply slid over on the couch and handed me the controller. The screen still looked the same. I pushed the up button and suddenly, as if by magic, the game appeared as any normal game would. I could see that the polygon shapes I had been observing were actually trees emerging from the mist, and that the flowers were at the base of the trees. I could see paths through the trees, and found it easy to negotiate the game. I handed the controller back to her, and slid back over. Once she began to move the character, I completely lost the normal game image and was slammed back into weird-polygon land.",
      "I was fascinated. I had never experienced anything like it. I was, no matter how hard I tried, completely unable to see what was going on in the game. I could only identify shapes, and I could find no way to reclaim a visual understanding, without myself being in control of the character. Amused, I leaned back on the couch and began to contemplate the relevance of this experience. Reality, it turned out, was up for playing tricks on my brain. For the first time, I was able to watch and experience that old philosophical assertion that cognition -though responding to an outer reality- is in fact a highly interpretive act.",
      "As I mused on this, my gaze fell upon the white + that marked the center of the screen. Its position was static, relative to the rest of the furniture. It appeared as though it was etched in glass, through which we were watching a game take place. I let my gaze relax and started to welcome the familiar stream of beautiful fractals that my mind was generating in my peripheral vision. I should, at this point, clarify that I felt quite intoxicated. As I watched, the polygons on the TV screen -themselves recursive drawings- began to move off of the screen and into my field of vision. It was as if I was watching them float right out of the TV screen and into my mind. As I let this visual effect wash over me, the light from the candles started to do the same. Suddenly, every object in the room seemed to be making fractals manifest in my vision. As my eyes stayed fixed upon the + in the middle of the screen, every object started to emit fractals into my vision.",
      "I continued to watch, and then felt this odd sense of rushing upwards. A warm and insistent pressure flooded my mind, and suddenly, the fractals re-aligned with their sources and the world rushed into this incredible and indescribable realm.",
      "I sat there, trembling. I turned to my friend and said, very calmly L? Would you find it strange if I said that right at this very second, God was speaking with me?",
      "She looked only slightly puzzled and said, Well, You are on acid.\rPart 3B - Into the Night",
      "I hugged my friend tightly and explained that I had to go outside. I had to be out in the night, I invited her to come with, but she declined.",
      "I walked outside, my heart beating rapidly. The most dramatic sensory aspect of the fugue state is visual. The best analogy I have ever come up with, even after three years of contemplation, is to liken the experience to solving a magic eye puzzle (stereogram) with everything in my field of vision. As I walked, I found that I could observe everything in my peripheral vision with ease.",
      "I could listen to, and understand, multiple conversations simultaneously. I could listen in on the couple walking behind me, and the couple ahead of me. It seemed as though I could hear things clearly, despite ambient noise pollution and distance. My posture, which is notoriously poor, straightened. My breathing was slow, deep and thirst-quenching. There was absolutely no sense of intoxication, in fact, the normal experience of reality is significantly bland and confusing in comparison.",
      "A myriad of descriptive visual metaphor appeared around me. Everything described something, and every thought led to another effortlessly. The night would come to be marked by synchronicity after synchronicity, although these were revealed through a curious faculty of attention, characteristic of the fugue.",
      "It was as though I had been teleported into a different world. One that the first experience in April had only alluded to.",
      "I walked rapidly, aware that I was a slightly alarming presence to some passers by. I looked sternly, straight ahead, my gaze unmoving. But I walked tall. I remember my trench coat flaring wide and flapping behind me. My jacket was open. I was quite comfortable with the cold. My thoughts raced, but mostly I was awash in a sense of amazement at just how incredible this world was.",
      "I went as quickly as I could to my girlfriend, Ss work, a bar. It was the bar we had met at, where she now worked as a server. As I approached the bar, I experienced another amazing perceptual shift. It was very smooth transition, but I now found that I was moving slowly in comparison with everyone else. Although, I must say that it seemed as though I was moving at an ordinary speed, and everyone else was dramatically sped up. I could perceive their paths, as they walked, and see the patterns that they formed as they interacted with each other and the environment. The rest of the world seemed unchanged. The leaves of the tress moved at a normal pace, as did the birds and a dog that somebody was walking.",
      "I went inside the bar where S worked, and got her attention. She guided me to a seat on my own, as she could obviously tell that something was very different. I sat in booth, breathing very slowly and deeply. The people in the bar were in a frenzy, it seemed, especially the servers. My first thought was to compare them to honey bees.",
      "S soon came over, and I told her a bit of what was going on but that Id have to explain later. She told me that a couple of her customers were from my home town and that shed mentioned this fact to them. They, apparently, were amenable to my company and I was ushered over to their table.",
      "The content of the conversation was rather unremarkable, as I certainly didnt dare explain what was really going on. What I remember most was that I had a keen awareness of their non-verbal signals. It was an attentive awareness, in that I was fully conscious of their body language and what it meant. My aptitude for conversation was greatly increased, and I was able to engage them both easily. When I felt that I was beginning to overstay my welcome, I left and walked home. It would be several hours before S was to come home.",
      "When I made it back to the apartment, I grabbed my address book  and looked for someone to call. I couldnt find anyone who seemed right. I found my attention repeatedly being drawn to my roommates address book, which was open to his boyfriends phone number. I didnt want to call it, mostly because I didnt want to inadvertently traumatize, or over-involve someone I lived with. Every time I tried to find someone else, though, my attention would re-direct itself to my roommates address book. Now I was actually sort of mad with myself. I really didnt want to see him.",
      "I decided I was going to go back out into the night, outside had been a much livelier place. As my hand touched the doorknob, the phone rang. It was my roommate, M.",
      "M, as it turned out, was high on Ecstasy and wanted me to be home when he got there. So I waited. And he came home. I tried to explain what was going on, and tried to draw his attention onto the channel I was on. He didnt get it, but it turned out he was just about the perfect person to talk to.",
      "After a few hours of trying to describe to M what was happening, S came home, and I tried to explain it to her. She quickly fell asleep. I was unable to sleep, so I set myself a goal. I was to lay in bed, on my back, and not move at all until morning.",
      "What happened that night is mostly internal. Mostly thought. Though I shall explain that the theme of rapid and multiple synchronicities continued through the night. And that every time I had an epiphany as I lay there thinking, the digital clock read as a palindromic number.",
      "In the morning, the experience continued. I felt deep serenity, and was very energetic -though not hyperactive or over stimulated. I had an interesting experience with my two cats, that lasted for a couple of days.  I found that they seemed aware of my mindset, and desperately sought my attention. I followed them around, and they led me from place to place, where they would circle until I found what they had led me to. Usually, it was a mess, their water needed to be changed, for example. Occasionally, it was a toy theyd lodged under the edge of a piece of furniture. Whenever I did what they led me to, their behaviour changed to enamoured affection, before they led me off to the next task.",
      "The sense of spatial vision stopped after I finally slept, as did the awareness of conversation and sound. What was occurring with the cats continued for several days, as did my energy. I solved every problem I could think of, did all of the cleaning, and was amazed at how many things I was suddenly noticing that I had simply never observed before. These things ended after a further two days.",
      "The synchronicities didnt.\rPart 4 - What Came Next",
      "Again, I dove right back into LSD and consumed it several times a week. Again, the fugue-state eluded me. This lasted for almost two months. I had been a disastrous wreck for much of that time. This time, the idea of losing the fugue and not being able to reclaim it was terrifying to me. I wish I could accurately portray my behaviour during this time, but its difficult. This second experience was even more traumatic than the first, for not only had I been shown an incredible and revolutionary transformation of my entire inner world, but I was unable to perform it a second time. After a few weeks, I began to get depressed, and concluded that it had been a repeat of my first experience in April, and that it represented an episode of drug -induced psychosis. ",
      "Beekeeper M.",
      "A good friend of mine, was having a birthday party. It was the second or third week of December. I invited to come with me, my girlfriend, and two more friends. One of them was beekeeper M. As you may guess from his nick-name, this M is a beekeeper and lives on a farm outside of the city.  M is also a deeply religious Seventh Day Adventist. His personal interpretation of his faith, allows him to consume psychedelics, although he had a long history of psychedelic use that occurred at a time when his views were more liberal.",
      "This evening, M and I consumed both LSD and mushrooms, one tab and one gram for each of us. When the party turned out to be a bit of a dud, we went back to my apartment. I was tripping strongly, when I suddenly felt a strange sensation come over me. I had been pulled into the fugue. I looked around the room, my eyes wide.",
      "M was right there with me. Grinning.",
      "S and my roommate M werent. M, my roomate, had consumed mushrooms, but S was only drunk. What occurred next cant even be explained. Beekeeper M and I were communicating, without words, although I would not dare to call it telepathy. It was as though the world was a record, our attention was the needle and M and I were in the exact same groove, at the exact same time. The experience is indescribable, and has never been repeated.",
      "I spoke to M, and asked if it was really happening. He assured me it was. I said Are you serious? Its really this easy?  He assured me it was.",
      "The evening played out the way the others had, although this time I had someone else experiencing it with me. The synchronicities piled up, as though the world was communicating with purpose. On top of that, it was also communicating the same things to M. We actually talked about that one, just to make sure.",
      "It seemed as if every thought I had was put there. It felt as though M and I were having a conversation with each other, and also having the same conversation with our surroundings. I was cut lose, and was starting to lose my grip. I asked M Is this God? and he said Yes.",
      "I lost it. Completely.",
      "What followed was nearly violent, and a little terrifying, and not just for me. I was so shocked that at some point, I found myself in the un-rented apartment next to mine, vomiting for hours with more force and violence than at any other point in my life.",
      "I hope that I can communicate just exactly how traumatizing that moment was. In the span of perhaps fifteen minutes, I had received confirmation that I was not alone. And I was not insane. The experiences that had dominated my life, driven my abuse, made me set aside all else in a desperate attempt to comprehend it had suddenly been proven real. Even if it was just drugs, it was happening to someone else. And that someone else was my best friend. And that someone else had just told you that the presence we were both talking to was, in fact, God.",
      "I lost it. And Im not ashamed to admit it.\rPart 5 - More Experiences",
      "A few weeks later, I was now indulging for a different reason. This time, I was pursuing the fugue with certainty and purpose. Conversations with M, who believed very thoroughly in Gods plan confused me further, as I had never been religious before. Up until this point I had been very firm in my belief that God was unknowable, and that it was therefore a pointless endeavour to try and please it. If God even existed.",
      "The compounding of further synchronicities, too innumerable at this point to catalogue in any meaningful way, combined with M's religious certainty, again left me rushing to categorize my experience as divine. I wont try and defend my judgment during this time, as I had endured a great deal of psychological trauma, and was still heavily using LSD. I was barely sleeping. I thought constantly.  I kept on engaging experience after experience, repeatedly shocking myself. I left myself no time for recovery.",
      "Within a week, I was on acid, visiting my friend L, with whom I had first experienced my first full fugue-state. I didnt dare tell anyone the thoughts I really had going on in my head, and I had as yet no words to describe the experiences. I had not partitioned the different aspects into workable concepts or ideas. I was right in the thick of it, and convinced that I had been granted direct access to God.",
      "Her boyfriend was also there, and within a short time I was in the fugue again. It happened suddenly, as though my attention were simply drawn to it, by some chance event. I talked excitedly with them, sharing with them the searing lucidity I was experiencing. I introduced them to circular logic by having a conversation that was entirely circular. They were also on the same LSD that I was, which was of the same variety that our entire social group had been using for the previous 6 months.",
      "My girlfriend had been pretty badly shaken up by my behaviour, and I decided that it was best to expose her to me when I was in the fugue and wasnt freaking out. She to this day has never consumed LSD. L and her boyfriend were definitely not sharing the fugue-state with me, as M had done earlier, but were definitely intoxicated and willing to go along with me as the guide.",
      "We got back to my apartment, and after a short time, S and I started to get into an argument and my friends left. I found it absolutely impossible to communicate with her in a normal sense, and started to try and explain what was happening with the use of metaphor. Again, I laid awake in bed all night in deep internal reflection. Again, the strange attention sharing activity with my two cats persisted for about two days. \rPart 5B - Continuing",
      "I abstained from engaging in my pursuit of the fugue, confident now that I would be able to find it again in the future, and confident that it was a true experience. It quickly became apparent that I was deeply affected by what was happening, and that I needed to stop and recover. I abstained from psychedelic use until my birthday in of March 2005.",
      "During this period of abstinence, I thought about what was happening constantly. Every waking thought that was free from the obligation of a task turned to trying to understand and integrate the fugue. Everything from what had happened to my mind on a neurological level, to trying to incorporate it in my goals for the future, as I knew it was now inseparable from my life",
      "Until this point, however, LSD had always been an integral part of the experience. I just presumed that, though the experience was real, it still required LSD to be initiated. I was wrong.",
      "On my birthday, almost 11 months after my first experience in Montreal in 2003, I was having a wonderful birthday party. I had taken pill of MDMA and two grams of mushrooms, in a tea. I was enjoying myself, and at some point sat down  to play Gran Turismo 4 on my PS2. I picked up the controller, pressed a button, and instantly found myself immersed in the fugue. I was amazed but delighted.",
      "The fugue, it turned out, was an experience that didnt necessarily need LSD. This confirmed that, first and foremost, it was something that was occurring during states of extreme mental excitation.",
      "The rest of the evening passed with all of the hallmarks of the fugue excitation, but this time it was less intense. It was, in fact, enjoyable. The party continued, and I enjoyed the benefits of having access to such searing clarity. With mushrooms, the shared attention experienced with the cats, lasts 1 day easily, and a second with effort. \rPart 5C- The Dentist",
      "At this point, I wont include detail of my trips, and will just give what further information I feel is necessary to complete my presentation.",
      "After several months, I had engaged in several more trips, on both mushrooms and LSD. I found many interesting things, which I will not bother to elucidate here, as this text is already far too long. After many more experiences, the fugue became more and more of a tool. It became a state I would engage in to heal myself. I no longer experience psychedelics in the same way as other people, or the way I did in my youth and experience the fugue every time I consume them.",
      "To add to the evidence that the fugue is not necessarily associated just with psychedelics, I shall inform you that I have also experienced it while I was having my wisdom teeth extracted. Obviously I had been given nitrous oxide.\rConclusions",
      "Here, I presented only the key events that led me to recognize that the fugue is a very real experience, and that it is an inherent quality of the mind. Needless to say, the thoughts and conclusions that Ive gained from years of contemplating the subject are too numerous to express here, as are the details of my more recent trips. It should be sufficient to say that the fugue state has become a valuable tool, and that I have explored it deeply. I have discovered much of what it is (a state of mental excitation) and what it isnt (a direct link with God) as well as how to handle the incredible amount of information that flows through.",
      "Listed here, though, are several key points that explored the transition of from bizarre drug experience to valuable tool of awareness. I have experienced it with two others, Beekeeper M and an analogue version with my brother in law, S. That it has occurred with two of my closest friends is a matter for later consideration, though I shall assert that they are both deeply religious individuals and have interpreted their experiences as such. Sadly, our collective disagreement on how to interpret the experience has been a divisive issue. M is a Seventh Day Adventist, and believes that his experiences shall have profound consequences in his faith. S is a practising druid, and believes that this ought to be kept secret, and shared only with initiates. I, of course, have chosen to subject my experiences to the rigors of scientific inquiry.",
      "I have also experienced this state one a variety of drug types, and combinations. Some of these drugs are completely unrelated, as in the case of my nitrous oxide experience. It should be clarified that there is still a sense of awareness as to what drug Im on at the time, that there is an experiential difference between the fugue on LSD, on mushrooms, on nitrous oxide, on MDMA.",
      "During my subsequent experiences, I realised that accessing the fugue requires either an accident of attention, or an intent. I soon learned how to intentionally to access it, as well as how to lower its intensity. I have yet to disassociate the experience from drugs, although the threshold quantity required to access this mindset has lowered significantly.",
      "I have also learned to recognize aspects of the fugue state in normal waking life, as well as when I consume marijuana. Although this usually only leads me to small realisations about how to better get along in my immediate environment, it serves as a means of clearing up mental blockages.",
      "There is much, much more that can be said on this matter. After three years of exploration, trauma and recovery."

      "I read on the internet earlier today about a biotechnology company that is attempting to create a method to vaporize pain killers in an inhaler-type device to almost instantly relieve pain rather than the user having to wait for 30 minutes to see the effect.  I had just bought a vaporizer for smoking tobacco the other day, so this gave me an idea.  Maybe I should put my tramadol in the vaporizer and give it a shot.",
      "I tried this around 4:00pm today.  I didn't know if it was going to work at all so instead of taking my usual dose (300mg = 6 pills) I used only 2.  I crushed them up a bit and put them in.",
      "About 7 minutes later the vaporizer was filled with vapor so I took a hit.  I started to cough up a lung because the vapor burned my throat badly and it tasted horrible.  Never the less, I kept on puffing and I slowly got somewhat used to it.  A few minutes later, when I was almost done inhaling all of the vapor, I started to feel relaxed.",
      "This lasted for about an hour or so.  I'm sure if I had used 6 or 8 pills rather than two I would have felt great for a much longer period, but I decided I didn't want to subject myself to that horrible taste again.",
      "All in all it was a good experience learning I could vaporize a pill.  I liked getting the effect in 5 minutes rather than the normal hour it takes for tramadol to kick in with me."

      "I recently had a great experience combining two low doses of different psychedelics. I've been experimenting with the approach of using a low dose of one substance to nudge me just out of my normal state, and a low dose of another substance to slightly increase that state. Most of the time, the second drug will affect me stronger than it would have on it's own, almost as if I had taken a full dose of it, because the first substance acts as a path opener. The high that ensues is usually a subtle combination of both drugs, less overwhelming than a full dose of either, but usually enough for me to have a very good time.",
      "The two substances in question that evening were 2c-t-2 as a path opener, and 5-meo-dipt as the added boost. At 10pm I ingested 6mg of 2c-t-2 dissolved in water. I waited for the subtle change in perception and minor anxiety (that, for me, often seems to accompany the initial phenethylamine push) to integrate and plateau, and then at midnight, I similarly took 4mg of 5-meo-dipt, just before going to a dance event.",
      "By the time I had gotten there, relaxed, hydrated, and waited for the visiting DJ to make his appearance at the decks (1am), the 5-meo-dipt had smoothly sailed into my personal world, effortlessly combining it's own brand of intense physical energy with the mood lift that was already rolling through me from the 2c-t-2. I felt great. I danced, I shook, I let my limbs be taken over by the bass. During one rhythmic build, I had the clear sensation of having a ball of energy move up my spine in beat with the music, and explode above my head as everyone's arms raised to welcome another peak in the mix. Again, during all this, as with my other low dose experiments, I was able to stop it whenever I wanted, and coordinate myself enough to get water, talk to a few people etc...",

When these occur with me, they usually take a week to resolve. It was my second day into this episode, when I decided to go dancing. The day after the above experience, my neck pain was completely gone! And remains so several day later. All in all, cheaper and more fun than a chiropractor!"

      "I am not just writing a I got fucked up!!!  report, but a guided tour of how I get high using needles.",
      "It is a hassle not having a car, and having to sneak around discretely. My roommate has no clue I do anything worse than smoke pot. So waiting at the coffee shop, I lost patience on my first coke-dealer (had to work at 6:00 PM).so my heroin guy picked up the coke as well before he picked me up drove me home. The first dealers phone calls were ignored since he was late. So I scored a half-gram of heroin, and a teener (1/16th of ounce) of cocaine for the price of an eightball. I was limited on time since I had to work, and wasnt going without the rewards of payday",
      "A.) The Cocaine Ringer...",
      "4,30 PM:  I went to my bathroom and carefully rationed out a  gram of coke in my spoon. I measured 40 cc of water. I rolled up a q-tip for a filter. The cocaine was good quality, chunky and had a rainbow shine. It dissolved well in the water and turned clear. I always get real excited when get ready to shoot up, had to do it slowly because my hands were shaking. I popped it into a good vein in my forearm. I pulled the plunger back to get a blood flow. Bingo! I shot it all in. As soon as I shot a rinse of water from my needle into my mouth I felt the desired effects. The taste slowly fills all of the taste-buds, nerves, and tissue. My whole body felt like a warm blanket covered my skin from toes up to my scalp. The music I had playing had a great flangy/ phaser effect and all I could do was just say ahhhh! The body buzz was more euphoric than ecstasy! That with the sound effects was my chemical-orgasm. There are no words to describe the feeling.",
      "4:40 PM: Slowly felt the peak fade away.  Now this is where I want to do something so I dont get stuck on stupidthe restless energy I am left with tweeking on coke.",
      "B.) The Heroin Follow-up",
      "I wasnt going to work half-cocked. I needed a balance for the coke, and booze wasnt an option. Now I never mix cocaine and heroin at the same time because I cook my heroin, where if you cook the coke its gonna turn gooey and harden, thus clogging the needle and wasting dope.",
      "4:55 PM: The heroin was a gray/tan chunk. I crushed it into a fine powder. I dumped about and tenth of a gram, maybe more into the spoon. I measured out 40 cc of water and slowly squirted it into the powder. I then lit the bottom of the spoon with my lighter until the brown mixture dissolved into a golden liquid. I dropped a new q-tip ball into the mix and pulled out a good 35 cc. I then found a different vein to shoot the dope in. I felt it immediately. Ahhhh! Kind of like 5 long island ice teas or  taking 5 1,000 mg vicodine pills. I get a nice body buzz and a spinning in my head. I always want to be seated when I do this. Breathe. Relax and enjoy. This lasted over 8 hours. I always end my coke rush with a heroin glow to get rid of the cravings. ",
      "C.) SUMMARY",
      "Work was a breeze. Only one of my supervisors sensed I may have been on something, but is cool and told me to smoke pot after work next time. I repeated the same steps as above until I reached a critical supply level. I wrapped the goodies up and am saving them for a rainy day."

      "I wrote this report up to discuss the first time my friends and I ate mushrooms. To add a little background on us we had been avid pot smokers for almost two years and stumbled upon a batch of Mushrooms most unexpectedly.",
      "So the story goes.. I met a friend at the local county College who happened to have a batch of mushrooms. At first I was skeptical because I had heard rumors of people faking psychoactive mushrooms for other kinds of shroom, but a friend (the one who introduced me to the guy selling the shrooms) had already tried an 8th and said it was good. We, to our regret, paid 50 dollars for an 8th. This is terribly bad in price as most 8ths go for around 30-35$ (as I am told). But we were very excited, as we had never before tripped, and they were out of season (January). We got four 8ths on a Thursday and decided to eat them in the woods the following Saturday. I had recently learned that being comfortable was very important so we overpacked. On Saturday afternoon I packed two backpacks with the following items:  3 blankets, food, sealed water,  Weed and a bowl, WARM clothing, and a hat. For experimental purposes I also packed a large pad of paper, colored markers, yellow tinted ski goggles, a bottle of lemon juice. (I unfortunately forgot my guitar). My friends, who I shall re-name Bob and Eric, showed up around 3:00pm Saturday afternoon. We all had warm clothes and backpacks and set off into the woods at 3:30.",
      "We got to our smoking spot, a large forking tree that had fallen over a deep stream bed around 3:30. We decided the tree could act as a base camp and we could do whatever we wanted as long as we returned to camp when it was time to go. We got to eating the shrooms at  4:00 exactly. We, to our joy, smoked pot at exactly 4:20. Bob, Eric and myself were propped on the tree (one part you stand on, the other you learn your back upright against, its more comfortable than it sounds) We were prepared for very bad tasting mushrooms, and they didnt smell great. Each 8th consisted of about two full (cap and stem) mushrooms that were about 4 inches long. Eating them was a feat at first, they tasted like something dank and stale and odd. After a few bites, and a shared bowl of weed from our bubbler I thought to myself that they tasted a little like almonds. A little off from them exactly, but not all too bad of a taste given the new perspective. Munching the rest of our shrooms went fast as we were excited to trip. After that was all said and done it was about 4:40 and we didnt have such a great sense of time from the weed. By the time 4:45ish rolled around we werent feeling anything and Eric became a bit skeptical.",
      "I didnt know what to look for so I could not tell myself if anything, besides being high, was taking place. I figured that since my stomach was quite empty, though I wasnt very hungry, I would be feeling something. Eric thought because he was a bigger kid, 230 pounds, that he may be more resistant. We had four 8ths with us separated into plastic bags so after eating we had one 8th left over. I told Eric to munch a little of that and he did. He ate one cap which left the bag with a cap and two large stems. At around 5:00 me and Bob split what was left of the 8th and I told him to hold the paste on his tongue with me. The sun started its decline and I was anxious to start tripping before total dark (we started too late). The weed was decent hydro and I think at first we put off some initial effects to that.",
      "One thing that told me something was happening (around 5:30) is that I was a little anxious and jumpy. I walked across the tree to the ground and planted my feet on the earth It was weird for me. The ground felt more solid than I had ever known it to be. I liked the feeling of walking around on the hard solid ground and did so for a little while; meandering about and throwing some sticks out into the trees. The sun was casting a nice golden color through the trees and I liked looking at it through my yellow tinted goggles. At this point I still attributed nothing to mushrooms, I just felt unusually high. In retrospective I wish I had not smoked at first to better understand the initial effects of mushrooms. After my little excursion on the ground I climbed back on the tree and smoked a little more. We were quiet, I remember that; just kind of passing the bowl and looking out at the trees. No one thought anything was different than normal days at the tree.",
      "Somewhere between 5:20 and 5:40 we started to get really high. I felt my high pushing upwards and it reminded me of my first time. I thought this was the trip. I thought I was peaking, I was wrong. We took for granted that this new and exquisite high was what tripping was and were a little disappointed thinking it would be a bit more dramatic. We hopped off the tree and walked around base camp. I put on the yellow goggles and could not believe the sunset. Everything around me was golden and amazing looking. I called wearing the goggles the golden land. I know it sounds stupid but I really felt that having the yellow tinted ski goggles was like being somewhere alien and beautiful. I put on soft gloves and a hat and than showed my fiends the light. Eric and Bob liked it a lot; so much that Bob stole the goggles! Bob put on the goggles and ran away a few yards into the woods. I was annoyed because the sun was coming down and I wanted more of the light, but I let Bob play. I stalked Bob out in the woods for a good 10 minutes of so and was shocked at just how amusing the childish game was. When I got back to the tree with Bob, and got my goggles back, I knew I was tripping. I think I was the first to admit it.",
      "Its hard to describe it at first. I felt very much so in place with everything around me. I felt like an animal, a product of nature. At 5:50ish the three of us on the tree started to laugh at an odd thing: The wind was shaking the little leaves on the trees and we perceived this as the trees shaking the branches at us. Right around here we all admitted that something was happening besides the weed..",
      "Things are a little hazy from this point on but I will do my best to accurately recount. To avoid bringing any fiction to this report I will leave out instances I can not honestly remember well enough. We got off the tree and I started to crawl around. I felt very attached to the Earth. I was feeling primal and crawling around on the ground was incredible. It was cold and I was near fully sealed up in warm clothing so I didnt actually experience the cold ground, my clothes did. I had no cares to think about, I didnt even care if my clothes got very soiled, though I was careful not to get wet. My head was pulsing and I felt very happy and very  excited. I couldnt tell if we were loud and we didnt care. After crawling around we went back to the tree to talk about our trip. It was getting dark then. Near sunset. Eric was the first to get a visual. He looked at a network of roots coming out of the slope to the stream bed and perceived these little roots as moving. It seemed to him as if little ants were moving things around on the inner wall of the stream bed. Later he thought there was a perpetual mini landslide in the same spot.",
      "We all felt GREAT. We were under the impression that drinking vitamin C would help our trip so we started to down lemon juice. It was a lot of fun. It opened up our saliva glands and we just kind of hung our heads down and let it rain out. I cant tell you why this whole process was so fascinating.. but it was.  Things get choppy here so I will add the highlights. It did in fact get dark and we could see distant cars on a road through the trees. The lights from the cars were big globes of light that made trails as the streaked down through the trees. The forest seemed new and alien to me. I remember having the deepest and most profound connection with nature and all its devices. I was not as philosophical as it was meditative. I felt like a part of everything around me, it was unexplainable. Hugging little trees was fun and rolling around in the ground was like sex with nature. I remember saying, my senses are having sex with all of this guys. My ability to perceive on all levels was simply doing something it never had. All politics about anything were gone, I was just me in a place. If I could imagine Adam in the garden it must have been something like this.",
      "Having my entire body covered against the cold was a great idea and I learned it had its extra merits too. My favorite thing was crashing into a viney bush with all this on.. I felt the bush holding me up and my body conformed along its contours. It was sublimely comfortable. From there all I could do was moan and roll back into my mind. The darkness was interesting yet I would like to shroom next time in light to see this melting thing I hear of.. When I got up Bob was gone and Eric was listening to slayer on headphones back at the tree. Seeing Bob gone distressed me and I searched for him. We found him 20 min later. He was about 50 yards off base camp. Standing in the dark facing off into the trees on some other level of being. We got him back and went to base camp. I fitted Bob and Eric at different times with the goggles, gloves and hats I was wearing. Its amazing to have your whole body covered than just roll around on the forest floor. When they had the stuff on I pushed them into the same bush and they had similar experiences. We went into a small panic when we found out that the weed was lost and it was too dark to find. We looked for the bag with a cigarette lighter to no avail. But we still enjoyed the trip. Later we found the bag and it felt like Christmas.",
      "We decided at around 9:00 to leave the woods and we left all our stuff at base camp, which I cleaned up later. We than went out for food with a friend driving. Most of the time was spent at the restaurant and the car but it was nothing like the woods. We were coming down. Overall the trip was incredible and I am eager to try it again some day."

      "I have had two seperate problems with coffee/caffeine. When I was seventeen and eighteen I would drink many cups a day of coffee. I was young and I thought it was a good feeling to have the energy buzz, not to mention trying to avoid the crash that came if I didn't drink. But I noticed I got insomnia and had horrible sleep, and I tried different methods to combat it, including meditation. What worked the most effectively was quitting coffee and caffeine. For five years I didn't drink caffeine or coffee. Then by a fluke in trying to relieve stress, I started drinking caffeinated sodas again.",
      "I was still aware that I didn't want to become addicted to caffeine, so I limited my intake to about one caffeinated buzz every month. I was able to avoid coffee, because I knew that would hook me the most, so it was either cokes or teas. So this went on for two years. And then I moved to LA, and I was working in the film industry. For whatever reason of conformity I began drinking coffee daily and getting caffeinated daily, too. I was trying to get an 'edge' to help me get a job, because it was swimming with sharks out there. But once again, I noticed that I was getting insomnia. Another thing I noticed was I would get edgier and was easier to aggravate, which was a quality I had seen in my family members all the years I had been caffeine free, and it was a quality I saw which repulsed me and helped me stay away from caffeine. So, in LA I got further and further away from my lucid calmness and more and more into a driven thoughtless machine.",
      "So, after a couple months I gave up caffeine cold turkey, which made me crash for three weeks. I would sleep for 18 hours a day for three weeks. I couldn't stay awake. I figured it was from the months of insomnia and probably some depression mixed in there as well. So since then I will go for weeks drinking coffee or caffeine, and then maybe last three weeks without it. I have been smart in one respect though, which is I usually don't drink caffeine or esp. coffee, after 12 noon, and almost never drink it after 4pm. I try my hardest not to drink it, it feels gross to be addicted to something. Which is how I would describe my relation to caffeine. I would prefer to be slower, think slower, and have that peace than to drink coffee, always be in motion, always think I am right, etc."

      "A friend took mimosahuasca back in november 2006 and said friend, who will be called S, almost died from a severe allergic reaction.  She would later describe this as 'I think it is easily the worst experience of my life.'",
      "Set and setting: S had heard of other people taking mimosahuasca and having standard trips. S had taken mushrooms before.  S followed all dietary precautions for a day preceding the trip.  S was a little antsy to trip and taking mimosahuasca may not have been the best idea that night, but I am not here to report about psychological effects but rather that S went into anaphylactic shock which very well could have masked itself as a bad trip and killed her if she had not gone to the hospital.  S has some strange allergies to things like avocados and melons.",
      "On the night of the incident, four individuals drank ayahuasca in a dorm room.  It was brewed on a hot plate with water and lemon juice and filtered through a clean dishrag (she is not allergic to laundry detergent) and paper towel.  It was then split into four equal portions, the rue was drank (4g ea), the individuals waited 15ish minutes and began drinking the mimosa (14g ea).  S drank hers faster than the rest, but did not completely finish.  The rest of the drinkers threw up very quickly after drinking, but S did not throw up much at all.",
      "While the effects of the drug began to come on for the others as normal, S looked like she was beginning to have a bad trip.  She stated that something wasn't right, but could not express herself very well.  She started talking more and more adamantaly about how something was not right and eventually got up and started running around the room, screaming.  The trip sitter and another sober individual believed she was having a bad trip and so got her alone and tried to calm her down.  This was effective for very short durations of time and panic would always set right back in. It climaxed to the point that she was thrashing on the ground, flailing and screaming 'i'm dying' when the cops/paramedics were called.  It should be noted that it took two 150lb males to hold her down to prevent her from hurting herself, and 6 EMTs.",
      "When the paramedics came, they were informed about what was happening. She was sedated and taken to the hospital, after being strapped down on a board.  She was informed that she stopped breathing for 3 minutes in the hospital and could have easily died.  The doctors told her that she had an allergic reaction to something in the brew and that she had gone into anaphylactic shock due to it.  The only thing that she remembers is feeling as if she couldn't breathe at the beginning, when she originally began to complain that something wasn't right.",
      "This report stands as a staunch warning towards anyone considering using mimosahuasca, and against the philosophy that sitting a bad trip out is fine.  If someone is adamant that something is wrong then for god's sake take them to the hospital.  I urge anyone reading this to be very careful when considering whether or not to take psychedelics, had this been done while camping or solo, not much could have been done to save her life.  I have gotten a lot of shit about the fact that it was taken in a dorm room but I once again remind my readers that although she had a terrifying experience, she did not have 'a bad trip'. She had a physical, allergic reaction to the brew which caused her lungs to restrict airflow and her body to nearly die.",
      "BE CAREFUL",
      "p.s. having an allergic reaction and nearly dying is very bad. having a bad trip is very bad.  Having an allergic reaction while you are tripping, having your words go unheeded because your trip sitters believe some crap like 'she thinks she's dying, but it's really only her ego', being sucked into hell, strapped down to a board after 6 emts sit on top of you, and losing the ability to breathe for 3 minutes, while you are tripping, does not have a word to describe itself.",
      "Follow-up report, added Jun 22 2007:",
      "When she started screaming, the RA heard it and came to the door.  He was told that she was having a bad trip and he said he would have to call the police, and the person who answered the door then told him to call the paramedics.  The two tripsitters then went back to holding the one who was having the bad reaction down and told her help was on the way and that she'd be okay, etc.  When the police came, they had to ask permission to come in the room, which was granted.  They then came and questioned the sitters while the sitters held the one who was having the allergic reaction down, then the paramedics took over (there was only a small time delay between the police and paramedics coming).  One of the sitters told the paramedics to give her benzodiazepenes, but they wanted to know what she was on etc. so we told them how much and from what plants of each of the plants, that the rue was an MAOI (with harmaline?, not sure if that was mentioned, probably).  The sitters basically refused to talk to the cops but answered any questions the paramedics had.  It was left out that it contained lemon juice.  They then strapped her to a board and took her out.  The police made the sitters track down the others who had ingested it so they could question them then put them under protective custody and take them to the hospital (I believe against the advice of the paramedics at the scene), and two of them had tests run on them (which they had to pay for as well as ambulance rides) while one was not admitted. ",
      "As far as campus level, there were all sorts of rumors around the dorm but the story never broke in the paper or anything.  Everyone involved that were known by the campus were brought up on charges.  The sitter who provided the substance was put on disciplinary probation (you get in a lot of trouble if you fuck up again and it stays on your record for six years after you leave the school) and was also kicked out of the dorms.  The two punishments didn't have any bearing on each other as they are separate systems that handed them out.  Disciplinary probation is the next worse punishment than suspension. The other sitter was given warning probation (same thing as disciplinary probation, but does not stay on your record after you leave the school).  I believe the three others were made to do some sort of rehab program and got warnings, but I am not sure. This is arguably against university policy because the university does not have a policy against illegal drugs, so people were charged with creating a hazardous situation/safety hazard, or helping to create one (which they apparently created by ingesting), and also with causing or threatening to cause harm to another.",
      "Further, the police collected samples of vomit from trashbags, as well as a bit of mhrb powder left over in a bag, but nothing has been heard from them.  There were wet paper towels and tupperware with the tea and mimosa sludge in them laying around the dorm when the police were there, but they did not notice them, although they were looking as they thought a decorative coke-bottle full of sand was 'it' until the imbibers who had not had bad reactions corrected them."

      "I have been experimenting with psychedelic drugs for a year now. I've taken several trips before on LSA, LSD and mushrooms. But when I heard about DMT, the more I read about it, the more I absolutely wanted to try it. Terrence McKenna's writing is particularly inspiring.",
      "Over the past few weeks, my friend C. and I extracted the DMT from Mimosa Hostilis root bark. We were left with a few hundred milligrams of a gummy, slightly off-white crystal.",
      "Setting: C.'s dorm room. We had low lighting on and a large armchair for the tripper to sit in.",
      "Set: My girlfriend of several years had dumped me earlier in the week. On the one hand, I was thinking about delaying this experiment until I had a better handle on myself and my feelings. Another side of me wanted to try this stuff anyway, as I wanted to keep active. I also thought that it might help me put a different perspective on my situation. I figured it was only 10 minutes if it was bad, anyway, so I went ahead. (This may have been a risky or fool-hardy decision, but I gambled and won this time.)",
      "Major Chronology:",
      "T+0:00 60 mg DMT, smoked",
      "T+0:07 Primary DMT effects subsided",
      "T+0:30 one bowl marijuana, smoked",
      "While I usually smoke marijuana nightly, the previous night I had gone to the bar instead.",
      "C. went first, loading 60 mg (as measured on his .01g scale) into a small pipe (the marijuana kind) sandwiched between two mesh screens. He pulled it in with 5 separate tokes, holding none of them particularly long. Part of the DMT caught fire when being lit, and singed the screens. After his fifth pull, he relaxed back into the armchair and closed his eyes. After about five minutes, he looked up at me and said 'Wow.' Good CEVs, but probably not 'breakthrough'. Well worth it, he thought. As I do not remember his exact description of what he experienced, it is omitted from this report. I dont want to give it an unjust treatment.",
      "We figured that I should attempt to hold the smoke in longer than he did, and make sure not to burn any of the material. After repacking the pipe, I sat in the armchair and took a few deep breaths. I steeled myself like before I take a hit of salvia, preparing for a massive inhalation effort. It turns out this was not completely necessary, but may have helped. I held the lighter above the pipe, and drew in my breath slowly, allowing the flame to reach almost down to the DMT, but not quite. When it started to fizzle and bubble slightly, I increased my inhalation. I pulled in a large amount of smoke which smelled something like paint, but was not unpleasant.",
      "From what C. and I had read, we expected to want to cough immediately. I hypothesize that any desire to immediately expel the smoke comes from impurities in the crystal, such as leftover naphtha from the extraction. Our crystal looked good and tasted fine. We had spent considerable time and effort selecting our reagents and ensuring good quality control was enforced throughout the extraction process. I held the first hit for 10-15 seconds, released it slowly, and immediately repeated the process for a second large hit. At this point, I attempted to go for a third. C. says that I exhaled no smoke after this toke, figuring that I got all of it in the first two. In any case, it was very difficult to pull off. My sight began to tunnel-vision down so that I could only barely see my hands and the pipe in front of my face. Motor control of my arms began to fail as they grew heavier.",

      "I collapsed back into the chair and closed my eyes.",
      "WHOOSH",
      "My body was pulled down into the chair, through the chair, ripped backwards. My soul was propelled forward as if from a cannon. An electric neon clown face, like one would see at a carnival funhouse, came screaming toward me. It opened its mouth and swallowed my soul and I flew down a long track which kept bending downward, ever more downward, even when I must have been freefalling vertically, I was pulled more and more 'downward' along these two parallel infinitely downward-bending lines, like a rider on a psychedelic rollercoaster.",
      "Breathe and relax",
      "Breathe and relax",
      "This constant rhythm filled me, with these words echoing slowly over and over. Each time I envisioned the word 'breathe' I felt like I was taking in a massive deep slow breath. In fact, this could not have been the case. I recall perhaps twenty of these 'deep breaths.'",
      "C. reports that my breathing over the course of the five minutes following my third toke was completely normal. By contrast, his sped up rapidly at some points, and slowed to deep massive breaths at others. He claims to have been fully conscious of his body the entire trip. I felt as though perhaps I was inside my chest (or maybe the chest of the clown-thing, whatever it was), conscious of its breathing, but the rest of me was nowhere to be found. I remember experiencing the feeling of physical pressure on my chest, but not being particularly alarmed.",
      "At some point a girl outside said 'Yo' to somebody else. Her greeting echoed, reverberated, and faded -- 'YO.. Yo.. yo.. yo'. Where was that coming from?",
      "Breathe and relax",
      "Ribbons of colors shot around my field of vision. Planes of colors in every orientation intersected one another, spread out, and morphed. I saw colors hard to describe, initially, much of what these planes looked like resembled an oil slick, with metallic shades of green and blue shimmering away. They then turned into colors without names. The stripes and ribbons danced through the planes.",
      "I was happy, so happy. Filled with a warm and fuzzy feeling.",
      "The entire time, a soft buzz was audible, like a guitar amplifier with the guitar itself unplugged, but still turned up.",
      "Breathe and relax and --",
      "As rapidly as the trip started, it faded. I opened my eyes. Breathed in deeply, and exhaled slowly. 'Holy shit,' I said, 'that was amazing.'",
      "I asked how long I had been out, five or six minutes. Time did not exist for me in that span, it could have been a minute or an hour.",
      "I don't know particularly what 'the chrysanthemum' is, I don't believe I experienced it this time.",
      "Deep insights? Not particularly. I wouldn't say that it was very 'introspective,' like three hours peaking on acid, thinking away about my place in the world. Thoughts about myself, my life, my problems, simply did not exist in DMT world. It was a complete break from my waking conscious.",
      "Did I break through? I'm not sure. Without having tried it again, I cannot say that I know how far it can take me. No contact with aliens, bugs, or other foreign creatures that others report. Still, for what little of a glimpse I had, it was well worth it.",
      "I sat still for another twenty minutes while I came down. The room looked more vibrant and colorful than before. Geometric patterns such as the wood grain finish on his dresser were more interesting than usual. My body felt relaxed and tingly. Respiration was normal and trouble-free, as it had been the entire time. Didn't think to check my pulse.",
      "After twenty minutes had passed, I felt somewhat more 'with it' -- I could stand up and walk. My hands began to shake slightly. We smoked a bowl of weed to calm down with. The feeling was not like being 'stoned' in the ordinary sense. I had a great sense of calm, as usual with weed, but none of the 'inertia' or laziness that weed usually brings. The next hour felt vaguely like a low-dose mushroom/weed combo.",
      "The next day was fine, I woke up with a cold, but I don't believe it's related. (My throat has been sore all week.) My mood was as upbeat as could be expected given the girlfriend situation, possibly even more so.",
      "Conclusions: It was worth it for the come-up alone. The high-speed onset is such an exhilarating rush. The entire rest of the night had a very positive vibe to it, I felt as if I had witnessed something magical and sacred and was blessed for it.",
      "A magical night indeed."

      "FOAF and his lady spent tuesday from 10.30 am to 2.00 am at home having fun with approx 180 mg MDMA crystal each, plus numerous joints made with medium quality hashish. They're both experienced users of MDMA, which they use either to enhance erotic adventures together, or when they're playing gigs-both being musicians. FOAF is a long term moderate to heavy cannabis user. Neither have any history of mental illness.",
      "Wednesday morning they were both pretty tired, and aware that they'd not eaten enough during tuesday-FOAF estimates that he'd consumed no more than 1000 calories. After a late lunch of beans on toast at 3.30 pm, they decided to try BZP/TFMPP party pills for the first time, to see if they were indeed an acceptable MDMA substitute.",
      "They'd procured a tub of Enjoi efx party pills from New Zealand. The tub cost just under 10 for 5 capsules, of 450mg each. The label claimed 100mg BZP and an unspecified amount of TFMPP, and vitamins C, B3 and B6 in each capsule. Apart from feeling a bit tired, they were both in a good frame of mind, physically comfortable, and being at home, were in happy familiar surroundings. Having read of some of the side effects of BZP they were feeling slightly cautious.",
      "At 4.30 pm they took one capsule each",
      "T+15 mins FOAF could feel a very mild rush coming on",
      "T+20 mins FOAF began to feel queasy-his lady had noticed no effect",
      "T+30 mins - both feeling queasy, and both slightly speedy, with a noticeable 'metallic' taste in the mouth",
      "T+1 hour - both feeling quite speedy now-surprised at the strength, but both feeling rather nauseous, which really spoils the speediness. FOAF notices his neck muscles tightening and makes conscious effort to loosen them as he suffers from spinal arthritis.",
      "T+2 hours - the speediness would be quite nice if it weren't for the nausea and the generally metallic feeling throughout one's body-a harsh and very 'chemical' feeling headache tries to start, and comes and goes. Mouth feels dry and fouled up.",
      "T+3 hours - still nauseous, find that physical exertion sadly makes it worse. FOAF picks up a musical instrument and has a play-notices easy high speed playing ability, much like cocaine or speed-after 10 minutes is feeling too nauseous to carry on. 3 hours is the time that the label says to take another capsule if required-no way!",
      "T+4 hours - still nauseous -both a bit disappointed and feel that it's been an endurance-nausea, muscle tension, peripheral headache. Both ate more beans on toast at this time-quite difficult, but feel a bit better for it.",
      "T+5 hours - no change-still both feel fragile. Notice time has passed quickly. Listen to music, and notice no enhancement of listening pleasure. Also notice no enhancement of physical/sexual feelings-just want to feel better.",
      "T+5 hours 30 - the nausea is now only spasmodic. Both decide to take approx 80mg MDMA crystal - he sub-lingually, her orally.",
      "T+6 hours -both coming up on the MDMA-feels SO much nicer-a much more embracing feeling-still occasional queasiness, but both feeling a lot better-very tired though.",
      "T+9 hours - have had sex a couple of times, but the BZP/TFMPP has made it impossible to climax-they don't usually have too much trouble on MDMA crystal. Still suffering from occasional nausea waves and very tired indeed.",
      "T+10 hours - decide to go to bed-both feel a bit wired but are so tired that they fall asleep quite easily.",
      "T+18 hours -the morning after... both exhausted and still feeling queasy!",
      "T+22 hours - still feel quite fragile and drained.",
      "Conclusion",
      "A powerful stimulant, which would have been ok were it not for the negative side effects. Might be ok for taking before going out to play a gig, but it would need to be when one was fully rested and fully nourished. As a replacement for MDMA it's a non starter. It has none of the warmth of MDMA, very little empathic quality, and is much more akin to speed or dexys-only more coarse, harsh and physically draining. Please do yourself a favour and think seriously before dropping two of these and going partying-you'll probably feel like shit for quite a time."

      "It all started with my friends taking vicodin 5's and such, you know, the small stuff. They all were my weed-smokin people. Now they started using pain pills. So almost all of them were snortin away while I actually turned it down for the first 3-4 months. I stuck to my weed, ocassional acid or mushroom trip. Well why were pills so good to my friends? They seemed to like them quite a bit. So I said, 'Im gonna try it.' So I got my first pill, it was a hydrocodone 10 (the greenish ones) I ate it, took it with some water...not being high on weed. So half hour, 45 minutes later I can definately feel it and why my friends were into it so much. It was like, the best feeling. Weed was just an everyday thing back then so it was like, ok, forget tha weed, I want pills. Time went on, doing pills, just the small stuff, vic's and perc's. No Oxycontin yet. At the same time smoking weed as usual. Quite a bit more LSD trips were common too. That was my favorite but it wasnt that readliy available as the pills were. So with pills being easy to score, I actually started dealing them where I worked, at home, wherever I went, I had a big bag of pers or vics for sale. So at work the boys knew I liked pills, so one of them brought in a oxy 20, offered me a line of it. I so willingly said, 'yah, sure'",
      "So there we go I could feel this was like perc's times 5...nice. Yah really nice. So now I was talking about getting oxys to do and sell, and another hot item roxy 15's and 30's!~ oh 30's were my favorite. So eventually I meet this guy that has all these oxy 80's and I invest money in them to sell and support my habbit, because now I had quit my job and was doing about 40 to 80 miligrams of oxy a day. I had gotten to the point where if I didnt have any oxy to do, I was ill. My body would sweat, my brain ache, my body ache, and all I could think about was how I could get more!! Eventually I got so bad that I had run out of profit money from the pills, and had to pawn stuff off to the pawn shop just to have money so I wasn't jonesing (withdrawls from opiates) so great my body and brain are addicted to an opiate. What the heck can I do now? Just wait for more money and invest again. Yah. So I did, but the same thing happened again, I ended up snorting up all my profit money in pills. I was doing at least 80 mils of oxy a day now. By now I had also made a trip and purchased several bundles of herion, and tried that as well, never using a needle just to let you all know. I always did these opaiates through the nose or orally. Within a 8 month period of this point I decided to go to rehab/detox. I had try to quit myself but could never do it. I even had a doctor prescribe me 15's to ween myself off of them. That didnt even work. She found cocaine and methadone in my urine test. They took me off the prescription immediately. That was about my breaking point. I decided to do the right thing and get professional medical help. And I did. I was in rehab for 7 days and when I got out it was like I had my regular life back, since then I have joined the armed forces and live life free of a life sucking, money eating, addiction.

      "It all started a few years ago when I was at a friend's house. (for legal reasons, I'll call him Melvin). We had both dabbled with different drugs for a few years, and we thought that we knew our limits as far as certain substances were concerned. We had also had some interest in Datura because a friend of ours had recently eaten some seeds and tripped off of them. He didn't really give us details, but had said that they were extremely powerful. With that in mind, we went off to harvest some seedpods and eat the seeds.",
      "The plants were growing in the front yard of somebody's house. They were about 4 feet tall and had some fruits that were covered in sharp spikes. Melvin said that we'd better pick them fast so that the people whose yard we were on wouldn't bitch. We each picked about 5 seedpods and went to his house, where we opened them up, took the seeds out, and proceeded to eat some.",
      "I remember that the seeds tasted extremely bitter, almost too bitter to keep down, but we managed. I asked how much I should take, and he said, ' about 15'. (at this point we had both eaten about 150 of them). We both kind of sat around for about 30 minutes, anticipating the trip. At the end of those 30 minutes, I began to feel very hot and everything had a 'hazy' quality to it. I also noticed that my mouth felt dryer than it ever had before. (Think of running a marathon in the Sahara Desert with no water while smoking an enormous blunt, and you will realize just how unpleasant datura cottonmouth really is.) Melvin got up to get some water for us, and then I looked at my hands for some reason. There appeared to be smoke or steam coming off them, and I started to notice that the walls were melting- not 'breathing' r 'shifting around' like on shrooms or acid- but actually melting like butter on a frying pan. At this point I became very frightened with the idea that maybe the entire world will melt into a cosmic puddle, with me and everyone I know in it melting as well. Melvin finally came back with the water and told me to 'go to the next room and look at your eyes, they're fucking HUGE!' I did just that, looking into a mirror and examining myself. I remember that my pupils were so dilated that my whole eye appeared black, and i thought that i must be some alien and then walked back to Melvin with the new-found realization that I was an alien. I don't remember too much after that, but apparently we both walked around town in a completely dazed and psychotic state all day talking to imaginary people and believing we had the ability to teleport from place to place. (some of our friends had run into us and, realizing how fucked-up we were, became our babysitters for the day and told us about parts of the trip that we couldn't remember.) After several hours of this, Melvin wandered off to the local park and some of my friends/babysitters began going home. One of them asked how I was feeling and my response was something like 'only if the water is a billion years old'. At some point somebody called my mom and told her to come pick me up because i was 'really fucked up'.",
      "She came and picked me up and then drove me to the hospital after seeing exactly how 'fucked up' i was. (It turns out that she thought I had taken some kind of terminal, Syd Barrett-style acid trip or had suddenly gone completely insane. I was wearing no shirt or shoes, my brand-new glasses were missing, and I was ranting and raving about things that weren't there.) I ended up in the emergency room where i had to be restrained by police, orderlies, etc. because I kept trying to escape. The doctors stuck all kinds of needles in my arms and hands and i kept trying to take them out. I remember looking at my left hand and then looking at my mom saying 'Look, the Japanese blood islands.'  After that i don't remember too much about the hospital, except the day after when i was still tripping extremely hard and came to the realization that i was being held against my will and being sexually tortured with a catheter and started shreiking uncontrollably for what felt like forever (Apparently datura makes you unable to urinate, so the doctors put a catheter in my penis. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PAIN OR FEAR IS UNTIL YOU TRY TO PULL A CATHETER OUT WHILE TRIPPING ON DATURA!!!!!!!!!!!) I was discharged about 4 days later, but i had to go to rehab after that because i was still a minor and had OD'd. For the next year or so I struggled to come to terms with what happened to my mind that day, and became very strange and reclusive without the desire to go to school or get a job or do anything, really. I finally got a job not too long ago and it has helped out my mental state a bit.",
      "In closing, I urge anyone who wants to try datura not to try it."

      "After several very positive experiences with LSD, psilocibin and MDMA, I decided it was time to further expand my horizons. Ideally, this would have been done with more acid, but it can be extremely hard to get my hands on, and both my efforts and those of my friends had met with little success in that regard. With all of our local access points exhausted, we decided to seek out alternatives. What we found, after some searching, was the ingestion of Morning Glory seeds.",
      "After doing some searching on the intar-webs, we discovered that HBWR seeds would be a more potent, and hopefully safer choice. My first experience involved myself and two other friends, *R and *J.  My good friend *S brought down the seeds from his house up north (we had ordered them online) and we decided that a random thursday over Feb. break was a choice time for our experience. *S brought the seeds, and I looked up various preparation methods. What I decided to go with was grinding the seeds (without shucking them) and soaking them in water for a period of time, then filtering out the seed material and drinking the water. I bought 6 bottles of Lemon Flavored Dasani, and proceeded to make 6 bottles of 'tea' (no heating was used). I set two bottles aside, one with a dose of 15 seeds, and one with a dose of 8. These will play a large role later.",
      "Having the most experience with hallucinogens in my friend group, I wanted to take the strongest dose, using myself as the guinea pig. However, my intentions weren't purely altruistic, I also wanted a really strong trip. I put 12 seeds in my bottle, and 5 in the bottles of my companions. The seeds soaked in a cool and unlit drawer (LSD can be affected by light and heat, I have no idea what effect it would have on the chemicals in HBWR) for about 3 hours before my trip-buddies arrived. After using coffee filters to get out the seed material, we all started drinking this stuff, which wasn't unpleasant tasting (due to the lemon flavoring).",
      "At about 15 minutes into it, I started to feel the onset of a headache. This faded quickly. Nausea also came and went rapidly, never getting bad enough to induce vomiting. R and I took dramamine just in case symptoms came back. After about an hour, a very pleasant high started to kick in. The high was very tactile, and was accompanied by a very strong sense of euphoria. We decided smoking would be a fantastic idea at this point, and boy, we were right. After getting high, the euphoria intensified, and we wandered around. For me, the experience was very akin to low doses of LSD-25 that I had taken in the past. The experience was focused, mellow, and enjoyable, with subtle visuals and next to no actual hallucinations.",
      "Four days later, the real trip happened. A friend of mine, P, wanted to trip after I told him about the seeds. Excited to experiment again, I told him I already had two bottles prepared. Bringing them over at about 9 pm, I drank most of the bottle of 15 seeds, while he tackled his bottle of 8, and the last 1/4 of mine. After a brief bout (maybe 20 minutes of watching tv and feeling poopy)with nausea, we both felt the onset of the same euphoric high I had experienced before. Wanting to emulate my last trip, I suggested getting high. We did just that, smoking a large bowl. We were completely unprepared for what was coming next.",
      "Waiting for my former (and P's current) roommate to arrive so we could smoke (again) with him, we sat down to listen to some music. By this point, about an hour had passed, and we were experiencing mild visual distortions. We turned out the lights, and listened to some tunes while we waited for *D to arrive. Time passed quickly and slowly at the same time, and before we both knew it, we were tripping incredibly hard. D came in, and saw we were tripping, and turned up the music. All of a sudden I lost control of what I was seeing, and the most fantastic set of cartoonish visuals I have ever seen played before my eyes. P had a similar experience. We smoked a little with D, and at this point I was tripping much much harder than I had expected. A feeling akin to the loss of control that comes with drinking too much was taking over my mind, and I was saying things that I normally would have kept private, commenting on how I looked in the mirror, etc. My eyes and ears were red from smoking, and as I watched myself, my ears elongated and stretched to a point, and my eyes and mouth began pouring fire out of them. I became the devil for a few moments, then reverted to my human form. I thought this was incredible, and laughed loudly about it.",
      "Visuals were uncontrollable and potent at this point. My perspective was shifting in wonderful ways, with my hands being the size of mountains. I was a giant among men, and nothing could stop me. I could have leapt over a building if I wanted to, and I was enjoying myself immensely. This was the most powerful experience I have ever had, even more so than 4 hits of LSD. My pupils took up my entire iris, and I couldn't stop grinning like a madman. I began to feel increasingly introverted, and looking back, it's due to the presence of someone who wasn't tripping (D). I was overcome with the urge to go back to my room and finish the trip alone, so I tried to leave. All of a sudden, nausea hit me with the all the force it could muster. I made it to the bathroom, and threw up once. Cleaning up, I realized I felt incredibly better. In fact, even vomiting hadn't been that unpleasant. I washed up and left D and P, and went back to my room. What followed was a wonderful talk with some old friends, musical enjoyment, and the trippiest session of mariokart 64 in the history of mankind.",
      "The night was fantastic, and my trip wasnt even half done. I lay in bed tripping silently from about 2 until 7 in the morning, then fell asleep until about noon. Realizing I had to get to class, I got out of bed, only to realize I was STILL tripping! It was very mild, but if I focused on the visuals, I could increase their potency and induce a peak. I continued to trip on and off, with lessening frequency and intensity, until 7 that night. In my Bio class, we were watching pictures of Monkeys and talking about primate evolution. The monkeys would look at me, get up, and walk around the projection screen. It was incredible. Going to bed that night, I had incredibly vivid and memorable dreams, and they have continued since then (it has now been 4 days). Waking up the next day, I felt nearly normal. P wasnt so lucky. He had a bad trip after I left, since he was unprepared for what was coming and had no-one as crazy as he was to relate to. He only started feeling better yesterday.",
      "Why was my trip so powerful this time? I think its because the seeds had soaked in water for 4 days before the trip. Every account I have read online involves soaking the seeds in about a shotglass of water or alcohol to minimize the amount of liquid you have to drink, my theory is that this limits the potency of the trip. Water can only hold so much of a chemical before it becomes supersaturated with it, and no more will dissolve into the water. By using entire bottles of water, and allowing for such a long period of saturation, it allowed that much more LSA to leech into the liquid. I made several more bottles and I plan on revisiting the land of giantism and euphoria tomorrow.",
      "Some personal suggestions:",
      "Use the method I did for extraction. It works wonders.",

      "After being an every day user of hero wan... for about 4 or 5 months, i decided one day to quit cold turkey (mind you, i was not shooting it, only snorting it, but i was doing anywhere from 6 to 10 bags a day, which is ALOT, enough to easily OD a non-user, or even an unexperienced user with slight tolerance) so ive felt the less severe symptoms of being dope sick when i stopped my one-bag-a-day habit the year prior (only snorting), and lemme tell you, that was no picnic. but only that time i didnt tell anyone, not even my parents, i just sed i had the flu and stayed home from school for about 4 days...feeling like a new man coming off the stuff.  Then a couple months later my dumbass started using again.  I decided to tell my parents bcuz this time i know i couldnt do it myself. i wanted to stop, but the craving to use would be so severe that i would end up using.",
      "so after letting my parents know (who had nooo idea watsoever) they were fully supportive and took me to the hospital.  they gave me a clonidine patch at the hospital and told me to take it off when i felt better.  the only thing i noticed was that it gave me a slight lightheaded feeling (most likely due to its blood pressure lowering qualities). thats about it. as far as helping me to get thru withdrawal..i couldnt tell you...i was so sick it was like being in hell...i did not get a wink of sleep for the first 3 days..then on the fourth day i felt a little better and by the fifth day my symptoms were just about gone but i still couldnt sleep...i decided to take the patch off and i slept fine..ive been clean ever since (that was june 2006)and always fight the urge to use heroin again...it is by far the most addicitve substance ive ever used..i strongly suggest to never try it..cuz i would say about 90 percent of people who try it WILL become addicts...the other 10 percent have to be extremely strong willed people to try it a stay off of it...it will slowly creep up on you no matter who you are, in retrospective of clonidine..i dont think the patch administers enough of the substance to feel any effects, however, i doubt it has any recreational qualtites, but i could be wrong..."

      "I am 23 years old with a high metabolism, if it matters any. I had done my research on this mushroom, prior to consumption, to ensure that I was not going to die as a result of devouring it. Chances are that if you ask someone if they've heard of the mushroom called Amanita, they will tell you something along the lines of 'Yes, it's deadly.'",
      "Most of the accounts I read, were nothing more than profuse sweating, drowsy, nausea, and eventually vomiting. Thinking back, their vomiting was likely the reason for their lack of a 'trip'. The other end of the spectrum, where there where but a few accounts of people who went into other dimensions, but could not explain their trip. They could not even begin to, so they said. As a result, I didn't know what to think was going to happen to me, but I had a gut feeling that it wouldn't work since so many things were going wrong in my life at the time.",
      "I bought one ounce of 'Siberian Amanita Muscaria Caps (Grade A)' from a widely known source, and upon arrival 2-3 days later, the cap was dried and crushed all to hell within the bag it came in, with a small portion of it in almost a powdered form now.  The taste reminds me of Psilocybe Cubensis but, not entirely. They taste fine but, I love the taste of Cubes. One problem though, it felt like I was eating clams because of what felt like a light film of sand amongst the soft mushroom. **Crunch... mush, mush, mush... crunch... mush... etc.**",
      "From what I understood 1/3 of the bag should give a mild trip, 2/3 will give a good trip, and the whole oz (28 +/- grams) should only be taken if you are 'very daring.' The first two hours are supposed to be composed of sweating, nausea, constant urge to vomit and feeling very tired. After the first two hours, the good effects are supposed to come on and the bad vanish.",
      "I know that eating shrooms on an empty stomach is good for increasing the effects, so upon waking that morning, I grabbed a glass of water to help get the dried mushroom down, but didn't want to drink too much, which could allow me actually vomit, instead of dry-heave.",
      "It was 1:00 PM when I started eating it, and by 1:12 PM there was little more than half the bag gone. I did feel a tad bit 'buzzed' by then, but it was very, very minimal. I was also feeling a bit ill in my stomach. I ate all but about an 1/8ths worth (looks wise, not weight). I wanted to eat all of it, that was my intention, however, as I said above, I began feeling sick in my gut and if I even thought of downing more I would have puked right there.",
      "It took about 2 hours from eating it until the good effects started, from 1pm until 3pm. During those first two hours I felt like total shit. I kept salivating and thinking every second 'here it comes' (puke) but I was able to resist by distracting myself with a movie that was on and other methods learned from many hangovers. Which, by the way, those first two hours felt like a really, really bad hangover.",
      "A little past the two hour mark, my 'illness' went away, just like that, poof! Then the good effects started to kick in. I was laying on the couch up until now and got up to take a leak, and felt like I was floating and every thing was in slow motion. When I tried to think of what I was going to say, or when I said it, it came out goofy, such as 'I better piss myself before I piss 'cause I gotta piss'. Yeah, kinda screwy, however the effect's did have some effect on my speech, it wasn't focused on it, I could still communicate. The high lasted about 4 hours and reached it's peak during the third hour. The main effect was feeling like I had to physically interact with something, mainly swing a punch at someone and fight them, I had to fight, but not necessarily hurt anyone, I just wanted rough, physical contact with something, anything(!), but preferably living.",
      "I also felt invincible. I was watching a werewolf movie and all I wanted to do was jump in there and kick it's ass. I knew I could do it! I would snap it like a twig and throw it across the room, and let out a mighty roar or achievement! After about an hour into it I released my urge and rough housed with my german shepherd, which reminded me of the last time I was drunk. I ended up getting my hand mashed on his tooth and hitting my head on a dresser, Neither of which hurt, but both bled quite well. But, regardless of my injuries, I pushed on and brought him to submission - I won. I felt like I had and could at times almost see that there was a one foot buffer between myself and everything else - A fluffy/watery blue buffer. At one point I felt like a strong bubble was covering my mouth and giving it a muffled, trapped sound.",
      "After that was over with I began to talk to people (real people) and I was talking a mile a minute. It was like I was on speed, or coke, even the euphoria and more vivid sights, and yet at the same time physical things were slowed down. I was even drinking a cup of coffee in one hand while bouncing a basketball in the other, hardly even looking and doing it all with ease, while thinking to myself about how interesting this is and if the others had noticed yet that I was on something.",
      "Around this time I laid down on the couch again to relax and was talking with my father about mushrooms and he was telling me of his past experiences with Psilo C. and I found that I could not pay attention. It was very strange. It was as if my mind would take in 3 seconds of my surroundings, his words, etc. and then it would skip ahead a few moments. I was skimming through time. If you have seen the movie 'Click' with Adam Sandler, what he was going through, was what was happening to me only at a much hightened speed. Much heightened. I was here, then next thing I knew, I am there, then over there, then someone is talking to me, then they appear to be waiting for a response and next thing I know I'm sitting on the crapper. I mean, it's weird, allowing you to skim through your life and be aware at times, and at others your body seems to be running autonomously, without your input - Just like as it was explained in that movie.",
      "It is sometimes so fast that my life is composed of snapshots, screens. Like an old black and white film on a projector spitting out the frames at a rate that you can differentiate one from the other, but none in between. Like blinking my eyes as fast as I can while drunk/high. Along with this whole frame/time distortion effect, I felt as if I were out of sync with my body. I would move and then a moment later, I actually moved. My body was lagging.",
      "This lagging/out of sync effect was what caused my hand to get mashed while fighting my buddy. I have my own style of fighting, made up of various martial arts, street fighting, etc. and when that happened to my hand I was distracting him and preparing to attack, with my arms extended as if I was hugging a giant ball in front of me and swaying side to side, moving my arms, jumping, etc. and I swung at his face and and my arm was lagging this time. By the time my arm reached him, my attack was too late and he began to defend himself, causing my hand to end up in his mouth.",
      "Looking back on it the lagging I experienced is quite normal. However, when our minds are not altered in such ways by drugs we do not pay much notice to it. *Thought comes before action* Even still, everything I did at a higher speed was like watching myself do it, then watching myself do it again within the 'shadow'(?) of my first. I see this used in some movies, like actions or Samurai types for example, where they swing to attack and you can see the previous frames of their arm and sword swinging out, and the further from the actual arm the more transparent they are. And then at any point before/after impact, they quickly replay that scene with his arm swinging out. That's what it was like. It looked and felt just like that.",
      "It was a very different high than psilocybin, and in no way similar - Not in the least. It reminded me of having a good buzz on (alcohol) and having that ballsy 'gotta start a fight' feeling. Along with the speedy/cocaine-like effects. IMHO, as nice as the high was, it wasn't worth the two hours of gut wrenching and non-stop salivating during the first two hours.",
      "I'm sure my trip would have been much more enhanced if I would have finished the cap, but I just couldn't, I even gave it two more tries after the first two hours, while I was eating something else (breakfast: bread, chicken, carrots and peas) and only got down to little bites and couldn't do a third without puking, even when mixed with my food, so I immediately gave them to a friend to get rid of, knowing I would never go through that again, and he gave them to one of his friends. Another thing, about 1/3rd of the shroom cap left in the bag, was powdered, so I'm thinking that stuff likely held a good bit of the active ingredient. My high would have been hightened quite a bit if that's the case, maybe doubled, had I eaten it. Maybe next time I will eat two ounces.",
      "So, the amanita cap did get me high, but it is not worth repeating due to those first two hours. Bottom line, neat effects but I'm sticking to Psilocybin.",
      "(I have changed my mind on this lack of repeating, like most people who get a hangover, yet go out drinking again in the future. I will use them again.)",
      "One last thing: The sweating that many others reported as being very common, I did not experience that at all. I did however feel cold but that may have just been the room temp."

    "report": [
      "This is going to be a fairly long, fairly in-depth analysis of the changes in consciousness that occur during a dissociative salvia experience, including a fair amount of psychological and philosophical argumentation. First, though, I think I should give a little information on the perspective from which I approached salvia. I'm a philosophy student at an ivy league college, specifically interested in the philosophy of the mind, including consciousness and perception. Since any theory of how the mind operates must account for everything the mind is capable of doing, abnormal psychological phenomena (such as hallucinations and fascinating things like synesthesia and inattention blindness) provide wonderful limit examples by which to test theories, if a theory can't make sense of such phenomena, then it is obviously inadequate.",
      "Pharmacologically, salvia is unique in that it is a kappa opiod receptor agonist, distinguishing it from the 5-HT-2 serotonin receptor agonists that comprise most of the common psychedelics, including LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin, and the other so-called 'dissociatives' which are NMDA receptor agonists (such as dextromethorphan, ketamine, and PCP).",
      "Now I would like to introduce some terminological distinctions. The term 'consciousness' is a bit vague because it can refer to so many different things. One sense is what I will call 'perceptual consciousness,' this refers to the sensation of being aware of a sensory stimulus. I will simply mention that finer distinctions can and must be made within the realm of perceptual consciousness to account for phenomena like unilateral neglect, in which the subject isn't aware or conscious of a visual stimulus in any familiar sense (he has no idea any visual stimulus is being presented) but it can be proven that his brain nonetheless has access to the information presented in the visual stimulus. There is also a lot of debate surrounding the concept of so-called 'epiphenomenal qualia,' a view which emphasizes a subjective experience in perceptual consciousness, there is, so the view claims, a feeling of 'greenness' associated with seeing something green. For our purposes, however, we'll ignore such distinctions, since we are only concerned with the kind of perceptual consciousness associated with hallucinations and other visual stimuli of which we are completely aware. In addition to perceptual consciousness, there is also what I will call 'introspective consciousness.' This refers to our sense of self, our unique identity.",
      "Before describing the salvia experience itself (and keep in mind that I am only concerned with a full-blown dissociative experience), it will be helpful to discuss the process of dreaming, because dreams are the most familiar of all hallucinogenic experiences. Hallucinogenic dreams occur during a stage in the sleep cycle known as REM (or Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. We have both introspective and perceptual consciousness in our dreams, we are still the same 'person' as we are while awake, even if we find ourselves in completely different and alien circumstances, there is no fundamental change in our identity or sense of self during dreams. The only difference, and that shared by dissociative experiences, is that all the sensory information comes from within.",
      "I use the term dissociative experience to refer to one in which a person is 'severed' from the external world, such that all sensorimotor interaction with it is blocked out, and the person has absolutely no interaction with the world around them, they don't see or hear anything around them. The only two routes to a dissociative experience that I know of are through NMDA agonism and kappa opiod receptor agonism, this account only applies to the latter, as I have never had a dissociative experience with an NMDA agonist. Psychedelic experiences, and, I would propose, although can't confirm, deliriant experiences, only alter our perceptual consciousness: the hallucinations that occur have to do with the way in which we perceive the world, hence the predominance of patterns and such in psychedelic trips.",
      "My salvia experience began with approximately 30 seconds of rapidly intensifying psychedelic effects until I was plunged into a dissociative 'coma' (for lack of a better word), I remained in the dissociative state for approximately 3 minutes (according to external observers), and then, once I returned, there was another 2 or 3 minutes of gradually subsiding psychedelic effects, until I was left with an odd 'stoned' or 'drugged' feeling which subsided over the course of the next 10 or 15 minutes until I had completely returned to baseline after about 20 minutes. Although short in duration, the experience was incredibly exhausting, I was drenched in a cold sweat and had to lay down for the next hour and felt tired for the rest of the night.",
      "The first thing I would say about the dissociative experience itself is that it is fundamentally inarticulable: words are simply inadequate to describe it, but Ill try my best. The other important thing to understand is that the use of the pronoun 'I' to describe the experience is completely inappropriate: the rift in introspective consciousness was so great that it would be a mistake to say that the 'I' who was present during the dissociative experience is the same 'I' that is now writing this or that was present just before entering the dissociative coma. The best way I can describe it is to say that my subjective, introspective consciousness was seperated from the 'me' that is now writing this, and was transplanted somewhere else. It felt as if my consciousness has shifted from 'me' to a thought flying through space, or to some primordial plane of existence or something like that.",
      "In any case, what was so amazing and terrifying about it is that, when my consciousness left 'me', it felt as if everything I had ever known about my whole life and existence was just like a dream, and illusion, a mere 'snapshot' in this new form of reality, and I gradually realized that that life that I had always known before was now gone forever. To use a modern reference, it was somewhat like the feeling Neo must have had upon awakening from the Matrix and realizing that everything he had ever known was just an illusion.",
      "The difference is that Neo was still Neo: he still had the memories of the experiences he had had within the Matrix, he was still fundamentally the same person as before, all of my memories, everything I had ever known, was completely stripped from me, and I was left to ponder this new form of existence. I remember fighting it at first, trying desperately to return to the 'I' that I had always known, to go back through the rabbit hole as it were, but finally, as I failed and realized it was gone forever, I came to terms with my new existence, and those with me remember me saying 'I give up' (which really freaked them out apparently). I remember trying to form words, trying to say something, as I was fighting to regain my old identity, but I couldn't form the sounds properly, and all that came out was gibberish until this 'I give up'. In any case, after a few minutes (a few minutes in the 'real world', since while I was in this dissociative coma I had absolutely no conception of time, it could well have been an entire lifetime!), the room started to come back into view, and I remember the feeling of elation at returning to that identity which I had thought was gone forever.",
      "Nonetheless, all I could do for the next 10 minutes is lay down and try to affirm to myself that I was 'back' so to speak, back to the 'real' reality, and that 'this' was what was actually 'real' and that what I experienced in the dissociative coma was just a hallucination. It was a terrible shock, really, having my entire identity thrust back into me after it had been ripped out of me, and it was psychologically exhausting trying to make sense of what had been thrust into me, trying to make sense of all my memories and trying to reestablish my identity.",
      "In summary, I feel that this was both one of the most terrifying and one of the most enlightening experiences I have ever had, enlightening because I can think of no other process that so elucidates the nature of introspective consciousness, it has thus proved to be an invaluble experience, as it provides me with information about our consciousness that I would otherwise have no way of accessing. In addition, now, to the puzzle of how various physiological changes in brain states can result in changes in our perception (or, indeed, how a bunch of neurons firing off in the brain can lead to perception at all!), there is the added, and in some ways deeper, puzzle of how agonism of the kappa opiod receptor leads to such drastic changes in my introspective consciousness and my fundamental identity/sense of self."

      "In highschool, I took LSD many times as a recreational drug until I ultimatly 'pierced the veil' on a few trips, with unpleasent mental results, and no longer take it.  However, I know many people take LSD as a 'fun drug' and not as a tool for introspection, and I'm writing this as a warning of what can happen in the wrong set and setting.",
      "I hadn't intended to trip on the day in question, but did so impulsively when someone offered me cheap geltabs.  They were purple, and literally as thick as a guitar pick.  I was unsure of how much to take, but ended up consuming 2-3 at around 11:00AM, figuring classes would be over (at 1:50) before the hardest part of the trip kicked in, and that I'd just skip my classes and wander around the campus/town anyway.  I shortly thereafter remembered that I had a doctors appointment at 4:30, and that my mother was going to pick me up at 5:00 (it was my senior year, but I believe my license was suspended at the time due to traffic tickets).  Based on what I've read, I'd put the dose at around 350 ug, but I have no real way of knowing.",
      "An hour or so later, I got the usual body-kick/giggly feeling, intensification of light, patterns, etc, but soon realized things were going to go bad.... I'd be walking through the halls hearing fragments of conversation, and my mind would weave them into conversations about me, my name being called etc, I remember at one point laughing and saying to no one, 'THAT, is paranoia......'.",
      "I got out of school, and decided (foolishly) that since pot usually has the effect of making me calm, it would calm me down enough to go to the doctors.  I had $40 on me that I had been intending to spend on pot, I think my plan was to by a 1/2oz bag for 50, but had spent $10 on the acid, I'm not sure.  So I went to the local park with a kid I knew, he was a heavy user of pot, and he agreed to help me around (I knew I was tripping too hard to walk around streets by myself) if I could give him a ride home, which I wasn't sure I could do, but I didn't feel that bad lying to him because I was really freaked out.",
      "There were 3 people in a car in the park with some really strong nuggets, they wanted $40/eigth, and it was hard to talk to them, I kept getting paranoid.  But I know I bought the bag and smoked a bowl with them and the person I was with, and really started to freak out..... I wandered around town (small town, just a crossroads, a strip of stores, etc) with him in a daze, at one point I really started to freak out and I said 'I'm having a bad trip' and he just kept saying, 'No, you're not', and that helped calm me down.  But we kept smoking pot until finally I was laying on the roof of a building, staring at the trees above me, and they broke up in 100 other things, nymphs, dryads, etc, in my mind..... but it wasn't the sense of 'being everything' (or alternately, just that 'everything is one') that psychedelic doses of LSD can bring, this was just everything being out of control, broken, and I couldn't make sense of it.....",
      "I remember being across the street from my school, and saying something about needing to get down off the roof, and my friend said, 'don't you know where we are?' and I said 'yes, we're on the roof of the pizza place', and he said 'no, look around, man, we left there a long time ago', and I realized he was right, or at least that I believed him, my abilty to interpret visual perceptions was destroyed, I was totally lost in my head, paranoid, I didn't even really know I was on a drug, I just knew I was lost and had to be back at the school at 4:30, I HAD to be there or else BAD THINGS would happen, I HAD to see my mother, it was like being lost at the mall when I was 5 and really scared and I just HAD TO FIND MY MOTHER because she could make it all right, except I knew it wasn't like that at all, and it was all coming in so damn fast I could't process it at all.",
      "We got in a van with a bunch of people and the remainder of the pot was passed around and smoked, I remmeber seeing road signs and not knowing what they really meant, but somewhere in the back of my head I knew I had to be back in front of my school at 4:30, and I got obsessed with this, and I kept asking 'what time is it? What time is it?' and finally they got pissed and set all the clocks in the van to like 7PM, and I freaked out, but then we got back to the school, and a few minutes later my mother pulls up, and I manage to say 'can we give (my friend) a ride home?' and she says, 'no, you're going to be late', so I think he was pissed, he walked away, I got in the car and it was all weird and broken, I don't really remember it all that clearly, and she thought I was stoned and was mildly irritated and said, 'were you guys smoking pot?' and it seemed TOTALLY logical to say 'no, I'm on acid', and she got really pissed.",
      "At the doctors they ended up just having me sit in a dark room for an hour until I'd calmed down and was somewhat lucid again, and they decided I needed to be removed from classes for 2 months (got to do work at home, yay) because my judgement about taking drugs was bad, AND my parents made me pay for the doctor's appointment, since it was pretty much a waste of money.",
      "The moral here is, anyone can have a bad trip anytime, and yeah, at least at my HS there were a fair number of people who took low-to-mid dose LSD in school, but that doesn't make it a good idea.  For some people this drug is a bad idea anytime, and I would very much recommend waiting until you're at least 20 or so to really screw around with it, because hopefully by then you'll be directed and independant enough to integrate the experience into your life.  I've had major problems integrating the psychedelic expirience with my life, I think I was bound to have problems with anxiety/disassociation, I don't blame these personality traits on drugs, but I think LSD made them more visual in their nature."

      "I'd like to detail a salvia experience I had last week. First of all, I've done salvia about 6 times and I thought I'd try to reach the highest plateau by doing a high dose of 10x (salvinorin ehanced)leaf. (for those of you not experienced with salvia don't even think of doing a large dose of 10x your first time.. unless you don't mind smashed furniture everywhere and being so terrified you'll scream bloody horror for your mommy while clawing at the walls)",
      "Salvia is no joke. It is a total mind-melting, shamanic blast-off strait to never-never land, especially at high doses. So I planned ahead. I recruited both my girlfriend and my roommate to be my guides (and to hold me down). I am especially interested in the multi-universe/dimension aspects of M-Theory physics and salvia has a way of ripping a gaping hole right into the space-time fabric of the universe. So, I prepared for my voyage be letting go of as much tension as I could by telling myself I have a good life and I'm generally a lucky person with a good heart and mind (The usual BS, ha-ha).",
      "I loaded the first large bowl on my glass Turkish water-bong with approximately 325 mg (1/3 gram) of the 10x (with MJ as the base), lowered the lights to almost total darkness, turned off all ambient sound, got onto my bed and had my sitters sit on either side of me. I proceeded to torch the bowl (lighter is right on top of the leaf for higher temps but an ice cube helped to reduce harshness) and began inhaling the thick smoke to my lung's end capacity (note: I can take pretty large bong loads and I think that ability is key to a salvia breakthrough). I held for exactly 16 seconds on the first inhale (I wanted to be able to hit it again!) and then prepared for the final breakthrough by taking another giant hit and then having my sitter count back from 20. (I've learned that salvia smoke must remain in my lungs for no less than 17 seconds to achieve a major breakthrough).",
      "I remember hearing 17, 18...and then I was no more. Spinning furiously and gaining momentum down a gaudy plastic colored vortex right into some grotesquely ironic inner dimension at the core of matter, time, space and thought. This was a very scary place because I got the feeling that I've now seen too much and there is no way I am going back (although the concept of 'back' was very vague and little memory existed of the 'real world'). I also got 'the joke is finally over' dj vu again in a major way (It is common with my trips to feel that life was all just a big, silly joke played on us humans) I  felt that the people behind the cosmic curtain facade were about to emerge and scare the living shit out of me. Who are these beings? They feel distinctively like someone we know very well but forgot about upon entering our earthly existence. It is very creepy yet somehow terrifyingly exhilarating to feel as though you are being watched by something beyond our dimension. Even after the trips this feeling remains somewhat.",
      "I have no idea whether my eyes are open or closed nor am I conscious of my bodys position or any of my surroundings. In fact, I cant remember having a body at all. All I feel are images of my childhood in all directions culminating and building up to an approaching presence.  There really was no hope of directing my trip to focus on enlightenment in the realm of understanding the universe in a way I could rationalize it. Salvia tends to take you where it wants you to go. The trip feels more like an exaggeration of the subconscious and it toys with your fears and expectations of how you emotionally view life and the universe. There seems to be little logic involved, just a blizzard of primal intuition; I feel like a three year-old kid in a very perplexing world and my fear or joy seems to shadow what comes next. This substance really does make one look at life in a different context and from a completely unique perspective. It is truly an out-of body experience. This stuff is really weird with a capital W.",
      "I realized something was holding me down. Flickering segments of a far-off reality were trying to tear into this crazy dimension. I heard a voice far off in the distance yelling something.I began to realize that it was my voice. I had been yelling help and hold onto me! hold onto me, Im falling in!. There were two entities at either side of my  stretched body. They were very far apart. They gave me comfort because I felt I would spin off forever into another unknown dimension if they let go. I began to realize that they were people back in the world I had come from. It was strange to think that they could be partly in this world too, sort of like the dwarf lady in the movie Poltergeist trying to hold on to the little girl from falling into the afterlife dimension. They were of course my girlfriend and my roommate, who were deeply disturbed by my yelling and horrified expression. In fact, they both vowed: To never, ever try that salvia shit in a million years after that, which disappoints me because Ive spent many hours trying to peer-pressure them into trying it!",
      "All in all, I think salvia trips are the best at higher doses. I feel once I understand' (ha-ha) this substance Id never settle for mediocre journeys again (if there is such a thing as salvia either tends to either just work very mildly or its wildly intense). So, I plan to get more 10x in a few months and have another go. I really cant do it too often because its such a crazy, kick in the ass experience; sort of like trying to water-ski without skis and your hands are tied to the rope. The only drugs I can even remotely compare it to are high-dose Ketamine/DMT experiences, but all packed into about 8 minutes. This substance- Salvinorin A (said to be possibly the most powerful dissociative/psychedelic in the world) has a big future. Yet, salvia wont be legal for long if people take it in the wrong setting and for the wrong reasons. People will end up in ER from carelessness. So please do as everyone else states emphatically: ALWAYS have a sitter and never be in public. Irresponsibility with this drug will just be nails in the salvia coffin and we really want to keep this legal for a while.",
      "It seems that it that there is a art to breaking through with salvia. So, for a breakthrough every time:",
      "I remain in a very comfortable environment (preferable my bed) with nothing around to knock over and with a sitter I trust. I use a water-bong and add an ice cube to the water.",
      "I use high-potency salvia (10x Salvinorin enhanced leaf from a reputable source works the best) and pack 250 mg doses into the bowl (unless its stronger than 10x!). I use MJ or tobacco underneath the salvia leaf as a base. Keeping the lighter right on top of the leaf the entire time I am combusting the material, I take in the most smoke my lungs can handle without coughing up (if I cough, I have to start over). I have my sitter count back from 20 when my lungs are full and do not exhale the smoke until at least 20 seconds. I try to take in short breaths of air while my lungs are full with smoke to circulate the smoke in my lungs. I repeat this process if necessary."

      "  It was a saturday night and I was feeling like getting high off of something or another, and since the parents were home, i knew that a nice joint or two was out of the question.  I recently had gotten into Hydrocodone and Codeine as a nice alternative, so I figured one of those would do me up right.  I went to my little pill bottle and looked at the contents.  Noting that I had quite a few 7.5mg Hydrocodone tablets, I decided to pop a few.  I threw down two of them at 10:20pm, and just waited.  I have done Hydrocodone and Codeine(usually 90mg) about 15 times, so I knew just what to expect, except this time was different I knew right away. ",
      "I considered it the standard that the mellow buzz would kick in at about 30 minutes, but this time I was surfing the web and at about 20 minutes I all of a sudden felt like I was reclining in my chair like it was an automatic dentist's chair.  I was very pleased, so I just sat back and watched the screen saver.  I very soon lost all knowledge of my limb's presence and the sore throat I was experiencing was completely gone.  At 10:50-11:20 came the peak. It was unlike any opiate experience I have ever had.  I got an intense 'strobing' effect in my vision like from pot, but without any paranoia or mind-clouding at all.  I certainly wouldn't want to do any important thinking (or driving), but if needed I could confront my parents I think no problem.  I felt absolutely perfect and warm, and the good buzz lasted until 12:30am. ",
      "The only problem is, you don't come down slow at all you just all of a sudden realize it's gone.  Kind of a bummer but well worth it.  This is by far one of the great drugs. I see some people on here taking extremely high doses (I've seen 37.5mg and up)  and I don't think it is necessary for me at all.  15-20mg is enough to get me feeling great without feeling like a glutton."

      "Friday had finally arrived. The anticipation was mindblowing, the preparations, extensive. During the day I could barely contain myself, begging time to make an exception for me, for the sun to set just a little faster.",
      "Curiously, the days festivities actually began with a drug test - that I passed. You see, I had found myself compromised in regards to my recreational activities some weeks before, and was at the time facing the consequences of my carelessness. No matter, for without the imposed abstinance of my cherished trysts with the Lovely Mary Jane, this night would not have been possible. After pissing clean as the new fallen snow, I made my way to the setting-- the local science museum, which was holding its monthly light show, to the music of Dark Side of the Moon, a personal favorite.",
      "With the show to begin at 9, I took all four of the pretty little pieces of paper I had in my pocket at 7pm, relishing the mildly bitter taste as I sucked on them for my traditional 20 min, before swallowing to make sure none was lost. The onset was normal, with the clammy coldness that I have actually grown to enjoy creepying over my skin by approx. 8pm, before giving way to decent visuals and mildly abstract thoughts.",
      "I had taken these same blotters before, actually quite frequently over my period of impending drug tests, due to their indetectability, and was aware of their relative impotence, hence 4 hits. The night would have been rather lackluster had it not been for my first love, Mary. I had arranged for a friend of mine to bring a car as a secure smoking location (as the museum officials had finally become aware of the type of people who attended these shows), so we all piled in and went over to the darkest part of the parking lot. After a brief stint of irrelevant complications, I found myself with a small glass bong in my hands, packed to capacity with some succulent bud I had obtained.",
      "This was where it got interesting.",
      "Keep in mind this is all in the context of LSD, which was still working effectively enough that I didnt even notice there was no water in the bong. This realization came about mid-harsh-hit, but as I hadnt smoked for the better part of a month, the pungent aroma that I missed so, so, so very much was more than compensation. Ah, the payoff of my patience. Obviously, my normally shield-like tolerance was at baseline, at with the first, sudden blast to my receptors, reality melted around me. It consumed my body with the first hit, and I quickly passed the piece to my friend while absorbing the INTENSE sensations. Depth perception was out the fucking window, it was as if everything I saw from the backseat of that car was on a flat canvas.",
      "I only took 1 more hit from that bulging bowl and it was entirely sufficient for where I wanted to be. I quickly exited the stifling car and made my way towards the building. On the way there I saw several of my friends smoking in their cars, and made a weak attempt to acknowledge them, euphoric in the knowledge that I was lightyears past them. Another friend of mine approached me later, and I was fascinated to watch her talk and gesticulate-- it was as though she was a fluid cartoon, and her entire body was a monochromatic collage of blue (smerfette?). I finally reached the floor and laid down for the show, under the giant, colorful dome of the planetarium, and gradually reached a trancendental state, to the point where I can barely remember the show, just nitpicks of the songs, and the intense elevation I felt at climax of Eclipse, a moment I had eagerly awaited the whole show.",
      "I could barely find my way to the train station, but once on, just chilled and enjoyed the closed eye visuals, before eating at a pizzaria and walking home with my friend. Its a long walk, and there were many adventures in between, but the real peak of my night was actually yet to come. When we reached my house, I was starting to come down (2:30am), so we rolled the rest of my bud and his into one fat club of a spliff, and carted it outside with a fuckin forklift. We finished it after some time, and I just laid back, enjoying the twinkling, connect-the-dots aspect of the stars, before heading in. I was way stoned, but not exactly tripping, and laid down..gradually drifting off.",
      "KEEERRRR---POWWWW!!",
      "My eyes shot open and I saw only my digital bedside clock reading 3:23am. My universe had been remolded, repressed, processed and spit back out. The sensation I felt as the full power of the bud hit was indescribable. I stood up and walked around, and realized that I realized everything for the first time. I saw things for how they truly were, they looked the same, but I saw them entirely differently. It was a heightened awareness of the universe and everything, I had no idea what was happening. Gradually, I pieced together the conclusion: My name is ----, Im tripping on LSD, and these are the effects. The best way I can describe the sensation is as though before I was just an animal, such as a dog, and that I had just become self-aware as a human, suddenly realizing, I EXIST. I also pieced together that if I went to sleep, the feeling would go away. I laid down, but was continually touching my arms to bring my attention to the fact I had a body, as it would instantly disappear each time I was still, and I would become nothing more than an immeasurable point of awareness in the cosmos where thoughts-were-matter-were-energy, where everything was constructed of the same inexplicable material. This was the strongest I had ever felt these two drugs in combination.",
      "The feeling lingered for days, obviously not as intense. It wasnt exactly a good feeling, but definatly not a 'bad trip', that was months ago, and my tolerance is once more at baseline.",
      "Fuck if I cant wait to try it again."

      "We had recently aquired a new personal catalogue of tryptamines to sample from.  I was very excited about our new finds, because I've been very familiar with 2C-E, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, and 5-MeO-MiPT, but I hadn't had much experience at all with 4-substituted tryptamines, and felt that they had something to offer me.  So now that my friends and I had established a good stock to experiment with, we decided to go for it one night.  Only two of us would be tripping, my girlfriend was present, but wouldn't be joining us.  The setting was at my home, we have a very neutral, earthy living room and decor, so it helps keep things mellow. The entertainment of the evening was a Les Claypool DVD my buddy brought over, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers DVD so we could watch the wallpaper.",
      "4-AcO-MiPT fu., (+1 hr)4-AcO-MiPT,  5-MeO-MiPT, (+2 hr) 10mg 4-HO-DET fu.",
      "(0:00) We eat 20mg of 4-AcO-MiPT fu.  I expected 20mg to be a very strong dose, because it had been the week before. the visuals had been exceptional.  We put the dose into a spoonful of peanut butter, and down it went.",
      "(0:30) starting to notice alerts, this stuff comes on pretty gently, almost too much so, it feels like we're not getting anywhere.  At this point we alter the lighting in the room and set ourselves in for the trip.  We changed out the lights and put a nice deep blue hue in the room with colored bulbs, a lava lamp and blacklight.",
      "(1:00) Now we're feeling the 20mg, but its not quite a strong as we wanted, there's some visuals, but they can be ignored, somewhere like a ++.  So we decide that a bump is definitely in order, so I measured out another 18mg and split it in half, more peanut butter.",
      "(1:30) The bump we'd taken begins to come into effect.  Some of the miprocetyn patterns emerge.  My buddy prefers it to be dark, but I like the light because textures and patterns in the carpet really come out.  But in the dark, there seems to be a lot of dimension shifting and bending, so I don't protest.  Its somewhere around this time that I think how nice it would be to mix some moxy into things.  So I then vaporized about 5-6mg in two piles.  Each time I would take a hit and hold it, a warm rush of sensory awareness would come over me, and an electrical joy would seep into me and spill through my body.  It felt like ecstasy (the state, not MDMA).  In that moment, everything seemed to freeze, and a warm and inviting presence would sweep me away.  I wish i could recall if this affected the visuals at all, but I can't.  It did make me more focused on them, though, I do recall that.",
      "(2:00) My buddy was also interested in piggy backing, but wasn't sure he wanted to smoke out of an essential oil pipe...something taboo.  Instead, we had talked about bumping with some ethocin (4-HO-DET).  Miprocetyn has a very warm, open, social feeling/vibe to it, and its perfect for philosophizing.  ethocin, on the other hand, is a wonderful meditory tool, it has a definite bent towards the infinite and spiritual.  We were dying to know how that would mix with the miprocetyn, so we each took 10mg of the fumarate salt, which is only about 6.5mg of the freebase.",
      "(-:--)This was ten o'clock when we took the ethocin, and it usually takes about an hour to 1.5hrs to come on.  During this time we sat and chilled and goofed off.  It was a very liberating high feeling where laughter comes natural and from the soul.  I think we kept DVD's running this whole time.",
      "(4:00) Around midnight now, and my buddy's feeling it all really strong, we both sit and space out for a while and meditate.  For some reason, I only felt a slight buzz from the ethocin, and that was just because I felt chilled. Miprocetyn doesn't make me cold, ethocin does.  So I just slip into meditation, and try to open up my perception.  The CEV's at this point are absolutely indescribable, multi-dimensional planes of color abstraction that seemed bizarrely digital.  This whole experience carried a strong force of philosophies of cognitive sciences.  During the whole trip, I felt preoccupied with the concept of synthetic vs. natural.",
      "(4:30-5:00) Now that my buddy had come down a bit from his jaunt, I seemed to have a delayed reaction to mine.  By this time, my girlfriend had come down, and she and my buddy were sitting in the room chatting.  I'm not aware of how it started, but they were talking about ghosts, and a haunting involving the Civil war, soldiers, and their ghosts.  She began describing the things people would report experiencing, such as smelling soldiers, hearing footsteps, etc, etc.  But suddenly, I began to move rapidly out of my center of awareness and it was getting lost somewhere else in my head.  When she was talking, just by me hearing and understanding the meaning of the words, it was making the perception real.  Sudddenly I was surrounded by a civil war camp with soldiers around me, and bootsteps, and their smell, but this layer of awareness was separate from other layers going on, and I couldn't differentiate between any of them.  I couldn't tell which layer was reality and lock in on it, and began to lose my concept of self into the awareness.  All I could do at that point was start smacking my hand on the floor so she would stop talking and maybe I could explain what just happened.  Because as long as she was talking, it was impossible for my head to get straight.",
      "Some point after this, I began to have flashes about the nature of awareness.  And I realized that all biological life, through evolution, has been moving to organism that can define reality at a higher and higher perspective, with humans being the pinnacle of that currently.  Part of us being human (and natural) is that we do create and define reality, and if we were to create super-intelligent, sapient beings who can produce, operate, and replicate themselves, then that too is a form of life, and no less synthetic than ourselves.  The concept of synthetic has arisen out of an anthropocentric view of reality, and that view has been shown to be fallable and incorrect, therefore, synthetics too must be recognized as an invalid concept.",
      "I saw possible futures through the effects of technology.  First, universal chipping, then neural-chipping so our minds are the internet and the world a computer screen, then universal awareness, then super-intelligent sapient machines who we share our awareness with, then we become the machines altogether.  Organisms that adapt to a changing environment survive, and those that don't adapt, die.  The environment's changing, we changed it, and now we have to adapt to it.  But the environment's changing in a way that may make it incapable of supporting biological life, Then an organism must adapt by findind a new platform on which to support its awareness.  Might that awareness be a universal technological consciousness?  If that were so, our habitable environment would suddenly radically be changed, moreso than when we found out the world was round.  Suddenly, all of 3 dimensional space would be our habitable environment, no longer constrained by biological limitations.  new beings could be instantly conceived and created, ready to recieve the internet-hook up of conscious-awareness.  This new organism would spread, discover, reveal, and colonize.  Eventually, a technological fuzz would grow and develop over all the physical bodies in space, like so much cosmic mold.  That's the future, and that's where we're headed, now just to wait and ride it out.",

      "T+/-0, circa 8 pm - in an effort to get /some/ product to survive the heinous binge of one companion, I placed a twice-distilled shock-frozen myricistin crystal cluster upon my tounge.  I would estimate, based on my experience, that it was a little less than would be required to fill a 00 gelcap - maybe 8 or 9/10ths thereof.  It dissolved into my tongue, numbing it, over the course of the next 5 or 10 minutes.",
      "T+30 minutes - was amazed, again, by the increased rate of absorbtion through oral vs. digestive membranes.  Felt initial rush of euphoria, stimulation, and sedation (yes, at the same time).  Began becoming easily distracted",
      "T+1-5 hours - A light herb-like buzz, plus recall of random tidbits about the span of my life, lucidity of thought where not specifically interfered with by inebriation, utter liberation within the bounds of the sanely safe and/or nonviolent, and the like.  Fairly intense LSD-like distortion and breathing of the room we were occupying, which is odd, because it usually leaves my immediate field of vision untouched while completely supplanting everything else within a given field, such as sky, or ground, or room.  Smoked 1 (average-sized) joint amongst 4 people at some unknown point in this spectrum, (probably around T+3 hours)",
      "T+6-9 hours - Smoke second joint, roughly equal size.  Peak suddenly begins.  Very suddenly.  It's exactly the same as the rest, except 1) vaguely herb-like head trip is intensified into a rather large amount of spaced-out internalized thought, and 2) an amazingly huge feeling of raw intensity that's not particularly connected to anything.",
      "T+9 hours - peak ends, go home and go to sleep.  Still chasing, happily but realistically, after whatever impulse strikes my little heart - I am free, and just a bit loopy.  Then, the darkness comes.... I sleep.",
      "T2+-0 hours, 5:42 pm the next day - wake up, still feeling all spaced out.",
      "T2+0-4 hours - still spacey, mild visuals still occuring at random.  Wrote prior experience report to Erowid while watching the screen dance colorfully.  Most of the liberating effects of seratonin (or whatever) lubrication are gone, however, leaving me no more prone to exploration, learning, and growth than normal.",
      "T2+4-6 hours - Angst.  This last mild trip came too close on the heels of another, within about a week.  Serious depression can ensue from neurotransmitter (seratonin? dopamine? something else?) depletion within a solitary trip, although unlikely.  I have the 'lucky' advantage that, for much of my life (age 7-19), 'serious depression' would've been the happiest day of my life, which means I coped pretty well.  Holed up in my room, listened to music, and got so homophobic (as in sapiens, not sexual) as to blow off a rather lovely shot as a live musician.  Its primary hallmark, aside from 'general angst,' is that this angst is multiplied roughly a thousand fold any time another human, perhaps even living, being, is encountered or contemplated.  It's definately a 'stay away from humanity' compulsion.  Tends to kill the sex drive, too.  I was keeping my trips to about twice a month or, preferably, less - which I was doing until this one.  This depression, its effects, and its very specifically antisocial nature are the reason I'm writing this experience report.",
      "T2+7-?? hours - although still anti-social, some euphoria kicked in to counterbalance the depression from somewhere... probably further drug effects.  Although usually averaging out, they would occasionally each become distinct entities.  Oddly enough, it does not manifest itself as a hatred of humanity, which it well could, but simply a desire to avoid.",
      "T2+?? - take melatonin (5mg usual dose) and go to sleep, hoping this would rebalance things.  Fall asleep watching, in neon green, the fractals formed by the boiling cauldron from whence the myristicin came.",
      "T3+0 - woke up at 11am,1&2pm, and at 4pm decided to make it last more than a few minutes.  Still feel rather lightly spacey, as though I had smoked much hempenflower the day before.",
      "T3+6 hours - discovered, while writing this experience report, that what I thought was the trailing end was, in fact, trailing into a completely seperate sort of visual hallucinogenic experience, distand and dreamlike and writhing and sleep deprived (not that I haven't slept well in the last couple days).  I'm not sure whether it lasts drastically longer when absorbed through oral membranes, which would seem odd, or whether I drastically misestimated the dosage, which would also seem odd given the number of tabs I've packed in my day.  On the other hand, this is my first experience with twice-distilled matter, although impurities in the original very much appeard scant enough to be negligable.  Nonetheless, I'm rather feeling like late in the second day of a two-tab trip, rather than late in the third day of an 8/10ths tab trip. ",
      "Whatever it is, it appears to be going up, rather than down.  The antisocial part(s) of neurodepletion (antisociality being the last to go) has also faded fully during the writing this experience report.  Although I apologize for writing this before the experience was finished, it does provide a glowing example of how deceptive this substance can be : perfectly clear-headed a few moments afore, I am now distanced from my eyes as a dream-like state consumes my visual world.  By previous experiences, I would expect full-field visuals to ensue, here, at T3+8-12 hours.  Do not drive on nutmeg, folks, not even the slightest traces thereof.",
      "Nonetheless, as I doubt all that much would be gained from a moment-by-moment, play-by-play until some unknown hour of the morning (I thought I was 90% or more finished after the *first* day), I suppose I'll end it here - my primary purpose being the warning of depressive neurodepletion, and that done.

Soon enough I'm fairly drunk and decide to attack the methylone. I'm looking forward to this as I love MDMA so much and I've read its similar if less intense.

      "1hr 30- Right about here things become so lost I just don't know anymore. I actully eat a further 250mg of methylone in southern comfort and eat a further x3 10mg gel caps of 4ho-mipt.",

Spacial distorsion to an astonishing degree, rooms are so out of persepctive I'm unsure that I'm actully in them. I decide to go into the garden for a cig. As I sit there I feel almost god like. I sit at the garden table and I'm sure there are other dark spirirts sat around the table with me and I feel like some kind of intergalatic physcadellic being. I feel like a dark being, a deeply sinister and dark being surrounded at the table by other similar beings with starnge swirling bats flying around us. Visuals are very intense.",
      "I've tripped very very hard with mushrooms but this was harder and much more intense. colours were around me but they were not happy bright colours, they were dark colours, sinister colours that weren't conductive with happyness. It was unfoundingly scary stuff that I was absolutley unprepared for and unable to deal with. However, at the time, I didnt realiase how scared I was by the shocking intensity of it all.",
      "I go back inside and try to calm down. It doesnt work. I panic. I panic a lot. Grab a coat and go into the garden again. I jump over the garden fence and start walking at a ferocious pace, I walk about 4 miles to a local farmers field with a lake in the middle of it, my only mental reasoning at the time being 'theres water there, if I can get there I'll be fine.'",
      "I get there, still very much wasted as a fart and realise that the field is not actully the sanctury that I've been looking for. Its now about 6am. I sit down and watch the sun come up over the lake which was, I admit, very beautiful and nice to watch, but short lived.",
      "I kept telling myself 'Its a drug, it'll wear off' over and over again but when I got to about 7am things werent improving, people were turning up at the lake and I was still very much out-of-control and very much panicked. I was starting to get auiable hallicinations aswell, strange noises and noises from people that werent there. By this point I'm no longer drunk or under the influenace of the methylone however cannot understand why the 4homipt still has such an unforgiving and strong grip of me.",
      "I think this lack of understanding at the time stemmed from the fact that I was so wasted when I took the 4homipt. It wasn't till the following day, when I was fully 'down' that I realised how much 4homipt I'd eaten.",
      "Meanwhile, back in the field, I was using my hand as a 'How-much-am-I-still-tripping' gauge. I'd look at it to see if it looked any less weired than it had previous, and each time it looked like some horrid twisted tree branch, like something from a tim burton film, whats more, something that didnt belong to me.",
      "Visuals at this point are very much similar to those from psicoln/pysobin. Visual perspectives are skewed, surfaces are morphing and my mind is carrying my eyes. For instance, I'm sure my hands and coat are unusualy dirty, so when I look a them I see dirt marks and on them, they look manky and horrible, later I realise theat they're clean and fine.",
      "I assess the situation. I've walked at least 4 miles at the speed of a possessed beast fleeing the scene of a crime and drunk little water. I feel dehydrated. I ponder drinking water from the lake but am sure that will arouse suspicion from surrounding dog walkers. If indeed the dog walkers are really there at all.",
      "I check my pockets. Shit me. I have my mobile phone and its charged up. FANTASTIC. I think if only I could articulate my situation to someone. I have a 'test' conversation with my self to see if I can still talk. I can't. Not without sounding like horrible and un-natural. I can't think of words to say either. I barely rememebr my name.",
      "At this point I became very alarmed and feared very slightly for my life. Looking back I fell into a deep state of panic when I jumped over the fence and fled. I should have just stopped. Thought for a second, gone back, gone bed and sweated it out. Here I am wasted to fuck on some chemical I cant even remeber the name of, dehydrated, potentialy scaring the shit out of innocent dog walkers at 7am in the morning. I phone my best friend and partner in crime, M. M doesnt answer. I call again and again and again again. I'm getting cold as well.",
      "I text him. The mobile phone is very very difficult to use. I can focus on it visually but find it hard to fathom what I meant to do in order to acheive my desired outcome. All I can muster is 'NEED HELP....HELP.' No response.",
      "I consider calling 999 and asking them to take me to hospital for some form of treatment as I seriously consider the fact that I may never be right in the head again. As I mull this thought over I shed a tear to myself becuase I'm so so scared for my sanity. I still can't understand why the drug hasn't waned at all. In fact it has waned compared to when I was sat in my garden but I'm so panicked I don't recall this at all.",
      "I check my hand, still tripping hard I think. Still looks like a wicked evil tree branch. I consider calling parents and asking them to take me to hospital. Yes I decide, thats the best bet. I call home at about 8.30am. At this point the best thing ever ever ever ever happended. My younger (20 something) brother answered! We'll call him X.",

I started to see little things on the floor and they looked like spiders but I knew that it was just in my head so I didnt care. And then I felt sick so I got up and tried to walk to the bathroom. It felt like the world was flipping violently from side to side. And I couldnt even make it out the door so I had to crawl the rest of the way.",

And the next couple of days were spent in my bed I was unable to walk properly for days and I chewed the skin off the insides of my cheeks.

Indeed, the feeling was much better than caffeine without jitteriness or upset stomach.",
      "Over time, I typically drank 2 to 4 tea bags (2-4 grams) per day and noticed several health benefits. I fruequently suffer heaches, fatigue, and painful bowel syndrome including IBS and diverticulitis. What I noticed afeter several days of use was that my symptoms of discomfort were gone. I eventually finished the box of tea and suffered no cravings or rebound irritability. I felt fine, so I forgot about the coca tea. Obviously this tea had no addictive effect whatsoever for me, although there is supposd to be a very small amount of natural cocaine alkaloid in the tea.",
      "This year I again had a severe case of diverticulitis treated with heavy duty antibiotics and prescribed narcotic painkillers. Although I minimized the dosage of the vicodin to last a while, when I ran out of Vicodin I became irritable, with headaches and moderate to severe Irritable bowel Syndrome, which I assure anyone who has never experienced, can be excruciating. Instead of getting more vicodin, I decided to take regular tylenol and order coca tea once again.",
      "Two days ago I received the tea bags and began with 3 bags (3 grams coca leaf) followed 5 hours later with two tea bags. I followed this again today and my internal pain is 90% relieved and I feel less irritable and less exhausted. It seems obvious to me that coca leaf tea in its natural state is safer and more beneficial than coffee, tea, or even Vicodin for that matter. This herbal medicine ought to be more fully respected and seen as a completely different substance from the purified drug cocaine."

      "having a 30 yr history of drug addiction, i know one when i see one, except for this. heroin, methedone, dilaudid, morphine, demerol-any and all opiates opiates,synthetics and deritives-plus all arbs, speeds, hypnotics, bla,bla,blah ad infinitum. substituting one for another, took me from respectability (i'm college educated and had a career) to the gutter (through a series of jails, detox hospitals and near death experiences. this was not the future that i had planned for but i had lost all power of choice BEFORE i knew it.",
      "through the grace of GOD and a 12 step program, i got clean and was clean for 1& 1/2 yrs.before i met mr.gbl(renutrient). having an exercise program, i had no problem taking a nutritional supplement to aid in hgh production-after this was a legal 'nutritional supplement' that would help me-right?  wrong-i was hooked from the first 1/2 oz. sip. it was as good-as far as the euphoria, and as bad -as far as the destruction, as anything i've ever done. in the beginning, i thought that i'd found the perfect drug-legal, non addicting, mood enhancing, bearier breaking, sex enhancing, body building and more.",
      "within weeks i was out of control. during this binge, i was stopped by police 6 times for erratic driving (once i had passed out in a total strangers driveway and they called the police). each time i took the breathalizer it was negative and i was able to become perfectly alert-so they let me go. i could have killed many people, including my 6 yr old daughter. i had auditory and visual halucinations-hearing people talking to me that wern't there (and talking back), seeing fire and smoke in my periferal vision, blackouts with total memory loss, car wrecks, job loss, and on and on.",
      "when i finally realized that i had to get stopped, the withdrawal was bad. sleepless nights (after xanax to take the initial edge off), unmitigated terror & fear, agitation, inability to think, physical and mental craving for more. that was  a year and a half ago this stuff might be the panacea for everyone else in the world but it's no good for me."

      "Before I begin to detail my experience, I'm going to share some background info on my life.",
      "When I was 14, after a long year full of teenage stresses and such, I had my first panic attack. I had no idea what it meant, but it made me feel like I was going crazy. As I recall, the next day I told my mom all about that experience and she told me that she had a panic disorder and that I probably did, too. Living was difficult for a few months until I was fully on SSRIs (sertraline/Zoloft - 100 mg). I now felt back in control of my body and mind. It is now over two years later that I write this report.",
      "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
      "I had been very interested in drugs since my first panic attack and I found all psychoactives and their effects to be extremely fascinating. I read experiences and learn all I could about these substances and I still do.",
      "Previous to this night, I had only smoked marijuana once in my life. As is common with many, I did not achieve what I considered a 'high' my first time. However, I think the reason was that I had no other valid experience to compare this one to and therefore, I could not understand what it meant to be 'high'. This was before I had tried alcohol of any sort. Skip to a few months later and I had drank myself to a buzz a few weekends in a row. Now I did know what it meant to be 'high' and so this leads us to last night.",
      "It had been a long week for me. I won't really say why other than I had been busy after school every day until late in the night and I had also been dwelling on the thoughts of my life and my need for an intimate relationship with a significant other. I had just gotten home at about 11:30 on a Saturday night and at my house was my step-dad's son and a friend of his (we'll call them M and C). They are both experienced in many, many drugs and C had brought along a bowl of his which he had been scraping. After awhile, he realized how much resin was in it. So, naturally, he offered it to myself and my friend (who declined, but was also at the house). I happily accepted, as I had been looking for the right opportunity, but one thing or another had fucked up in the planning stages.",
      "According to C, I 'knew how to hit' even though I didn't have much experience and I didn't feel much of anything up to about four or five hits. But then, after sitting awhile, I became very giddy and while C was telling stories about his crazy life, I was laughing harder than ever before. It felt very natural though, not forced at all. and when I thought about how much I was letting myself laugh, I realized some things were happening.",
      "I proceeded to take about four or five more hits, each becoming smaller as the resin ball waned in size. Now I was noticing the effects. They really hit me after I stood up, I felt like nothing was real and the past hour had been a dream of some sorts. This somewhat made me panic and I decided it would be best to take a walk outside (not a great idea in early March). We walked outside and I began to explain the effects, how everything seemed to be on repeat and that whenever I let my focus slide, everything seemed like it didn't exist, even though I knew it had just happened. In the cold night, my jaw and mouth started to chatter and I wasn't sure if it was the drug's effects on me or simply the weather, but then I noticed that everyone else was experiencing the same physical sensations so we went back inside.",
      "Inside, I ate a fruit cup. Food wasn't really amazing yet as some people say. Once again, it felt like I was doing the same actions over and over and, when I focused my attention, I came to that realization. I then went to sit on my couch with my computer in an attempt to write about what I was feeling. I noticed that, when I put all my attention into my writing, it was decent, but when I thought about what I was thinking, I got pulled into my thoughts and considering writing a trip report became futile. I told my friend this and he said I should let myself slide with my thoughts, which I decided to do.",
      "I pulled out my favorite album, Dark Side of the Moon (clich, yes, and no, I'm not a Pink Floyd newbie - I have all of their albums and enjoy most of them, but DSotM is a true masterpiece, which I soon realized more than ever). As I listened to the album, I became amazed at how all of the music and parts could be heard at once and felt simultaneously. I could hear parts I never really heard before without having to focus on them. When I heard these parts, I laughed because it was so fascinating how my mind could work like this. I also noticed how I could think of something, an argument perhaps, and think about that, as well as hear and feel the music and consider the nature of what I was thinking. It was a truly novel experience of the mind.",
      "When I closed my eyes, I didn't exactly have closed-eye visuals, but listening to the music made visualization easier and I started think of my thought processes in certain ways. The best way to describe it would be like the shape of a chromosome. At the one side, there are two separate strands and in between those strands represents all sensory perception around me. Then, when I stop and think about the experience, it all goes into the middle in concentration, in a single thought. Then, when my attention fades, the sensory overload comes back into place. That's the best way I can put it.",
      "Another notable aspect of the trip was the way reality was bent. It's a very difficult feeling to describe as many probably know, but the entire thing felt unreal and, even when I woke up the next morning, I could not initially distinguish between what I had dreamed and what had actually happened. This somewhat freaked me out, but I knew it was just the effects of the drug. Similar feelings happened during the experience - it felt like a dream world even though everything I saw looked completely normal. It was a subtle feeling. My panic disorder would have picked me up and taken me away during these times had I not had such a great knowledge of myself and my condition and that what I was feeling was merely chemically induced. I was in the clear.",
      "Overall, I would say I took a total of about ten hits off the resin ball. The night was a definitely interesting, mind-expanding experience that I will never forget. I'm not completely sure if I 'enjoyed' it, per se, but, by going into the experience with an objective mind, I think I managed to avoid all the pitfalls that certain individuals fall prey to their first times. I will most likely use cannabis again in the future, as I hear that nearly all highs are different. I now view this drug in a different light as I know its true effects and how they are much more mental than alcohol. I now respect drugs more and I plan to responsibly use more in the future and learn all I can about the human mind, especially my own."

      "[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "It all starts with a 5-gram order, funded by me and 6 other friends. Our original plan was to order 4-aco-dmt, but this one was much cheaper and were all broke as hell. I decided to combine two of my experiences with this drug into 1 report.",
      "So far I have taken a 15 mg dose, a dose that was somewhere around 35 mg, both of which are reported, and then a 10 mg dose and an 8 mg dose that are not reported.",
      "Before I go into a lengthy discussion of my experiences though, I will give a summary of my reaction to 4-aco-mipt to those of you who need methylphenidate ,-)",
      "Overall I would give this drug a 3.5/5",
      "To help give that number context, I thought methylone and weed were 5/5, shrooms and 2c-I were 4/5, ephedrine and alcohol 2.5/5, dxm 1/5 and nutmeg .5/5.",
      "\tFor me, I would say about 18 mg = half eighth of shrooms. I weigh 140 lbs, Im 5 4 and 16 years old.",
      "\tEffects kick in surprisingly fast. The come up is exhilarating and rapid. I usually did not feel it until 15-20 minutes after taking, but some of my friends reported effects after as little as 8 minutes.",
      "\tTastes like complete shit, cap that mofo",
      "\tDuring come-up, I noticed my body was confused about the temperature and I kept getting hot and cold flashes. Also, my sense of perspective and distance and time were completely shot until after I peaked (then they were only partially shot.)",
      "\tThe intensity comes in waves. It will come up a bit, stay there for 10 minutes, then take another leap. When I come down, it will suddenly feel like Im completely sober. Then 30 minutes laterholy shit! Im definitely not down yet.",
      "\tVisuals were very pretty.",
      "1.\tInstead of surfaces slowly changing between colors like on shrooms, I saw fields of colored dots, especially when my eyes were closed.",
      "2.\tI would see brief glimpses of rainbows around sources of light, like the sun and light bulbs and reflections off of metal.",
      "3.\tGeneral patterning that was similar to shrooms, but less smooth and creeping, but more swirling and wavingI know that makes no sense, its just hard to describe.",
      "4.\tCEV were amazing. I would see a field of multicolored dots form creatures and places and people on my higher dose. On lower doses it looked more like some kind of strange ambience visualizer on itunes.",
      "5.\tAuditory hallucinations were very strong. Stronger than shrooms in my opinion. When I was on my high dose, almost any sound that I thought about I could hear like it was real. For instance, if I thought about my dad coming down the stairs and seeing me tripping, I could hear it and would panic.",
      "\tAlthough most of the visual effects go away after about 6 hours, that number is very dose-dependant. I was still mentally tripping 18 hours after my high dose.",
      "\tThe perma-trip seems especially bad. I still have strong tracers and visual effects 3 weeks after my last trip (including colored dots when I close my eyes.) It is getting weaker though, perma-trip is a bad word for it, because it always goes away",
      "\tWeed synergizes more with this drug than any other psychedelic or drug that I have ever tried. It can totally send my trip flying.",
      "\tI liked this drug better solo than with other people. But this is true for me with all psychedelics Ive tried except 2c-i.",
      "1st test run: 15 mg.",
      "Dose was taken in a capsule at a forgotten time, probably between 3:30 and 4:00. I was with 5 other people, all taking varying doses.",
      "My friends are:",
      "R: 20 mg, one of my best friends. We both tripped together for the first time and most of my trips have been with him.",
      "S: 10 mg, a friend, more so recently because we talk a lot about drugs. Hes the kind of person who knows extensive information about other peoples experience from reading online but has only limited real life experience. Hes similar to me in that way, but I have more experience tripping under my belt.",
      "J: 30 mg, another of my best friends, he turned me on to psychedelics (was also with me my first trip and supplied the drugs.) He is more experienced than me with psychedelics, but has only been tripping for less than a year.",
      "T: 18 mg, a sort of friend. My relationship with him is mostly that hes invited me to his parties.",
      "B: 13 mg, Js girlfriend. She dropped out of college with him and moved back to his hometown (where I live in MN) and they lived with his parents. She had very limited experience with drugs. Her only other psychedelic experience was an 8 mg dose of 2c-i.",
      "We were sitting in Js basement, which is trippy as hell when he turns off his fluorescents and turns on his blacklight. He has a lot of glow in the dark animals stuck to the wall. The lizard on the ceiling is very cool. It only took 20 minutes for it to kick in, and I started to get overwhelmed sitting in his basement in the dark. I decided to go get a breather and went upstairs and then left his house. I started to feel less anxious and a little better. My mind was fighting the drug. I wanted control.",
      "Soon, everybody came outside to see where I went. I did not want to go back in, but most of them did, except S. After a little confusion and laughing, we somehow ended up splitting into two groups. R, S and I went for a walk and J, T, B decided to go drive somewhere nice. It was chilly out, but I was well dressed and it didnt bother me too bad. Me and S started a very analytical discussion about drugs. We talked about what we had read about and what we wanted to try and what we knew how to get from various online sources. I think that secretly this was my (and possibly his) way of keeping cool and convincing myself that I couldnt have a bad trip because I was in control enough to have a intellectual conversation. My friend R tried to contribute but unfortunately I would occasionally dismiss what he would say because I thought that it didnt make much sense and was somewhat stupid. It was more subtle than that, but I felt bad about it. This started to bring out a lot of confusion. I found myself having an issue determining what other people were thinking. They all seemed to have motives. It always felt like a person had a sort of plan behind their words and was plotting in some minor way or thought this about me or what I would say. It was bothering me a lot.",
      "We spent a while commenting on the cool visuals and how fun it was, but secretly, I was still battling my fear of intoxication. I kept asking myself why would you take a drug like this if you fear tripping so much? I tried to just ignore it, and it worked a little, but it kept coming back occasionally to bother me.",
      "At around t + 4:30, the group all had places to go, and I was still tripping pretty hard, but considerably weaker than before. I went with T to sell a bag to one of his friends and then left to go find some people to hang out with. Luckily I met up with a bunch of other really good friends of mine. One of them though, L, I had a difficult time with. I had been feeling threatened by him lately. I was still battling many issues of self-consciousness and confusion. L was two years older than me, he was bigger, much more attractive, more confident, and got the girls he wanted. He and another girl in the car were both tripping on I think 20 mg. At first I had no real problem with being with L, because I still liked him a lot even though I felt threatened. But then we started to smoke weed. I was convinced that I had completely come down from the MiPT and felt comfortable getting ripped. We smoked three bowls of some real headies, all very fast. When we were done I suddenly realized that I was tripping much harder than at my peak. The visuals, especially the ones with my eyes closed were much stronger. It was then that I got an intense wave of paranoia. My discomfort with L really came to the surface to bother me. I couldnt understand anything he said and my mind completely twisted his words in my head and made it seem like he was putting me down and making a fool of me with every sentence.",
      "Eventually I had to go home. This involved a talk with my parents. I was still tripping very hard and they must have known. This was at a point were they were very worried about my drug use, so this sent many more waves of paranoia through my fragile brain. I went upstairs and pretended to sleep. I thought I heard my mom crying in the bathroom, which I assumed was about my tripping, which she obviously knew. It was then that I found out from a txt message that Js parents had found the whole 5 grams of the 4-AcO-MiPT while we were out wandering around. Some of the people who threw down hadnt even tried it yet. It was largely my responsibility as well because it was me who had gone around finding people with money and promising them lots of pure drugs. I spent the whole night beating myself up mentally, I felt absolutely terrible. It wasnt really intense but I was incredibly depressed, all that night and the whole next day. I couldnt fall asleep until about 3 in the morning.",
      "The next day I found out that my mom had been crying because her uncle had died and my friend had gotten the drugs back from his parents the next day.",
      "2nd trip: unknown amount. Sorry this is such a long report, but its very meaningful to me, so I wanted to fully report it.",
      "This story starts at about 6 o clock. My friends S and BS (a really good friend of mine) both took the 4-AcO-MiPT. S took 15 mg and BS took 60 mg (note, BS needs ridiculous amounts of psychedelics to feel anything, so this wasnt actually that high of a dose. It was high enough for me to drive for him, but he was still in reality. Dont try this at home kids.) Both reported to me that they felt much less than their last trip, and that they thought it had degraded at least 50% in potency. I didnt find out until the next day that S hadnt actually taken anything and had just pretended to trip to not let BS down. He just didnt feel like tripping at all. BS has a hard time determining the strength of psychedelics because he barely feels anything at all ever. It turns out that the MiPT hadnt degraded. I would not find that out for about another 7 hours or so.",
      "Fast forward to 12:00, midnight. J had let me borrow his scale to let me weigh out a bunch of MiPT. I decided to give myself a little boost so I could stay up all night and weigh. I weighed out 15 mg and put it in a capsule. Going under the assumption that it was 50% degraded, I didnt expect to really be tripping. Sure enough, after about 25 minutes or so, I wasnt feeling squat. I then decided to eyeball out 20 mg, because I had a strong desire to trip balls. Im not sure what made me eyeball it out, but it just seemed like the right thing to do. I have a strong suspicion that I ate more than an extra 20. It took a long time to kick in, way longer than my first 15 mg trip. I got disappointed because It hadnt taken any time at all to degrade, and a lot of people had thrown down blah blah blah. After a while I was getting visuals and feeling pretty stimulated. I had to leave the room where I was weighing out the drugs in, because I couldnt focus enough to weigh. I sat down and the visuals starting to get stronger and stronger.",
      "Suddenly I got very nervous. This was much stronger than I was planning on. Doing a little more calculating in my head I decided I must have been stupid to not think I was going to trip by taking somewhere around 35 mg.",
      "Every 10 minutes or so the intensity would kick up a notch. One of the weird things about the 4-AcO-Mipt is that is comes and goes in waves. I tried to figure out when I would peak based on dose charts from my previous reading on the internet.",
      "Ok, only 15 more minutes, then youll peak. Youve tripped harder than this, just relax.",
      "Try as I would, I could not relax. I was fucking scared. I was scared of a bad trip. I was so fucking scared of a bad trip on every single one of my trips that it led me to a bad trip, funny enough. I reached the point where I thought I should peak and I took a deep breath. I started to feel a little better, and tried to enjoy the visuals, which were becoming amazing. I would see rainbows everywhere, especially around sources of light, like the light bulbs in my basement.",
      "After another 10 minutes I was alarmed by the fact that another wave came and it got more intense. I could safely say I was tripping harder than I ever had in my life. It was scary and beautiful. If I closed my eyes a field of perfectly visible colored dots would form my vision into a sort of television screen that would display anything. I would see creatures and screaming people form.",
      "Another 10 minutes, another wave. By this point I started to panic. I felt an attack coming and my entire visual field was vibrating violently. I paced rapidly trying to cool myself down. I considered waking my parents and having them call the ambulance. Everything was so distorted I couldnt tell where I was or what I was looking at. It was just rolling and morphing in an insane pattern of color and trails. I thought that there was no way it could get any more intense than this, but I was wrong.",
      "Another 10 minutes, another wave. This time turned out to be my last wave of increased intensity. I didnt know it until 10 minutes after it happened, naturally. I was going in and out of panic attacks, my heart was beating at a really rapid, irregular rate. I was at the point where if I had wanted to get my parents up and call the ambulance I dont think I could have. I was crawling on the ground trying to breathe normally when I came upon a strange object. It was my brothers ipod.",
      "Before the trip I had preset it to play Abbeys Road on repeat, and then completely forgotten about it. I put the headphones on and pressed play. Come Together came on and I tried to sit down and relax. At first the music bothered me, but I didnt think enough to take the headphones off. But then, something strange happened. In the middle of my nightmare, I liked the song. I got up and started to bob my head. All of a sudden, my heart was beating normally. I got a little more excited and started to dance a little more. I was completely grooving out to this album. Intense euphoria hit me and my bad trip was gone. I was swirling in the middle of a psychedelic storm of colors, but I was having a good time. This was certainly something I didnt expect. I always assumed that if I took an unusually large amount of psychedelics I would freak out. The intensity would drive me into a nightmare that would only be cured by coming down. It proved how little I actually knew about psychedelics, I relied too much on the reports of other people.",
      "I would hear these voices in the back of my head, telling me that I was lame for taking drugs by myself in my parents basement and staying up all night dancing to an ipod. All these negative voices would tell me I was ugly, I should feel bad about my sex life, my friends think Im stupid, so on and so forth. But for the first time in a long while, I managed to tell the voices that they were wrong. I never really understood the voices in my head before the trip. They always burrowed into my consciousness and I never really understood they were wrong. If I thought about it, I could tell myself I wasnt stupid, but I never really believed it, until now.",
      "I just kept grooving. Just kept grooving, kept grooving and grooving and grooving. I felt the voices and I heard them and responded with a sharp No, I dont care, youre wrong. I was filled with happiness and self-respect. I loved who I was, I didnt care what people thought about me. All you gotta do is keep grooving and dont let nothin get you down. If you have something against somebody else who has not wronged you, its just a way for you to release inner struggle of your own. I finally truly believed this, not just agreed with it. I was grooving so nicely, I couldnt even tell that I was listening to the same album over and over, I didnt care, and it was wonderful.",
      "After about 4 and a half hours of solid groovy grooving I had come down a little, and my parents were awake. I was still at about a +3 and had intense visuals. Normally this would have scared me shitless to talk to my parents like that, but not now. I was free, liberated, completely in control of my fear. I had overcome the greatest challenge, and I could accomplish whatever I wanted. I had never felt better my whole life.",
      "I usually didnt get up until after the rest of my family had left for work/school on weekdays, because of my late start, but today I was up and talking to them. I could tell that they appreciated this greatly. I made lunch for my whole family and spent a long amount of time talking to my mom about life. Everyone in my family could tell that something was up, but didnt say anything because of my attitude. Once they all left I took a shower and got myself ready for school. I wasnt afraid at all to come to school tripping, I was completely at peace with myself. All I had to do was groove. Just groove, groove and groove and groove forever.",
      "Life is the ultimate trip. And up until now, I was having a bad trip. Pretty much since my girlfriend dumped me (almost 2 years ago,) up until now, I had been having a bad trip. Im not blaming her, it was completely my own fault and decision. When Im sober a bad trip doesnt matter as much because my mood is more regulated. I just generally feel a little low, feel unmotivated, lazy, arent nice to people, dont maintain friendships as well. But its still a bad trip, and now, I had found my good trip.",
      "It happened to be Valentines Day that day, so I rolled sweethearts into baggies and handed them out to my friends. I laughed as they were suddenly jolted by me placing a baggie in their hands and quickly shoving it into their pockets and looking around really sketchily. As soon as they found out it was sweethearts they laughed and I received multiple hugs. I took a test in math class which I had forgot about and scored a B+ (below my general standard in that particular class, but It was by no means bad, and I was still tripping.)",
      "I got on the bus to my other school after math and then called my mom. I let her know that I wanted to take her out to lunch. She agreed and we went and got some food. I had another long talk with her, which was very rewarding. Ive understood my parents and their internal struggle a hundred times better since that day. At various times I was amazed by how I was still tripping, since according to a website the drug lasts 4-6 hours or so, but I just laughed and kept on grooving. My mantra became the groove. I grooved all day and then passed out early that night. The next day I wasnt tripping but had terrible HPPD or permatrip or whatever you want to call it. Now, about 3 weeks later I still have it pretty bad and Ive only tripped once since then. I dont mind it, and its slowly going away.",
      "My friends and I all agree that the 4-AcO-MiPT has a really bad permatrip. At normal doses, it lasts 4-6 hours like a website suggests, but the tail end can last for over 18 hours. This minor sort of altered state lasts seemingly forever. This is one reason why Im not too fond of the drug. I have gained so much more off this chemical than any other because of this experience, but I have a feeling if I had eaten a quad of shrooms I would have gotten similar or possibly better results without as bad of a permatrip.",
      "Since then I feel completely changed. I can still feel the good trip, and I am still grooving. My appreciation for music has multiplied 10 times since that night. I have overcame most (not all) of my issues with self-consciousness. I have also strengthened my relationship with my family. It almost seems like because of this, my entire family has been getting along much better with each other. My brothers are twins and had separate groups of friends and would constantly argue and pick on each other. Now they talk about each other as if theyre best friends. I have also stopped hitting my brothers. Even if it used to just be in jest, I would hit them harder than I should have. And I feel a lot closer with my parents, even though they are still extremely stressed out because of money and their jobs and their teenage son who does drugs.",
      "I feel like a lot of the problems that had occurred in my life and in my family and my tension with my friends had all been because of my negative attitude and issues. Now Im doing what I can to repair what has been damaged.",

      "For egotistical reasons I will now relate a few experiences I have had under the influence of that wicked madness-inducing narcotic, marihuana:",
      "Bizarre Experience #1: I am sitting in a bathtub of warm dingy water smoking a small bowl of the pot. Enjoying mindless hoppy-go-luckiness of mind.  Splashing happy water. Eyes roving about, I spy whippits (Oh, JOY in a can!) and immediately determine to inhale their contents. I do so, inhaling one, then another. Frigid blue lips. I am enjoying dissociative effects and general WOOH WOOH WOOH WOOH of reality reflecting off bathroom walls ...when all of a sudden... a feeling of empty dead butterfly gutlessness occurs in my abdomen areas. I perform the cursory 'reality check' to make sure I have all my robots in a row only to discover to my aghast that quotidian reality has at some point in my absentminded reverie been sucked out of every toilet seat, wall tile, and faucet of my dingy bathroom world. Every surface of the room drips and vibrates with existential Nothingness. My mind leaps out into the imaginary spaces of the World searching for meaning only to find the rest of the World an identical crud-covered hell. This whole experience frightens me shitless (literally) and after evacuating my bowels I take off downstairs to watch some good ole T.V. About 15 minutes of this crap is sufficient to put me at ease.",
      "Bizarre Experience #2: I am again in the bathtub (I'm with Archimedes on this one...the bathtub is where it's at). I smoke a bowl of grass and get out drying myself in front of the mirror. Like the narcissist I am, I pause to ponder my alien countenance. I say alien because I always see a stranger staring back in any mirror I dare to peek into. I feel an intuition. It tells me...you could be a floating head...if you want. I decide that might be nice and pursue this feeling further. Within a matter of no more than half of 5 seconds, I have localized consciousness in my head to the exclusion of the rest of my body. That is to say: I became my head and erased my body. I check the mirror, it being a more objective source of knowledge I reason, only to find that my body has blurred away, still visible but fuzzy, and my head is illuminated, a corona of white light enveloping it. It takes an effort to maintain this state and the novelty soon wears off, returning me to full body awareness. I am bemused and ready for sleepy time.",
      "Bizarre Experience #3: Probably the most bizarre experience I've had with marijuana. A friend and I have walked out to a wooded area to smoke, hoping to avoid mindcontrol policestate authority figures. We find a clearing, smoke, and head back to his house. We are crossing a field between the woods and road, my friend nearby at my side, we aren't talking, just digging the outdoors, when on the way from hither to yon a most uncanny occurrence doth occur...that is to say, with no warning whatsoever my awareness seperates from my body and leaps above my body into the air. I see myself as if in a grand movie. My whole life an hour and so many minutes of videotape and this a scene of small importance. i am profoundly saddened by the realization that my life like a magnetic image on a VHS tape will fade and dissappear into nothingness. Of course, this is all quite fucking-well-disturbing, and I immediately feel disoriented and struggle to regain normal comfortable consciousness. Reality spins. I feel light, which is better than the previous feeling of not existing. And then I am back in my body. Stunned but otherwise none the worse for wear. Upon returning I realize I've fallen over and am on my knees reaching up to the sky to balance myself. I relate my experience as best I can to my friend, who apparently noticed nothing amiss, but he is on the marijuana too and shows little comprehension...."

      "I've always been interested in psychedelics, and in my life I had the chance to experience quite extensively with mushrooms, amanitas, san pedro and a small dose of LSD once.",
      "I work as a medicinal chemist at a major pharma company, and lately I got interested in the synthesis of the reatively simple (structurally) N,N-dimethyltryptamine. I was checking the company's chemical database when I noticed that tryptamine (a close precursor of DMT) was readily available on the shelf. The reaction leading to the N,N-dimethylated analogue (DMT) is a simple reductive amination, where the two hydrogen atoms on a nitrogen of tryptamine are replaced by two methyl groups (CH3). Having attempted the synthesis twice now, I can say that most of the recipes found on the internet are incomplete or in some cases complete bollocks.",
      "First of all, tryptamine oxidises quite easily on the shelf, turning to a deep orange/brown colour. If this is the case it needs recrystallizing from boiling heptane or hexane (heptane slightly better). The yield for each recryst is quite shit and it might be necessary to repeat the process on the leftover orange crap. Once recrystallised, tryptamine looks like soft, flat, large, waxy white crystals.",
      "Now for the solvent used. I saw many reports saying that methanol is a good solvent for the dimethylation. I tried it, and about 30 mins into the reaction a precipitate forms and the overall time of reaction and yields are greatly reduced because of this. Best solvent I used is THF. This is the key to high yields and purity of final product. As for the reducing agent, sodium cyanoborohydride works just as well as the milder sodiumtriacetoxyborohydride (STAB) and I generally use 2.5 equivalents for the first one and about 4 equivalents for the latter (based on moles of  tryptamine). Addition of acid (say 2 eq max) is necessary as this cuts on reaction time greatly. I used glacial acetic acid for this and it works great.",
      "Any formaldehyde/water solution will do. I used 5 equivalents based on tryptamine.",
      "Now for the order of addition of reagents. I saw reports were ppl were strongly advising to cool the reaction mixture prior to the addition of formaldehyde to the mixture of solvent, tryptamine, acid and reducing agent. This is true only for very large scale reactions, but is nothing to be worried about when working with a few grams of starting material.",
      "In THF my reaction took less than 2 hours to go to completion by LC-MS. Work up was as following: removed THF by evaporation (or rotavap), added 1M HCl solution to the crude mixture and placed whitish solution in a separatory funnel. Washed the aqueous phase with Ethyl acetate (do not use DCM! Even tho it evaporates easily it forms big emulsions during the separation which complicates things) and the organic layer discarded. Now the water phase was made basic by the addition of 2M KOH (white precipitate starts forming) and washed again (twice) with Ethyl acetate. Now the water phase was discarded, the ethyl acetate dried on sodium sulfate and the solvent removed by evaporation, leaving a clear slightly yellow oil which foamed under high vacuum pump. Now the choice is yours. You can either smoke this as it is (contains impurities) or try and recrystallise it from boiling hexane or heptane (not so easy as described on the net) or even column it (5-10% Methanol in DCM with a few drops of ammonia/methanol added should do the job). And voila! You have your own DMT.",
      "General procedure:",
      "To a stirring solution of tryptamine free base (1.0g, 6.24mmol, 1eq) in THF (30ml) at room temperature were added sodium triacetoxyborohydride (5.29g ,24.96mmol, 4eq) and glacial (17M) acetic acid (0.71ml, 0.75g, 12.48mmol, 2eq). After most of the borohydride was dissolved, 37% formaldehyde aqueous solution (2.5ml ,2.53g, 31.20 mmol) was added dropwise via a syringe. Stirring was continued for 2h and LC-MS (3min) showed complete conversion of starting material (peak @ 0.94min, M+=161) to product (peak @1.01 min, M+=189). Work up proceded as described above. Column (DCM with MeOH gradient of 5 to 10% with a few drops of 5M ammonia in methanol) gave 1.05g (89%) of a white crystalline solid (DMT).",
      "Now for my experiences. First time I tried 30mg smoked. I felt a general light headiness like 10 seconds after inhaling and the light in the room started to become more intense. I felt giggly and active and was getting slight cold shivers on my body. After max 15 minutes the effects vanished completely.",
      "Second time I decide to try it properly, a 70mg trip. However at the moment I havent got the right equipment for smoking it so I made a spoon out of some aluminium foil and inhaled the fumes generated by heating the bottom of the spoon with a lighter. The smoke tastes exactly as the crystals smell, a typical indole scent. I didnt mind it. Because of my shitty apparatus, I didnt inhale all of the smoke, however 10 seconds later my mind was racing at incredible speeds and I got a bit freaked out.",
      "I lied down, worried that this was gonna last for an entire hour, but I managed to snap out of it in no time! I was then tripping real hard, with visuals both with my eyes opened and closed. It was great, much better than mushrooms as it feels more linear, synthetic, less introspective and with much wilder visuals. The best thing was that after 20mins I was already coming down with very little side effects. After one hour I was feeling calm and relaxed and I smoked a big joint. Nice experience, although I dont think it would suit the weak hearted!"

    "report": [
      "Last spring I ordered a 10ml vial of essential oil of wormwood from a reputable internet entheogen supplier. As an amateur psychonaut my reasons for selecting this particular drug were most likely romanticized accounts of absinthe intoxication in literature and film. Though I've had my fun with the substance, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without patience, discipline and a good knowledge of preparation and dosage. I have none of these things of course.",
      "My first experiment was to make some 'absinthe'. Basically I bought a bottle of Pernod and added about 15 drops of the oil to it. I'd read an account of someone else doing the same, though this person recommended about 10 drops per 750ml bottle. Of course, the liquor and the oil don't mix, so I have to give it a shake before pouring myself some. Through this method, I get drunk long before I notice the effects of the wormwood. Being, as I said, undisciplined and impatient, I upped my dosage, adding more drops to the bottle and sometimes a drop or two right in the glass. When I did begin to feel the wormwood, it was like a lucid drunk, I was very clear headed but had the distinct feeling something was off. At some point during the evening I packed a bowl with marijuana, salvia divinorum 20x extract, resin of leonotis leonurus, and yes a drop or two of wormwood oil. In my hotboxed pickup truck, I got right stupefied and eventually went to bed.",
      "The next morning I felt fine, no hangover, no lingering effects as far as I could tell. Then in the afternoon I started walking the two miles to work. About halfway there, things started to get funny, I never saw anything distinctly hallucinatory, but something wasn't quite right. This lasted my entire evening shift, I'd catch things out of the corner of my eye, and generally mistrusted my senses. The pattern repeated for the next few days, whenever my activity level went up I started feeling funny. I came to the conclusion that the orally ingested thujone had deposited itself in my fat and was being burned whenever I became active.",
      "After three or four days of mild tripping, one starts to wonder if he hasn't given himself some brain damage. Hoping to purge the stuff from my system I began consuming copious amounts of caffeine. If my goal was to burn through the stuff faster, it certainly worked. I entered a state like the onset of a psylocibe mushroom trip. Walls moved when I wasn't looking at them, co-workers would turn around to see me standing on tables for no reason, and I generally went around doing and saying rather silly things. After almost a week of tripping, it finally wore off, but I retained a feeling of suspicion towards my senses for months afterwards.",
      "So I haven't tried taking large amounts orally since then, if it was in my system that long it stood a good chance of causing liver damage I'd imagine. I have occasionally dripped some on a bowl of grass, with varying effects. It seems that one needs to get it burning pretty hot in order to feel it. There was one instance in which there was some wormwoody resin left at the bottom of the bowl of my small plastic bong before my friend and I threw a large roach in there. His grass was a very sticky 'juicy fruit' and burned nice and hot with a big red cherry. As I was taking a large hit near the bottom of the bowl I tasted a distinct change in the flavour of the smoke which was immediately followed by a wave of sensation passing through my head. My friend and I were still on shift, and we ended up having to stay quite late to get everything done because well, we were tripping balls. Walls melted, everything was funny, and my friend spend an hour rearranging objects to look like faces and then taking pictures of them on his cell phone. It was crazy.",
      "I've never had the days-long effects when I've smoked it, only from oral consumption, but honestly I know too little about how the substance works to be doing the experiments do. Be careful out there, from what I understand, thujone is an incredibly powerful neurotoxin and a lethal dose is a pretty small one. LSD is safer, and easier to regulate doseages. Unless you're an advanced pyschonaut, or just crazy and stupid like me, it's probably best to stay away from it."

      "An Ambient Experience",
      "Intro",
      "A friend of mine, a person who some might call a pseudo-pharmacist, did me the pleasure of providing me with some Ambien (zolpidem).  The 10mg pills were skinny white ovals, lightly coated and very dense.  He told me that, although they are sleeping pills, they make you trip.  Yes, trip!  Like mushrooms! he assured me, Visuals and everything!  He advised me to take 2 pills, and to definitely not drive or pretty much do anything dangerous.  I was skeptical, never have I heard of a psychedelic sleeping pill.  But here I am, with several of them.  First I must say that I take opiate painkillers daily for a back problem, and I also smoke Cannabis quite frequently.  I was on both of these at the time of my Ambien voyages.",
      "The first night",
      "Dose: One 10mg tablet orally",
      "A short while after consuming the tablet I began to feel reminiscent of a small bit of Valium or even Flexoril (cyclobenzaprine).  This feeling lasts for some time without progressing, then fades away.  I did not sleep any better that night than I normally would have.",
      "The second night",
      "Dose: One 10mg tablet orally",
      "       10mg tablet insufflated",
      "Repeated same as first time.  After the first pill had kicked in I snorted half of another one.  The pill burns the nose and I decided to abandon the other half.  Effect was slightly more pronounced after snorting this half-pill.  I did not sleep any better that night than I normally would have.",
      "Third times a charm",
      "Dose: Two 10mg tablets orally",
      "Here I go, two tablets,  I began feeling the effect I have described twice now.  Its kinda cool, strong enough to not be boring, but its not even near psychedelic.  Its not even dissasociative.  I layed down on the bed in my room and waited for a while longer.",
      "After a bit I noticed that I was, in fact, pretty high off the shit.  I sat up and looked around, my eyes darted between the posters I have scattered about the walls of my living space.  I looked at a large fractal poster, very detailed and colorful, shaped like an explosion, or implosion perhaps, of psychedelic energy.  It was the damndest thing, the poster was eating itself.  Rather, part of it was eating another part of itself.  It didnt have a mouth, or teeth, or even a true form, but the motion in which it was moving distinctly told me that it had turned around and was gnawing on itself.",
      "I had done it.  I had achieved psychedelic visuals from a pharmaceutical sleep aid.  They werent too complex or meaningful, nothing that wasnt there, no colors even just object distortions, pattern movements, etc.  No closed eye visuals, no audials, no tactiles just a little visual eye candy.  It was pleasant, yet quite manageable, not overwhelming.  No anxiety.  It does not seem like something I could have a bad trip from.  I got up and walked to the bathroom, where I examined the wallpaper, which was moving around in a liquid fashion, melting perhaps.  I examined the 1 floor tiles, which were blinking and shifting positions and shapes.  I examined the wood grain of the door, which looked like rain almost.  I went back into my room, layed back on the bed, and woke up the next day.",
      "Conclusions",
      "Zolpidem can DEFINITELY cause hallucinations.  It is much milder than mushrooms, the visuals from Ambien are similar, but much less intense.  I personally experienced no anxiety.  The flip side to that coin is the fact that experienced psychonauts would probably find Ambien boring, compared to mushrooms, acid, salvia, etc  Ambien is probably not going to cause any religious experiences, although I personally have not gone higher than a 2-pill dose.  I think probably one would forget much of the experience if the dose was too high.  I experienced some hazy-memory feelings, but not too bad, much less than Xanax."

      "I was diagnosed with ADD about a year ago, and have since abused my Ritalin and my friend's Adderall by snorting it and taking it orally. In all honesty, after having done this about 25 times, and Adderall only once, there is no real excitement left in taking more than necessary, and I only do it when I'm bored or need to be extremely productive. Ritalin is by no means addictive though - I have never had a physical or psychological longing for it.",
      "What I find most interesting are the varying effects that Ritalin and Adderall can have. Sometimes the former energizes me to the point of feeling like Superman, like I am invincible and nothing can stop me from reading a novel the size of a dictionary and cleaning an entire house. Other times, I become paranoid and jittery. And on two occasions, I felt depressed, as if the world were melting before my eyes, and I couldnt wait until, what I described in my journal at the time as The Fog Of Stupid, would just go away.",
      "The first type of effects are desirable for someone with ADD, or at least for an intense procrastinator. I dont know if I actually have ADD, because it is very simple to be diagnosed with it. A doctor asked me 30 subjective questions, and since I answered, Yes to a majority of them, he will diagnosed you. I love learning and to an extent, I even enjoy homework, but unless a teacher or textbook is totally engrossing, then I cannot drudge up enough motivation to pay attention. I take several accelerated and AP courses in school, and on days when I do not take my prescribed amount of medication, I can feel myself zoning out more, taking less notes. And when it comes to homework, I just dont do it.",
      "However, when I feel that it is necessary to concentrate on something, I orally take 30 mg. of Ritalin. After about 25 minutes, the hyper-focusing and motivation starts to kick in. The first time that I did take more than my prescribed amount (about 50 mg) I wrote 13 pages in my journal, a one-page history essay, and drew and colored 15 pages for an extra-credit history project in a span of less than three hours. I had been procrastinating these chores for days, and suddenly, everything became inspirational, and I felt incapable of putting my pen down. My hand was sweating and ache-y from scribbling hundreds of words, but I was intent on completing as much as humanly possible in even less time.",
      "Recently, I stayed home from school. I hadnt taken the Ritalin the day before, so I had not written an important essay or studied for numerous tests. Around noon I took 40 mg. This had me wiping down counters, throwing away garbage, cleaning and vacuuming the floors, putting away dishes, and doing numerous loads of laundry until 4, when I took another 40 mg. I did not stop cleaning the entirety of my house until it was immaculate, around 6:00. At this time, I realized that there was nothing left to do, which was very stressful. I paced back and forth, from one wall to the other, shaking my hands and doing jumping jacks, for two hours. When my father came home, I climbed into his car, and willed myself to not speak too much. Thankfully hes oblivious, because I recall trying to keep my mouth shut but then allowing myself to speak, and not stopping rambling on and on about stupid things.",
      "Once in my mothers home, I willed myself to feel normally, but only felt depressed and dull. But then I started talking with her and after a short period of time I felt perfectly fine. For all of the moving around I did on this day, I only had three cookies and a cup of tea in my stomach, which I consumed later that night. Im not worried about my weight, but I like to eat junk food when Im bored, and while on Ritalin, the thought of consuming food never passes my mind.",
      "The ability to hyper-focus on my surroundings, particularly music, is also strengthened. If I allow myself to become a part of a blaring stereo, then I can feel the sensation of being totally consumed by sound. It is strange, and can be disorienting, but what I find even stranger, is how upset I become when I am not consumed by the sound. When the Ritalin is at its strongest, I automatically feel my heart beat as if it were the only thumping organism in the world. A good song can actually manifest itself in a physical form - I dont ever see the music, but I can feel it, as if it were this massive entity swirling around my body and it is the only thing I can think about. When this doesnt happen, and I feel detached from my surroundings, as opposed to being totally immersed in them, I get very irritated and disconcerted.",
      "Occasions in which I feel paranoid and jittery come at a surprise. I once swallowed just 50 mg. before school and, perhaps because of some other anxieties as well, I became so riddled with paranoia about what I was going to do and become frightened that I am going crazy that I got sick to my stomach and had to leave school early. Too much Ritalin always gives me diarrhea. The nurse sent me to a back room, unnerved by my jitteryness and apparent mild anxiety attack.",
      "My worst experience with this was when I snorted 70 mg. of Ritalin at once. A bunch of friends and I were sitting in my neighbors house, and they were all high or tripping on some hallucinogens, so I decided to use the only drug I had. Rolling up a dollar bill, and crushing the pills into twelve thin lines with a kitchen knife and my library card, I quickly snorted each one, leaving a deep white stain in their tablecloth. Nothing - no effect for nearly a half hour. But by the time it did take effect, I was reeling. My breathing was reduced to strained gasps, everything appeared to be muddled and unreal. When my friend put her finger on my pulse she actually jumped back, and said, Holy shit, I cant count how fast thats beating! I attempted to calm down by drawing some pictures, but they all morphed themselves into a creature from The Yellow Submarine: these ugly swirling shapes supposed to mean something. I really hyper-focused on these, and it was mentally painstaking, because I couldnt help it.",
      "Sometimes (like with music) I love becoming part of another object, but I loathed this, because I wanted to see what the whole picture looked like but it was impossible- my brain centered its attention only on bits and pieces. The rest of the night sucked too. While my friends were laughing and saying things like, Oh my god, the world is so beautiful! I wanted to cry, or to convince myself that everything is allowed to be imperfect. This is when the Fog of Stupid came along. My friend Jane (not real name) sat across from me in the diner we had migrated to. The neon lights of the sign were melting down the windowpane, everyone was speaking too slowly, and I didnt know how to respond without sounding like an idiot to myself. I apologized relentlessly for being so annoying and stupid, she told me not to worry about it because I sounded normal, but everything she said seemed like a lie. Everything was so slow, and I recognized that it was my minds fault. There was a wall preventing any intelligible thought from passing through and processing itself - The Fog of Stupid, the phrase I apparently repeated incessantly, along with I dont get it and This doesnt make sense.",
      "The food tasted like sawdust, and finally, too confused by own apparent craziness, I ran home. I listened to the same song on full volume for two hours, while the rest of my room melted in waves around me, images depicted in the song played around my walls. I did not hallucinate these images, I simply imagined them. I was able to scribble in my notebook for several pages, before it was clear that my mind was no longer infected with depression or stupidity. Note: nothing I have seen on Ritalin has been scary, just frustrating.",
      "My only experience with Adderall has been decidedly different than the Ritalin. I was fairly drunk when I went to my friends house for a long night. We each snorted four lines of Adderall, I do not know the quantity, and for the next hour I was relaxed and unmoving, but I didnt feel messed up. When my friends instructed me to help out with moving things around the house, and when they temporarily freaked out about something, I showed boredom and disinterest, which frustrated them. Soon afterwards, we smoked seven grams of marijuana, at which point I started bugging out and becoming jittery and upset. Other times that I smoked this much or more didnt result in my seeing little bugs crawling around, and I am usually just delirious with the funny bone. On this day, I felt helpless to control the things around me, and I was very sensitive to everything, which I believe is due mostly to the Adderall.",
      "Ive never noticed any type of comedown or decline in my energy level to the point of a converse effect of extreme laziness. When I realize that it is no longer affecting me I feel fine, and am capable of doing whatever Id be capable of at any other sober time. With high dosages I have terrible mood swings, and feel depressed, but never to a suicidal level - I usually just want to cry. I dont end up crying, and when it finishes Im perfectly fine.",
      "Ive never snorted any other type of drug, so I do not have something to compare with, but snorting this is not painful. I enjoy the feeling. Writing all this about ADD meds makes me realize how little a purpose snorting them serves though: the positive effects are few and unnoticeable, and the negative effects really just make for a slightly, but not terribly, unpleasant evening. However, taking anywhere between 40 and 80 mg. orally is excellent when I need to get a lot of stuff done."

      "I had about five doses left, so I grinded it all up, put it in a mug, which was filled for about a quarter with the powder, added boiling water and left it to soak for 5-10 minutes and I poured it through the coffee filter. The tea was brown instead of green-brownish and smelled very strong. I drank it all up in about a minute or so, five minutes later I felt that the caffeine started to have its effects on me. What struck me as odd was that I didnt get a shaky sensation as I usually do, not a lot of physical energy, but my fingertips and toes started to get numb. My heart rate didnt increase as I expected, but the strange thing was that I started to have muscular spasms: painful cramps in my shoulders and lower back as I stretched out, as I walked up the stairs my legs hurt I cant think of any other reason why this happened, but the mate.",
      "Ive never believed people claiming that they got high on mate, but Im having second thoughts, since I felt some tickles in my toes and fingers, felt relaxed, yet alert and awake. I wasnt really high as in another state of mind, or extremely happy, but I wasnt quite myself either. Time did seem to pass slower, and I was more productive.",
      "I guess all I can say is that grinded mat really is more potent, but if I take to much, there is a downside.",
      "On the plus side, compared to coffee, a mate overdose doesnt make me feel sick, nervous, sweaty and trembling, if you have the choice, choose wise, choose mate!"

We went to a usually spot to smoke and started puffing away. That's when I noticed something weird, the taste and smell were off, it smelled like nail polish remover, and the taste was horrendous. After about 1 cipher of the blunt I was fucked up. I felt all rubbery, and out of nowhere I just started sprinting down the street to my friends house. I felt like just going crazy. I sat down on my friends porch and that's when the worse drug experience of my life happened.",
      "I remember sitting in a wicker chair, and hearing a beating sound, I put my hand on my chest and started to panic. My heart was beating insanely fast. I felt constantly out of breath and really hot and scared. My breathing patterns were insane, I was taking huge gulps of air and yelling 'THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO BREATH RIGHT NOW.' My friend's face started to turn extremely red and was sweating.",
      "Phase 3, me and my friends decide to get into his car. I get in and I felt very small in his car. Now the weird thing is, his car is a very small Jetta. After this I really don't remember much. I could barely talk and my thoughts were racing so fast. I thought every thought anyone could ever think twice. I don't remember going to sleep or anything.",
      "The next morning I woke up and felt out of it, I wondered what drug I had done last night. I was a veteran pot head and have smoked an exotic variety of weed so I knew that shit had to be laced, after reading about PCP and its effects I knew I had done it.",
      "The suck ass part is that it has damaged me permanently. Whenever I smoked weed my heart races super fast and I can't enjoy because it feels terrible. It also left me with a terrible case of anxiety. ",

I tried to take a warm bath to calm down, sat in it for about 5 minutes and then I had a strong urge to leave.  I would start smoking a cigarette, take a hit or two then put it out, and 10 minutes later I would do this again.  I also repeated trying to calm down in the bath, only to have to leave it after a few minutes.  So I decided to go to bed, which was difficult but eventually worked.",
      "The next afternoon, I took all of my medication as I usually do and went to work.  This turned out to be a mistake as, like the day before, the symptoms returned only this time about 100 times more intense and I had an overwhelming sense of doom.  So I talked to my boss and managed to get a ride down to the emergency room.",

I was nervous with this because I experimented when I was younger with this stuff and it was never a good experience, and even low dosages of benadryl make me uncomfortable, but at this point I was willing to try anything.",
      "So after another eternity, the nurse finally comes in and gives it to me and BAM, it went away instantly.  The relief was so great that it was almost orgasmic.",
      "So now I am still on the geodon, but I take a 25mg benadryl everyday with no return of the akathisia."

      "Before I start I must tell everyone.2ce is more powerful than LSD, it is as no where NEAR as good (nothing really is) as LSD but its effects are much more insane, not in a good way.",
      "I had heard that my friend Drew had ordered 2ce online and it was some obscure hallucinogen.  My friend Taylor had done something like 40mg one night (way over what your suppose to do) and he claimed he had lost his mind for like 6 hours.  So wanting to experience it for myself we went to Drew's to buy some.  When we arrived he opened the door, pale as a ghost and said nothing other than 'I just died.'  He acted foolish and couldn't comprehend what we were saying when we were trying to get the 2ce from him he just kept saying that he was dead and that he could not release it.  Finally we got him to let us 'see his wallet' (he was holding the 2ce in his wallet.)",
      "We proceeded to take the 2ce out it was in a little manila envelope with a little baggie inside which contained the powder.  I poured out 2 huge lines (which were estimated at 25mg) without knowing anything about the drug not even how much this was or how much I should take.  My friends said 'Dan, dont do that much only do half one of those lines.'  I responded 'I have done allot of drugs this is nothing.'  As soon as I snorted the lines we left and about 2 minutes after snorting it I asked to go home because I felt it setting in and for some reason wanted to be home.  I lived up the street from Drew so I got home like 5 minutes after the lines had been ingested.",
      "I felt very insecure and the threshold was HEAVY.  I then felt extreme nausea and my nostrils burned as they always do when snorting 2ce.  I must have puked about 15 times then just kept dry heaving.  After about 20 minutes of being sick I felt okay.  I curled up into a ball on my mattress and felt very cold my brain could not make sense of anything.  When I was puking I puked out of my window and I still functioned enough to grab a role of paper towels and clean that up at like midnight.  I dont remember much but I remember just wanting the feelings I had to end for like 6 hours then I drank a little vodka when my trip was coming down and fell asleep.",
      "When we were at Drews I had made a little take home baggie of 2ce for myself that consisted of about 10 mg.  I never learn my lesson with any drug so after recovering from the night before at about 5 p.m. I opened the little baggie and snorted it in my bathroom.  This time it was a normal dosage but my nose still felt like I had snorted glass.  I turned around and puked 3 times then felt great.  I had a very smooth trip.  Then and from that point on whenever I've taken 2ce it makes me feel like someone put a substance which makes objects easy to move in my thoughts, such as grease or Vaseline.  I realized all the wonders of the world and just loved being alive.  I went out and just looking at trees and seeing the sky and smelling the air made me feel wonderful.  Plus all of my thoughts came and went so smoothly it was heavenly.",
      "A couple days after that we got my friend Glen some 2ce and just like me he thought he could handle it even though we told him not to do that much he snorted about 20 mg.  5 minutes after snorting he laid on his back of my friends finished basement.  Snots began running down his face like water.  I had never seen so much snot before the bottom of his whole face was a shiny layer of snot leaking off the sides of his face.  He then became disoriented and laughing hysterically.  He then began puking.  I counted his puking up to 20 times then I left the room and he continued to puke. ",
      "Once his sickness got over he sat on the couch and had no recollection of anything or anyone.  He kept asking us who we were and where he was.  We would try to talk to him and he would just keep repeating what?  Who are you?  And where am I?  I left before he could snap back into reality because I was also tripping on it and that was too much for me so I went outside and looked at some trees then listened to some music and enjoyed another nice smooth trip.  After that trip glen said he would never do it again and to this day he has not.  I will trip on it again if it ever comes around."

      "My day had not started off great, as I had just failed my driving test, so my mindset was not very productive. My friend T had gotten his hands on some 20x (I think T said 21x, I can't remember) Salvia extract, and invited myself and a friend to go and smoke it. I am not a fan of hallucinogens, and had additionally been completely sober for the last year as I had gotten out of rehab. I decided to try Salvia because it was legal, it wouldn't come up on a drug test, and I had wanted to try it back when I was actively using marijuana, alcohol and cocaine.",
      "When my friend C and I reached T's house, I realized that I had not eaten all day, I also take a number of anti-depressants/anti-psychotics, and have been diagnosed as depressed and anxious, but I chose to forget all of this and try the salvia. We entered his bedroom, where the tv and computer were both on, as well as the lights. It seemed comfortable enough, and T began to load the bowl. T's brother was to be the sober sitter.",
      "C went first, and she took a large hit from the water bong that T had just loaded up. She immediately explained that she hated the taste, but went ahead and finished the bowl. Within 20 seconds she was acting very giggly and happy, commenting on how it felt like an intensified version of weed. Then she began to hit me playfully, saying I 'looked at her wrong', she seemed like she was really enjoying it.",
      "I went next, and T told me how he was giving me more than C (since I was obviously bigger, I'm 6'2 and 165 lbs). I hit the water bong, and contrary to what C said, enjoyed the minty taste, but coughed some out. I took another rip without coughing and held the smoke in for as long as I could, probably over 30 seconds. T told me to go sit on the bed quickly, so I did so. Like C, I immediately felt very floaty, and lightheaded - this sensation lasted for about half a minute, and then I noticed a quickly rising sound pattern, a tick-tick ting, and I was gone.",
      "I felt an extreme pressure, and it was like my body was ripped in two. The last thing I consciously remember is kneeling down like I was at church, as the sensation was so strong. All of a sudden there were 1,000 versions of the same room before me, all of a postcard size. It was like a huge kaliedoscope, and every picture was identical. It was then that I began to panic. I felt like everything was 'fake', and that I was in a nightmare - I seriously thought I was dreaming. I shook my body violently to try and rid myself of the feeling, but the only thing that went away was the kaleidoscope of pictures. I tried to stand, and then the world morphed again. It was like my vision was flipping like book pages, or like I was stuck in a weird mirror that had no exit, I had this intense feeling that this was how I would feel for the rest of my life, and that this was all a nightmare that would never end.",
      "I vaguely remember wanting to go to a hospital to get 'fixed', I thought my mind was permenentaly broken. I forgot where I was, and who I was with, everything was just a set. The room and all the people were completely new to me, and I had never seen them before. This world where I was now was where I had always been, and always would be, but I did vaugely remember some other world that was different and happy. I again stumbled, and noticed the door to the hallway (through the 'book page' vision). I became convinced that if I went down the stairs and out of the house, the nightmare would end, and maybe I could find my way out and back to the normal world. The house was fake, but outside it had to be real. I was heading for the door, when C gently put me on the floor. She tried to tell me where I was and why I was there, but it just did not 'compute', she was just a piece of plastic or something. My anxiety increased, and I began to raise my voice about 'getting downstairs'. C sat on my legs so that I could not move, and began to calm me down by whispering that everything was okay and that it would all end soon.",
      "I began to slowly calm down, but was fascinated by the stripes on C's shirt. And as I began to focus on them (they were shining or moving) and actually breathe, my mind slowly came back. At first I still didn't know where I was, and all the people in the room were just 'dolls' or something. But then I began to remember that I had taken Salvia, and it all began to make sense again. I finally reached a somewhat controlled state, but my vision was still 'flipping' (less intensely at this point). I was violently trying to hold my mind still, because I did not want to go back into that picture nightmare world. For a few minutes, I felt petrified, like I was going back again, but I focused as hard as I could, fighting my racing thoughts, I slowly came back into reality. Even after I remembered most everything, I was still very high - my vision was jumpy, and everything was brighter and had a kind of gold tint to it. I was feeling very hot, and was sweating alot from my forehead. I approached T's brother, and almost forgot his name, but remembered and told him I was going out for a cigarette. As I sat and smoked, I began to laugh and feel giggly, and was fascinated with the embers at the end of my cigarette. It felt good to be in the cool night air. I finished my cigarette and went inside, but the cold of the outside seemed to stay with me, and I was cold for the following 45 minutes to an hour.",
      "For the rest of the night I had a kind of irritable feeling (I lost my cell phone and for awhile was convinced it was stuck back in the nightmare Salvia world, so this may have caused it), and felt slightly lightheaded. The next day I still felt sort of weird, but it wore off. However, I must say that for awhile (both the day after I smoked it and the day after that), I had moments (3-4 seconds) where I was very afraid that all of a sudden I would go back to the Salvia world, on the edge of a panic attack - this may have been due to my anxiety and depression problems.",
      "I definintely had a bad trip on Salvia, but I found it personally valuable, and do not regret trying it. I am not sure if I would do it again, but I wouldn't write it off the page. This was definitely the strongest drug experience I've ever had, and I think that Salvia is in a true league of its own, I've never been so disassociated from reality before."

For the record I think I ate anywhere between 2 and 3 seed pods to myself in a 4 or 5 hour window.",
      "It is July 20th, 2006 in Colorado. I was celebrating getting a new apartment. I had brought some friends up from Denver to party with me. Normally I tend to stick with marijuana as my recreational party item, but this day was different. My friend had said that she spotted some Jimson weed outside. I had asked what it was. She told me it was a psychedelic. Three of us had decided to have some. I had made some fried chicken and all the fixins and we ate some seeds.",
      "We didn't feel anything after 45 min except for a body high. We all decided to eat a little more. We all figured that 45 minutes was enough to digest and process the seeds, man were we wrong.",
      "Things get fuzzy at 2 hours into the trip. Here is all that I remember. I can recall being out on my back patio staring into the river that ran behind my place. A green and black spider about 5 feet tall with legs the size of small trees wandered towards me. I wasnt scared because I remembered that I was tripping. I was amazed when the spider morphed into about 3 gold impalas which bounded off. I went inside to have a cigarette and got restless. My neighbor, whom I had known for a little while, perhaps 2 months, came down and we partied with some herbal refreshment of the green and sticky kind. After maybe a bowl or two I know I left to do something but I havent a clue what, maybe a short walk around my building due to being restless and I returned to my place. My neighbor left a few minutes after I got back.",
      "I got the brilliant idea to have some more seeds after returning. It was at this point, after the seeds hit me that I blacked out and have no idea what happened. I wandered around as far as I know for a while longer. Here is where I get the shock of the evening. The next memory I have besides the constant movement of cigarettes is that of my friend saying that the cops were there and they wanted to see me.",
      "I go outside thinking to myself Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, I am way too trashed to talk to the cops. So I walk up to the cop and try to introduce my self as best I could. He asks me ,Have you been up to my neighbors apartment today? I respond with something along the lines of no. He then tells me that my neighbor said I walked into her apartment and was staring at a wall while mumbling to my self. She asked me to leave at which point I did. The cop also said that she saw me in her car looking for something. I denied that as well. That didnt matter to the cops because the sober(ish) neighbor says that I did and she wants to press charges. I was told from the police when I was sober that during the ride to jail from the back seat I was singing Were going for a ride, were going for a ride!",
      "While in jail I remember EMS checking me out at the jail, they said I was with it mentally enough that I was no danger to myself or anybody else. My vitals were fine so they allowed me to deny treatment and a trip to the hospital. My pupils were blown and my pulse was slightly fast but other than that I was fine. Such bullshit though, the truth of the matter was I was farther from just fine than anybody could have thought. I sat in a freaking chair for a day I think talking to imaginary people and real people alike. Everybody must have thought I was crazy.",
      "The end result was that I had trespassing in the first and second degree charges pressed on me. I went to jail to detox until I was bonded out I think three days later. I had my first degree trespass deferred for two years and had to plead guilty to the second degree trespass charge to get the deferred plea bargain.",

All I know for sure is that I am a dumb ass for doing what I did and hope that I have not caused any permanent psychological dysfunction to the victims of my crime if it even happened. It was an incredibly bad experience."

      "There were three main themes that kept arising in conversation: 1. Music is a part of everyones lives  2. Find your passion for life, and pursue it.  3.  Life is like starting from one room of a Mansion to exploring all the nooks and crannies of it. ",
      "THEME #1: Music is a part of Everyones Lives",
      "The human mind is very different from one individual to another, but all seem to enjoy some form of music.  For some people it is as basic enjoyment of listening to pop radio from time to time.  Others enjoy intricate jazz, composing, or playing instruments.  But the vast majority of the population falls somewhere between those 2 extremes.  All people start simple and grow to become more complex, but some choose not to.  You wouldnt see an 11 year old kid appreciating John Coltrane or Medeski Martin and Wood.  They would rather listen to the radio, like kiss FM, and all the popular artists.  As more music is introduced u grow as a listener and are able to appreciate different types of music.  Bands like Phish, Grateful Dead, and so many others, music that goes off the main road and keeps u thinking while listening.  These bands have more than just 3 different power chords being played over and over.  I hit this phase when I was around 14 years old, but I did not fully appreciate this type of music for over a year.  Many people reach this phase and dont go on (which is completely alright and also understandable.  Even if people stay at the first stage of pop music and its culture, that is not a problem.  They are most likely stronger in another areawhich will be explained more indepthly.)  The third stage, which I'm exploring right now is exploring your roots and THE roots of music.",
      "Jazz is the roots in the music tree.  Its complexity is often hard for people to follow and appreciate, but in time, anyone can enjoy it.  It really takes a trained ear (and a friend or teacher to help introduce it).  Im not talking about old popular jazz that grandpa and grandma listen to either, its the style you would hear in a serious college jazz ensemble.  I was introduced to jazz about the same time I was introduced to more complex music.  One of my main focus in life is music, so it wasnt too difficult to start enjoying these genres.  For others it will take more time or never happen, and its up to you to decide for yourself.  But also just because you start to appreciate jazz more, doesnt mean you cant listen to pop radio anymore.  I am 16 now and have been exploring jazz for a little over a year.  I didnt even really start to enjoy it until the Eau Claire Jazz I played a concert at our school in the winter.  This was a couple months ago.  I was able to talk to the musicians and really feel the music.  I was inspired   I feel that if you understand jazz you can understand almost every type of music created in the 1900s.  People who want to explore other areas of music can listen to classical music (jazz was started because of classical music, so in essence classical music is the foundation).  All and all, people all like music, but different types.  My advice to you, if you enjoy music, is to explore it more and take in as much as you know.  If music isnt your passion, then pursue your other goals.",
      "THEME #2: Find your passion for life, and pursue it",
      "Life is about passion; not about grades or jobs or money or college.  If your passion is to learn, go to college and have a merry time.  But do not frown upon those who have passions elsewhere.  For passion is personal, its unique, it cant be explained... its the driving force of human existence (love being a passion) and should never be judged.  Let your passion engulf your life and enjoy the ride it takes you on.",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-TW",
      "Everyone, in a theory brought up, has some passion in life.  A definition that would be accepted of a passion (this is just from the way we were talking about this topic)  is the one thing you live to do.  It is for the most part your favorite thing to do, and the one thing that gives you that natural good feeling.  Another thing about a passion, is it is not always easy to figure out  and sometimes can change from time to time or also become more complex or specialized.  My passion is music, more specifically playing guitar.  I know I love playing guitar, but I still have not discovered all there is to learn and also what type of music is for me.  I am very open about music types and enjoy playing almost anything.  Im sure as I mature my passion will also mature.",
      "Finding your passion can be difficult and its not likely to be the same as your best friends.  One person in the discussion found his passion, or what it seemed to be.  He most likely just found the starting end of an idea that will lead to his passion.  Also no one can tell you what yours is, its all up to you.  Being hungry for knowledge and wanting to explore indepthly is what will help your passion evolve.  This can also be seen in the game of life. ",
      "THEME #3: Exploring the mansion",
      "This was by far one of the most intense analogies we were able to come up with.  We simply thought that when u are brought into the world, you start out in a crib in a simple room.  At first it is extremely overwhelming and takes a long time to analyze everything and become comfortable with the surroundings.  As soon as the surroundings are comfortable, the doorway is then analyzed.  Then as soon as enough courage is built up (after careful research and studying) the door is opened, which exposes you with a large hallway with a vast number of doorways to choose.  This then becomes more difficult because of all the options you are given, not all being good.  This could be thought of as the teen years when so much is thrown at you at once, many teens cant handle this pressure, but the strong willed and mentally tough ones will succeed and explore more doorways.  The ones who are risk-takers (I learned about being a risk taker in some lunch meetings sophomore year, HAH) will open the doorways of this hall way, and maybe peak in to see whats happening inside.  Its a repeating slow going pattern, with the ultimate goal being able to discover the whole mansion, achieving all knowledge (wisdom). ",
      "This whole night for me has been exciting, interesting and also intense.  It was an overall good experience, and I feel helped me become more informed about myself, as well as others and the relationships between others.  This was a very sporadic even that really moved and changed all that participated.  I doubt that this could ever be repeated again as successful.  For close to 6 hours, we explored so much and talked so indepthly that it is difficult to capture it all on paper.  This has probably about 5% of everything said.  The other 95% will forever be enjoyed by us."

      "A couple months have passed since I took my first and last trip on Salvia (I guess thats already a hint at my experience). I did thorough research on others experiences, and even after reading negative review after negative review, it still didnt sink in how incredibly negative my experience might be. When others relay an experience of going through a type of Hell, it is usually not meant to be taken in a representational sense. They truly perceived the ordeal of seeing or experiencing Hell. I did not realize this at first as I read them, and took all of these negative reviews very lightly, even laughing in anticipation as if I wanted to experience those same things. I ordered a few grams of Salvia Divinorum 15x extract online and found the packaging amusing when it arrived. This is incense. Not for human consumption. I suppose its the only way to legally sell the stuff online.",
      "As an occasional, but experienced pot smoker, I looked forward to trying Salvia with the thought of a trip being nothing more than the effects from really good weed. I settled into my friend Andrews apartment with my other friend Caleb. We all began completely sober and did not mix anything with the Salvia. As we packed the first bowl, we agreed to trip one at a time, knowing that the total experience should only last 5-10 minutes. Caleb, who is a less experienced smoker, took his first hit. Surprisingly, nothing happened. This was strange since Salvias effects take place almost immediately (usually on the exhale). I prompted him to take another. Again nothing. I assumed that quite possibly the stuff I purchased was bad or fake. Just as I was about to flip on the lights and call off our Salvia night, he said, Wait a minute. What happened for the next 15-20 minutes was a series of giggles as he explored the room and talked to things that were not there. This was not uncommon though for Caleb as he typically and strangely does this while drunk or high. He described his experience later as being no more intense than really good weed. This is exactly what I wanted to hear, and was anxious to take my hit.",
      "I sat down and packed a fresh bowl of the extract. Lighting it up with a torch flame, I took two huge hits which completely cleared the bowl. That was my biggest mistake. I have this thing in my brain that sometimes tells me more is better. Well, more is not always better, especially with Salvia. I was anxious to experience what other people feel in those first few seconds. What could be so amazing that leaves most people virtually speechless after the first hit?",
      "After my second exhale, I began to feel a very low frequency intense vibration around my head and in the room. My leaning back into the chair felt more like me falling into myself. I could still see my friends, but they seemed more distant. Caleb, eager to know what weird and amazing things I was feeling, kept asking me, Do you feel anything? accompanied by a huge grin. I tried to explain, but all that came out was, This is really fucked up. He kept repeating the question, and it soon became very annoying and provocative to me. I was no longer having fun. I realized at that moment that I am a person who loves to be in control with a firm grip on reality. On weed, I can explore my reality in fun and unique ways without ever leaving reality. Now, it was like I was strapped into a rollercoaster that I no longer wanted to be on, and it was too late. My last words to my best friend before I was swept away were, Shut the fuck up!",
      "Its hard to logically explain what happened next. I was thrust into another dimension that looked so unlike the one I am familiar with. However, I can somewhat explain how I felt. One moment I was in the room with my friends. Slowly, it was like the room, my friends, and my whole world were revealed to me to be fake. It was as if some cosmic being who I could not see, was showing me that everything I new to be true, never really existed. This realization was intense and very real to me. Not only was I experiencing this mental state, but I was also experiencing an incredible force controlling my physical body. My only burning desire was to return to my world. I wanted this to all be a horrible nightmare, but I knew for a fact that it wasnt a dream. It was 100% real.",
      "At this point, I had completely forgotten that I had smoked a substance. My eyes were open throughout this whole ordeal, but I was not seeing the room my physical body was in. The things I saw did not take shape like earthly objects. It was as if I was in some dream-like videogame where every object was a metaphor or representation of something else. I saw something that looked like the wheel of fortune spinner. It was missing one of the pieces. Much like a puzzle that represented my reality, I knew my life was that missing piece and now that it was removed, would never be able to fit again. I was essentially dead with my soul forced to dwell in this hellish realm. My life on earth was a farce all along. My family, friends and ambitions were all just a dream. THIS was my real life. There was no one to cry out to for help. I was alone in infinity.",
      "After about 5 minutes and what seemed like hours, I began to come down. I suddenly saw the room again and some people (who I did not recognize at first) standing and watching me. This made me very uncomfortable. Suddenly everything made sense again. I had smoked Salvia and these are my friends, but where was I? I stood up and tried to explain to my friends that I knew what was going on (as if they needed to know). I was just so excited to have my life back that I wanted to tell them that I knew I would be OK. Im sure this actually just made me look more messed up. Seeing them standing made me feel as if they were waiting on me to go with them somewhere and it confused the hell out of me, so I ordered them to sit. I fell back onto the couch and tried to sleep off the rest of the high, but my mind and body would have none of that. Although I was back in my reality, I felt what I can only explain to be a disharmony between my soul and body. Where normally the two parts rest on the same frequency (so to speak), my soul and body were on different frequencies trying to tune into each other again. This left me with a severe internal discomfort which slowly faded over the next 20 minutes.",
      "The blessing of this drug is that it only lasted 20 minutes. I could not imagine that same experience stretched over 10 hours! In a strange way, I dont regret trying Salvia. It has given me a broader understanding of the vast capabilities of the human mind and consciousness, as well as offered me a taste of what a psychotropic trip is like. I consider myself lucky to have experimented with this first, rather than jumping into acid or LSD. I will be happy sticking with weed!"

      "I know this is short but what I experienced can not be explained in words. I wrote this within minutes of the effects wearing off.",
      "My first few tries at salvia were met with minor effects. The gravity feeling. Tunnel vision. Felt like I was stoned. This was fun I thought. After work today I thought I might enjoy it again. I had been using small amounts (25mg) of 15x previously and figured 40mg might be good this time. Ohhh how I was wrong.",
      "The setting was my dark room. No music or sounds of any kind. Only light was a blue lava lamp. Temperature was about 22c (71 Fahrenheit).I was using a 381mm (15 inches) water bong and a butane torch lighter. Notably there was quite a bit of smoke this time. Within 10 seconds it came on strong. Massive gravity, I was being pulled down. I was becoming less and less aware of everything around me. Forget tunnel vision. It was like my vision was failing all together. The last thing I remember was taking a second hit and laying down on my bed. Then.. nothing. No memories, thoughts, or anything. I was dead. I say dead because suddenly it was like I had regained consciousness, not in our reality but somewhere else. I really thought I had died. I remembered I needed to get back to my body. I thought of nothing else, no memory of what I had done. The only thought I had was that I needed to get back. It frightened me that if I didn't try my hardest I wont ever be part of existence as we know it. It was just like when your dreaming and know it and you're trying to wake up but cant.",
      "Finally I found my self back in my body. My room came in and out of my vision. Kind of like someone was turning the lights on and off in a pitch black room. It was all I could do to get up. I could feel some force pulling me back down towards my bed. I didn't want to lay down. It might have taken me away again. The force kept trying to take me away. I needed to keep touch with reality. Scrambling I found my phone and ran outside. The light was so bright! Sounds were odd also. Like someone was turning the sound on and off. I called my friend and tried to talk. It was hard. Hearing their voice made me feel not so alone. Gradually it wore off. I had a hold on this reality. The whole time coming down the effects (light, sound, gravity) pulsed stronger then softer gradually fading away.",
      "I must say that this was the most intense experience of my life. I don't know if I will ever try it again. I have given the rest of my salvia to a friend. I will have a sitter next time for sure if I venture into that realm again. Listen to what everyone is saying! Use this herb with caution and respect. If you don't, it will kick your ass and frighten the shit out of you. Use a sitter! If you do decide to use it, I wish you luck in your journey.",
      "After later analysis I've concluded that I may have reached level 5 - 6 according to the salvia users guide. A lower dose may give me a more enjoyable experience but I am still a bit reluctant to try again."

      "I am now almost 21 and for the past three years have been on a rollercoaster of recreational drug use. At first it started with drinking and smoking, then it turned into mushrooms, 2c-e, and other research chemicals I could come across. Then I was introduced to cocaine. Cocaine plagued my life for a couple of years on and off, occasionally quitting to enter into a rolling(E) spree one summer.  I eventually found the high to be not as good, and found more negative effects than positive.  At this time my girlfriend was doing the same amount of drugs I was doing.",
      "Starting in high school I had always liked vicodin and pain killers, but could never find a reliable source so it never was a often thing, but in my second year of college I ended up trying oxy and found a good source. At first my girlfriend wouldn't do it, but she eventually tried it and loved it and got on board. At first an 80 mg could be cut into 8 different lines and would send us off into heaven. One 10 mg line would make me nod off into a blanket of utter warmness and calm.  Soon after doing it a couple times a week for awhile the tolerance built up.  After three months of doing it a few times a week or more we were up to 30-40 mg lines. The high was still amazing, but more money was needed to obtain it, which is the start of the downward spiral.",
      "During that time I also had a friend who was able to obtain good H. I was unsure whether I wanted to do it since its been so demonized by everyone all my life, but gave it a try anyway.  I enjoyed it alot but was definetely comaprable to oc's high, so more often I stuck with oxy. At the time of the three month mark, I went away for a couple of weeks for a family vacation.  Not thinking, I brought nothing with me, even weed.  All I could think about was the next time I could get oc or if anyone where I was vacationing at had some.  It was quite bothersome more than anything.  I just needed to feel high.  I had to take a few sleeping pills everynight and drink in the evening to  ease the discomfort I was having.  The craziest thing was the dreams.  Every night I would have a different kind of dream all revolving around oxy or heroin.",
      "When I got back I was able to go back to the usual routine of buying it everyday. During most of this time I was without a job and luckily had the one of the greatest girlfriends a guy could ask for, most of the time paying for it all. And all the weed.",
      "In a week I would say we would go through 10 80's and 2 1/8ths of ganja. When we were unable to obtain oc we would usual resort to getting real high off weed, or go to some of the prescriptions we were able to obtain.  For a while I was having chest pain, not really bad, but in need of pain killers I played it out to be excruciating so I was being prescribed vicoprofen.  It is a little stonger than vicodin, but still took about 6 or 7 to get a real high off them for me.  So those went fast and when I was out of them my girlfriend had prescriptions for benzodiazepines, cyclobenzaprine, and ambien. When it was dry with oc we would rely on those to help diminish any chance of withdrawals and it seems to work well so far.",
      "Now it has been over 6 months of doing oc pretty much everyday, or every other, and the tolerance levels of around 40 mg at a time. I still will never reach the truly nod off high I experienced the first few times, but it still is amazing.  Oxy is defintely my drug of choice. I had my time with uppers and they have no appeal to me anymore.  From an outsiders perspective me and my girlfriend look real healthy, are doing well in school, both have jobs, and have great realtionships with our families, and even most of our friends don't know we have anything to do with oxy or h, which I am greatful for."

      "My name is Mitch.  I was introduced to mind altering substances when I was 14.  I had not been introduced to anything besides marijuana until I was 16.  I am writing this to warn readers of the dangers of mixing drugs with anti-depressants and taking anti-depressants in general.  Let it be known that these drugs have different effects on different people.  Here goes......  Me and my friends had been experimenting with various drugs throughout high school.  We all had done nitrous several times before this particular night.  In the days before this night, I had been sent to see a counselor for depression.  I was high constantly and not eating or sleeping, so my parents sent me there. ",
      "The counselor advised that I start taking a prescription anti-depressant.  I was against it, but my parents were for it, and to my everlasting regret, I agreed.....to make them happy.  I was prescribed Zoloft.......I now tend to refer to it as lucifer.  Nothing changed in the immediate days after I began ingesting the Zoloft, but when I started smoking pot with it, everything changed.  The first time I realized that the combination was messing with my mind, I was sitting in my room alone.  I had smoked my usual four or five bowls and got ready for bed.  My television was on and I could see all of the lights blinking on my walls like strobe lights (this is where it gets weird, bear with me).  I looked over at my door and it started getting smaller and bigger (I was very disturbed at seeing this).  I watched my door for an hour or so until the trip wore off (if you would call that a trip).",
      "Little did I know, I was soon to experience a trip that I had never heard of or read about in my life.  These mild hallucinations went on for a few weeks and I continued using and experimenting while on the Zoloft.  Here is where the Nitrous comes into play.  My freind bought me a box of whippits (nitrous cartriges) for my 17th birthday and we started inhaling them at his house.  We left his house to go to my house because my parents were gone.  There were four of us at my house in the downstairs livingroom.  My freind cracked me a whippit and I inhaled it.  This first one was like any other nitrous trip,  short and very cool.  The lights swirled around me and I felt a happiness that I had not felt before.  After the first round of whippits, we all went and smoked a few bowls (we were all very heavy smokers).  After getting high, we decided to take some more nitrous.  We all filled our own balloons and turned on some Pink Floyd or something.  I remeber watching as my friend inhaled and exhaled into the balloon. I also remember me being the last one to put down the balloon. (We would breathe in and out of the balloon to increase the effect, very dangerous). ",
      "That's when it hit me.  I was focusing on my friend laughing and suddenly his head separated from his body. His head then turned into a million heads and they were all floating around me laughing. I remember thinking that I had finally pushed it too far.  That I had died and gone to hell. I had no body and felt nothing.  All that made up my world were these floating heads, laughing at me.  The fear that I felt was indescribable.  I would not wish this feeling on anyone.  It was a life changing fear....  I finally came down (after what seemed like an hour in hell).  I felt fine for the first 20 seconds or so after it was over. But then I felt the most radical sickness that I have ever felt.  I felt like every bit of energy and water and thought had been ripped out of me.  I felt like my soul was gone and that I would never be the same.  My other freind went and got me a glass of water.  This didn't help much.  The flower design on the carpet was blooming and the fireplace was opening and closing.  I was experiencing paranoid insanity firsthand and I hated every second of it.  I couldn't sleep that night.  I remember feeling like I was floating out of the room every time I closed my eyes.  The next few days were like a horrible hangover with a bad trip thrown in the mix. ",
      "I have been in a haze ever since and I think it was because of the Zoloft.  I don't recommend taking any anti-depressant if you use any other drugs.  Nitrous in particular.  But that is just me...... fair warning!"

      "20:25 [T-0:10] Dropped four tablets of ginger root powder extract, to help with stomach and nausea issues I had with my first mCPP experiment, and a lot of other drugs.",
      "20:35 [T+0:00] Dropped 85-95mg of mCPP in some rolly paper and then go and have a shower.",
      "20:50 [T+0:15] Some colours are starting to stand out more than usual, but they are not the usual neon-grouped ones that stand out on say 2C-B, MDMA/MDA or LSD. More the browns, greys, yellows and darker colours. I am starting to narrate what I am doing and about to do in my head a bit more. I am feeling something ever so slightly, but definitely no real effects yet.",
      "21:10 [T+0:35] Starting to feel nauseous and more saliva is building around my mouth than usual. I am also getting indigestion feelings and feel burpy. Starting to sneeze a few times in a row and my nose is rather blocked. The drug does not seem to have decongestive abilities. I am constantly getting gaggy feelings which are not comfortable and my eyes are running.",
      "My forehead feels rather tight and tense, as does most of my face seem like it is under some sort of tension. I have got a semi headache and in other words I am not exactly feeling great but I try not letting this come up feeling hinder a possible good experience. Eyes do not appear dilated at all and the skin of my arms and hands feels rather sticky, like on mushrooms.",
      "21:15 [T+0:40] Started feeling some weird extra sensations on my skin. Could be the start of those 'cold rushes' I have read about in other reports. Vision has become worse, harder to read, but not because I feel high, dizzy or am hallucinating. It just seems to have changed my vision somewhat in a non psychedelic way. Similar to how reading becomes harder on opiates.",
      "21:20 [T+0:45] Colours arent exactly brighter or anything, but anything I look at, the dominant colour seems to stand out much more, and so will all other things in my peripheral vision of that colour.",
      "21:22 [T+0:47] Just threw up in the toilet. Somehow some shitty sweet and sour pork microwave meal came up and I ate that about 7 hours ago. But some toast and some crackers with cheese I ate many hours after that did not. How does that work?",
      "21.25 [T+0:50] Starting to feel a bit hot and have a fair bit of sweat on my forehead. Just put on some music (a freeform hardcore set) and it doesn't sound like I'm on a psych or MDxx. Sounds pretty normal but every now and then I can convince myself otherwise. I close my eyes and am only just able to get a very slight 'I'm on something' or dissociate feel. Starting to get random blood vessel or pressure point twitches and also random quick sharp pains, they are pretty tolerable though.",
      "21:30 [T+0:55] Face is drooping somewhat, although it feels like it is dropping much more than it actually is. My feet are getting restless and I keep stretching the top of my foot and fidgeting them a lot. I now notice some medium warping and morphing going on but the visuals stop as soon as I realise it was in sync to my shallow breathing. I start to get that feeling that my front top gums or top teeth or pushing out more, that I get on ecstasy.",
      "21.35 [T+1:00] Feels like heat isnt being regulated properly and getting constant muscle annoyances, such as twitching and continuous jumping. So far I don't rate the body high very good at all, and the mental high is lacking severely.",
      "21:40 [T+1:05] I'm not a violent person at all, but I found some forced images going on in my mind of beating up dead corpses sarcastically funny, but I didn't laugh about it. Seems to bring out my forced dark humor.",
      "21:45 [T+1:10] This drug has ruined my creativity or drive to be a bit insane like I usually am, or just do weird shit, walk funny or make weird noises and talk to myself in a different character like usual. I am definately 'on' a drug now. I don't feel this drug has much of it's own character, and what little character it has is pretty uninteresting. Boredom quickly turns into a sort of anxiety or just a general feeling of wanting it to be over, not because its bad, but because I would rather be sober.",
      "I do not really like the facial tension I get on it, it's doing something weird to my sinus, and it is making breathing slightly harder. I am still not taken over by any complete high yet, like a stream of consciousness or just any complete and continuous effects. I did stretch my arms and back though and it felt pretty good, but it probably would normally too. So far though nausea isn't as bad as it is in the first hour and an half on MDMA for me.",
      "22:00 [T+1:25] This must be the peak or nearing it now and there is no push in any direction. This is boring at best. Random pains and tensions are persisting. I would definitely rather be sober. I am thinking of having the remainder of my GBL I have been saving to straighten things out.",
      "22:10 [T+1:35] No new or stronger effects at all. Same old flushed, puffy face feeling. Still got the shitty facial tension and now the nausea is creeping back up. I am very gassy. There are less than pleasing tastes in my mouth. Where are these cold rushes? I just feel overheated worse than on pills.",
      "22:35 [T+2:00] Nothing has changed really, I now know that the high isn't getting any better or more intense. I have been talking to someone on the internet for the past half hour or so. I don't have the motivation to go for a walk in the dark, and feel it would be uninteresting at most anyway. Still feel hot like my face is flushed red, and feel tension under my eyes. I am still sweating with my fan on.",
      "22:50 [T+2:15] Unless it is because I am still engaged in an internet conversation I am not feeling nauseous or feeling all the shitty effects as much now. But I do feel a bit too hot to be comfortable, maybe even hotter than before.",
      "23:25 [T+2:50] I have been talking to the same person since the last timestamp, normally this is not what I would choose to do when taking a chemical, far from it. The only use of a computer would be to play music or watch something trippy if I am inside. But I find I have to be doing something on the drug to overcome its side effects. I could not just melt into my surroundings and enjoy any type of trip or feeling. I notice now that when I lay back and stare I get moving peripheral visuals, like something continuously moving away or scrolling in a certain direction. When I focus on that object, picture or pattern directly there is no moving anymore.",
      "23:27 [T+2:53] The feeling is still pretty much at that same uneventful level so I have 2.1ml of pure GBL in some orange juice.",
      "23:40 [T+3:05] The G has kicked in but I'm not overly sedated or relaxed, I just feel better as expected. There is no amazing synergy at all, unlike meth and G which feels wonderful. It's like I am not feeling the full G effect either, or the mCPP much anymore. Somehow, it is like they have both cancelled each other out to a degree.",
      "23:55 [T+3:20] I have the rest of my G which is only about 0.7ml. Mixed with orange juice again.",
      "00:00 [T+3:25] More of the same. Not really feeling any different, slightly down from the background mCPP buzz which is actually what I wanted. The G is having some effect which I can enjoy. G really is the wonder drug for any time and place!",
      "00:15 [T+3:40] Feeling kind of hungry I go and eat some Weet Bix with milk as chems, especially GBL cause some gut problems for me along with some gross bowel movements. Fiber normally fixes it somewhat.",
      "00:20 [T+3:45] Check eyes, they are ever so slightly dilated. I sit back for a few minutes to digest the food and feel the rest of the G feeling.",
      "00:30 [T+3:55] It feels a tiny bit like I am on a meth comedown, but without the body stimulation, and the mind isn't the same mechanical and habit-based structure like on meth or its comedowns. To tell the truth I would rather be on a meth comedown as this is still pretty subtle at most.",
      "I ring a friend to see what he is doing. We talk shit for a while, he tells me his net is still down so I tell him to retype his password in. He told me there would be no use as he hasn't touched the password in his router configuration or any settings at all. I tell him to try it in a very 'knowing' way. He does so and it connects instantly.",
      "00:45 [T+4:10] It feels like sleep won't be all that easy so I opt to masturbate for a while to help with sleep. This would not be a sex drug. Too much up and down and when erect it isn't as strong as like on G alone or even on a meth comedown. More like the kind of hard on I can get after a few MDMA pills, i.e. not the greatest.",
      "01:20 [T+4:45] After a lot of up and down I cum and its not near as intense ejaculation wise or feeling wise as meth, but I think the G made it feel better than it would of, and it was better than a sober orgasm. I thought maybe because viagra is a piperazine this drug could help achieve a better erection, but then I remember BZP which I had no hope of getting it up on (or after) at all.",
      "Wish I had more G so I could blow out (G-Sleep) as I am over this drug, and over being awake. Not that it is doing anything it's just keeping my mind a bit awake, but my body doesn't feel stimulated besides my jaw slightly. Still a bit hot but nowhere near as bad as before. I never got those cold rushes people talk about.",
      "01:30 [T+4:55] It feels like sleep still won't be all that easy so I go and play some classic Unreal Tournament online for about an hour then go to bed.",
      "02:45 [T+6:10] Well sleep is harder than I thought, but no rapid closed eye movies like when trying to sleep on meth, and no eye tension from trying to keep my eyes shut, just semi-awake boredom.",
      "Had some pretty weird dreams through the night. A repeated dream I get at times of being driven on a bus down some really winded, very narrow, bumpy hill-side road and other cool scenery, to some pool caves where everyone goes after it has rained for a few days.",
      "Then as usual a friend from my past talks to me as a ghost. Telling me how by killing himself he is stuck in limbo and cannot progress and can only live in this area (he jumped off a cliff similar to the one in my dream), and needed my help to get him back into the real world. After finding a fool-proof plan to get him back alive, he decides in the end it is better for him to stay in limbo as he would disappoint himself, family and friends or something like that. And has his own solo life now in limbo. Very odd dream, it is like my friend really is communicating with me. Dreams can be so intense and delusional, even more so than a psychedelic trip.",
      "I woke up some time around midday feeling pretty normal. Not down at all but my forehead still feels hotter than it should be.",
      "I have tried mCPP once before this experiment, at 65mg with a 25mg booster about an hour and a half into it. I had similar side effects as above, especially nausea and didn't really enjoy it, but I thought if I made a push on myself in a positive direction I could enjoy the experience. I felt a sedated effect about 2 hours later, where if I smiled I could trick myself into thinking 'this is okay' for a few seconds, but beside that I didn't enjoy it.",
      "I'm not going to bother trying this drug again. It is a waste of time and has no decent effects for me at all. It is not in any way, shape or form MDMA-like. It is more like some dirty, uneventful stimulant with no positive or motivational push with no actual physical stimulant properties besides the side effects. I'll be giving away the rest to a friend who can maybe get something positive from it."

      "I had been reading about Kava Kava on the net, and it sounded pleasant to me, judging from the various reports.  So, my friend Kyle (140 lbs.) and I rolled up some blunts with pipe tobacco and cannabis, smoked at the beach, and decided to go get some.",
      "The GNC was still open, so we drove over to the mall, and picked up a bottle of 90 500mg capsules of the root powder.  It wasnt the concentrated kind, just the regular.  Was that a mistake?  So we take the bottle home, and empty out all the pills into a couple plastic baggies, and mix ALL of it with a can of Kerns Coconut Pineapple nectar.  I also added a little canola oil, to help it mix together.  I dont have a blender, which might have been another mistake, but we whisked it up pretty good, and it seemed to dissolve well.",
      "We were left with a milkshake-like drink, which we split, chased with another can of nectar, and some water.  The first half of it was actually somewhat pleasant-tasting to me (and only me), but the last few gulps were somewhat hard to get down.  Certainly a lot easier than drinking that much hard alcohol.  By the way, by the time we ended up drinking it at 8:30pm, I wasnt feeling the effects of the marihuana at all, which was good because I wanted to  feel the Kava Kava alone.  After we drank it, I was actually a little worried we had taken too much, as 45 pills worth each seemed like kind of a lot.",
      "But, after about 45 mins, I really wasnt feeling much of a bodily change.  I started to feel a little more relaxed, but also a little anxious, like before I drop MDMA, because I wasnt sure what to expect.  So, an hour after drinking the stuff, at 9:30, we split a pre-mixed alcoholic drink, as to quicken the effects of the Kava.  That seemed to have little effect, other then the alcohols.  About a half-hour after that, we went to the beach and smoked some leftover cannabis, and some resin we had collected off some bong slides.  Again, nothing but the usual high.",
      "My friend kind of veged out on the couch for a while.  I was dissapointed by the whole thing, because other then a slight change initially, I really didnt feel much at all from all the Kava.  I was expecting a lot more from the amount we took.   I still want to try some of the Kava from Hawaii, and perhaps next time Ill look further into prep methods, but overall, a waste of time."

      "My little brother introduced me to DXM a couple of years ago, I did not know that such a trip was even possible.  This drug has advanced me spiritually and mentally beyond what I even imagined possible.  The most recent trip that I have had was the most amazing yet.  Throughout the years that I have tripped, each experience was like the most vivid near death experience possible, the sensation of being beyond life and back to the most familiar state that I can only compare to what might have been felt before I was born being very intense.",
      "I took 480 MG of Triaminic Thinstrips, waiting nearly an hour or so before I felt anything out of the ordinary.  A wave of nausea washed over me and I threw up several times before that familiar wave of comfort finally settled over me.  When the drug was in full peak I was watching with my little brother several TV shows showing some of the more extreme police shows.  The sense of familiarity and being in a dream was VERY strong, most of the experience being most like a trip back to that time that I can most compare to the time I can imagine before I was born.  There is the most peculiar and strong feeling of deja vu and stong visual hallucinations of a place before memory.  The experiences and memories that I have taken from each trip have made me more and more convinced of a previous life beyond just a past life, a super-conscious state where I feel like a bud or droplett from a larger place.

      "Everything feels like part of a dream and the natural result of every decision I have made in my life up to this point.  If I am in a dark place I can close my eyes and hallucinate in pixels.  I have seen past lives and from the TV shows that I have watched a greater sense of purpose or closeness to that beginning.  This drug is nothing like I can compare to, it is the best comparison to a spiritual near death experience.  I love it, it makes me feel like I am back to the source of life, like I am dead and alive at the same time.  Coming down from the trip is a slow and spiritual release from a higher state, if I happen to share the experience with any friends I will hopefully be born as a soul brother/sister to that person."

      "During the last few weeks, my mental outlook has been very contemplative and introspective.  I have been reading Being and Nothingness by Sartre and reading dozens of trip reports on the internet.  The day before this experience, I had a reflective conversation with a friend of mine where we spoke for about four hours.",
      "I wanted to trip at night, so for the past few days I had begun shifting my sleeping patterns.  I woke up at 8:00 PM and did some light stretching.  I am not taking any medications and have no physical/mental problems.  Except for a handful of crackers, I have not eaten in more than 14 hours.  I feel somewhat nervous but upbeat and looking forward to the experience.",
      "Note = Quotations are from actual entries either made in my journal or spoken into a tape recorder during the experience.  (I used the tape recorder from 12 AM until 4:30 AM, otherwise I wrote in my journal.)",

I psychologically begin insulating myself inside my apartment.  I take a quick shower and any apprehensionsseem to dissipate.  I look at myself for five minutes in the mirror, then put on a favorite t-shirt and pair of jeans.",
      "8:52 PM (+0:22) = I seek a couple of benefits from this experience.  I want to temporarily remove myself from the ordinary world so I can recapture a more essential frame of mind.  Now [in my mid- to late-20s], I find myself getting bogged daily in daily experience and want to reclarify what is truly important to me.  I also want to explore myself and get some honest insight into why, despite my abilities and ambitions and respectable levels of accomplishments, I fail to live up to my own internal standards.",

Melt away to the worst I can be, and then come back to the best I can be  I realize and accept I will never be perfect, because my strengths as a person are linked to my weaknesses.  They are tied together and cannot be separated.  The key is that if the strengths are busily utilized, the weaknesses do not have a chance to take hold and flourish.  The opposite is also true: Every hour I let the bad person run free is 10 hours the good guy cant walk with a smile on his face.",
      "? = I eat a few crackers and feel very good.  I turn out all the lights and lay on the sofa watching a candle.  I feel more eager to have a conversation.  I feel much more eager to philosophize with someone.  Ask questions, answer questions.  This would be the sociable time.  I feel a burst of energy, and have to consciously suppress the urge to call friends or go for a drive in my car.  Instead, I compose a poem describing the flickering candle into the tape recorder.",

I take two Advil (each 200-mg ibuprofen) and a Centrum (multi-vitamin).  I eat less than half of the meal I cooked before returning to work on my painting.",
      "? = I have a strong reaction to the song Positively 4th Street by Bob Dylan.  I dont know exactly what hes singing about.  Is he singing to himself?  Is he singing to someone else?  Or is someone singing this to him?  But to me, it sounded like parts of me talking to other parts of me.  Not exactly, but enough to give me chills",

[At the time I thought the painting was mediocre, but as I write this the next day I am really beginning to like the way it looks.  The scene is a storm at sea with a rocky island in the background.  The sky is turbulent and swirling, about to conceal a fading sun.  A large wave is building that will soon block almost the entire view from sight.]",

      "4:30 AM (+8:00) = Luna gives way to Mazzy Star who gives way to Sonic Youth.  I feel a dull pain in my jaw and slight discomfort on the top of my head so I take two more Advil (each 200-mg ibuprofen).  At this pointif I did have a steady girlfriend I would want her here with me to experience the aftereffect.  I have thoughts of incorporating this experience and future 2C-T-7 trips into my regular life.  This is the part of the trip where you bond.  For the next 90 minutes I organize my thoughts.  I sketch in my journal, and draw myself looking into the mirror with all the different people looking back at me.  I feel euphoric.  The apartment is silent except for the music and I drink plenty of water. ",
      "6:30 AM (+10:00) = I spend six hours playing around on the computer, relaxing and enjoying myself.",
      "1:00 PM (+16:30) = I eat a small meal and watch mindless television.",
      "3:00 PM (+18:30) = I go to bed and drift off to sleep after about ten minutes.",
      "11:30 PM (+27:00) = I wake up feeling refreshed except for a dull ache in my jaw, some tension between my shoulder blades and slight pressure in my eyes.  I am happy, seem mentally alert and feel ready to begin a new project of some kind.",
      "This experience was very enjoyable and I gained some beneficial insights that should help me with my daily life.  The physical discomfort was noticeable at times but never prohibitive.  While my dosage was mild, I now understand my reaction to 2C-T-7 and would be willing to try 20-25 mg orally in my future experiences.   I would like to try other settings or perhaps eventually combine 2C-T-7 with other drugs.   ",
      "In conclusion, I appreciated the introspective and creative aspects of the experience.  I now understand that the enjoyment is not in achieving perfection but the process of trying, and the disappointment of not living up to your full potential is minor compared to the despair and bitterness of never realizing even a small amount of your potential.  I enjoyed the feeling of painting, and sometime in the future might try to dictate an entire short story into a tape recorder while experiencing 2C-T-7."

    "report": [
      "To preface, let me state that at the time of taking this, I was in a poor frame of mind. I had been depressed for over a year, and had just gotten a job, thinking that the distraction of work would help alleviate my depression somewhat. This completely backfired, and the thought of spending the rest of my life working drove me into a deeper depression than I have ever been in before. I made the decision to end my own life, but I decided that before I committed to the act I would try breaking through on Salvia, to see if that would change anything for me. I had tried Salvia twice before, but only the leaf, and never using a butane lighter. The first time, my perception seemed off, and the second time I had a fit of laughter and felt a strange prickling sensation all over my body. Both experiences were short-lived and, in my opinion, not really worth it. I had no previous experience with any other kind of hallucinogenic substance, though I was an avid pot smoker. At the headshop I purchased a small plastic bong, a butane lighter, and a gram of 10x Salvia Divinorum extract.",
      "I headed over to a friend of a friend's house who had stated earlier that he was interested in trying some. From what I had read online, you only needed a pinch of the stuff for a full blown trip, so I figured I had plenty to share. My friend, P, knocked on the door and we were let in by his friend, E. I explained to them both that this stuff was supposed to make you trip out hardcore, and my friend P decided he would try some too. After explaining how to properly smoke it to them, I asked if either of them wanted to try it first. To my surprise, E said that he did. E lived with his parents, who were home at the time, but he assured me that they were OK with his drug use, and did drugs themselves on occasion. We were in his bedroom, which was dimly lit, with christmas lights and trippy pictures adorning the walls. I began to get a little nervous at this point, being as we were trying a supposedly powerful hallucinogen for the first time, but reassured myself and loaded E a small hit in the bong. I handed it and the butane to him, and watched as he kept the flame on it and inhaled the entire hit. He held it in for about thirty seconds, during which time P left the room to chat with E's parents about Salvia. After exhaling, E began talking to me about how he felt, and very quickly began slurring his speech. He started looking back and forth around the room, and seemed to be struggling with his words, which by this time had become completely incomprehensible. He had been sitting on the floor with his back to his bed when he took the hit, and now he was facing the bed, staring at it. He seemed to be trying to explain something to me, so I asked him if he wanted to get on the bed. He responded affirmatively, then pulled himself onto the bed. He sat for a few moments, muttering, and at this point P entered the room. About this time E was coming down, and he explained that he had seen the bed as a tall building that he was at the corner of, and that he had been trying to tell me something about teeth. E tripped for about ten minutes overall. He said it was crazy, and he enjoyed it.",
      "P decided he would go next. I loaded him a hit a a little smaller than E's, at his behest. He torched it and inhaled deeply, holding it in for at least thirty seconds. He exhaled, then began laughing. He continued laughing as he surveyed the room, when suddenly his cell-phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket, looked at the number, and answered with 'I'm fucked up!', then continued laughing. The person on the other end said something, and he replied 'I'll tell you later', and hung up the phone. Then he laughed some more and stood up. He began talking in a strange slur, telling us of a pull he felt on himself. We told him to sit back down, but he assured us that he was OK. After a few more minutes, he seemed to be sober again and was speaking clearly. He told us that he was going to go outside to get some fresh air, and we foolishly allowed him to leave unsupervised. We heard a thump on the wall and I went out of the room to find him leaning his left shoulder against the hallway wall. He began telling me about the force pulling him into the wall. E and I convinced him to come back the room and sit down. After another few minutes, he told us he was sober (again). We asked him if he was sure. He said he was. He told us he had felt a force pulling him to the left, and when he had left the room he began spinning in a circle, as the force pulled him to the left and prevented him from travelling straight forward. He somehow made it to E's mother, and began talking with her. She asked him if he was tripping, to which he replied affirmatively. She told him to go back to E's room, and on his way back he began leaning against the wall due to the pull of the force. He told us he didn't get any visuals, just strange feelings and 'the pull'. He said he liked it.",
      "It was finally my turn. Since I figured that I would have to be stupid to be willing to kill myself but not willing to go as far as I could on Salvia, I filled the bowl with the extract. I took the lighter to it and began burning the blackened substance, inhaling slowly. It took me about twenty seconds to clear it, and I exhaled almost as soon as I was done. I somehow knew that it would have been unneccessary to hold it in any longer. I managed to set the bong and the lighter down on a stool, and suddenly things changed. I laughed and exclaimed 'It's just like weed!', and stared at the bowl of the bong. My vision zoomed in on the black part of it, until nothing remained but blackness. The next thing I remember was seeing... Something. P tells me that after I hit it, I said 'Wait, this isn't like weed at all!', laughed, then went expressionless and started staring vacantly into space. I then said 'I can see it. I understand', in a monotone voice. Whatever I saw, I feel it was beyond human comprehension. My closest approximation would be that I saw infinity. I can't remember it well, but even if I did I wouldn't be able to put it into words. It was something you had to experience yourself. The next thing I knew, I was God. I was everything. I knew everything. Despite my previous belief that being God must be great, I found that I wasn't happy. I wasn't sad, either. I just was. It was as things had always been. My previous life, as well as everyone else's, was nothing more than a dream. This was the true reality.",
      "It was strange, I knew everything, but it was sort of like how information was stored on a computer. All the information is always there, but certain sections need to be accessed to find what you are looking for. I found it necessary to ask myself, 'What happens when you kill yourself?'. I was suddenly warped to another place, where I was a strange, geometric entity. I was like a piece of a pie chart, with the point signifying forward. I was seeing myself in the third person, and I was bright with pure white light. My surroundings were pure energy, flowing constantly, blue and white in color. I looked to my left and saw my answer. A large patch of black and brown 'dead' energy, unmoving, sat amidst the flow. This satisfied me, and I realized I did not want to kill myself. I said out loud 'I'm never gonna kill myself because that's what happens if you do!', confusing my companions who were unaware of my suicidal inclination. At some point during this, I stood up in the real world. In my world, I turned my attention to the energy again, saying 'I have to go', I began heading into a tunnel like formation of flowing blue and white energy. It was imperative that I went through this tunnel, though I didn't know why. I just felt it was necessary. On my left was a black half circle, and as I tried to pass it, it stopped me. I was still all-powerful at this point, and felt as if I could have destroyed the entity in an instant if I had wanted to. For some reason I did not want to destroy it. I struggled and demanded that it release me. It refused, and told me to sit down. I again demanded that it let me go, adding that if it didn't I would kill it, again it refused and told me to sit down. At this point I pushed it away from me. When I did this, everything changed. I was incredibly confused. Everything seemed very familiar, but incredibly alien. I looked at the black half circle again, and it too had changed. It was now a strange, alien entity. I realized that I myself had changed as well. I stared down at my hand. I previously had no hands, so this came as quite a shock to me. 'What the fuck is happening?', I demanded from the entity. It gave me no response. I suddenly felt as if I had done this all before, millions of times. In and around my hand I saw something that I can't explain very well. It was like my hand was zooming in, but not zooming in at all, with geometric patterns that all contained information barraging my mind. 'What the fuck is this shit!?', I demanded. No response.",
      "I suddenly realized that I should probably sit down. I stated this out loud, then sat on the bed. I got into the corner of the bed and sat with my back against the wall. Two entities stared down at me. Everything was still changing, becoming more and more defined, and it was angering and confusing me. I asked what was happening to me. Neither one of the entities answered. I began to feel that they were doing something to me, causing this to happen to me. I felt heat and an intense prickling sensation flowing over me in waves. 'What the fuck are you doing to me!?', I yelled, staring up at the entities. Again they were silent, further confirming my suspicions that they were the cause of this. Suddenly, I remembered. I remembered who I was, what I was, and that I had taken Salvia. 'Holy shit!', I blurted out. The two entities - P and E, were staring down at me, wide-eyed. I realized that the strange geometric pie chart cut-out figure that I had just transitioned from was still visible. I saw that it was extending from the back of my head, with the point centered between my eyes. I was aware that it was slowly closing, much like the way pac-man dies. I could still see the world I had left, could feel it pulling on me, and I wanted nothing but to return. That was where I belonged, not in this illusion. I knew that when it closed completely, I would be completely cut off from the 'real' world, completely trapped in this illusion yet again.",
      "After a few more minutes, it closed completely. I looked up at the clock. Ten minutes had passed. I was in a state of disbelief, and was more than unsure of reality at this point. A few minutes ago I was in the real world... But now I was back in this real world. I felt like this reality was some kind of sinister trick. I was definately still feeling the effects of the Salvia. P told me that I had gotten up and was walking towards the wall. He grabbed me to prevent me from walking into the wall. He told me that I was speaking clearly, not slurring my words like he and E had been. He said that he was fearful, as I had a crazy look about me and threatened to kill him. I felt at this point that I shouldn't do drugs anymore. I wanted to go outside, so we went out and sat in P's car. He pulled out his cellphone and began showing it off. I thought that this was a petty attempt to get me to want to be in this world. My worldview at this point was like a Buddhist's, except with a dark sinister force that was actively trying to prevent me from reaching enlightenment. Relinquishing all attachments to this world was the correct course of action, but more than that was necessary. Salvia was the key. It opened the door out, but the dark force had prevented me from escaping and brought me back into the world. I was incredibly suspicious of P at this point.",
      "About a half hour later I was back to baseline and amazed at the power of this substance. My thoughts had returned to normal and I was no longer paranoid of my friends. Despite my previous resolution to not use drugs anymore, I smoked some weed with P and E. I reflected on my experience. If I was indeed trapped in some kind of horrible illusion, what was that dead energy I saw in my trip? It implied that there were others, who HAD killed themselves, while during the paranoid aspect of my experience I felt that I was the only one who existed, everyone else was an illusion. At this point I was determined to see if anyone else would experience anything like what I had experienced, so I went to everyone I knew who was interested in drugs and offered them a Salvia trip. While the results were amusing, no one else seemed to get to the point where they were no longer their self.",
      "Over the next weeks I constantly thought about my trip, and began to find more and more inconsistencies in it. I was all-knowing and all-powerful, yet I was surprised when the black half-circle grabbed me, and I was unable to free myself from it immediately.",
      "Although I was something that was utterly alien, I and the black half-circle were both using English to communicate. This might sound a little crazy, but that's how real the trip was to me. There was no differentiating between it and the real world. It was the real world while I was there, and this world seemed fake in comparison. The closest thing to it that I've ever experienced was the first time I smoked pot, when I suddenly thought that everything was a movie and proceeded to laugh uncontrollably for the next ten minutes. I think this was why I said that it was 'just like weed'.",
      "One thing I did take from the experience though, is that I don't know everything. Before I felt that I had figured the world out and it just wasn't for me. Afterwards... Well, I realized that I don't really know anything about anything. My mind was thoroughly blown by Salvia, it was something I could have never imagined in my wildest dreams. I'm no longer depressed, and I think there is still a lot for me to learn about life and existence. I definately owe this to Salvia, because without it, I never would have been able to look past my own closeminded view of existence, not out of a lack of effort, but just out of a lack of ability. Salvia showed me things I could have never possibly seen on my own, it basically bitch slapped me and told me 'You don't know jack shit'. For that, at least, I'm grateful."

      "Before I begin, I want to say that I noticed many people are aware of the negative side effects of amphetamines from reading other experience reports. Although I will focus on that, this is not like the other reports. None of the other reports mentioned taking a drug that forces you to do things when your locked inside a place where there's nothing to do. Yeah, jail.",
      "About 2 weeks before I was incarcerated I was prescribed adderall XR from the same doctor who perscribed it to me three years earlier. I had not touched it in those years. I started at about 10 or 15 mg a day and he worked me up to 60 mg a day over time. I hardly remember if it worked on me or not, I was in a horrible crisis at that time in my life. But that's beside the point.",
      "I wanted to get an edge on college because I just started 2 weeks prior to my doctor visit, and also I remember the decreased appetite effect it has on me. I wanted to lose some weight from a very long summer of drinking and partying. He perscribed me 60mg a day starting the following day. The same doseage I worked myself up to over several months. I thought about it, but was not concerned.",
      "The next day I was eager to do it. I like speedy drugs and everyone here calls adderall 'Poor Man's Coke' or 'Poor Man's Yayo'. I popped the two orange capsules and then laid down to be lazy like usual. My girlfriend got up and started to get dressed and ready. I went for a short drive to a liquor store for something to drink, and slightly started to feel the affects after about an hour. It's hard to notice unless I'm really paying attention, but it gradually came to full effect and I started to feel the typical symptoms, which were awesome to me: I felt good, confident (but not the 'take over the world' feeling), motivated, not hungry, energetic, and ideas and tasks were interesting and all seemed to be productive.",
      "I went back and reported my condition to my girlfriend adequetely: 'I'm so fucked up' I told her. I had told her what it would do, so she analyzed me for awhile and voiced any changed in me she noticed. She said I couldnt sit there and do nothing, I was always cleaning, re-arranging something, talking to someone, writing, or asking questions. I felt as if all this time I've not been on adderall, I've been so lazy and now I had to accomplish all the things I should have or never did.",
      "I called my dad and corrected all the problems I was having with him at the time. I wrote a letter to my probation officer, telling him I want to turn over a new leaf and not fuck up anymore. I cleaned. I shopped. I organized. I talked. I was finally a productive citizen.",
      "5 days after this day I was arrested at the local court house for a probation violation that occured before my adderall perscription. I would be in jail for the next 18 days. I thought 'at least I have my adderall here.' But I didn't make the connection that this drug makes me want to do things and I am in a place where I can do nothing. I was in small 6-man cell for all those days. It was about 15 feet by 20 feet. I shared it with 5 other fellow criminals. I was completely unaware of the side effects adderall can cause. But these side effects are extremely amplified when I am forced to be seperated from the world. And let me tell you, it was terrifying.",
      "My parents were in Mexico for several months on vacation and could not visit me, call me, or send money. My brother came to visit me to tell me I had lost my car, job, all my money, all my belongings from my dorm room, my bank account got closed, my parents want to disown me, and when I am released at 4:00 AM into the cold snowy night on my release date I will be homeless and only have a T-shirt.",
      "This is true, all those things were happening on the outside. But adderall can cause anxiety and paranoia. Sometimes terrifying a person of social interaction or cause them to dread things they normally would not obsess over. Well what happens when your already anxious, paranoid, depressed, and terrified of the 'what if'. Disaster. When I was told this, I started to shake. harder and harder as I stood in the visiting booth. My mouth went dry. I mean, completely devoid of all moisture. I felt as if my stomach was tied into knots and that all hope was lost. I had a yearning to start putting everything back together, but I was trapped in jail.",
      "Back in my cell I obsessed over that day's visit. With so much spare time and nothing to do besides write, draw, or watch shitty TV I had plenty of time to overanalyze a situation. Is my girlfriend gone? She must be cheating on me! Everything is gone. I'll starve to death with no money or home. My parents never loved me. Everyone forgot about me! I'll never be able to go to college again! I believed all of that. I even had a day where I was terrified the computers at the jail would be wrong and show that I had to serve a year instead of 18 days. It was insane.",
      "One night I was dizzy and felt very strange. Especially when I stood up. I was resting, yet noticed my heart was unbelievably fast. I ended up blacking out and collapsing. My cell mates pushed the panic button and I was taken to see a corrections officer as there was no nurse on duty. My blood pressure was completely fucked. My heart rate was 180 beats per minute. The C.O. freaks out but is unable to send me to the hospital unless I am in the act of dying. Or so they say. I am placed in medical watch for several hours.",
      "Following that day I saw a doctor and they told me I was in trouble. I had lost 20 pounds in 12 days. I weighed 178.5 pounds before incarceration. I was then at 158.5 exactly. After some tests, I was lacking nutrients, vitamins, and other healthy protein levels. I was malnurished. My skin was red, dry, and scaly. I already have a skin condition, but it made it worse. Then it spread all over my body. And jail doesn't help that either. My heart rate was still too high, but not bad. She said I could have gone into cardiac arrest or had a stroke.",
      "From that day until my release things got really bad but sometimes they were okay. A letter from my girlfriend (who had not left me, my brother assumed she did) helped to ease the anxiety attacks and depression. I was released and it took 2 days of my girlfriend nursing me back to normal for me to see reality. When she picked me up from jail I was shaking and my heart raced when I spoke to her. I felt nervous around her, as if she was judging me or looking at me funny. And I still believed my world was crashing down around me.",
      "It has been 17 days since I have been released from jail.  I have fixed my problems but I still notice things are differant since I've taken the drug. There are times when I feel slight social anxiety and since I've been on the drug I've had more problems with my girlfriend than usual. But that may or may not be from using the drug."

      "I'm going to begin this report with a lead-in that I've seen quite a few times in experience reports: It all began last December when I had my impacted wisdom teeth removed (sound familiar?). I've been in something of a time warp since then and am, at this moment contemplating taking yet another Vicodin, though I long ago recovered from the pain that urged me to the dentist's office - I took one a few hours ago and am trying to hold off...",
      "Putting my current predicament aside for the time being, Ill provide a little more context, which I think is important. The Fall semester at college had just ended and two days later my ex-boyfriend and I were to go on a seven-day Caribbean cruise. This seemed a bit bourgeoisie to me but the trip was fairly cheap and I needed to recover from a particularly-stressful experience with finals and term papers. I was excited.",
      "The night before we departed, however, the left wisdom tooth in my lower jaw began aching. I had a feeling that I would be in for an interesting time on the ship. So, the next morning I went to Walgreens and stocked up on Orajel and Advil. On the first day of the cruise I experienced horrendous sea sickness, which compelled me to take Dramamine and lay in bed all day, drifting in and out of a sleep haunted by strange dreams as my tooth began to throb ever more. I felt as though I were dissolving, being scattered piecemeal in the waters of the gulf and carried to God knows what strange shores.",
      "The rest of the trip was more pleasant because I did not become seasick again, but I was eating Advils like M&Ms and rubbing Orajel on my increasingly-swollen gums almost hourly. When the cruise ended, my mouth was a (ship) wreck*two* teeth were now in pain and the cheeks around them were swollen grotesquely, until I could get an appointment with an orthodontist, I took Vicodin which I had left over from a previous prescription.",
      "The point of saying all that is to indicate that by the time I actually went to the orthodontist, I had already been medicated for a week and a half. The day I arrived at her office I was nervous but excited at the prospect of being dosed with nitrous oxide. To my amazement, I was left alone in the surgery room for twenty minutes, inhaling the heavenly gas and meditating. I was disappearing into the chair, sinking further and further down. I cleared my thoughts and became one with the environment. There was no difference between me and the chair, between me and the radio that was playing (appropriately enough), psychedelic rock of some sortI am the Universe, the undying SelfKether is MalkuthNirvana is Samsara.",
      "Are you relaxing? the pretty assistant asked, appearing from out of nowhere. I could only nod in assent. She left and perhaps ten minutes later returned with the orthodontist. They gave me an IV and the next thing I remember is waking up in my parents car, vomiting blood and going in and out of consciousness. As soon as I got home I began taking Endocet (oxycodone) and PromethazineEndocet every six hours and Promethazine every four. I was still too out of it to notice the effects of the drugs. I just wanted to sleep.",
      "Now, the Endocet was prescribed for pain and the Promethazine (a sedative/hypnotic) was prescribed to curb the nausea that often accompanies opiates and opioids. Promethazine also has the interesting effect of potentiating the effect of opioids and opiates, lowering the required dosage. When I woke up the next morning and took my meds, I realized this quite quickly, even though I had not yet read the literature which explained the nature of this match made in downer heaven.",
      "I would like to describe that day because it was truly beautiful and I will treasure the memory of it, regardless of anything that followed. After a night which I dont remember, the sun rose and, feeling the ache that was returning to my jaws obscured by chipmunk cheeks, I popped the two pills as recommended by the medical professionals. As I got dressed, something began to happen. I felt lighter, and resolved to go outside to enjoy more fully what was coming on. It was one of those cold winter mornings thats accompanied by a warm sun that makes the frosty air bearable. I was stumbling. I made my way over to the old wooden swing set and sat down, propelling myself gently back and forth. When I opened my eyes, disorienting vertigo. The vertigo was not dizzying. In fact, the apparent motion of the world washed over me like soothing waves of pleasure, like impulses from beyond the unfathomable gulfs of interstellar space.",
      "This was IT, I knew. This was why opiates suck people up. I was in a state of total peace. All of my thoughts and cares melted away as my vertigo grew and grew, taking me further and further away from myself and my puny ego. I decided to try walking again, it was decidedly difficult. I stumbled around the back yard, looking at the field and woods populated by hibernating trees. The ancient spirit of rural Louisiana was coursing through my veins and the world was beyond beautiful. In the opposite direction cars rushed down the road. Where were they all going? It couldnt possibly matter. I was at peace with everything. Finally I went back inside and read an article about drugs and the religious experience by Alan Watts, whilst listening to the music of the divine Josephine Foster. I wanted this feeling to go on and on. I wanted to surrender to the beauty of dissolution.",
      "I havent felt that way again on opioids, even though I have been using them quite regularly for the past couple of months. I take Vicodin and Lortab. I buy them illegally. I suppose Im not yet a full fledged addict, as Ive been able to stop for up to five days at a stretch, but I feel increasingly drawn in. I dont really *want* to quit, even though I know I should. Its the memory of that wonderful day that haunts and tempts me. How far will I allow myself to be drawn in? I dont know. But the time to leave this phase of my life behind is fast approaching, and it wont be easy. Im entranced."

      "I am very experienced with a variety of psychedelic drugs, having used a variety of tryptamines and phenethylamines. Mushrooms are the ally I am most comfortable with and I had combined 1 to 3 grams of mushrooms with 1 to 3 grams of syrian rue with positive results several times in the past. I had one prior experience mixing mushrooms and caapi (Erowid experience ID = 57698). I had attempted the Mimosa/Rue mix once before using 2 grams of rue and 5 grams of Mimosa bark but this had proved very weak and left little impression on me.",
      "No medications or other plants/herbs had been used in the previous week except for Cannabis and yerba mate which are an all-day-every-day thing for me usually. As a precaution only MAOI compatible food was eaten for two days prior and one day after the combined experiences. Consumption of yerba mate was limited to two cups daily during this period as I didnt want to risk developing a headache as some people have described.",
      "The experience (written in the lingering aftermath):",
      "Yesterday already seems like a world away so Id better write it down now before it fades. I had worked up the courage and felt psychologically ready to enter the world of Ayahuasca analogue brews. Under the advise of another member I was going to use the combination of syrian rue seeds and mimosa hostilis root bark.",
      "A friend had recommended the combination of syrian rue seeds and Mimosa hostilis root bark. He told me '20 grams of mimosa, cooked three times, and possibly up to 10 grams of rue 'tea' boiled down to one shot. Very intense, and I think a good starting dose.' At this point I should mention that this is FAR ABOVE what anyone who is not very extremely experienced with psychedelics should contemplate taking. He was recommending this dosage to me as the full, immersive, mind-shattering kind of 'introduction'.",
      "After reading some freaky reports of people apparently tripping balls on as little as eight grams, I decided to scale down the dosages somewhat. This might have been a mistake, as during the experience I felt no fear and could gave gone deeper. There was this little voice in the back of my head that said 'Okay, that looks like a lot of mimosa bark in the pot, that should be enough'? Ignore that voice. As Terence McKenna says, when in doubt, double the dosage.",
      "I ended up making a brew of 13 grams of shredded Mimosa hostilis with 3 grams of syrian rue seeds lovingly sprinkled into the boiling concoction. I boiled the plant materials twice, adding some peppermint and stevia the second time to help with the taste (haha, nothings gonna cover the taste of this stuff!). I combined the two extracts and boiled it down to around 2/3 of a cup of the most vile tasting purple alien blood ever. Tongue shudderingly bitter. Every sip screamed 'POISON'. I combined the two extracts and boiled it down to around 2/3 of a cup of the most vile tasting purple alien blood ever. Tongue shudderingly bitter. Every sip screamed 'POISON'. Drinking the brew took an amount of determination and around half an hour. Although there was definate stomach tightness from drinking the brew, it never evolved into an actual nauseated feeling, and I didnt purge thoughout the experience.",
      "It was around the ten minute mark, when I was only about half way through the cup of tea, that I began to feel the effects come on. From there it was all steeply uphill to la-la land. After 20 minutes my sense of time stopped working, and around thirty minutes I laid down in my bed because I was totally fucked. There was an intense dissociation, I could feel my physical body being dissolved and digested by the drug, like I was blowing away in the wind particle by particle. Pure energy poured through me, and I found I could control literally every thought, every emotion, every slight muscle response in my body.",
      "The rush was so intense I would keep involuntarily clenching up my muscles as if to resist the push of the drug. Then I would notice my clenched muscles and consciously relax them all, reaching very deep states of content. My thoughts flashed through my mind in waves, and Id see each thought as a fleeting, moving flash of colour in my mind. Open eye visuals consisted of a crawling motion and tracers when I waved my hands. The OEVs I found very much like mushrooms but the feeling of this drug was quite unlike mushrooms. The DMT gave a very high frequency buzzing feeling that I found more reminiscent of the cosmic LSD than the earthy mushrooms.",
      "I began to come down somewhat from the peak of the high. It took me about fifteen minutes just to figure out the time. First step was remembering the current time.",
      "'Its 9:00 now' I would repeat to myself.",
      "So I thought about this for a long time, and in the mean time went to the washroom and came back to my room. I had now progressed to knowing that I had ingested the brew at 7:30. Not only that, I stil remembered that it was 9:00 now. Quite an accomplishment, remembering two numbers at once! After a further several minutes of thought I came to the brilliant conclusion that an hour and a half had passed.",
      "But wait? All that in only an hour and a half? It didnt seem possible. The time distortion had been so severe, I couldnt accept at first that so little time had passed. Id set aside several hours to be high and now less than two hours had passed and Id already been blasted into space and come back to earth. It was perplexing. On mushrooms Id just be peaking, and here I was coming into a very pleasant plateau instead.",
      "There was an almost ridiculously heady euphoria at this stage. Like a good dose of MDMA, except of course for the visuals. I was feeling very very empathetic and at this stage concluded 'This drug is nothing but love.'",
      "For another couple hours the experience tailed off, and it was clear to me that the DMT peak was long gone, and it was only really the rue I was feeling now. Rues a very interesting drug, it seems very strongly antidepressant. All the fear and anxiety circuits in my brain were just switched off.",
      "I came to thinking about the differences between rue and caapi. One of the things this Mimosahuasca brew impressed on me is that both the Mimosa and the Rue are male entities. They arent particularly comforting, or nurturing. It may be a rough ride. But theres this sense of total power, in a testosterone/adrenaline kind of way. Total exhileration, inflation, power trip. These plants are not here to cuddle with me, but if I can flow with them its an incredible rush. The Mimosahuasca brew struck me as a very powerful drug  a drug with healing properties, yes, but still a drug.",
      "To me caapi seems a much more medicinal plant. Caapi is going to heal me, and she is a motherly, caring, nurturing plant (although like any good mother shes not going to hold me back when the stream of life gets too intense). Rue doesnt mind if Im just looking to get high. Caapi is more demanding of respect than the rue. On the comedown of this trip I smoked a lot of potent ganja and some hash as well, and this really brought out the euphoric side of the brew.",
      "I had a rather bad sleep that night, I dont know if I was ever really asleep or just spent the whole night tossing and turning in a kind of waking dream state.",
      "Surprisingly, though I felt reasonably rested and in a good mood in the morning. The afterglow from rue brews usually lasts a day or two for me. I went to a rather exhausting lab session, and when I came home decided more exploration was in order. The Mimosahuasca had raised my confidence (and arrogance?) levels regarding MAOI bearing plants.  I was going to take caapi today, and I thought I could handle it. I thought I was stronger than this drug, and that the previous night had demonstrated that. I WAS WRONG. I was going to take caapi today, and I thought I could handle it. I thought I was stronger than this drug, and that the previous night had demonstrated that. I WAS WRONG.",
      "I boiled up 15 grams of yellow caapi with 1.5 grams of Psilocybe cubensis stems. The plant materials were boiled twice with peppermint and stevia added to the second boiling just as I had done with the Mimosahuasca. The Psilohuasca brew came out a funny creamy-yellow colour. The taste was definitely better than the Mimosahuasca. The caapi has a somewhat unsettling alkaloidal aftertaste but it much more tolerable than the Mimosa. It just tastes like really terrible tea. I was really quite curious as to how the brew would compare to the Mimosahuasca, and also hoping that the MAOIs would take care of any tolerance issues dosing two days in a row (in retrospect  no concerns on this point).",
      "Again I drank the brew in about half an hour but this time it look longer to come on. My sense of time remained intact for a good 45 minutes after starting to drink the tea. This was around 12:30 and I knew I had to go back to the university around 3:30 to mark some final lab data (we were running TLC plates and my group was relying on me to come in that afternoon when they had finished running and mark the positions on the TLC paper before the signals faded). Somehow I thought I had enough time to trip balls and still come down and go do this lab stuff*",
      "* Doing too many psychedelics can mess up your sense of time",
      "Maybe it was because I had tripped and come back in two hours the day before, but somehow I was expecting to be relatively back to reality within three hours. Silly rabbit! Around 1:30 I looked at the clock and thought 'Okay, Im totally tripping right now but thats okay, its still two hours before I have to go.' But instead of slacking off, this trip kept getting deeper and deeper. I was getting into some really deep trains of thought, rather depressing ones actually. CEVs of plane dogfights from WWII and elite SS soldiers marching in lines. I felt all my social obligations and expectations to be shackles on me, and wondered why I forced myself to be miserable so much of the time just to please other people. Suddenly its 3:30 and Im tripping harder than ever, what am I going to do?",
      "The caapi vine was making it very clear to me that THE HEALING ISNT OVER YET. All I wanted to do is lay there and try to keep sane as I watched the ceiling writhe and twist. But no, I had to start screwing myself up to going out into the world and dealing with shit. I began to get quite anxious. After a while I noticed a thick foamy spittle in my mouth, which about three seconds later became an intense need to vomit. Not that there was really anything in my stomach, but I did manage to throw up/spit up/blow out my nose vast amounts of foamy mucous (yes isnt that pleasant). Alright, fine, so Im getting rid of all the accumulated poisons in my body. Well and good. But Im supposed to be finishing my lab right now! Panic.",
      "A second wave of purging comes over me. After it passes I see this little dead ladybug thats been on my bathroom floor for a couple days. But wait! Its moving, wriggling its legs around! Im so messed up that for a while I actually entertain the notion that I somehow brought this ladybug back to life. So Im thinking about this ladybug, helpless on its back, should I flip it over? Should I give it another chance at life? I look closer. Its not alive at all. Rather theres another bug chewing its heart out. The wriggling legs I saw were the legs of a different bug entirely. This freaked me out and disgusted me a lot, but was a very good metaphor for how I was feeling at that exact moment in time. Like the world was a filthy insect chewing away at my vital organs.",
      "So I finally get myself together and leave the house, another 45 minutes have passed what with the puking my guts out and all. Before leaving I look in the mirror and see my massive pupils and flesh white and pasty, drained of blood. Great. Everything should go smoothly, as long as no one looks as my saucer-sized pupils. I still cant believe Im about to go into university while +++ tripping and just having purged on Psilohuasca. I must be crazy.",
      "On the walk over Im still screwing myself up to what I have to do, it becomes a game almost. There was an undeniable thrill at the thought of trying to navigate a normal every-day learning situation whilst having one of the most intense trips Id had in a long time. I mean, Ive done lots of things whilst high on psychedelics. Just never biochemistry lab stuff. Theres no reason I shouldnt be able to do it. I just cant fuck up. Itll be really bad if I fuck up. I imagined suddenly puking a bunch of Psilohuasca all over my TLC plate. Yes, that would be hard to explain to my lab partners, wouldnt it?",
      "I have to cross this overpass with a train station just before I get to the University, and Im surpised to see one of my lab partners walking across the overpass at exactly the same time as me, but in the opposite direction.",
      "She waves me over and says 'You arent going to check the lab data now, are you?'",
      "Alright, just play it cool, I say to myself. No one else knows whats going on inside youre head.",
      "'Yes, Im going there now' I reply to her.",
      "She explains that she had just gone and checked the data, so that I dont need to go now.",
      "What? I dont have to go? Hallelujah! My prayers have been answered!",
      "Now I know how hard it is not to tell this cute girl youre tripping balls on Psilohuasca, but just keep your mouth shut. She doesnt need to know. Id be a lot of hassle to explain. Its too difficult to explain the concept of psilohuasca even when straight. Plus then she might think youre some kind of freak. Who does a bunch of psychedelics and then goes to lab still tripping anyways? Whats wrong with me? Does she know Im on drugs? I think she knows. Well maybe not. I say goodbye to her and head off before making a fool out of myself.",
      "So now Im walking home, feeling very relieved, and kind of thinking that the caapi just 'arranged' things so that I wouldnt have to go into the university. I mean, what are the chances that my lab partner would spontaneously decide to check the data that I was supposed to be gathering, and not only that but I would run into her just after she checked the data, thus saving my poor schizophrenic mind from having to deal with it? Synchronicity at its finest.",
      "I end up going for a walk in a park near my house because Im still tripping very hard and walking is calming me down a little bit. There was this puddle of murky milky brown water flowing out of a parking lot and into the road. I spent a while standing and watching the beautiful swirling patterns made by the flow of the silty water. Hopefully no one was watching me as I probably looked pretty stupid completely dazzled and enthralled by a scummy puddle of water.",
      "Im walking past this elementary school and these five kids start giggling. You know, the 'lets try really hard not to laugh at this person as they go by' kind of giggling. Maybe I looked funny. I think I gave them the biggest contact high of their lives, because the closer I got the more and more hysterical their laughter became. Five kids killing themselves laughing at me whilst Im tripping my ass off was a bit much to handle. What should I do? Well, I could just ignore them, pretend I cant here. Thats what an adult should do, right? Instead I decided to throw a snowball at them. This only resulted in another wave of hysterical giggling and a couple snow balls half-heartedly thrown back at me.",
      "'You suck! You call that a throw!' I yell back at them",
      "Then I feel really weird. Im insulting children and having a snowball fight whilst tripping. Is this what normal people do? Definitely not.",
      "I continue walking and theres this feeling that Ive regressed to infancy. I was nothing but a big baby. To further this notion, I hear a baby screaming. This fat lady is walking down the block pushing her kid in a stroller, and the kid is bawling and bawling without end. I mean literally for five minutes I watched this lady plodding along, her infant screaming, clearly audible an entire field away. It was surreal. Dont you want to try and comfort your child? Are you hoping that by letting him cry now, his batteries will wind down?",
      "I was feeling so many intense emotions at once I didnt know what to do with myself. I half wanted to die, because there was so much destruction all around me that was caused by humans. Senseless destruction. Like this area of trees I enjoy going to, but a lot of stupid stoners hang out there. They come and they break big branches and limbs off the trees for no real reason, just for some stupid entertainment because they are drunk and stoned. So the trees are scarred, and bleeding and wounded, and some even have spray paint graffiti on them. Its no longer the comforting clean natural place it once was, where I could smoke a bowl under a spruce tree standing up, with the branches coming down to ground level all around me. Now all the lower branches are snapped off.",
      "The other half of me felt more intensely alive than ever. Life, squared, cubed, to the ninth degree. Being so intensely alive that every breath hurts to take. The late afternoon sun was warm and comforting. I thought about the sun, and whether it could be considered to be God. Is the sun powerful enough to be God, I asked. To which the response was 'No, hes gone behind a cloud.'",
      "Seeing as the sun was behind a cloud I began to get rather chilly and headed home. It was now around 4 and a half hours since beginning to drink the tea. I was still +++ tripping, but definitely beginning to repair. I didnt trust myself with any food yet, but after coming home I warmed up and began to slowly drink a cup of yerba mate. I passed on an offer of dinner with the excuse I was feeling kind of sick, which I suppose was true in a way.",
      "It is now seven hours after ingestion and Im mostly back to normal again. I feel very weak and shaky though, probably partly from the lack of food. But the caapi + mushrooms was not a recreational experience, Im shaking now because it took me so far out. I feel Ive subjected myself to rather severe stress today.",
      "Was it a good idea taking the Psilohuasca today? No. Am I glad I took it? Yes.",
      "Did I have a sufficiently deep experience this time? Almost too deep. I went right over the cataract and flailed around on the other side, staring back to the calm and placid reality Id so willingly smashed.",
      "Thanks for reading."

      "I was recently at a large indoor Pagan convention on the West Coast. While there, I browsed a botanical purveyor that had many interesting herbs- the most of which (for me) was 'mulungu' bark.",
      "The label on the package stated very simply: 'Amazonian Mulungu Bark Erythrina mulungu', measured in 100g. The label stated it to be a sedative/hypnotic, and since I have had a long time need for valium for anxiety, I thought I'd give it a try.",
      "After a bit of poking around online, I was still coming up empty, except for a few vendors. Most of them seemed to agree that there were no known side effects and that it's been used in the rainforest for centuries as a hypnotic/sedative and is currently used for anxiety and as a smoking aid. One site claimed it was actually competative at nicotinic repectors. I didn't believe this, but I decided after a bit of browsing for 'mulungu' and 'fatality' and not finding anything to go for a cuppa.",
      "I boiled my teapot around 9pm, not really expecting too much, but deciding to warn my husband ahead of time just incase any complications should arise. I served out 3 tsp. of mulungu into my nice brown butterfly mug (from my mother- from childhood =) very 70s). I placed a plate on top of the brew and let it steep for 10 minutes, straining the pulp and discarding it. I sipped cautiously and waited for 10 minutes to see if I developed any signs of an allergic reaction. The flavor is remeniscent of anise, but not in a bad way....perhaps slippery elm root is a better comparison.",
      "Well, I didn't react poorly, and I slowly finished the rest of the tea off over the course of a 1/2 hour.  I soon became very drowsy. As I started drifting, I joined my husband in bed after my sleeping time bowl of cannabis. I've been smoking tobacco since I was 12 (Am 26 now), and really want to quit, and just as I nodded off in bed next to my husband, I thought, 'I really want to quit- for my health and his, maybe the cannabis will help...' and fell asleep.",
      "The next day I woke up and felt pretty good. The mulungu certainly was soothing if nothing else. I got up and started doing chores. I didn't really think about the fact that I didn't have a cigarette. In fact, I forgot all day, until about 7 when I saw my husband and roommate lighting up. I started to go for my smokes and then realized I didn't want them anymore. I smoked a bowl of very good grade medical cannabis (which I take for nausea), and considered my lack of desire for a smoke.",
      "In my hubris (and perhaps because I intermittently smoked alot of cannabis with the mulungu no negative result), I thought that perhaps the Goddess had heard my prayer and was helping me to quit. This went on for about a 1/2 hour until I realized, 'No. This is not a miracle, the Gods dont do those anymore. What's the one different thing I've done today??'      ",
      "The only thing was the mulungu. I I know this sounds like a commercial for this wierd tree bark, but I swear, it worked for me. I actually came to this revelation while in my car on a windy road near my house. I was so surprised I called my husband. That night, I decided to repeat the experiment and see if I craved a cigarette.",
      "The second night I made the mulungu - this time with a bit more reverence and less trepidation than the first time. I brewed up 3 heaping tsp. of ground bark (I wonder how they sterilize this stuff....if they do...). I put a plate over the cup to contain the steam and keep in nutrients- I've been told to do this by several herbalists for several different herbs, so I gave mulungu the same treatment. I let it soak for 10 minutes, then drained off the bark and drank the liquid. I felt a subtle tinge of relaxation after about 15 minutes, and there was a quiet buzzing to my thoughts. I have found a few internet sites saying that mulungu is an ingredient in some alternative ayahuasca recipes. From the slightly foggy drowsiness that I've come to expect from mulungu, I wouldn't be surprised. ",
      "The third day I tried not taking the tea: on the 4th morning I actually thought a cigarette sounded good, and it sounded better and better as the day wore on. I was happy to drink my tea that night, because the next morning: no cravings.",
      "Thanks to the mulungu, I now know that what I was feeling when I longed for a cigarette wasn't my actual thoughts - they were cravings. I know this because I've felt no desire for a cigarette whatsoever. I've tried to smoke to see how it would feel: it tasted poor and was unpleasant. I thought I should write - because other people should know that I took mulungu and didn't die. And it seems to be synergistic with cannabis, and is an extremely excellent smoking cessation aid. Blessings to all - my story may not be common- YMMV. Have fun and be careful!"

      "I alone on my bed with a lighter (just a normal one) in hand and devoured the extract. I held it in for as long as I could (about 15-20 seconds) and let it go. My friend later told me I didn't hold it in long enough, but it's all I could do. I felt kind of light at first, but decided another would be good... and then another.",
      "Suddenly a strike in the music gave me a very different emotional perspective on my room. It was sort of akin to a very beautiful emotional moment.",
      "I kept expecting the unknown but was instead hit by a wave of familiarity. The experience was just like one of the strongest marijuana highs I've ever had, the first time. Not the overall thoughts, but the detachment. The feeling that my room and I had been cast out into space, released from temporal and spatial reference points. I knew I was tripping, but I kept on smoking. I wanted to go higher.",
      "I began to talk to myself out loud. It seemed various objects in the room drew my attention, and that the answers to my various questions emanated from them (not auditory). I remember at first asking why I was all alone. At first I thought I was referring to nobody else being in the room, but received a response from my other self that built upon the question. I began to realize that I am surrounded by good people and was not at all alone.. but was spending a lot of time alone with no 'apparent' productivity toward school.",
      "(This experience was not foreign to me either. In one of my 'psychotic episodes' I ran around talking to various trees that I acquired wisdom from). The salvia experience was almost the same...though much much shorter.",
      "I remember shouting (at least I felt like I was shouting) what must of been a somewhat incoherent argument about why people talk to themselves.",

This too I was completely familiar with as these are actually called 'delusions of reference' in psychotic episodes. However, that didn't stop me from walking to the door and checking... nobody there.",
      "Things started to take a bad turn when the trip started to take shades of my worst pot experience (some super powerful cookies during a very emotionally unstable time).",
      "I guess it goes like this (though I haven't completely figured it out): I begin to realize how a true delusion forms and how intrinsic it feels to the person... I then start to believe I've broken from reality and have gone permanently *snapped* and can't come back. However, I seemed to possess a strange sense of calm while on salvia and told myself that *snapping* is not a big deal.",
      "Many people believe things that are not true, and they are deemed perfectly sane. I tell myself I used to talk to trees and have felt rays come from light sockets, whispers from vents. I've been in a mental hospital. I have large quantities of the antipsychotic Risperdal sitting on my shelf that I can take.",
      "... It's not that big of a deal. I then sit down and stare at the window. The window starts to take on a slight movement toward the type of visual hallucinations I've seen in the past, but somehow I stop it by resisting the temptation to indulge myself in that direction. I asked myself if this ability to decide might simply be due to the Seroquel, a strange manifestation of the medication psychologically... I sort of doubt it, but it's an interesting thought. I began to think about how recreational drugs bring on changes very suddenly whereas the medications I take act slowly over time, but the changes they both make are no more or less drastic...",
      "... I start to get anxious and remembered that I hadn't set the timer on my watch (I wanted to keep good track in case of a bad trip). I set it. I stare at it... I remember staring at it for about 15 minutes, telling myself I was done here..",
      "The trip ended and I was left with a sense of peace, contentment, happiness and a good amount of energy.",
      "It was like some of my most powerful and often more negative trips combined into one whole powerful and positive entity.",
      "I also smoked the whole gram during the trip....",
      "... I was under the impression that I would be completely knocked back and be unable to keep hitting.. so I kept hitting until it was gone (did spill a little bit though).",
      "I wonder about the meds decreasing the effectiveness, especially the Seroquel (though it is a low dose). 10x is relatively low. I used a regular lighter and didn't hold the smoke in as long as others are able.",
      "I also had my eyes open the whole time, and heard it's good to just close your eyes, relax, and imagine.. I'll definitely keep that in mind next time.",
      "Overall this wound up being an expensive trip! I'd like to try again. But next time with more preparation to get more bang for my buck.",
      "It very much surprised me that for the most part I have already experienced most of what happened in this trip before. The overall feel was unique, but that was mostly because of the unique situation... The trip was very much a positive one, though it did have a few moments of anxiety.",
      "However, I will say that this is probably the best recreational drug I've taken. If I try again I'll try for a more meditative stance as this drug was definitely forcing a good amount of introspection on my part."

We'd started the evening playing around with our new bodypaints, painting a bird-like mask on my face. The plan was to take pictures under blacklight, both of us using the unlabelled white powders about halfway through to enhance an evening of making art and trippy photographs.",
      "Within minutes of insufflation, my respiration and heartrate was increasing rapidly and my vision was blurring. I lay back in my favorite chair, just trying to concentrate on my breathing. Flotsam came out to see what was up with me. I don't remember clearly what happened next. He asked me what I thought it was; I said it wasn't MDMA. I remember feeling a lot of anxiety about my physical reaction, the racing heartbeat and breathing, my hot and clammy skin. The visuals were getting more intense, somewhat like dmt visuals, but they made me feel nauseous. I wavered in this half ecstatic, half painful state, feeling myself being pulled into a very strong experience, much like dmt, and resisting it. I couldn't stand to have my eyes open but the visuals were SO compelling. I would open them, then close them, but starting to become unable to tell whether they were open or not. My resistance added to my anxiety. I asked Flotsam to just sit and hold my hand while I fought the panic and nausea. I writhed in this state for some minutes I think, then decided I should be in the bathroom as the nausea was getting worse.",
      "I think I walked to the bathroom. I remember sitting on the edge of the bathtub, swaying back and forth with my eyes closed. I found I could make the visuals happen, will them into being, make them crescendo with the music or fade away. I spent what seemed like a very long time laughing and playing with this. (It was more like 5 minutes.) The nausea subsided while I was focused on my visuals so I went back to my chair and played some more like this. By far, this was the highlight of the entire experience, being able to willfully create the most intense, roiling visions behind closed eyes!",
      "At some point the nausea returned and I realized I would have to get the purge over with to enjoy the rest of the show. I made it so. That over, I settled back on the floor and just rocked and rolled with the waves. (Nausea did not return the rest of the night.) Leg tremors started in the inner thighs, gentle orgasmic spasms, leading to a very sensual place for me and Flotsam. I have no idea how long this went on (a long time!!) but it was extremely enjoyable and the visuals played right along with me.",
      "These were the highlights for me. It tapered off after that, though the visuals were good and strong for what seemed like several hours (only about three in reality). So there was good time distortion with it too. I was euphoric, still hallucinating wildly, but able to follow directions to complete the planned art project. The visuals hung on almost TOO long, I was ready to go to bed, my body was whipped, felt like my cage had been severely rattled (just like on 2CE), but I couldn't stop my eyes from registering these neon chasing lights and moving patterns. I eventually fell asleep, in spite of the mild leg spasms, about 6 hours after snorting it. Severely tired the next day, and out of it.",
      "I learned you should have a baseline sitter with you if you snort this stuff. The visuals and the time distortion were so strong I was not aware of my surroundings for quite awhile."

      "I have always built tolerances to prescription meds pretty fast. Lorazepam was no exception. The average dose (2mg) worked once for me and then did nothing. I experimented a few times within the 2mg-5mg range. Still nothing. I had a prescription for it but never took it because, well, it didnt work. So I had a lot left.",
      "(I do not remember much of this experience but this is all that I remember and then I was told what happened)",
      "2PM: I hadnt eaten anything for about a week and was starting to feel sick and very weak. I took 4mg of lorazepam. I tried to eat a bit of something and thing I managed to keep down a slice of toast. I drank one can of beer. At this point I was feeling good. I no longer felt sick or weak. I got a bit of a buzz off the beer but was not feeling the lorazepam.",
      "4 to 6PM: I went to one of my weekly meetings and brought another can of beer with me disguised in a green tea bottle. I took another 4mg of lorazepam and drank the bottle during the meeting. By the end I was feeling pretty tipsy and goofy which doesnt happen to me off of just 2 beers.",
      "6:30PM: I got home and started to feel even more weak and sick. I thought it was from finally eating and drinking something after a week (which was probably true).  I was starting to get shaky and wobbly. I decided to just ignore this and watch TV.",
      "10PM: My inability to walk properly didnt look like it was because I was drunk, it looked more like I was very ill and too weak. My mom asked what was up and I told her how I had just eaten something and my body wasnt handling it well. She was on her way to bed and said to me if it gets any worse tell me and Ill take you to the hospital.' Being the self-destructive person that I am, I took this as an invitation to just fuck myself up.",
      "(Here is where the amnesia starts to kick in)",
      "11PM: I went upstairs to my room and I dont really know what was going on, but I know for a fact that I drank another beer and took 1mg of lorazepam. I am a self-injurer and I dont remember it but I had cut my arm fairly seriously. (I had apparently done some nerve damage because to this day I still dont have feeling in part of my arm.) I wrapped it up and went to my moms room and she later told me that I said I cant walk anymore. Can you take me to the hospital? And she did.",
      "11:30PM: At this point my memory of what happened consists of pieces of images and a few words here and there. We got to the hospital and from what Ive heard I had absolutely no ability to stand up on my own. I had to be wheeled in sitting in a wheelchair. I got to the ER front dest and told the nurse that I had injured myself and needed stitches and couldn't walk anymore because I wasn't eating.",
      "4AM: The doctor stitched me up.  It was also the same doctor who had done my stitches 2 weeks prior to this event so he insisted that I had to speak to the crisis team. My mom left to go speak to my psychiatrist upstairs.  While waiting I popped the remaining 3mg of lorazepam in fear of being admitted and being searched resulting in them taking it away. Crisis told me that I had to be admitted and if I refused, they were going to have to call security. At this point I was really upset and yelling and swearing and just freaking out because I have been admitted to the psych unit too many times and really did not want to be admitted again.",
      "They said we would take a break for me to calm down and suggested I go out for a cigarette to help me relax. I agreed and wheeled myself out. Instead of going out for a smoke I wheeled myself to the elevators and up to the floor where my psychiatrist and mom were. I know I was furious and planning to yell my ass off.",
      "Around 8AM?: I got off the elevator and found my mom waiting and began to freak out telling her that they were going to admit me. My psychiatrist showed up and wheeled me into his office where he then placed chairs around me so I couldnt wheel myself away. I was told that I started swearing at him and yelling some more. At one point I was so angry that I tried to get up and leave to go home (stupid idea). I took one step towards the door and then started to collapse. My doctor caught me and carried me back to my wheelchair and then wheeled me into the unit. He lifted me up onto my bed and he sat on the bed with me to try to talk to me. I was told that I fell asleep right away.",
      "The next three days I do not remember at ALL but I do remember waking up with a band aid on the inside of my elbow indicating that they had done a blood test. It was also after 3 days that I first noticed I had cut myself. That was pretty shocking. No one mentioned me taking any pills but they did mention that I was drunk which I then denied saying theres no way I would ever get drunk off of 3 beers."

      "I had been prescribed Imovane for my insomnia. The first few days of taking it, it was working very well. It didnt really help me sleep though mainly because it made me feel euphoric and a bit tipsy similar to the tipsy feeling I get from alcohol. But after a week it just flat out stopped working. I doubled the dose to 15mg and still it didnt work.",
      "11:30PM: Wanting to get high I took 37.5mg of Imovane.",
      "12AM: I started to feel the effects kick in. I felt euphoric and very happy. I had a big urge to just go out and do anything at all without a care in the world. I couldnt really think because all I could do was feel. Just feel happy and giddy. I cleaned my room and was pretty much chain smoking. I wrote in my journal in an attempt to record my experiences. (I will get to that later). I dont remember much of it but Im sure I spent quite a bit of time just playing around with random knick knacks in my room.",
      "1AM: I went outside to get some fresh air and connect with nature. I sat on the front steps of my house and had a really big sense of happiness and felt at peace. I was very tipsy and clumsy. I was delusional too. I tried writing in my book with a lighter and dropped my cigarette on my leg and didnt notice it burning my skin. I started to see flashes. It was like flashes of a camera. On any other drug or even if I was sober I would be worried by this or start getting paranoid. But the Imovane took away all my paranoia and anxiety that I didnt care about the flashes. I was curious about them and wanted to know where they were coming from. I didnt go looking for them because I convinced myself it was just the harmless paparazzi after me. I have no idea why I thought it was the paparazzi, I just did. After about an hour I stumbled back to my room knocking down a few things along the way.",
      "2-3AM: I didnt stay in my room for more than a minute. I decided to go downstairs and smoke a joint with my sister. We went to our backyard and started smoking. I was feeling kind of tipsy but still really happy. Usually Im nervous around people, even my family. But I was talkative and enthusiastic with my sister and had no anxiety at all. My sister didnt notice anything. Halfway through our joint I started hallucinating. Our backyard consists of this tiny little porch that could maybe fit 3 people on it with steps leading down from the sliding doors to our lawn. Its maybe 3ft high. There are no fences separating the backyards of any of the houses down the entire street so you could basically see all the houses just like a front yard.",
      "Now what I saw was a bunch of people. These people were crouched behind the steps maybe 4 or 5 houses down. They crawled forward to the stairs of the next house, getting closer and closer to the steps where me and my sister were standing. They got so close that they were up to the point where they were crawling from my neighbours steps to mine when I realised that this wasnt real. I wasnt afraid, in fact I was pretty curious about what the hell these people were doing and wanted to talk to them. But I told myself that its around 2 or 3 AM and it makes no sense to have a bunch of people crawling from house to house towards me. After my realisation, Im guessing they disappeared. When we were done smoking I made it back upstairs to my bedroom in a very wobbly fashion and I dont remember anything else afterwards.",
      "The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed 1 and a half days later. My mom walked in and asked me how was school?. I just looked at her confused and said good?. I looked around and saw garbage all around my room and the journal I was writing in. I tried reading it but none of it made sense. There were mentions of me wanting to lick the sky, hearing giggling coming out of my walls and drawers, people watching me, people trying to break into my window, some fox in a bathrobe, a lot of random hallucinations I had. I could barely read the handwriting. At one point it took me 3 pages to write 2 sentences.",
      "Despite all the events that happened, I enjoyed the experience. I didnt feel any bad effects other than the fact that I was pretty much blacked out for a long time. The amnesia isnt good either."

      "Since I was very young, perhaps 7 or 8(22 now), I have been prescribed amphetamine salts in numerous forms for the treatment of ADHD.  I remember clearly receiving my first 5mg dexedrine tablets after numerous behavioral problems noted by my early childhood teachers.  At first I was thrown off, the pills made me feel strange and out of touch with my emotions.  I communicated this to my parents, a psychiatrist, also taking amphetamine sulphate and an licensed counselor, who informed me that the side effects should wear off soon. They didn't, and for several years I regularly cheeked the pills and would dispose of them somewhere after leaving the house for school in the morning.",
      "Then something changed. At around 11 or 12 I became very interested in altering my consciousness by any method possible, at which point I realized I was sitting on a huge prescription to speed, and had been throwing it out for years. This began a stimulant binge that lasted basically until I was 20.",
      "At first, the amphetamines did exactly what they were supposed to.  I've always been extremely impulsive and had trouble concentrating on bullshit, not a good mix for someone trying to attend school.  Although it didn't really help my grades, my ability to pay attention was drastically increased, and my outgoing impulsiveness at least changed to inward obsession, which I think was easier for my parents to deal with.  I started at 30mg a day orally, and gradually got my dose increased to 50mg a day.  I would regularly steal and snort the pills, going on 4 - 6 day binges where I would neither eat nor sleep.  In fact, the first two years of abuse I probably slept only 200 nights out of the year.",
      "When I would run out, I would pilfer my father and sister's prescriptions, or hit up other kids at school. I kept all of this use secret from my parents, outside of demanding some sort of downer for 'not being able to sleep'.  They ended up giving me trazadone, which I found incredibly addicting, another interesting post.  I took it every night for 3 or 4 years.  After the first two years the effects began to creep in slowly.  Incredible stomach cramps, and I believe significant damage to the lining of my stomach has been done resulting in daily nausea that requires marijuana just to eat. A general feeling of 'scatteredness' at about age 17 also took over the razor edge I used to get from the speed, resulting in a flood of thoughts with no real relevance which I felt unable to sort through. I also became heavily habituated to marijuana and tobacco during this period, mainly to offset or accentuate the amphetamines.",
      "All of this has led me to now.  Two years off the amps and I can honestly say thank god and I think they almost killed me.  Outside of the stomach and scattered thinking problems I also now basically have hardwired circuitry in my brain that commands me to take a stimulant in order to get anything and I do mean anything done.  I feel like serious long term damage has been done to my dopaminergic systems which results in the long term 'fuzzy' feeling I've experienced even years after quitting and extensive supplementation with amino acids etc.",
      "I've also experienced many strange hypertensive crises, and strange arrhythmias which doctors always assure me are 'not anything serious' and that 'no one your age has heart problems'.  Well, it feels pretty serious to me, and I'm totally unconvinced that a daily regime of amphetamines carries no risk for long term cardiotoxicity.  The last two years of my life have been me undoing the long term changes caused in my body by these chemicals.  Through yoga, exercise, meditation, limiting my stimulant intake almost entirely, getting regular nights sleep and vitamins I seem almost back to normal, but I wonder how many years have been taken off my life, how much better adjusted my thinking would be and if I wouldn't feel compelled to so much drug use.  If I just hadn't been pumped full of speed."

      "Towards the end of my senior year in high school, I was experiencing very worrisome symptoms: dizziness, visual blackouts, extreme fatigue, and I even fainted once. So eventually, I went to the doctor. After numerous tests, he diagnosed me as having depression, and prescribed Paxil. The first two weeks were awesome, I hardly needed sleep, lost weight, always felt happy and productive, and for the first time in my life, felt outgoing.",
      "It was great. Eventually the extreme effects wore off, but I continued taking it for a while.",
      "Fast forward two years later. I'm kind of down, and withdrawn. I  figure I can just start Paxil again, have the nice effects for a while, and then settle down into a normal routine. So I went back to the same doctor and was got my prescription filled. Unfortunately my experience wasn't so pleasant. I didn't sleep for days at a time, and was irritible and paranoid. I quit my new job screaming and cursing at my employers. I walked home flipping numerous people off. I had constantly had crazy amounts of energy, I couldn't sit still, and was extremely emotional.",
      "My boyfriend got worried about me and brought me over to his parents house to be 'supervised,' as he had to work, and his mother, being a teacher, had the summer off. Even that didn't work out. They took me to a local psychiatric hospital. I was all right until my boyfriend left, and the ICU door slammed in my face and I discovered it was locked. Then I freaked out. I started pounded on the glass at the nurses station screaming to be let out. They eventually wrestled me to the ground to give me a shot of Haldol, an anti-psychotic, and then forced me into a locked room. They said I assaulted a nurse, but I know I didn't, and I'm the one with the scar on my elbow because of it anyhow. I spent ten days there, was prescribed Zyprexa, and was released. Unfortunately, I still wasn't right. So back I went.",
      "I only spent a few hours there this time, though. The other patients were seriously creeping me out, and they gave me some kind of medication that made me feel really weird. So I somehow tricked a nurse into signing something that said I could be let out. I had to call a relative to pick me up, so I called my mom, 100 miles away to pick me up. She took me back to my home town, which I don't remember at all, because I passed out. I woke up in the emergency room. A few days later, she made me admit myself to the psychiatric hospital there. That was particularly unpleasant. I had made suicidal remarks, so they were able to get a court order to keep me there.",
      "I was misdiagnosed as being schizoaffective, which is kind of like a blend of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. So I was on numerous anti-psychotics, which didn't work, and lithium, which sent my thyroid levels to hell. (I had a bad doctor!) Its possible that I was on anti-psychotics for so long that they prolonged my psychotic symptoms. I was very paranoid, and constantly had extremely morbid and disturbing thoughts going through my head. All I could ever do was walk, and I refused to eat.",
      "Eventually, I was transferred to the State Hospital, which is in the city I live in. I spent six weeks there, and was still plauged by paranoia and morbid thoughts, although it was a bit better. The day after I was released, I went to see a completely new doctor and was almost immediately diagnosed as having manic depression, or bipolar disorder. Nearly all the treatments I recieved were completely wrong.",
      "In the end, I spent over three months in a psychiatric hospital, brought about by Paxil. I'm currently on one steady medication, compared to the seven I was on at one time. It was a traumatic experience and I hope no one has to go through anything like it. Be careful with anti-depressants! If you feel highly energized, experience rapid thoughts and ideas, or other similar symptoms, stop taking the medication immediately, and contact your doctor. There is a chance you could be bipolar, and there are better treatments out there for you."

      "[Erowid Note: to date, heroin has seldom, if ever, been identified as an ecstasy adulterant, as alluded to in this otherwise well written report]",
      "I had been wanting to try ecstasy since I was 17, but never quite got around to it. I'm now 25, a grad student and teacher. For information, I have never done any drug except for pot and nitrous. A friend of mine does E quite regularly. She was coming to visit and had two tablets of MDMA (rolling stones) for me and my fiance. She likes pills with small percentages of heroin in them, but I told her I wanted pills as pure as possible. She tried the ones she gave us before we did them, and said they were very pure. My fiance and I were very nervous before we took the pills. I thought that there would be a sudden head rush, and that it might be a very intense experience. I'd heard that people got nauseous and just felt like it was 'too much' when the effects were coming on. In reality, it was nothing like this. We made sure our living room was dark, lit aroma therapy candles, put on music..it was a calming environment. At 9:45 my fiance and I each took one pill. My friend and her boyfriend split another pill and each took another different one (a green one which had some heroin in it).",
      "I didn't really begin to feel anything for about 45 minutes to an hour. We just hung out and played a game while waiting for the effects to begin. About 45 minutes later I began to feel a little jittery and yet relaxed at the same time. My friend encouraged me to stand up and move around, and this did feel nice. I felt a little dizzy and movement just felt...fun. I petted our cats and smoked. My friend suggested menthol cigarettes, saying that non menthols just wouldn't taste good. She was right. They didn't. The menthol just tasted nice in my mouth. I also chewed a lot of peppermint gum and drank water. We just sat around and talked.",
      "About the effects that I'd heard of...I heard that touch would just feel FANTASTIC! I heard that I would feel incredibly loving and just feel at peace with myself-like I could see what was wrong in my life and just accept it and move on. I also expected to feel sexual in some way. Well, touch did feel nice. I gave my fiance a backrub, and I did enjoy the way his skin felt. He gave me one, and it was also enjoyable. His touch felt warm. I did feel comfortable with my friend and her boyfriend. I felt open, but not extremely open. At one point we were sharing embarrassing stories, and I was conscious of the fact that I could censor some of my thoughts. I felt nice, but the experience was not nearly as intense as I expected. In general, I felt mellow and relaxed. We all talked a great deal about going somewhere or doing something, but no one really had the energy or desire to actually go somewhere or do something. The farthest we got was walking around our apartment looking for nice things to touch and play with. I took several sweaters out just to touch them. I also did not really feel sexual at all. I felt totally asexual, actually, just enjoying being a human being. I would compare the feelings to a nice beer buzz without feeling unable to think or move clearly. My fiance wanted  chocolate at one point, and really seemed to like the taste, but I desired no food whatsoever. We talked about various kinds of drinks we might like, and when someone mentioned milk, this seemed like the most disgusting thing in the world to us all.",
      "Before my fiance and I went to sleep, as the effects were wearing off, we all smoked some kind bud, which definitely seemed to bring back the effects. I got very silly, and I was not sure if this was because of the pot or the ecstasy or both. This was about 2:30 in the morning. (We took the pills at 9:45, so the effects lasted about 4 hours for us.) We went into our bedroom, got into bed and started to touch one another, and then we did feel sort of 'sexual.' We really enjoyed the way each other's skin felt, and we started to mess around, and soon had sex. But this seemed to be a rather pointless exercise (sort of) because though the sex felt good, there was no way either one of us was going to have an orgasm. I'm still not sure I really felt aroused. Touching just felt good. Not really arousing like on pot, just warm and pleasant on the skin. I liked the closeness and intimacy. Eventually we just stopped and went to sleep.",
      "I'm writing this the day after, and so far I feel no after-effects whatsoever. No jaw clenching (I did chew a lot of gum.) No back pain. No nasty feelings or depression. My friend says that I may expect some tomorrow. I noticed no side effects when on ecstasy except that I had to pee a lot. I probably peed 6 times in 4-5 hours. I drank a lot of water to prevent dehydration, so maybe that's why. There must be a long line for the bathrooms at raves!",
      "Overall, I would have to say that though the experience was pleasant, I still much prefer pot. I would not really be tempted to try ecstasy again. It was not the 'life changing' experience I thought it would be. I did not really learn anything about myself or my friends. Though I was lucid, I had no real desire to think intensly about anything. Even talking for too long about serious things seemed to bore me. I did feel close to my friends and my fiance, but I usually feel close to them. I simply was not judgemental. I felt eager to please them and make them happy. I found E to be a very mellow relaxing experience, but I enjoy the sensual intensity that pot provides to be much more enjoyable. It makes touching much more pleasurable than E did.",
      "I just wanted to write this, because I've been looking at these experiences while researching E, and I wanted to contribute my own experience so others might benefit. My friend says that any experience on E is different because of different circumstances. She seemed to have a much more powerful roll than me, she said because of the contents of her pill."

      "After high school, I spent two years at Junior College in Northern California.  I wasnt at all social during my time at the JC.  In high school, my girlfriend was my central preoccupation.  I moved to San Diego to go UCSD and be with my girlfriend in the fall of 03.  We quickly parted ways and I was left friendless.  My best friend, by default, was logic.  I had taken some philosophy courses and enjoyed them and I changed my major to philosophy. ",
      "It was difficult to be friendless because I had moved into a very warm and lively house with three other guys who were accommodating and pleasant.  I didnt join in there fun because it often led to them making contradictory statements which was fine, but then they would glaze over the contradiction like it didnt happen.  I was trying to build an understanding of the world based on sound logic so I could make reasonable decisions about my future.  To this end, my demeanor was always flat, even when I drank.  To avoid being oddly silent, I would make dry jokes, espouse ideas, ask hypotheticals, or make observations.",
      "When two roommates came home with mushrooms, I decided I would take them.  My reasoning was this: its unacceptable for me to live and die on my current trajectory.  And despite various phases, my life hadnt changed in a meaningful way for years.  The college years were famous for changing lives, but they werent changing mine.  Therefore, I should eat these mushrooms as a means of changing my life.  Even if my life changed for the worse, I would at least gain perspective. ",
      "I hadnt heard any stories about hallucinogens, and had no idea what to expect.  I had the vague idea that creative people experimented with drugs, and I knew that establishments such as school and family would vehemently disapprove.  I ate them with the spirit of, lets see what happens.",

I touched my toes and saw faint ribbons of rainbow colors traveling up my calves. ",

      "A left and T stayed.  I started dancing in the middle of the room, while he sat against a wall and watched.  Dancing like this has been a lifelong hobby and it didnt feel at all out of the ordinary.  A very happy song came on and I danced like a fool.  I reached out and touched Ts finger with my finger, and it felt like a jolt of light.  It was the most sublimely happy Ive ever been.",

      "I went back in my room and closed the door.  It seemed like the trip was ending and I wanted to go to sleep.  Behind my eyelids I could see colors floating sideways like they were being squeezed out of something, and occasionally I saw disturbing images of clowns.  I wasnt particularly afraid at this point, more annoyed and wanting to sleep.  A and T came to check on me before they went out on a walk.",

There thoughts were closely associated with my family and school.  Then I had the thought that maybe everyone I knew had already taken mushrooms and I was becoming part of the club.  The thoughts had an immediate emotional impact on me before I could examine them properly.",
      "I was taking philosophy of neuroscience at the time and thought about perception, and about how its all I can prove exists to me.  I was on my knees in the middle of the room and felt something gripping my stomach.  The feeling rose to my chest and I had the very certain thought that I was going to die.  The feeling moved up to my head and I keeled over onto my face feeling like I had actually died.  I lied on my face and shoulder for what felt like a few seconds, then sat up and stretched my hamstrings.   My body felt so soft like I had just been born.  Im the only one here I thought.  That reintroduced my mind, and slowly gained momentum over the next hour.  I didnt feel scared, just annoyed that my mind was running and I couldnt stop it.",

To either believe the previous night was real, or pass it off as an other worldly experience attainable only through the use of drugs.  I decided on the latter, and that anyone who believed the events were real, would eventually go crazy.  Carlos Castaneda, Dan Millman and Jack Kornfield have helped change my mind.  I now think those experiences were as real as could be.  The plants gave me tons of energy, but I didnt have the character to handle it properly.  In retrospect, I did okay, but I probably went a little too far too quickly and hurt myself.",
      "Ive tried various means to gain more understanding.   I used mushrooms three other times without the same success, probably because of the increased expectations.  On one trip I got an insight into my personality when my internal voice seemed to fragment quickly over a period of a few seconds.  Since then its been common for me to think of the voices in my head as living together in a kind of community.  For about a year I smoked lots of marijuana, and was hoping for a sort of quick fix.  I ended up in a therapy and eventually took time off school.  I was desperate to get back on track so I signed up for a full length triathlon and trained all summer.  I didnt finish, but it wasnt all bad.  I learned a lot about health and nutrition.  Since then Ive treated myself more gently, and have had success examining the connections between my emotional history and my current behavior patterns.  At times during this period people have viewed me as strange.  I was acting terribly weird for a couple of years.  I was very confused, and I felt very special for being so.",
      "I now see two distinct possibilities for my life.  One is normal, in which I make my own choices for desired outcomes.  The advantage is safety and security within the fold of human interaction.  The downfall is the predictability and mundane routine of daily life.  The other is not normal.  In that life I give up the illusion of choice and follow power along paths with heart.  The advantage is expanded knowledge and awareness, increased potency of experience, and always having a challenge to meet.  The fallbacks are the unpredictability and inability to mesh with ordered society."

      "The problem with having depression is that every few years or following major life changes, it becomes necessary to go back on antidepressants in order to get back on track, even if you don't want to (take antidepressants I mean). It's a feature of the illness that it recurs, and those who have had it will recognize the lows when they come around, and the symptoms. Manic/depression (bipolar) is very different by the way.",
      "After a major move to a new city and a new job which turned out to be a disaster (manager has now been fired), and moving to yet another new job, I noted the depression that I'd had since age 10 firing up again. Sleepiness, teariness etc., and after 8months of trying to get over it myself, I took myself to a doctor to get some pills. I'd been on paroxetine (Aropax) as a teenager, and looked forward to feeling a bit more cheerful. However, after a few weeks I began to feel a bit like the doctor's guinea pig. First I was on a noradrenaline-reuptake-inhibitor, which gave me nightmares, and then he changed me to Effexor.",
      "Now I'll be honest - I'm not a big one for taking illicit drugs (I don't even smoke), I've only had pot and Ecstacy, but I've never been so high in my life. I took it about three in the afternoon. That night I woke up suddenly at about four in the morning, unable to stop moving. Twitching. When I got out of bed I had the shakes, dilated pupils, my jaw was spasming and my vision was jittery. I was talking a million miles a minute, none of it making sense. I couldn't sit still. I scared my boyfriend, who wanted to know what I'd taken. He was more worried when I told him it was prescribed.",
      "When I got to work (night shift), the chick I worked with asked me what was wrong, she saw my pupils and asked if I'd dropped before coming to work. Humiliating. Fortunately none of my patient's noticed. I filled her in and got on the internet.",
      "I took it for a few more days, as I knew that the side effects of antidepressants take a while to settle. However, it got worse. My co-worker told me to stop taking them as I was freaking her out. I didn't sleep for four days. And didn't feel tired. But I started feeling sick. And dizzy. My jaw was aching as it never relaxed. The pupil dilation settled but my vision didn't. My arms and legs kept twitching. I felt like I had the time I overdid the Ecstacy (serotonin toxicity). I looked in the Side Effects pamphlet and on MIMS, and I had side effects that weren't published. And there were reports on the internet that people had become addicted. I didn't want to have to go through withdrawals from this stuff if this was what it was like to get acclimatised to it.",
      "A fellow my boyfriend works with who enjoys taking drugs volunteered to take one to see what happened to him. He abstained for three or four days prior to taking it. He said it was like being on Speed, except that it doesn't wear off. The effects lasted 18hrs on him, and by the end of it even he wanted out. I promptly returned the packet to the doctor and opted out of the antidepressant idea to treat depression.",
      "I am now on Aropax again, and getting Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. I've never been frightened for my safety, even when taking Ecstacy (because that was a choice) but I couldn't control what was happening to me. Effexor frightened me and I refused to take it. Though it may find a place on the party drug circuit."

One hour later I am in heaven!",

      "Was about to go out with some friends to a club this weekend. We were in the parking lot of the club. My friend had a bottle of G and he knew I have taken it plenty of times. I thought I was big and bad and had built a big tolerance. I took two huge swigs. So we are walking up to the front of the club. I feel so good and horny. My hands got tingly feelings. I drank water inside the club. I was dancing for like 15 minutes, it was probably the best feeling I've had in my entire life. Then after those 15 minutes it was haywire. I had to go take a shit. I was shitting for like 15 minutes. When I came out I could not walk straight. My friend took me out of the club to the car. I puked on the way to the car. I passed out for about an hour and a half. I woke up, I found it pretty hard to breathe and I do not know why , but it was so hard to swallow. I puked more, and my friends told me I was beating the shit outta my chest in my sleep. This was Friday, today is Sunday and I feel awkward and confused.  This was the worst experience ever.  I found out after it happened my friend got the bottle from a different source than the usual, I was pretty mad.  Its all about buying the same stuff all the time, so I know exactly how much to take."

      "I'm a guy who likes opioids, really really likes them. Unfortunately, they're quite expensive as well as chemically addictive. I have had tons of experience with drugs, LSD, Datura, Mushrooms, MDMA, Opium, Heroin, DXM, etc... I found out about the effects of Kratom recently and decided to order ten grams from a reputable online store. In a couple of days the package arrived. It was labeled as 'Super Premium - Thai Kratom Leaves'. I proceeded to make a tea with 5 grams and a quid to chew on and swallow with the other 5 grams.",
      "Preparation",
      "-----------",
      "Quid",
      "----",
      "I stuck the shredded leaves into my mouth and chewed on them for about two minutes, I then swallowed the quid.",
      "Tea",
      "---",
      "I stuck the other 5g of leaves in a glass of water and boiled it in the microwave. After taking it out I let it steep for about ten minutes, and poured the liquid into a large mug through a strainer which collected all of the solid matter. I then put the solid matter back into the glass and boiled it in the microwave again. After it came out of the microwave I let it steep for another ten minutes and then poured it through a strainer into the mug and stirred while adding lots of sugar and honey. I ingested about half of the solid matter that the strainer collected and threw away the rest.",
      "I proceeded to drink the very bitter tea I made while eating some rice, shrimp, and bread. After I finished my meal I could already feel the effects coming on.",
      "Experience",
      "----------",
      "I became very talkative with my parents and had a slight buzz, a minor throbbing in my temples and a slight warm feeling throughout my body were noticed. After talking and laughing with them for a few minutes I went into my room and put on some trance music. This is when I felt the surge of euphoria coming on. It felt almost exactly like a 30-40mg dosage of hydrocodone bitartrate (vicodin). I was warm, happy, and horny (different from vico which makes me unable to get up). I felt like there was not a problem in the world and didn't worry about anything. Over the course of three hours this euphoria and warmth continued to increase slowly. I then became just slightly nauseous. Sitting still and not thinking about the minor nausea made it go away entirely.",
      "Come Down",
      "---------",
      "The euphoria finally reached a plateau four hours after ingestion. Five hours after ingestion I felt waves of strong euphoria coming over me with a slight bit of nausea (not bad at all) every thirty seconds or so. Each wave was like a mild orgasm surging through every part of my body. This persisted for a few more hours and I became slightly numb and tired so I went to sleep.",
      "Conclusion",
      "----------",
      "Kratom was MUCH more powerful than I thought it would be. I didn't expect the feeling to be so similar to opioid agonists, but it was nearly identical (it just lasted longer). It was a warm, fuzzy, euphoric, memorable experiment which I hope to replicate in the near future. I can sense that Kratom is habit-forming and urge anyone doing it to be CAREFUL! I wouldn't use Kratom more than once a week at most... it just feels too great for something legal and easily-obtainable... a true surprise!"

      "Nitrous aka Bulbs or Bulbing brought me closer to understanding myself. I havn't done anything for years, the last time was when I was under a light dose of Nitrous Oxide for the removal of wisdom teeth, which is not very close to 'the real thing'.",
      "Nitrous worked best after a coming down from ecstacy or similar indulgences as the body and mind are still altered, trying to clean the body from these toxins. With more experience with nitrous I was able to improve my experiences and learn. With first bulbing experiences had audio and visual distortions where music would seem to slow down and sound as though I was hearing them inside a rubber bubble, It kind of reminds me of a squash court where there is sometimes a strange echo when the ball bounces off the walls, this echo is applied to music and the music sounds like it is expanding with a phaser like effect.",
      "I become conscious of my breathing and closing my eyes allows me to have better visual hallucinations. With open eyes it is a little disorienting. Depending on dosage, bulbing became a journey for me, always starting with auditory distortion and then visual distortion where I would have some crazy fractal... this then gives way to a brighter light where I might be flying over a field or a mountain and then the next and most interesting step is 'The Question'.",
      "'The Question' is part of the hallucination, similar to LSD, but in a more euphoric state of mind I start asking questions and thinking, sometimes it was mathematical. In this stage the aim was to go further and to get the answers to the questions before the rush ended.  I always felt that each time I bulbed I would come one step closer to getting the answer to my question... or go one step further in my journey. The problem is that rebreathing/hyperventilating on the one balloon means that you are not getting oxygen and will suffocate so as I was hallucinating I was always asking myself, is it time to stop. Sometimes a friend would tell me to breath when they thought that I had been hyperventilating on the balloon too long.",
      "With subsequent bulbing the journey and The Questions took on a really interesting approach, as I was hallucinating I was always trying to go further on my journey which I felt was to understand the meaning of life. Then the journey started taking a very moral approach meaning that I was asking question about what I was doing (ie bulbing/drugs) and is it correct. In the end inside the hallucinatary state I was asking myself, do I want to stay in this world and or do I want to stop and live my normal life. If I stay I want to stay in this world, the drug abuse will lead to my death in the real world. This is extremely interesting as I am not or was not suicidal at all and was more a weekend recreational drug user, but I felt that through my journeys with bulbs I was actually slowly making a decision that drugs were not the right choice for me. I felt that I didn't have the ultimate answer to 'The Question' as I did not come to the end of my journey, however in restrospect my decision to stop the journey (stop using drugs) was actually an answer to 'The Question' I posed in my hullucinatory state.",
      "I also felt that bulbing also had a connection with other drug experiences such as LSD or pot. With some intense LSD trips I had the experience of being in space and meeting one of the beings who was responsible for the control of the universe (For the visuals, just imagine the film Lawnmower man where they are in the 3D world where the Lawnmower man has to get the correct password but keeps on getting 'access denied'). This type of experience amounts to looking back at yourself and asking the question, 'Why am I here'.",
      "After a bulbing session, I was tired and had the feeling of being drained for about a day. When bulbing I had maximum 12 bulbs (normally one at a time, sometimes two bulbs in an extra large balloon... but only 1 balloon at a time). I bulbed maximum once a week  and after about 1 year 'gave up' after coming to my realisation.",
      "As a closing note, be safe, do it with friends... read as much literature as you can and don't forget to breath."

      "It was 10:15pm. I was sitting in the basement of my friend's (J) house. I have used 2C-T-7 several times before this. I pulled out the little baggie containing 20mg of 2C-T-7 and was going to split it with J. We cut it into 2 lines and snorted it.  The first 20 minutes were extremely PAINFUL as always with 2C-T-7 My eyes began watering and my nose felt like it had been dowsed with gasoline and set on fire.... I looked up at the poster on the wall. It began to move. The edges of the poster began curling inwards and gently swaying from side to side. The visuals off 2C-T-7 are absolutely incredible. We decided to step out of the basement onto his back porch. As soon as I stepped outside, I felt a very different vibe. The energy released from the earth and plants around all seemed to be flowing and I could feel it all around me. I glanced up at the sky and the stars were all moving....It seemed as if they were giant strobe lights in the sky, searching for something (or someone) down on earth.  I have no idea as to how much time I spent staring at the stars. Next, I recall, I was talking to J and we somehow got totally confused as to what the conversation actually started out as. J began laughing and had an uncontrollable fit of laughter. I was still seeing very prominent hallucinations and looked down at my watch. It was 1:00AM. We smoked some high quality pot and J told me that he was having the greatest hallucinations that he had ever seen!",
      "We ended up going to bed after watching the sunrise at 8:00AM.",
      "This was one of my most enjoyable 2C-T-7 experiences as I felt as if I was one with nature and all the materialistic things in this world totally disappeared."

    "report": [
      "I have had pretty good experience with mind drugs. The usual ones I did were pot, xtc and lsd. I smoked pot for years, done xtc and lsd multiple times, but I have learned that salvia is on another level. On salvia, I have talked with spirits or Gods of a sort, or maybe just God, but I cant really tell. At first I thought maybe it was just all in my mind, but the further I went, the more I was convinced something was behind this drug or more than meets the eye..",
      "So out of my multiple experiences with Salvia, which is at least 10-20 times smoking it, I will give you the ones that stand out the most. I mainly use x10, though I have tried to get x20 but the smoke shop dealer I live by sells it for an outrageous amount, 40 bucks a gram, and when I am willing, he doesnt have it. So I say ok to the x10, which is standardized.",
      "Ok Here is one smoke session. I smoke alone, cause no one I know is in to smoking Salvia. I set up my Roor bong, its 18 inch so I get big hits. I pack the bowls pretty big, so when I cherry it up, I get a good milk and a huge rip. Now, because I have had numerous experiences with the feelings of Salvia, I will explain how they at least work for me in a session.",
      "I smoke a big bowl and a few seconds I begin to feel a tug at my physical shell. It sometimes rips away at my face, but if I concentrate or close my eyes I can control it to an extent so that I dont really notice it anymore. 15 seconds later, I begin to Hear voices. Typically at first they are people I know or I think I know and they tell me certain things to do, like take off my jacket, or lay down or close my eyes. I sometimes think maybe its just me, but I hear a voice which isnt mine. Im not schizophrenic, because I never hear voices when I'm off the drug or maybe the drug makes me schizo for a few minutes. Anyways, it goes away typically once Im in just like boxers or something. Sounds hilarious I know, but I feel more free and since I'm in a room I feel a little trapped so that lack of clothing and being in my natural state, I feel more connected to the universe.",
      "The voices usually cease, and I come back to have semi-lucid thinking. I remember my name. It's Ryan. I say my full name a few times, and sometimes laugh a little about it, but then I call out for Salvia. She talks to me sometimes. She usually says that if I want to be more experienced with her, I need to smoke more! Sounds crazy right? So I pack another huge bowl, maybe 3-4 minutes into the trip, and I hold it in for a while. By now, the physical sensation of being ripped apart is gone. Now its all mental. Now the visuals get more fun at this level. Things morph into one another and I get a feeling of being disconnected from everything happening thats external.",
      "Now after the second bowl I lose my concept of time. So I smoke some more bowls because I have this feeling that there is more of a level to reach. This is why I want x20. So as I begin to smoke more, I let the visuals take me away. What I have noticed from other drugs, which has also made me notice it when I'm sober, is that there is this flow of energy or vibrations that I can physically see with my eyes. If I stare at something enough I can see these white lines making a waving motion. At night they are black lines. Anyways, why they are relevant with my trip on Salvia, is that sometimes these vibrations and little white or blue lights, sometimes form images or shapes. I watched the line form a semi square and while I was on this trip, about 4 bowls in, I see what appears to be a face, made of white lines, but it disappears.",
      "Now I had my Kundalini awoken for the first time on an acid trip, but I find that on Salvia, it is much stronger! I can feel mad vibrations throughout my body, which lifts the hair on my skin for 30 seconds to a minute depending on concentration. I can sometimes pulsate these vibrations throughout my spine into my arms and legs. It is a feeling I couldnt imagine until I felt it myself. Now sometimes I become Cosmic conscious while on Salvia, but that kind of mind expanding I leave up to LSD. But there is one thing I have conceived on my mind a few times while really tripped on Salvia, and that is, maybe more than metaphorically, but actually literally, we are GODS. We have free will and conscious, which is a huge anomaly when it comes to a specie that has evolved on our planet. Regardless, I have seen shit from other perspectives, rather than the normality, and sometimes I see my self from a third person view that this physical shell is that of just another God having a physical journey is a universe to learn.",
      "When I'm peaked or coming down, is when I can sometimes get a conscious connection to inanimate objects. This has sometimes lead me to an idea that maybe again its in my head, as I am skeptical by nature. But then I think about how little I know, and I know this because drugs have truly woken me up to how unintelligent we are compared to the universal conscious, though that breaks down the ego.",
      "Back to Salvia trips I have had.",
      "Another occasion: Last Week.",
      "I smoked two big bowls within 20 seconds, and I completely lost my ego and most my conscious thoughts. I find that if I lay on my bed, I feel more tired and less a thinker. It seems like other people are controlling me. Sometimes I lose my identity so far deep, that I have to ask my self who I am, until I remember my name, but then it sometimes slips away just as fast. I dont find a trip like this that enjoyable, because I feel that I havent passed the physical feelings of Salvia and I'm being ripped apart. When I remember that I smoked Salvia, the feelings of being tugged at by some gravity usually go away. Physical Sensation on Salvia Is heightened.",
      "What I am learning is that once I become stronger mentally while on Salvia, the physical sensations can come to my control. I find that sometimes I get very tired on Saliva, but that might have to do with lack of sleep sometimes. I find that I have already reached levels 4 and 5 and one time 6, just alone on my multiple sessions. I have had some sessions where I do visualize my room or wherever I am as being alien, and that my body and mind are in another dimension but I can get the same feelings and ideas on LSD or Shrooms and these are pretty normal conceptions on Hallucinogens.",
      "I have found that pipe hits are really nothing compared to a big bowl hit in a bong(water-pipe). I have smoked salvia out of my pipe a few occasions and I only have reached levels 2-3 at high. I mainly get physical trips out of those more than mental trips.",
      "My personal philosophy after all my trips is that we are in a world that hardly anyone(identities) in the physical shell has truly found out what is really going on. The more I do things like this, the more I see signs in my average life. Gut feelings, or warning, ecetera. The more I do Salvia, the more I connect with the universe and its conscious. I used to consider things like that we are in a real GAME, literally and not metaphorically, or symbolically like it is said over and over, by people like Timothy leary. I thought it was like God created a universe, like turning on a screen and time flew past in billions of years, then he put in all his Codes and inputs  behind the Scene, which are laws to the universe and Intelligence or DNA. My way of thinking of this was that it was like a creator or a video game like The Sims and Civilization mixed into one. Could be true in an alternative view."

      "I recently began using St. John's Wort and Gingko Biloba to help with anxiety and depression. In my past I used ALOT of ecstasy, and recently quit at the end of summer last year. I was noticing that I was depressed quite a bit and would have anxiety attacks. I really didn't want to even start down the prescription anti-depressants route, since once you start it's very hard to stop.",
      "I read some experience reports about St. John's Wort being an antidepressant and axiolytic, so I decided to give it a try. After about a month of use with minimal success I switched to a different brand which also contained Gingko Biloba extract. I'd heard of Gingko before but never read anything about it. I've been using this St. John's Wort and Gingko combination for about 4 months now, and I actually feel alot better. All anxiety is gone and I feel much healthier mentally. I take 3 400mg capsules every morning, and I feel great the whole day. It's not a buzz per-se, but just very clear-headed feeling, all thoughts are in order, bit of euphoric/stimulant effect. Especially goes great with coffee. I would recommend this especially for anyone who has used alot of ecstasy and is feeling down all the time. Definately a substitute for some of the precription solutions out there (ie. Prozac, Zoloft)I just wanted to share this information with everyone since I've had great success with it. Thanx"

      "Im not a serious drug user.  I hate alcohol and love pot, but dont smoke it more than once or twice a month.  I never want to get burned out and always approach drugs with the utmost respect and appreciation.  About a year and a half ago I almost got my hands on some LSD, but came up short.  I was disappointed as one knowledgeable friend described a trip where his disembodied alter ego had put his arm around his actual self and began talking.  This seemed too much to be true for my ever rational intellect, but I was intensely curious. A true psychedelic trip to whatever alternate realities that may exist is something I had craved since high school when I first started reading about them. So when my brother told me he had got some good acid from a friend, I perked up immediately. ",
      "Being somewhat afraid, as I usually am before trying a new drug, I wanted to let him try it first and when he came back all he could utter was an exasperated these are awesome...lots... of energy.  So I set a date, my 22nd birthday, to try them.  My brother told me he had taken 2 hits and said it was just about right, but I wanted to make sure that it hit me fully and really ramp up the experience.  I took 3.  In about thirty minutes, I started to feel subtle waves of energy flow through me.  An increase of energy made me feel as if I was hovering slightly above the ground.  I felt taller and stronger.  My visual field became hazier and more blurry, like everything was just slightly out of focus.  I felt an overwhelming wanderlust come over me so I decided to head to the local arboretum and enjoy myself.  I went off the beaten path and explored the interior of the forest.  Various sights attracted my attention.  Majestic and massive oaks and hickories put me in a seemingly fantasy world where I played but a small and insignificant part.  I just stared and stared at complex spider webs that blew my mind.  Being a biology major, Ive always been interested in nature and its secrets, but before this day I never really looked at one in this way before.  How could this simple invertebrate make something so intricate and beautiful and deadly?",
      "I had thought from previous discussions about the drug that I might lose touch with reality or in some way have a bad trip, but it was nothing of the sort.  Reality was intensified, and instead of feeling fear, I felt an overwhelming love and appreciation for everything around me.  In that sense it was similar to MDMA.  I also felt a slight giddiness and would burst out with joyous laughter at different times for no apparent reason.  Nothing frightened me.  Insects that before would provoke a quick reaction from landing on me didnt.  I just observed their details and gently pushed them off.  I encountered a dog that was barking, but just blocked it out.  So many thoughts flowed through me, but I didnt get bogged down in any of them.  If I didnt like what I was thinking or feeling, I could alter it at will.",
      "I found a lake and just lied down by it for an hour just taking in the surroundings.  It was so intense and delicious, like high quality fudge or ice cream, that must be sampled in small bits and pieces because of its richness, that I had to steel my mind momentarily from the stimuli. All worries about life, college, and women that had been building for months just evaporated from my consciousness.  I saw tracers and various alterations of light.  At one point, I thought something was crawling under my skin and at that moment could sympathize with people who tweaked out and thought these things were real.  But as before I just changed my feelings at will.  It didnt bother me. I felt like a kid again before everything got so complex.",
      "After about three hours the main effects began to subside, but nevertheless the longevity of the experience, close to eight hours in total, pleasantly surprised me.  The come down was essentially a feather fall over 4 hours in a book store with just a touch of physical and mental fatigue.  This was the most intense experience of my life up to that point.  The drug gave me the profound and  mystical experience that I had been craving for so long. LSD was everything I had hoped it would be."

      "I bought a 1/2 liter bottle in London and managed to get it home.  I had been reading about absinthe for a long time and I was really excited to finally try some.  I mixed it the 'traditional' way with the water poured over the sugar cubes and then I added a little extra sugar because I thought it tasted better that way.  It helps a lot if you like the flavor of licorice.  It took me about an hour to go through the bottle.  This stuff was 150 proof and after an hour I just felt mellowly drunk.  (Three hours later I decided the alcohol had caught up with me and I was pretty toasty.)  I could speak just fine, walk straight (mostly), and carry on all the normal human functions. ",
      "The hallucinogenic effects that I had been hoping for weren't really there.  Lights looked really hazy, like they do through a windshield in the rain, and my short-term memory was pretty bad.  I actually dropped my friend off at his house and then couldn't figure out why he wasn't in the car.  Anyhow, driving was perfectly normal, except for the lights thing, and I had a really good experience.  I highly recommend trying this if you can get the real stuff.  I havn't tried any homemade, but I'm planning on making a batch just because the real stuff was so good."

    "report": [
      "I had just gotten back from a 5 day cruise where I was completely sober the entire time. I had tried to get alcohol from several people, but no one was very helpful. Once we made it to St. Martin, I figured I'd at least be able to buy some weed and maybe even a cool looking bowl if I was lucky. Imagine my frustration when I was unable to find anything. On the ferry ride home, my mom told me she had been offered free weed by people in the one store I hadn't gone in. I had swamp ass from walking in the sun that whole time and I was pissed. I spent the rest of the cruise in the room feeling sorry for my self and watching Dick and Jane in several different languages.",
      "This frustration carried over when I arrived at home. The next day I had school, so I decided I'd do something fun. My friend didn't really have anything with her, but she offered me some Ambien. Now, I had tried Ambien before and it didn't really end well. At any other time, I would have declined and looked for something better to do, but I had just gotten off that cruise and I wanted to be fucked up then and there. Needless to say, I accepted.",
      "When I got the Ambien, I made a bee line to the bathroom. I pulled out the prescription out and got my first glimpse of the end of my life as I knew it. Inside were 8 small, round, blue, tablets containing Ambien in its controlled release form. The last time, I had taken 3 and that was the regular form, so I figured 2 was a safe start. I pulled out my water bottle and downed two.",
      "The bell rang for first period so off I went. The funny thing about me and Ambien is that I have no clue when it kicks in or exactly how altered my state is. After first period, I was kind of annoyed. I wasn't feeling anything (or so I thought), so I went to the bathroom and took another pill.",
      "Second period was pretty cool. I felt a definite change in my demeanor. I was extremely laid back, not caring whether I played bad or not. I also felt happy. I was making great jokes. All the band nerds worshiped me. I should have stopped there. Instead, I went in the bathroom and took another pill. As much as I knew better, more drugs meant more fun at the time. Something in my mind told me to toss out the prescription bottle and to put the pills in my pocket. Perhaps I knew what was to come.",
      "In case you weren't counting, this was pill number 4 for me. In my head, this seemed like a perfectly fine number, nothing to brag about, but nothing to turn your nose up to either. Wrong! I can't remember much of third period, but from what I heard from friends afterward it basically consisted of me grinning, waving my arms around, telling people to shut the fuck up and claiming I knew far more Spanish than they did. I do remember a notable change in my physical state. I had begun sweating. I'm a big guy, so sweating for no good reason isn't exactly foreign to me, but this wasn't a little sweat on my brow, this was full blown football game sweat. I looked and felt disgusting and I could feel my self beginning to black out.",
      "I was worried, really worried. As much as I felt like nothing mattered I knew I had taken too much and I had about a 20% chance of getting caught. I don't remember the bell ringing, I don't remember getting up, and I certainly don't remember walking across the school to the bathroom right next to my 4th period class. However, I do remember standing in the bathroom with the remaining 4 pills in one hand and my water bottle in the other. My mind was all cloudy and by my calculations, I now had zero chance of not getting caught. I now had a choice. I could throw the pills in the trash and hope everyone in the school just ignored the 6'3' 350 lb kid drooling on himself, or I could take the rest and go out in style. I took the rest, but I didn't go out in style. I blacked out.",
      "The remainder of this story is based on first hand accounts from my friends and the reports the teachers and administrators wrote. My fiend (the one who gave me the Ambien) was in my fourth period. She said as soon as I came in she knew something had gone horribly, horribly wrong. I was sweating profusely and stumbling all over my self. She walked over to me and quickly led me to my seat before the teacher came in.",
      "She asked me how many I had taken and I said 'all of them' with a goddamn grin on my face. How big of an ass am I? I can only imagine how she felt at that moment. She did everything she could to keep me out of trouble, but I kept cursing at the teacher and right before lunch, the teacher called the deans and told them they needed to pick up a student. The bell for lunch rang. I yelled out, 'Saved by the bell! got up (with my friends assistance), and stumbled out of the classroom for lunch.",
      "This is the part I'm glad I don't remember. I guess I made it all the way down the hallway and to the stairs. Lunch meant I had to go down stairs, so down stairs I went. I did it in a rather unique way, though. Two steps down and I lost my balance. The rest of my trip down consisted of a role akin to a scene from Indiana Jones. Kids jumped out of the way as they saw me coming. I'm just glad I didn't seriously hurt anyone. Well, that's not true, I did seriously hurt my self. I must have landed directly on my knees or something because they were all fucked up when I woke up. I guess after I landed, I pissed my self. Imagine that. A huge kid sporting a 'got crabs' shirt, covered in sweat just rolled down the stairs, landed, and pissed him self. I'm just going to let that scene play out in your mind for a bit.",
      "This naturally caused a commotion (noted in one of the dean's reports), and they were on the way. Somehow, my friend managed to help me up and bring me to some bench. (I know, she's a real trooper) I'm not easily hidden even in the mob that is today's high school, so I was spotted by the administrators rather quickly.",
      "They took me into some office and began questioning me. I told them everything that happened save my friends name. They kept asking me where I got the drugs and I gave them a multitude of answers including finding them on the very boat that caused this madness. They kept asking me questions until one noticed my eyes rolling into the back of my head and called an ambulance fearing for my health. I was literally rolled out of school on a gurney in the middle of lunch. You can imagine my embarrassment!",
      "In the hospital, I met my mom and had a catheter inserted into my penis. I don't know if any of you have ever had this done, but let me tell you, it sucks. Thank god I don't remember the actual insertion of it. In fact, the next thing I remember after my black out is waking up in the hospital with my arms restrained and the worst feeling in the world in my dick. In my Ambien addled brain I thought I had fallen on top of a knife and that knife had gone right up my dick. I began pulling and straining at it until I pulled the bag off and my piss spilled out all over the bed. This was definitely the most embarrassing experience of my life. They didnt seem to mind me much though because they decided to keep me over night for observation.",
      "I guess there was a bit of confusion about where to keep me once they were sure I wasnt in any real danger. I was brought to this hospital because of my size, but my age made it clear that I should be transferred to Arnold Palmer. They had me roll over onto a gurney. I was able to do this much, but I ended up lying on my stomach with my ass sticking up in the air. There was no back to this particular gown, so the nurses were left with quite a view.",
      "Anyway, they eventually got me lying upright and into an ambulance. On the ride over, the some bitch kept telling me I had to watch my language when I got to the new hospital. She told me it was full of kids and my type of language would not cut it. I replied with something like, Well shit I guess Ill have to talk more like this. She informed me that I had just cursed again. I replied, Wow, I guess Im more fucked up than I thought I was. She kind of laughed nervously and didnt say much for the rest of the ride.",
      "When I arrived at the hospital I was wheeled into an elevator. It was a short ride, but that didnt stop me from making small talk. Hey! I exclaimed. The Male nurse that was riding up the elevator with me glanced in my direction, rolled his eyes, and then looked away. Naturally, I took this as an invitation to continue the exchange. Long shift, I asked. The guy sighed and muttered something like, yeah, now just be quiet.",
      "It was at this point that the elevator doors opened. I guess we had made it to our destination. My new friend wheeled me to the room Id be staying in and told me to be quiet because the babies were sleeping. Then he walked away.",
      "A few minutes later, an amazingly stunning nurse came up and checked my vitals. I didnt say much to her, but I wasnt exactly shy. I kind of jus stared at her ass and drooled. Anyway, she left and a doctor and a couple more nurses came back. They were whispering which, of course, pissed me off. It wasnt that I cared about what they were saying (they were asking me about how I felt, what I took, what Ive taken in the past, how often Ive taken it, why did I take it, etc). I didnt. I just didnt care for the constant hissing. My solution to this was to speak as loud as possible. I figured if I raised my voice, theyd subconsciously raise theirs. This didnt work and it took a while for them to calm me down. Eventually, they left and I was able to get some much needed shut eye. After all, this had been a long day.",
      "I woke up the next day around 5 am thinking Id be able to go home soon. Oh how wrong I was. I had to be cleared first which took forever. I guess doctors are busy people. Go figure. Anyway, I spent the day watching all these gorgeous nurses hitting on kids barely 3 years old. I just kept thinking, What the hell is this shit?! My cock has to be at least twice the size of that kids. They were all fawning over some black kid who was missing the bottom half of his jaw. Theyd ask him if who was his girlfriend and hed point to a different girl every time. The kid could have at least left me the fatty, but no. He had to make her his wife. What a dick",
      "After 6 or so hours of this shit, some shrink visited me. She asked me a ton of questions about whether I was depressed and if I had thoughts of suicides. By the time she was done, I was aggravated again. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and here was some lady trying to find problems where there werent any.",
      "Eventually, I was cleared to be released. I called my mom and had her come pick me up. The ride home was kind of awkward. What exactly are you supposed to say in that situation? I didnt know, so I just didnt say anything.",
      "About two weeks later, I had a meeting with my school to see if I would be expelled or not. It came down to whether or not I was going to give up the girl who gave me the Ambiens name or not. I wouldnt, so I got expelled."

There are many different 'racetams' out there but this one seemed to be the safest and affected most people that tried it.

Being more on top of things and having less procrastination seems to be a benefit as well. Anxiety is a thing of the past. I feel like I have the patience of a tibetan monk now.",

I've had experience with some opiods in the past, such as Hydrocodone and Oxycontin but for the most part i would not call myself experienced with these types of pills. After reading several experiences on this website and others (I never take anything for the first time if I have not researched thoroughly), I was actually quite nervous about taking this pill. Many people had reported vomiting and illness lasting for several hours. I decided on splitting the pill with a friend.",
      "5:30pm we each took half of the 40 mg waffer. An hour and a half went by without feeling any real effects of the pill which i had read was normal since methadone is slowly released over a long period of time and takes longer to 'kick in'.",
      "8:00pm First real wave of euphoria and effects similar to what i'd experienced with Oxycontin in the past. Dry mouth, a little sick to my stomach, but a general feeling of well being.",
      "9:00pm Effects begin to escalate and nausea beings to deminish. I felt good. Really good. I felt like if i sat in the same place for the rest of my life i could be completely content.",
      "12:00am Effects seem to peak. I was feeling a little overwhelmed and very thirsty. Minor urge to vomit but nothing i hadn't experienced with any other opiod i'd ever taken.",
      "3:00am A little itchy. Still buzzing strong, but unable to sleep. Things start feeling very heavy, pulse rate is slowing and breathing is noticeably shallow but wasn't anything i was worried about.",
      "7:00am Effects start to wear off and breakfast is good. No morning nausea like i'd experienced with other opiods.",
      "All in all i'd say it was a good experience. The danger of overdosing on Methadone is high so if you are going to take any be sure to go slow and be safe. If you like other opiods recreationally you will probably like this pill. My friend and I had a blast, neither suffered from any vomiting or intense upset stomach. Each person is effected by drugs differently so things may not be the same for you. Peace."

Im sure running would achieve the same result. ",

I was determined to see the masturbation through but I needed to pee so bad so I decided to pee then continue.  As I went to the toilet I felt quite heavy and decided to sit down and do it.

I thought it was a real insect as I get really skinny wiry spiders in my house so I didnt really think much of it other that how cheeky it was to be there.  as I watched it it had really thin spindly legs that were moving in what I could only describe as a mocking way and I thought to myself 'is this even real or is it this weird drug kicking in' so I pulled on the bog roll below not wanting to touch it in case it was real and it stayed in the same spot no matter how many times I pulled.  at this point I knew it was a hallucination but it looked so real.",
      "I was a little anxious and thought what can it do to me??? I then argued mentally within to come to the answer 'absolutely nothing' but then I sneaked one in on myself 'provided it is in fact a hallucination' what if its not? I didnt like the paranoia about whether it was real or not so I decided to grab it. It of course wasnt there and when I realised that I relaxed a bit and began seeing more of these weird fuckers all over the walls.  I returned to my room and as I didnt feel particularly spaced out I continued my masturbation to its end.  During this I would get side tracked.  for example I would see a third dimension in my laptop screen and have to touch it to make sure it wasnt real. ",
      "Also I noticed weird light patterns on the wall that I thought were reflections and id touch them to see if the reflection lit up the back of my hand.  at one point as I had my hand on the wall I took it away and saw the most amazing thing that was straight out of the movies. it was my own hand but like a watery shiny transparent one that came out of me. like when you see ghosts in films. I liked that and wanted to elaborate on it in my mind but hen I noticed the wall paper.  I thought to myself, I never noticed that there was a pattern under the paint before.  I believed that I had not noticed and that the drug had simply made me look close enough to see it. I touched the wall and could even feel the pattern, a kind of diamond like repeated shape.  I was so convinced and amazed that I hadnt noticed before that I went around checking other walls and it was there on all of them.  At that point again I argued with myself.  I thought theres no way I wouldnt have noticed this pattern so it must be a hallucination but even once I accepted that it wasnt real the pattern was still there so I changed my mind and decided it was real after all and I had just missed it. ",
      "At one point I closed my eyes and still could see the scene in front of me as if they were open and I assumed that this was because the scene had burnt itself in to my eyes but when I moved my head the scene didnt move with it, instead the rest of the room unfolded as if I were actually looking out through my eyelids.  Very weird stuff.  I noticed sometime during the trip that I could see a red 3d wireframe poppy glowing really vividly if I closed my eyes but it was boring and having read about thinking of things and them appearing I thought id give it a go.  It didnt work. ",
      "The only other thing that I actually noticed was that later in between the patterns on the wall I could make out lettering, as if the pattern was designed to spell stuff out if you looked the right way. I saw my name and then I started to think of the film the number 23 and I thought bad idea. I cant really remember much else of significance to be honest except that I had to pee a lot and I felt really really heavy.  my legs got the jumps and I felt anxious quite often for no real reason. today I have felt like shit all day and every time I have an sms on my phone and it vibrates I feel anxious and nervous about it.",
      "I dont mind feeling like shit but dont know how much is still in me since I do feel even now a little drowsy like codeine makes me feel.  I think Im gonna go down stairs and neck 12 of these fuckers and take a day off work tomorrow because I believe that my skepticism and reluctance to believe coupled with the apprehension of doing something new made it less of a trip than it would have been had I embraced it."

      "All right, back for round 2. Last time my 185mg oral dose I reported on left me wondering if the dose could be cut in half with insufflation. Intrepid explorer as always.. I carefully weighed out 100mg (not that I think it was too important with MBDB.. the divide-and-conquer method would be fine with this material). Raked into one whopper of a line about 6' long.",
      "Background: quiet house. Peaceful mindframe after a long and harrowing week, happy to be relaxing and to have the perfect tool to do it with. Al Green songs playing at about 85% speed on Siren jukebox (slowing down already slow music is perfect for this, lemmitellya). Movies rented in anticipation of the calm and sedated lethargy. Learned my lesson from last time: rented only movies that would tickle me: Blow, Snatch, and Revelation (a silly apocalyptic movie).",
      "Couldn't really find any information on this route of ingestion, so I was a bit nervous about the burn/drip and how strong it might be going this route, as I could only find one person who even discussed taking it this way (and anecdotal evidence is not exactly convincing). Still, I felt the safety margin was enough to work with. The potential for burn/drip was my main concern.",
      "But damn, that was a pretty big line for something I couldn't much find information on... So.. in the name of science..",
      "Toot toot! First ~50mg of the line had a rendezvous with my right nostril. Burn barely present.. drip nothing suprising. Reminded me sort of speed, sort of coke, sort of roll.. hell really just reminded me of tooting powders up my nose. Nothing major here. So I let it settle and begin to drip, and I let the left nostril conquer the other ~50mg.",
      "Shit! Spoke too soon! Ouch! Not really too intense but MUCH worse than the right nostril, perhaps I was a bit congested? Ah well.. not bad enough to deter me from this route of ingestion.. there are much worse things a fella can toot.",
      "5 minutes later.. the tide breaks, and waves of calm crash and ripple over my body. Sweetly I surrender to the sensation. Much better than that hour and a half shit when I did it orally (then again, I did eat too much beforehand. I laid off the food this time, even though I was snorting). Al Green has never sounded so relaxing. I sink peacefully into a nearby cot, relaxing my body entirely and completely.",
      "I notice, this time, there is tactile stimulation. However, it's none of that 'blowing up' tingliness. It just feels exceedingly good and relaxing to stroke my body very slowly with the tips of my fingertips. It doesn't stimulate me.. it relaxes me infinitely.",
      "I do notice a few shivers when I toss my head back and try to get all the material flowing, but aside from that it's a very sedate evening. Comparison to rolls, I feel, are unwarranted. This is pure relaxation. The feeling is enchanting, but I have really no desire to do anything. Laying on the cot with my fingertips trickling up my thighs and belly feels absolutely divine. My face and neck feel very nice also. But I wouldn't want any of the aggressive massaging that feels so nice on related chems. This is a soft, cuddly, stroke-me chemical. I also feel that there's no release of emotion with MBDB. I feel totally reserved and totally at peace. No outpouring or empathy. (Note: although I was alone and that could have affected this, my last experience was with someone and the same effect was noted)",
      "No discernable 'peak.' Feelings pretty much plateau and stay as described for about 2 1/2 hours. A supplement would have helped, but I was tired from the week and felt perfectly fine letting the experience fade, leaving me content as if I had just witnessed a beautiful sunset. You do not ask the sun to come back out and play. I drifted off to sleep, still feeling wonderful in my bed but obviously down. Slept soundly. Woke with no problems (although I did wake later than usual).",
      "Merits of insufflation: Naturally quicker, doesn't 'creep up on you.'",
      "Is it cheaper? I'd have to say NO! It took half the material, but experience seemed to last half as long. Although I'd certainly be more inclined to insufflate it next time, I'll probably toot a bit and eat a bit, to give it more leg. Either way, MBDB is just not potent enough to bring the dosage down much.",
      "Nevertheless, 100mg was very pleasant up the snout."

The fact that I have no future, no friends and absolutely no one that gives a shit.",

      "This was my first time with LSA, and also I'd only smoked weed twice in the last two weeks prior after being accustomed to smoking almost every day since the previous summer (this was in March).",
      "It was a Saturday, one of the first days of the year that it was actually nice outside, and I had no obligations. A couple of my friends had been telling me about their recent LSA experiences and I'd been itching to try it. Today was the perfect day me thought. Me and two friends got started pretty early (one tripping with me and one driving). We ate 4 packets of morning glory seeds around 11am and we were both feeling nauseous within half an hour. I noticed my legs felt weird when I tried to walk (I'd been sitting in the car for a while). As the nausea passed, things were starting to feel weirder.",
      "The guy I was tripping with was describing how he felt and I agreed with everything he said. By 1 we'd acquired some herb, and then we met up with some more people to smoke. It wasn't until I started smoking that I started tripping hardcore. The more I smoked the weirder it got. We left to go buy a blunt at some point and I could not function around people at all. It was like everything I said or did was wrong, even though a sober friend said I was fine. I felt so much better once I was back with my friends. This is around when time started blurring together. As I was still coming up I felt like I was on salvia, and I think I would have preferred to stay on that level for a while. But I was still smoking pot and the trip was still getting stronger. Some parts of it were amazing beyond description. There was some realization that I kept coming to, I don't remember...",
      "what it was, but I kept reaching the same realization again and again and each time it felt even more comforting and reassuring. I was riding the spiral for a while, for lack of a better description. It was like I was something infinitely small and I just kept zooming out, kind of like at the end of the first Men In Black when it's zooming out of that galaxy thing. But for as much of this amazingness that I felt, there was just as much fear, doubt, and paranoia. I lost control of my inner thought voice at some point. It was like my brain and my body were disconnected from each other. The words that came out of my mouth were really comforting, but they had nothing to do with what I was thinking. It was like they were a step ahead of me. Then again was I even thinking my own thoughts?",
      "Some divine power had a hold of me.. What it was I don't know. My sense of self was completely shattered. Everything that I was prior to that day no longer existed. I was a glitch in time, my life as I knew it ending as I returned to my true form. I was just an idea floating in some kind of weird idea thing. It was like anything that had any meaning to me, any thoughts, words, anything that I understood, was disconnected. I couldn't understand anything. My thoughts were trapped in a neverending cycle. I still had the idea that I was a human and that I wasn't done living as a human yet, which made me think that I was just a human with a broken brain. I feared I'd be stuck on earth listening to this voice in my head keep talking forever (my own voice which I didn't have control of), and that I'd thrown into an asylum or something. The voice in my head told me it was God, but I refused to believe it. I thought that either a) it was really God just messing with me,",
      "b) it was some evil spirit tormenting me",
      "c) it was the spirit of the morning glory plant teasing me, or",
      "d) I'd just straight up broken my brain..",
      "At some point I thought that I was the plant, the spirit of it I guess. I also thought at some point that I was the word doubt, because I just wouldn't believe that it was God. Us humans are creatures of doubt though, that's why it's so hard for us to believe. It's why people try to prove things scientifically instead of looking at them for what they really are. But is that just the drug talking? I'm doubting again. My thoughts kept going around and around like that until at the peak of my insanity I woke up. I guess I'd fallen asleep in the car while my friends were doing something, although I never noticed the transition from being awake to being asleep. I woke up as soon as they came back to the car though, and instantly I was back to reality. The body high was still there, but my head trip was over.",
      "At first I thought I was transported to another point in time, a couple months ago, but then I realized it was still the same day. It might've been 5pm by now, my sense of time still wasn't there. My friends informed me that they were getting acid, but my head was still too messed up to even think about doing that any time soon. So I went with them to get their acid as I was still getting reacclimated with reality. This guy that was with them gave me some Ritalin. It was the kind with the little balls in it. A little later when I was with other people I snorted about two thirds of it and gave some to my friend. While I was with people I didn't really pay attention to any visual effects of the drug, but by the time I eventually got home that night (around midnight) they were still there, subtle but enjoyable. The Ritalin added a little to the body high and kept me awake longer, although I kept forgetting I took it because I was still so blown away by the morning glory seeds."

So far I've already taken something around 30gr. -mostly through german Hustenstiller. Today I wanna write down the feelings and  thoughts I get during my Trip. So it comes that im sitting here in the middle of Europe, together with 1200mg DXM and the good will to write as english as possible, so that every smart freak out there in the crazy world of Fnord can understand what my DXM-tuned brain will cry out for him:",

I take another 180mg (tt:900mg). For some raeson I start doupting if it was a good decision to give me a heavenlike trip. But who cares TakeIT MakeIT. Its time to walk trough. I can feel the jump up to the 2nd plateau.",

Reading gets even harder. I'm feeling like one who is totally drunken but has already puked. So not really bad just high.",

Now 7am in the morning but  I m still totallly high nowayout wow I cannot keep a cleardirection. what i ve experienced this night is too strange too deep to tell it anybody without gettimg mad. I succeeded. Now I m sitting here in front of my pc -one eye closed to focus the letters on the keyboard. Damn its WOW.",
      "I thought a lot about human evolution birth and anthropology. About 30minutes  I sit in my chair asking me what I AM. I am a human person, born and brought up. I feel for some way like an animal or like YES thats IT THE MATRIX thats exactly what I m thinking about remembering the last 7 hours. History is just short one step I felt it. The Room in which I tripped was getting much larger. One step seems to be about 10m for me. Everything is circeling around me. Its amazing how dxm can be within higher doses. It really throughs me out of reality i coudnt say if it s dream or reality. In the normal reality we ve time and room/space but with DXM my your blood those two units get miXed up. Yeah man thats it.",
      "So however, now its monday afternoon and I m still dizzy but man enough to post my trip-report and to think todays night. Ok so finally let me point out that DXM isn t a drug that makes me happy, but if were searching for a reality-break-through experience..."

      "Some how through doing this I made the universe fall out of existence. I brought it back to existance. It than fell out of existance again. Than it began existing and not existing very very rapidly. Until I finally firgured out that he wanted me just to say something. I thought I recalled him picking me up at that point. He says that he never picked me up.",
      "The next thing I know I was walking in the park and my leggs compleatly went out on me. I got back up ok and tried to walk. My leggs went out again, only this time I hurt my ankle. I started to cry almost histaricly. Some how my babysitter calmed me down and made me sit by a tree. This is my last actual memory, nothing past this can I remember.",
      "My babysitter told me the last thing I said was,'There is a fly flying in my eye.' I can't help but think that this may have had something to do with the legend that if you eat the amanita muscaria you will see the lord of the flys. My sitter said that I than became compleatly unresponsive. No one could wake me up or get me to talk. After a while he got worried and called 911.",
      "At the hospital, they ran every test on me possible, spinal tap, mri, Pregnancy?, blood. Aparently they didn't ever find out that I had taken amanitas, they though I had drank too much beer! During the night my entire body swelled, I wasn't breathing right, My heart wasn't beating right, and they repeativly had to sedate me because I was trying to rip my breathing tube out. Of course my parents got to sit in the room and watch all this.",
      "The next morning I woke up in a hospial room that I had never seen before, with about 6 people I had never seen before. When I got home, I saw a fly for the first time in our house, just sitting on the mirror. I have seen them here and there in our house ever since. They have a very deep and spiritaul meaning to me now. They, in a way, represent death to me."

      "Deep music and a friendly talk are well-known, trustworhy helpers of the psychonaut.  However, after the Nth trip, you might feel that taking psychedelics at someone's home, when accompanied by your pals, by music, and by soft furniture, becomes just as habitual for you as visiting pubs on weekends is for the silent majority. You might feel that you need a change.",
      "When I got that feeling, I decided to take a solitary trip in the forest.  No music, no friends, no civilization.  Summer came, and one day I found myself in my parents' country house with a dose of 2C-B in a pocket of my bag.  In the evening I told my mom and dad that I was going for a walk, and set out.  The good old forest that I had known since my early childhood met me with the quiet whisper of the wind in the leaves, and with absolutely no gnats.",
      "[T+0:00] I sit down on a soft pile of needles under a pine, take two plastic cards, a business card and the precious packet out of my pocket, and snort the substance using the above items. (Imagine you are playing a quest game: How would you do that?)",
      "[T+0:05] I feel the very first effects.  The sounds of a rather distant highway become clearly audible.  Bloody technocratic civilization won't let me out! (Actually, I wasn't upset by the traffic roar at all, just decided it would add a touch of 'industralness' to my trip.) Still sitting under the pine smoking a cigarette.",
      "[T+0:15] Wow, I'm pretty high! But who the hell is stomping behind my back? It appears to be local folks gathering edible (not magic) mushrooms.  Have to relocate.",
      "[T+0:30] The forest begins to show its magic to me. I would never have thought that watching a small bug running along a blade of grass can be such a great source of pure psychedelia.  The bug runs, changing its colour like a chameleon, and the wave of new colours washes over the entire blade. What a wonderful creature! Each plant becomes a personality. Rind morphs into strange but friendly faces. The forest is a kind place.",
      "[T+1:15] The day is wearing off.  It's getting cool in the forest, so I decide to go.  The road leads me out of the forest right into a meadow.  I become instantly overhelmed by its bright yellow colour and the chirr of myriads of grasshoppers and other unseen insects. I see a lilac thicket forming a sort of a grotto over the road, and I get a strong feeling that it's a mysterious cave with someting extremely amazing expecting for me in it.  The feeling transforms into pure euphoria, which rises higher and higher with each my step, literally tearing me apart from inside (in the good sense).",
      "[T+1:30] I reach a rise in the road due to a slope of a ravine. To prevent the ravine growth, people terraced its slopes with trees long ago.  The terraces remind me of an amphitheatre, so I decide to take a seat and watch the performance.  The distant trees of the forest become the scenery, the meadow turns into the scene itself, the grasshoppers form the orchestra, and the lonely bushes and small trees are actors.  Everything shifts and twirls.  It's very impressive.  The theatre's only spectator is nearly clapping his hands.",
      "[T+1:50] The performance is approaching the end.  I leave the theatre and go up the road.  While ascending, I can distinctly feel the air getting warmer with each my step from the bottom of the ravine to the top of its slope.",
      "[T+2:00] I feel I'd like to visit a small spring purling nearby. On the way to the spring I meet a countryman who resembles a green-faced goblin, and then I see a human figure far off accompanied by something looking like a horse or a big dog.  I'd in no way like to get bitten, or kicked with a hoof, so I leave the road and take a side trail across the field.",
      "[T+2:10] While I'm approaching the spring, I see a family that came by a car for fresh water. They've already filled their jerrycans and are bustling around trying to embus into the car. I feel that I don't want them there right now. It seems they feel my feeling and begin to fuss about quicker and quicker. Finally, they slam the car doors and start trying to do a U-turn on the clearing. I can hear their talk. The wife to her husband: 'Hey, you idiot! Do you see you're driving right into a ditch?' - 'Nope. Haven't you ever noticed the 'Blind man at the wheel' sign on the windscreen?' Ugh, they manage to turn around and vanish into thin air. I spend some time watching the water running and preparing myself for",
      "returning home.",
      "[T+3:00] I return home. I'm nearly at the baseline. I have a talk with my parents, then go to my room, light an Indian incense stick, meditate for a while on how amazing the trip appeared to be, and fall asleep until the morning.",
      "[T+12:00] I wake up in the morning very joyful and full of positive energy. I stay in the extremely good mood for a week or two. Thank the forest."

Like LSD, but I feel much cleaner.  This drug is very well balanced which I loved, I had to fight for the rewards I got.  I felt completely balanced, my life was made up of extreme lows and highs, the highs were soo beautiful, I felt like I was enlightened and I would disapear if I so wanted to. ",
      "The onset was 4 hours for me, extreme body at first, we also hiked for those four hours, got rid of all the poisoned, I though I would fall asleep in snow after I threw up because I though it was the end of the trip, little did I know it was a mountain of ever increasing peaks, wow. We got back to an apartment and layed on beds until 9 am, where it was pure visual and out of body travels.  I cannot emphasize the strange ever rising aspect of this drug, being very ambivalent at first, thinking only 8 seeds, whats the big deal, I was not expecting the most powerful experience of my whole life's existence. I have only done this dose, but if felt very high, although not out of control, but very intense, the right amount for a powerful experience.  The poison was hard to deal with, I drank a lot of water, so much that I though I was drowning myself.  We came out of this being more clear and refreshed then ever before, a true purge.  Now having slept and woken up at 5 pm, I feel better and ready to do good deeds and become an active part in changing the word."

      "Tonight:",
      "I shall do my best to disregard placebo, but this may be difficult",
      "T + 0 - 09:44 - 2 gelcaps swallowed, no food eaten since 18:00 yesterday.",
      "T + 3 - 09:47 - feel slight more relaxed, cant be sure its nothing more than placebo though.",
      "T + 9 - 09:56 - not feeling it as expected, slightly disappointed.",
      "T + 12 - 09:58 - feel mentally a bit slowed, and a *tiny* bit dizzy, nothing amazing though, not like I was last time I done 2 caps (bouncing around like a mad man), got some tunes on which hopefully will help.",
      "T + 13 - 09:59 - here it comes, I think, really feeling this music now and feeling nice and dancey. I'd like to say at this point I mentally feel like Ive had about 5 pints as far as general happiness and loss of inhibitions go, but theres none of the usual alcohol fuzziness, I feel as if I could sit and do some work fine. Vision is a little bit retarted, I can focus fine but it seems to take my brain a *tiny* bit longer to register what things are and my eyes feel a bit heavy.",
      "T + 16 - 10:01 - feeling it a bit more intensely now, feels more like 6-7 pints, but still with the mental clarity. Basically, think of it as being drunk but with the bad things (blurred vision/difficulty focusing/mental fuzziness/arrogance) greatly reduced. Of course I can feel the bad effects that alcohol would give you, but VERY mildly, it seems GBL gives me 100% of the good things of alcohol at any set dosage and 20% of the bad ones. This is not to say GBL is all fun and games though, the dose-response curve is very steep and if I had taken 4 gelcaps chances are I'd be out cold right now.",
      "T + 19 - 10:04 - Feeling more dancey and happier now, nice euphoria and general 'life is really good' attitude, I love GBL, gonna let it do its thing now. Oh, one thing I'd like to add - GBL can make some people vomit, the taste of the chemical or the irritation it causes to your stomach can make you dry heave or full on vomit, I am lucky though and I have never even felt nauseous (slight stomach discomfort maybe) on GBL with a full stomach, but I have a friend who projectile vomits on it sometimes. I think of GBL as a mix of the good things of alcohol + the good things of caffeine, but better.",
      "T + 23 - 10:09 - Eddie Halliwell is r0x0ring my panties at the moment, got the tunes up loud and headbanging to the tuneage, loving it :), a plus 1.8 on the schulgin scale, not quite as intense as a 2, cos theres no adventure as such, but I can feel it right now, but I could continue with a normal day's plans if I wanted to (expect drive of course). I feel as if I could drive, but I know I couldnt, not quite like alcohol in that respect where I imagine enough to feel this :) would make me pretty certain driving would be a very stupid thing to do.",
      "T + 31 10:17 - Nothing new to report, feel the effects in waves, currently not feeling it too much, just worried GBL will be banned soon, I hate this government :(, planning on buying a litre or 2 with a friend in September, just hope its still available.",
      "T + 50 10:35 - Feel pretty much back to normal now, vision is still a *tiny* bit drunk like, but I think its worn off pretty much",
      "12:19 - meh all gone now, it was good, but Ive had better GBL experiences.",
      "As you can probably tell by all my waffling, the GBL was making me very talkative",
      "Would like to add this:",
      "Today I had 2 gelcaps (1.7ml) with a nearly empty stomach and had a wonderful time, focusing was hard, I was wobbly and speech was slurred, but I felt fully in control and mentally fine, with a nice dose of euphoria. I have had enough to be knocked out cold before and when I woke up I felt fine. It seems that if GBL/GHB is used responsibly it can be a fantastic social drug, I have ordered larger size 000 caps and hope to try 1.5 when they arrive."

      "This is the third time I have taken 2CB and it came in pill form as opposed to the stronger capsule form of previous experiences. The effect was not nearly as intense as on other occasions, and the predominant sensation was one of nausea with subtle visuals, i.e. shimmering colour hue and slight kaleidoscopic patterns appearing 'on top of' rather than 'inside' objects (as in lsd / psilocybin etc). Feeling somewhat unfulfilled, I administered a substantial line of ketamine (perhaps 1/10g), smoked a couple of cannabis joints and tripped out nicely watching Braindead.",
      "My out of body experience, however, occurred whilst in bed about 5hours after ingesting the 2CB. In bed I snorted a large line of ketamine and about 5 minutes later became aware of a tinnitus-like noise in my ears, which could have been there a while but only entered my consciousness at this moment. The ringing then began to fluctuate musically, creating the most intense and beautiful, sometimes frightening, noises imaginable. Accompanying this, were equally intense fluctuating illuminations, starting as flashing waves or sheets of light, and eventually transforming into vivid moving images of everything and nothing.",
      "I have experienced these sensations before, but this time I became aware of my body moving, when it was actually stationary. I encouraged these feelings and allowed myself to suspend reality becoming a floating consciousness, free to travel where and when I wished. The defining characteristic of this trip was the control I had over my own sensations. I could will my self to fall infinite distances at speeds so incredible that I felt my flesh being ripped, almost dissolved, off my body,but not in a frightening way, as I retained the ability to instigate or cease such motions. I can only compare the physical sensations with those of experiencing extreme g-force, so my lay-analysis would be that I had somehow interrupted the nerve endings so that they no longer responded to external stimuli, but to my conscious will.",
      "As much as I want to share as much as I can of my experience, I dont want to bore you, and I am bound by the limitations of the English language in my descriptions. I most definitely felt I had gone somewhere unusual: I have had similar experiences but the amount of control I had this time meant I was able to actively partake in my journeys rather than simply view them as some kind of passenger might.",
      "One particular vision/sensation, which was more fun and entertaining than mystical and divine, was watching  and encouraging - the walls of my bedroom disintegrate, leaving the frame of my room suspended in an infinite void. Using my imagination I was able to make myself think my whole room was swinging, pendulum-like, in massive sweeping circles, my body felt as if this was actually happening. At one point, a feeling not dissimilar to that of sand giving way beneath ones feet at the sea-side became apparent inside my back and legs. It actually felt as though I was dissolving into my bed until I was nothing but pure consciousness.",
      "What made the whole experience (around 3 hours of going in and out of different trips, with ketamine top-ups) special was the symbiotic relationship between the physical, the aural and the visual. The music would change dramatically if I opened my eyes, or if I decided to move in a different direction. The visuals would alter if some external sound entered my consciousness, and might send me flying of at the speed of light in the opposite direction. I remember opening and closing my eyes to hear the music dramatically speed up with eyes open and slow to a triphop pace when closed.",
      "Felt fine the next day, though slightly withdrawn and thoughtful. If anyone has similar experiences or know different techniques for this I would greatly value their views.",

So, I added a little apple-cider vinegar, to a large plastic mug of about 20 oz. of water, and put it in the microwave until it was boiling. I then put some of the Lagochilus inebrians in a plastic tea strainer (holds about as much as a tea bag), put it into the mug, and then covered it for about 15 minutes. I then sat down and drank it slowly, because it was still very hot. The effects began about an hour later, and lasted about 4-5 hours. Inebriated is a good way to describe the way I felt. It wasnt bad at all, and left me very relaxed but alert, with no bad aftereffects. I slept well that night, and the next day, it seemed that I felt a bit more calm and relaxed than usual.",
      "However, the next weekend, I tried preparing it, and found no effects at all. After waiting for 3 hoursnothing. So, I tried again, with more herb. Four hours laternothing. I couldnt figure it out! Then I tried again, but this time, for every sip I took, I held it in my mouth for about a minute. Well, an hour later, and I was inebriated again! Ive read of other peoples failures with this herb, and thought that they just didnt get the real stuff, but now I think I understand what is the problem. The active ingredient is apparently absorbed sublingually!"

I originally ordered 1 gram of MCPP from a site in New Zealand, deeming that compound the best bang for the buck. After three months of waiting, and pretty much giving up hope that I'd ever see my precious little baggie of powder, a package finally arrived. I'm not sure what happened, but they ended up sending me 5 grams of MeOPP instead.",
      "Not having a scale, I divided the entire bag up into gelcaps, which after calculations ended up being about 150mg per cap, with a little left over. Curious to see the effect of snorting it, and wanting to get the experience started quickly, I lined up a little (estimated about 50mg) and proceeded to inhale. About half the line went into each nostril.",
      "Oh my God, it burned worse than any substance I've ever put up my nose, and there's been more than a few. Seriously, I teared up immediately, and every time I inhaled it burned more. There was no way I was gonna get an active dose in my body this way, so after an hour or so of waiting, I downed one of the caps.",
      "My friends and I were sitting around smoking some good hydro, and about an hour passed before I really felt anything above and beyond the weed high. Initially I felt kind of speedy, like I just drank four or five cups of coffee. My hands were quite shaky, and this persisted the entire length of the experience. The come up was in waves, not unlike MDMA, but much milder. I also became alternately hot and cold, with each wave bringing a change in temperature.",
      "By about the hour and a half mark, it seemed to plateau, and I settled into a nice, comfy feeling of slightly speedy calmness. That sounds a little contradictory, but it's the best description I can think of. My head and body were buzzing, and I was definitely not tired, but it felt really good to just lay down with a blanket. My pupils were a little dilated, and stayed that way for an hour or so.",
      "At about two hours I could feel the effects waning, but it was a very slow, graceful comedown, not at all like the abrupt crash I usually feel with stimulants. I was pretty much baseline after about four hours. Peak rating was a solid +, maybe ++. I feel like perhaps it's just a dosage related issue, and I plan to try the substance again at 300mg to see if the effects are heightened."

      "This experience was the worst I've ever heard about Marezine.",
      "It all started out about midnight. It was a sucky autumn night, chilly and all. I heard from a guy at the bus stop whom I told I like to trip DXM that I should try Marezine. He told me to take a whole box of the stuff but I thought that 12 pills was a bit much so I looked up Marezine dosage on the internet. It said for my body weight and a first-timer, to take between 4 and 8. So I took 6. About an hour later, I experience a drastic mood change. My emotions hit the highest point I've ever experienced on a legal drug. Much like morning glories actually.",
      "Then it all hit rock bottom. About 2 AM, I forgot I took any of them at all! I looked at the box and it looked unopened to me so I thought I must have dreamed the whole emotion thing. Anyway, I opened the box up for the second time and pulled out the sheet of those little pills. It looked full! I saw 12 tiny little white pills in there! So I took out 6 and popped them. About an hour later, I was so messed up that I couldn't think straight. My brain felt as though it was no longer there. Then the hallucinations hit me. I looked at the ceiling and it started to dance around. Not the kind of dancing you want, mind you. It looked as though it was melting on me and it scared the crap out of me!",
      "I turned on the tv for awhile and I can't even remember what was on. I believe that I was watching xena or something. Anyway, my vision turned black and I became dizzy. I fell into some sort of trance and even though my eyes were closed, I could still see my room and the tv! I think that the Marezine forced my third eye chakra to open which, in itself, could be very dangerous. Anyway, I got up to go to the bathroom like every half hour. I looked in the mirror and my pupils were the size of marbles! I literally couldn't see any color in my eyes. When I went back into my room, I was laying in bed and I picked my hand up and looked at it. Remember the jiggling on the ceiling? Well, my hands started jiggling and at first it looked cool. Then I got scared when I started seeing a clear jelly around my arms. Next thing I knew, these intricate bacteria-looking things began growing out of the jelly! I freaked out majorly and I couldn't help but keep staring. It was as if I had no control over my body.",
      "Sometime during this experience, I felt as though I stopped breathing. I became unnerved by this and it literally scared the crap out of me! I thought I was going to die and I regretted the experience totally. I got out of my bed finally and took my eyes off my body and the things stopped growing. Then I turned around and looked in my bed were I had been laying. There was the jelly again! Only this time, it looked like mold grew on it. Rapidly too. It seemed like only seconds had gone by with each full growth. I ran through the house yelling for my grandma (who had no idea what was going on) to get up. I made up this story about a girl at work putting it in my drink and telling me after the fact that she had put it in SOMEONE's drink but was not specific as to who. I told her that I was having horrible hallucinations of viruses and bacteria, etc. She became frightened as well. She went in the other room to talk to my grandpa and as I was sitting in the living room, I saw the simpsons appear on the wall and I was watching as though it was a tv show. That was the high point of the trip.",
      "Next thing I knew, we were on our way to the hospital and I don't really remember the events leading up to it other than my mom being called and told to meet us there. In the emergency room, things mellowed out. They didn't pump my stomach because the ingestion happened too long ago. The nurse and the doctors all had never heard of a Marezine overdose and nobody even seemed to know what Marezine even was! Anyway, they hooked me up to a heart monitor and I became freaked out again as I realized that my heart was not beating normal. According to the monitor, my heart rate all across the chart was a steady pyramid when it should have been spiky and different sized. They drew my blood and tested me for drugs, etc. I came up clean (luckily) because I hadn't done anything for a long time. Anyway, I started feeling like I was going to puke so they gave me one of those gold plastic things. I started to move it around and I saw a gold powder moving around and I started to play with it. My mom started yelling at me to stop saying that there was nothing there but it was as if I didn't hear her. To me, it was there and that's all I would believe. It amazed me how I couldn't separate reality from unreality. With LSA and LSD, I could always separate the two. Anyway, they let me go home about 7 AM and I went to my mom's house.",
      "I was still hallucinating at this point and heavily. I began to see spiders and bugs crawling all over the couch and I flipped out. It was as if I was having a nervous breakdown or something! Anyway, everyone tried to convince me that it was all in my head but I just wouldn't listen.",
      "Finally about 12 noon, I fell asleep for about 2 hours. When I awoke, I began hallucinating immediately. I saw a little girl standing next to my mom's work desk. I began to talk to her, asking her what her name was and what she was doing there. She told me that my mom was babysitting her and I believed her. When I got up to get a closer look at her, she just disappeared! Weird, I thought. So I went and sat down on the couch. Then I saw a woman leaning over my little sister and then her brother and sister (who weren't in the house and I knew it) appeared next to her. Finally, she disappeared and so did the 'ghost kids' as I call them today. By this point, I was beginning to gain control of the trip. I figured out that if I close my eyes and imagine an object appearing and being solid, when I opened my eyes, I would see it and I could pick it up and play with it. This is when the trip became a bit more fun. I created safety pins and tweezers, a thermometer and a computer which I proceeded to play with until I got bored. Then all the hallucinations disappeared and I felt VERY drained. As a matter of fact, I felt almost as drained as I do when I crash on ephedrine. Anyway, the hallucinations gradually subsided and I returned to 'normal' by 8 PM that night.",
      "For a trip that was supposed to last 4 to 6 hours, it lasted almost 24!",
      "All in all, I would say that Marezine is very dangerous:",
      "Physically, it blocks histamines and has strong anticholinergic effects.",
      "Mentally, it induces a kind of psychosis where you can't separate real from unreal and you also feel things that you shouldn't be feeling. For example, you CAN feel pain from your hallucinations!",
      "Finally, spiritually, it can do much more harm than help. Forcing open the third eye chakra, for example, can bring highly unwanted visions into your everyday life. Also, you could lose faith completely simply because you can't tell what is real and what isn't.",
      "Generally speaking, I wouldn't mess with marezine ever again if my life depended on it!!! Its too much of a risk!"

      "10:45 A.M. - Effects mellowed out until now. I went to drop a plastic ball into a test tube and as soon as I put it near the rim of the tube I cracked up completely, felt floaty, legs tense, arms tense, bent over a little as my stomach tensed cause of laughter.",

      "After being sentenced with felony theft, I got the rather unenjoyable experience of spending 3 months in county jail.  Considering that this was my first time in jail, I was very scared and had no idea what to expect.  I went in there with my presciptions of Lexapro and Adderall, and realized that the Adderall really sucked to take in jail, so I found some 'speed freaks' who had access to 'sleeping pills'.",
      "Well, all I really wanted to do was sleep, considering this was the quickest way to blow time and get out quicker.  So, I would trade my 20mg adderall for 100 to 400 mg's or Seroquel (or what they called it, 'Quil').  I was told it was a form of tranquilizer, hence the 'quil' in the name Seroquel.",
      "Well anyways, around 10 am, I'd pop one of the pills, sometimes cutting them in half to sleep off of 50 mg, and sleep FOREVER!  I don't even know if these pills are used as sleep aides, but it worked.  Perhaps it was just the power of suggestion, but I didn't care, cause they conked me OUT!  I'd wake up around 5 pm, then pop another one before bed time (around 10pm).",
      "One weird side effect that I noticed was that, obviously, the more I took, the deeper I would fall into sleep.  But the weird thing was, I would have very vivid dreams, and would actually yell obscenities in my sleep (definitely not a good thing to do in jail).  I'd literally wake myself up screaming 'STFU you piece of shit' or 'I'll kick your fuckin ass!'.  I actually had a guy come up to me and tell me that I was 'possessed' and should seek Jesus (I was actually attending a private Bible College the year before, so I'm pretty sure I wasn't possessed).",
      "Generally if I only took 50mg, I'd be fine, but anything over 100 mg and I'd start yellin.  But then, the nurses began to crush up the sleeping pills (Seroquel and Tradnizone), and stopped giving me my adderall.  They had no idea that I was trading them for these pills, but the jail doctor stated 'It's an amphetamine, he shouldn't be taking it'.  The jail doctor was a dumbass, I was diagnosed with ADD about a year before, and the pills had absolutley no amphetamine effect on me at all."

      "Friday night, my girlfreind and I decide to go to a movie.  The plan was to get something to eat (bad idea) and see 'Blow.'  Then we would proceed to get back to my apartment and indulge in some 5-MeO-DIPT.  The movie wasnt all that great, and we arrived home around midnight.  I usually don't like dosing anything at midnight, but I just received the foxy and was eager to taste it after so long.  I put our doses in gelcaps, and poked a hole in each.  She had 6-10 mg or so, and I was 20-25 mg or so.  After measuring the dose, we each took 50 mg tenormin(atenolol), to hopefully ward off any hypertension.  30 minutes later we dosed. ",
      "After approximatly 25 minutes I started feeling tremors throughout my body.  I then changed the CD to Dead Voices of Air.  I had already gotten comfortable in my sleeping clothes, but found it was still too cold, so I threw on some more clothing.  My girlfreind was just laying in bed listening to music, I started getting paraniod.  Now I've almost never had this reaction on psychedelics, because I can usually rationalize fear with ease.  However, I started getting tinges of fear that were slowly creeping up in my head as the effects started to peak.  About this time I went to the bathroom and took a shit.  Needless to say that was the most awkward feeling shit i've taken in my life.  When I returned to my room my girlfreind reported to me that she felt sick.  She then proceeded to the bathroom to empty her stomach. ",
      "I was worried.  I was shaking uncontrolably at that point, too confused to tell if I was feeling good or bad.  I changed CD's to ELpH vs coil 'worship the glitch.' Music was wonderful, and the images in my head were nothing short of breathtaking.  I lost track of time at this point, but soon realized my girlfreind had not come back from the bathroom in what seemed like a long while,  I went to check on her and she was curled on the floor in the bathroom.",
      "She looked up to me with a big smile on her face and told me how peaceful it was in there.   I was still having violent tremors, but they now were feeling wonderful.  I started getting waves of euphoria, followed by short waves of discomfort.  It was a cycle of feeling wonder, then uncomfortable, and wonderful again, repeating a few times every minute or so.  I really couldnt concentrate on anything to tell if I was getting visual distortions or not.  We basically spent the entire time chatting and listening to music. ",
      "I decided to get something to eat when I felt the effects fading.  Food is great when foxy's on the brain.   Around 8 am we both agreed it was possible to sleep.  I tried to persuade my girlfreind into sex, but she was too tired.  We slept, woke up 3 hours later, feeling great, and energized and generally happy for the rest of the day.",
      "All in all, during our chatting, I felt it was easier to express myself to her, even though I wasnt talking in comprehensive sentences, but we both seemed to understand what we were trying to say.  I feel that this drug is gentle to me in the emotional respect, and it doesnt cause any irrational delusions in me like some other psychedelics tend to.  Both of us had a positive time, although we didn't 'learn' much(I attribute that to the fact that the drug isnt very delusional).",
      "We will repeat, at a lower dose."

      "First, let me note that I never take any perscription drugs and rarely do I take over-the-counter drugs.  At the time of the experience report, I had not recently taken any drugs besides the p. azurescens and the weed.  I smoke weed every day, as Dr. Dre exhorts me to do, and I take small doses of mushrooms about 4 times a year.",
      "Over Christmas Break, my brothers and I cruised down to the Oregon coast to conduct our second annual hunt for psilocybe azurescens and cyanescens.  We were quite successful, harvesting some two-hundred p. azurescens mushrooms from the dune-grasses, three to four times as much as the previous year.  Because of our bountiful harvest, we decided to experiment with larger doses.  This would prove to be a foolishly confident move on my part, resulting in my most difficult drug experience to date.  On the night in question, I had been mentally preparing to take mushrooms, but I was expecting something more in the vein of my previous experiences.  What I encountered, I was not prepared for at all. ",
      "Out of respect for the holidays, we waited until all of the family 'squares' were asleep before beginning our journey.  This was probably my first mistake.  It was a dark, cold, rainy night, so our options were fairly limited in terms of what we could do.  We couldn't really take any walks if we got restless, and we had to be quiet and sneaky about the whole thing so as not to alarm our relatives.  The circumstances formed an anxious and reluctant mood in me, but nothing that I thought would ruin my experience at the time.  After all, I usually entertain a little healthy paranoia to keep me from doing anything terribly stupid.  This was more than paranoia, though, a sort of foreboding.  But I ignored it, assuming the kick-ass trip would outweigh the anxiety.    ",
      "[T - 0:00-0:10] - We took about 24 of the little devils (6 each) and cut them up into smaller pieces, placing the pieces into about 40 oz. of boiling water and letting them steep with teabags for about 20 minutes.  I find that fruity teas, especially orange teas, mask the bitter flavor of the mushrooms most completely.  We split the liquid up four ways: one for me, one for my wife, and one for each of my brothers.  As always, the tea had a very pleasing, earthy taste and was no trouble to ingest.  Anxious for the experience, we had all finished our draught before 10 minutes had passed.  While we waited for the mushrooms to kick in, we watched some American Dad cartoons. ",
      "[T  0:25-0:30] - Within about 15 minutes of finishing our tea, my brothers reported that their trips had started.  At the time, I only felt a tightening of my stomach and my chest, but a lingering dread began to creep into my thoughts.  I began to wonder what, if anything would happen.  Had I taken enough?  For that matter, was I even sure that I had picked the right mushrooms?  Maybe the discomfort in my stomach was only the beginning of my death by mushroom poisoning.  Could I confuse a poisoning with a trip?  Sure.  Was I being poisoned?  'Probably not,' I told myself, 'Don't head-trip yourself into a bad place.'  I began to feel restless and worrisome, so I decided it was time to smoke a little weed to ease my nerves.",
      "[T  0:30-0:40] - Once again, out of respect for our relatives, we smoked outside in my brother's car.  Normally, I would totally advocate smoking weed, especially if you are a regular smoker like I am.  But the setting of our pot-smoking was so damned creepy that it was a horrible place to 'come up' on mushrooms.  It was raining, and it was dark.  The car felt kind of like an underwater casket on wheels.  My sense of dread growing stronger, I asked my brother to put on some music.  He chose DMX's collaboration with 50 Cent and Styles P, entitled 'Shot Down,' an ultraviolent gangsta rap anthem with an ominous and dark beat.  Usually I am a big fan of rap, and I have listened to 'Shot Down' plenty of times before and been unaffected.  This time, however, the grisly imagery bore a hole into my brain.  For example, 'If your head ain't hanging off of your shoulders, you ain't got shot, Nigga, just nicked.  Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone it gon' do more than chip, Nigga.' ",
      "I was trying to be patient and calm myself down.  I took a rip from the bong each time it was passed to me, smoking about an entire bowl of pretty potent weed, more than I would need to get high from sober.  Finally, I asked my brother if we could listen to some Bob Marley or Pink Floyd and he grudgingly accommodated me with some Marley.  At this time, I began to notice that the stereo face seemed to be moving toward me.  I became transfixed upon it for what seemed like a few minutes, and it seemed to somehow reach out to my eyes as my eyes reached out for it.  I came to notice a complicated network of lines, a pattern that seemed to be interacting with the moving numbers indicating the track time.",
      "At this point, I was sure that my trip had begun, and I knew immediately that it was something different and beyond what I had experienced in the past.  I looked at the smoke-filled car around me and saw the pattern superimposed on everything I tried to look at.  It was especially creepy to look outside the car into the dark, because it seemed as though the pattern of lights and lines was approaching me slowly and smoothly, but at the same time relentlessly.  I knew I could not escape it because it was happening within me, and this started to scare me.  I told everyone that I needed to go back inside, because the experience was becoming too much for me.",
      "[T  0:40-1:00] - Inside, I felt better, but my trip was just beginning.  I thought I would try lying down with my wife, who was a bit further along in her trip, but also having difficulties with the larger dose.  I found that I got frightened when I looked at her face, because it seemed contorted and distorted, so I tried closing my eyes.  With my eyes closed, it seemed like the visions started coming on even stronger, so I got back up and tried to keep calm.  The whole time, I was restless and anxious but also excited and even joyful.  Joy gave way to anxiety and vice versa in ebbs and flows.",
      "[T  1:00-1:30] - Concluding that the bed was not the right place for my restless body and my racing mind, my wife and I got up and joined my brothers in the kitchen.  I noticed that some objects seemed to be simultaneously farther away and closer than they should have been.  Space seemed to be meaningless.  I pondered and examined this curiosity for awhile, feeling better up and around.  Someone, perhaps my wife, called my attention to the fact that the dcor of the house was largely purple or periwinkle in color.  Once my mind turned to looking for purple I began to find purple assaulting me from every angle.  Purple was spreading from objects that contained no purple previously, until finally I could smell, taste, and feel the purple all around me.  Once again, I could not control my sensations and I began to feel panicked about it.",
      "[T  1:30-5:00] - In an attempt to try to ground myself in reality I began eating, but I had neither the patience nor the sobriety to cook myself anything.  I think I ate a carrot and some Doritos.  But the more I ate, the further down the rabbit hole I fell.  I kept getting scared, wondering whether I would recover from my trip.  With little to do, my brothers began watching cartoons again, and I curled up into the fetal position and watched along from the floor.  My wife served as a kind of an anchor to hope for me, as she was past the discomfort, enjoying herself.  But my experience for the rest of the night was the same.",
      "The cartoons seemed to take on deep significance, as though they were realer than any world I had ever lived in.  The situations provoked in me more existential worrying and a deeply disturbed feeling from the darker humor.  I wish I could say that things improved before I came down, but I was pretty much fighting off the bad trip in one form or another for the rest of the night.  We watched about 3 hours worth of cartoons, which ranged from provocative to creepy to horrifying.  By the end, I finally felt like my body was calming down, but only insofar as the trip was gone.  Most of the night, I spent with my head buried in my wifes lap wishing that I hadnt taken the mushrooms.  We may have smoked another bowl of weed at the end, or I may have just crashed.  My memory is fuzzy on that point.",
      "I relate this story in order that one might learn the importance of set and setting.  Since that bad trip I have taken mushrooms again three times, and each time was an incredibly joyful and awesome experience.  The difference: I paid closer attention to my feelings and planned for the right type of environment.  It is awful to feel limited and constrained in the context of a mushroom trip.",
      "ON DOSAGE CONTROL",
      "To control my experience to a greater extent, I now grind the dried mushrooms up into a powder, so I can easily measure out repeatable doses from the powder, which is of uniform potency.  This is far superior than taking an approximate dose each time based on caps or grams although the strength of the powder will vary depending on the mushrooms I put into it."

      "I am a 19 year old college student currently undergoing testing for THC due to an incident which occurred several months ago.  I am not one to obey authority, so I have been researching ways in which I might cheat my urine tests.  To see how long THC lasts in my body, I went online and bought some test strips for about 3 bucks a piece.  I then proceeded to test myself in order to find out how long THC remains in my body.

However, I would advise allowing oneself at least 5 days to allow oneself to be tested."

      "A friend of mine and I had been interested in exploring some research chemicals for quite a while, and I found a rather good deal for some 2ct2 at a very nice price at a perfect time. It was in the possession of my friend before long, on a very pleasant day on which I was feeling very nice. I had been reading Terence McKenna's Food of the Gods and listening to the birds for most of the day, sipping down some coffee which isn't normally part of my diet and therefore has a rather marked effect on me. The caffeine had clearly worn off at least 90% before that night, though.",
      "My friend was in possession of a large quantity of this chemical, which is nearly impossibly and completely irresponsible to 'eyeball.' We didn't have any gel caps, and weren't sure of how to exchange a small amount. I came up with the idea to put a square of aluminum foil onto the scale and weigh it down with a penny, then weigh out 20mg of the chemical on top of that and then proceed to fold the foil around it.",
      "Around 11:00 PM I washed my face and such, got comfortable, made sure everything was in order, and then around 11:10 I carefully unfolded the foil. A light white powder. I tasted it directly at first. I see absolutely no reason why someone would need gel caps to consume this orally, I could have dropped multiple doses worth of this chemical into my mouth and tolerated the taste with no problem. Yes, it tastes bad, but not enough to make me gag, and I gag fairly easily. However, I didn't want to lick down the foil and penny, so I dropped said items into a large gulp's worth of water and shook it around a bit. It is indeed quite water-soluble, and the water's flavor wasn't even noticeably altered.",
      "I was prepared for the night. I had some corn muffins in a ziplock bag just in case, due to the face that I had fasted for roughly six hours beforehand. I had 1000mg of acetaminophen on hand ready to counteract the possible headache which some users report. I had 50mg of diphenhydramine prepared to help me pass out afterwards. I had a good supply of water. I had multiple intriguing books. I had marbles, paintings, wallpaper, and a mirror ready to receive my gaze. I had an mp3 player loaded with experimental and psychedelic music. I had a coat draped over my lamp's shade to keep the room dimly lit. I had materials for writing notes or for sketching if I felt inclined to do so.",
      "I spent the first hour or so after I dosed reading Terence McKenna's 'Food of the Gods' and relaxing my body. Gradually I began to feel more interested in reading in strange positions on the floor and such. This could easily have been placebo, but I wouldn't dismiss it as such, as there was a marked mood lift and desire to stretch which could possibly have been the first signs of onset. Approximately an hour after ingestion I was sitting at a desk still reading when my attention was suddenly arrested by the texture of the paper on which the book was printed. The texture of the pulp had never been so noticeable and bold, almost skin-like. The way I was noticing the space between everything suddenly seemed significantly altered, but wasn't distorted. It was a feeling of suddenly noticing how much space there is all around me. I felt a bit more warm than I had a moment ago, in a very comfortable way, like being outside on a summer night after some mild raining. I began to notice hints of pink and green 'auras' from most things. I grinned.",
      "After finishing the little section of the book which I was progressing through at that time, I used a random folded piece of paper as a bookmark and set the book down. I proceeded to move from my chair. I was thinking I may need to get adjusted to movement in this headspace, but somehow my movements were far more precise than normal. I had remarkable control over each part of my body, and simply moving from my chair to the floor a few feet away was a little journey involving some degree of awe at the normally ignored beauty of the motor capabilities of my body. In the process of moving I took a quick survey of my room, noticing more of the pink and green auras which I was noticing had fractal characteristics. I sat down against the wall with my legs crossed. There was a nice painting a few feet in front of me of a hilly field with long grass and some scattered trees on a beautiful partly-cloudy day. The wall around the painting was showing some level of something in between bubbling, breathing, and melting while the painting was beginning to show signs of 'coming to life.' I could hardly believe these visual effects had come in so suddenly, they were already on par with my past experiences with mushrooms and were getting rapidly more and more incredible. My hands were doing some minor trembling while I let them, and I was smiling.",
      "I stood and looked into the mirror. I once again had an impression of incredibly precise movement while watching myself. I became rather occupied for a moment in pointing at my reflection accusatively and got the notion (which was hilarious at the time, and which, of course, I was entirely aware of the ridiculousness of) that it was as if my reflection and I were arguing about which one of us was the one in the mirror. Visuals and mental effects were still rapidly on the rise. Any movement I would make, especially facially, would happen simultaneously extremely smoothly and clearly in the mirror. I sat back down. The walls were on the fritz again! I chuckled to myself, and they got a little more ridiculous. At one moment around this time it was a little too much for my eyes, so I reflexively blinked, at which point I jumped a bit, taken off guard by the fact that the visuals behind my eyelids were even more incredible. I laughed at my reaction. I also had a very pleasant body load, including pleasure from things as simple as touching my foot.",
      "I turned on some Boards of Canada softly and closed my eyes, immersing myself in an infinite canopy of fractal imagery. It was sharp and crisp, it was beautiful and full. Primarily pink, magenta, and green colors, but everything was there somewhere, integrated perfectly. I was zooming further and further into these visuals and seeing incredible things, generally geometric landscapes and fractals made of pixels which were made of fractals. These visuals resonated with the music astonishingly. I was also hearing a cornucopia of glitchy electronic noises which massaged my brain in all the right ways, especially when going on my little closed-eye journeys. These seemed to be a combination of my conscious mental navigation in this matter (as I was enjoying it) in combination with heavily altered animal sounds and drizzling rain sounds outside my window. Even with the music off these sounds persisted as heavily as ever. I put on some headphones a few times for some of the music, which generally blasted me into a very strong visual musical experience. I saw the wall in front of me in many, many different ways, all of which had me in many different brands of awe simultaneously. I saw a couple of frightening things in the aforementioned painting a couple of times (such as needles from an evergreen tree forming a sinister demonic visage of sorts), but generally when something of that nature happens it's only a matter of smiling at it, which was done, and which was, of course, completely effective. At some points during absolute engrossment in the fantastic visions, I felt as if I was dissolving or breaking into tiny particles, and the rest of the world was doing the same. I became very enthralled by the dimensions of the room around me. I can't stress enough that the visuals were encompassing every corner of my vision and were crystal clear and mindblowingly artistically tasteful.",
      "I stayed in this area for a good while, perhaps an hour. This period of time seemed far, far longer and my few-and-far-between checks of the clock generally revealed themselves to be within ten minutes of each other. During this time I spent a lot of time looking at that painting, in which the grass was swaying in the wind and the clouds were shifting in a remarkably appealing fashion. There were also patterns of mythological eyes peeking out from the clouds and hills in the painting, but in a very benign and simultaneously mystical and playful way which made me smile warmly. I was also very intrigued by the marbles I had and by an abstract wooden sculpture nearby during this time. I had some hunger, and a couple of bites from one of the corn muffins was both sufficient and delicious. The texture was appreciated on a whole new level, and I now have quite an appreciation for that food item in particular. There were several more examples of precision in motion, such as in position changes and in moving briefly to get a glass of water from the desk. The experience was becoming increasingly more enthralling and I had a symbolic and spiritual appreciation for every movement I made down to my breathing and my rapid heartbeat. This in particular would be a little difficult to really get into textually, and this report is about the effects of the chemical. I can say, though, that despite what I've read from some people's reports, this substance certainly wasn't lacking in 'substance' for me in any way.",
      "I eventually had that nondescript urgent feeling and momentarily wasn't sure what to do about it. Then I realized, of course, I had to urinate. After that ludicrously spiritual experience was completed, I felt quite relieved. I sat at the desk and tried to read some. The words were bubbling, but legible. However, I was being caught up in every sentence which my eyes scanned. Perhaps coincidentally, this part of the book involved symbols and language, which was very appropriate for trying to read while under the influence of a powerful psychedelic and also, of course, even more intriguing than usual. I put the book back down and grabbed my mp3 player immediately after simultaneously deciding I should worry about reading later and noticing that a wonderful track was beginning to play. I put the headphones on to get the full experience of this Boards of Canada track curiously titled 'The Devil is in the Details.' This song has heavily altered speech in the background through the entire thing, saying very interesting things. I was watching my wallpaper do terribly unimaginable things, which were right on track with the speaking in the music. The line 'These things are happening day by day, just as I tell you they are happening, wherever you are' came coupled with a particularly incredible burst of beautiful pattern-warping glory. This experience definitely involved the greatest music-euphoria I've ever had.",
      "I was feeling mild nausea, which I had no real way of alleviating at the time, but I was fine with this. I wanted to go to sleep within a few hours in order to get sufficient rest for a rather eventful day ahead of me, so around 3 AM I took the diphenhydramine (along with the acetaminophen just to preemptively treat any possible headache to come). I spent the next few hours laying in bed enjoying the experience, which was still going strong. I eventually drifted off and woke up 6 hours later energized and completely sober, though with a pain in my neck from passing out in an awkward position.",
      "All in all this was an absolutely fantastic chemical and I will be trying it again for sure. It absolutely blew my other psychedelic experiences away, particularly visually. This is one which I suggest without a doubt, though taking care is obviously necessary with any psychoactive one does. It also had a very nice afterglow sort of thing for the day after, though I am aware that some people report headaches. Overall it seemed like it had all the spirituality of a mushroom experience perfectly and stylishly mingled with an 'electronic' undertone which was incredibly interesting.",
      "Good luck exploring your mind, be safe and not moronic, etc."

With a few previous bad trips behind me i decided to take 100mgs of metropolol(an adrennalin blocker). Just so i wouldnt do something very stupid or get insanely worked up. Think of them as zannax.",

Remembering how someone had stated that this wasnt the friendliest drug to snort, i decided to lick two of the l(20mgs) up and hold them on my tongue, swirling it around.

I calmed down after  afew moment and very slowly took time to shave very carefully. Though i cut myself mildly(i havent in years). Afterwords, maybe 20 mins after the first dose i noticed that my pupils were as large as dinner plates. The waves of fear and anxiety returned.",

Then shifting into a panic when i couldnt be certain if Brother Bear was the best movie for me to chill to. Id become severely panicked and put in the first movie id come across, Bad Santa.",
      "After another glass of rum, I decided that the effects were all in my head. I was just having a very bad panic atatck and must continue. So i promptly ate 15 more mgs of 2c-t-2. I know now that of course i wasnt thinking rationally. I never use recklessley like that.",
      "At this point in the night, perhaps an hour and a half id gotten dressed in clothes i loved. The comforting factor is what i was looking for. Id started talking rapidly and spouting off my tirade of goverepression to my dad. We talked for hours on the subject, while i drank and ate a massive amount of fried chicken. The alcohol was acting as a downer and i started to feel very tired physically, if still energized mentally.",
      "Fast forward eight hours, ive been up watchinga  ww2 movie marathon. Being far to caught up in the movies. Sucked into them. At moments i kept thinking of what i will do next(as if im actually part of the movie). Moments of confusion afterwords untill i remembered where i was again. I re-checked my pupils and they were still dinner plate size. Id put on some sun glasses since the sun started to come up. The light was that painfull.",
      "Id come down somewhat id guess, my mental faculties coming back. I started becoming very scared of when this would all end. The tv no longer was a portal into another realm, i realized that it was just the drugs effect. That i prolly should have been worrying about meeting my friend ina  few hours. Luckily within the next two hours my pupils had gone back to near normal. The constant agitation was gone, but my pupils were non responsive. Odd.",
      "Id put off my driving for two more hours till i felt 100% normal and had no physical signs anymore. Overall this was an odd experience. It had the property of sometimes leaving me totally coherent in thoughts and then off in that world of over introspection/fantasy. Definitely worth the weirdness and im glad i tried it. Though the experience wasnt what id call pleasureable. I cant see any usefullness for this. My thinking was quite skewed and the constant fear and agitation it gave me(or i gave myself) left me unable to truly be objective."

      "A few experiences with the pharmaceutical MAOI moclobemide (trade names manerix, aurorix):",
      "On its own definitely gives a slight stimulant, energised buzz - I have more energy and motivation. Taken too late in the day it can cause insomnia. Has a fizzy, cerebral feeling at times, quite different from natural plant MAOI's.",
      "With alcohol: a friend and I took 150mg before going out. Energy and morale were generally higher, approaching people I didnt know was definitely easier (bear in mind it's been studied for the treatment of social phobia).",
      "With mushrooms and cannabis: Seemed to have a sobering effect on the weed, less tendency for stupor, more energy. With mushrooms, the trip was noticeably lengthened, with a gradual return to baseline. My friend and I again took 150mg an hour before consuming an unknown but large amount of cubensis mushrooms. Hallucinations were also extremely vivid and colourful. However, the moclobemide seemed to sober one up from the effects of the mushrooms - the dreamy feeling wasnt really present. There was also less tendency for stupor, with more energy to move around. I felt more inebriated than blissful, the mushrooms had lost a great deal of their organic, mystical and wholesome aura.",
      "Next day I felt tired and my head was clouded. Ive never had any form of hangover following mushrooms. I dont recommend this combination - moclobemide might be more suitable with DMT. Personally I plan to stick with Banisteriopsis caapi as my MAOI inhibitor of choice."

      "The Experience:",
      "5:00 PM:",
      "After doing some research I decided that I would get the most out of the 2C-T-7 If I were to insufflate 10mg. Hearing that the burn was quite bad, I decided on numbing my right nostril with some Benzocaine Gel. After I felt it was sufficiently numbed, I insufflated all 10mg at once.  I had some slight fear as to whether I should have taken less, especially since this was my first experience with the chemical. Unfortunately, the Benzocaine Gel did not seem to help the burn very much.",
      "5:05 PM",
      "Only five minutes (I was not surprised by the quick come on of the effects, but I was surprised by the intensity of it) and I'm feeling slightly uncomfortable. My throat feels as if it's missing it is so numb. (At the time, I assumed that was due to some Benzocaine Gel I may have swallowed, but in later experiences without Benzocaine, I still felt the same effect.) It did get me quite nervous because I did not think I would feel the puke coming up that was surely going to come (but never did.)",
      "5:15 PM",
      "I'm feeling nauseous, more uncomfortable, and I detect a definite change in perception, visuals are slight, and I can feel the intensity growing. At this time, I felt a strong urge to defecate, and so I journeyed to the bathroom. That experience was very similar to Shulgin's report of defecating while on a 12mg dose of 5MEO-DiPT.",
      "5:30 PM",
      "The discomfort and visuals are intensifying to the point where fear is getting irrational. I am slightly concerned and so I think to myself 'Perhaps it was too much for a first time experience?' At this point the visuals were somewhat akin to LSD: Shifting patterns in my carpet, wood grain and reflections were very sharp, and wavey. The visuals were accompanied by a VERY fast strobing effect, which seemed to cause visuals and sound to echo. I had to spend a 10 minutes or so in bed, trying to ease my mind, did a little meditation as well because of the growing discomfort from the body feelings. There was a definite speediness with the 2C-T-7, which didn't help matters at the time. I still had a great fear of whether I had done too much, which seemed to dissipate as I hit the plateau about an hour later.",
      "6:00 PM to 8:00 PM",
      "I seem to be peaking now, and the visuals are full blown. The best way I can describe them as is 'waves of colors, purple, yellow, red, blue, perhaps some green as well, covering everything and emanating from everywhere.' It seems as if these 'waves of color' are semi-transparent. It is as if they are right in my field of vision...everywhere, and yet I can see through them. Text on my computer screen looked like cryptic symbols, somewhat like this: '3#$%GH' and so I gave up reading anything and wandered around my apartment.",
      "The mental effects were minimal. (What I mean by this is, there was a lack of any 'mind-fuck' or any 'zoning out' In fact if anything, my thoughts had sped up.) I had been talking to people online before the visuals really kicked in, and I did so after the visuals died down a bit, and I could tell I was a lot more philosophical than usual, but I did not detect any thought loops, or any interesting though patterns.",
      "One effect that stood out from the others (besides the visuals) was time perception. Time slowed to a crawl, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. What was a 2 hour plateau seemed to drag on for 4-5 hours. This 'time stretching' continued throughout the rest of the trip making the 4-hour experience seem more like 8 hours.",
      "At Or Around 8:30 PM",
      "While the visuals have diminished quite a bit, the time perception dragged on. By this point, my body felt quite sore all over. I could no decipher text well enough that I picked up a pen and began compiling notes on my experience.",
      "The effects lasted until around 11:00 PM and with the aid of some Melatonin (just to be sure I could fall asleep) I fell asleep relatively easy at 1:00 AM. When I awokr 8 hours later, I felt fine, and if anything, only slightly tired (but this was probably due to the Melatonin which has a tendency to make me feel a little groggy when I first wake.)",
      "In Summary/Comments:",
      "2C-T-7 provided some of the most stunning and intense visuals of any compound I have tried thus far. However, there was a feeling of emptiness with the 2C-T-7. It seemed to lack 'soul'. I think that perhaps combining it with 5MEO-DiPT (or LSD for that matter) will fill in the emptiness. While the burn was quite bad, it was not bad enough to dissuade me from trying that route of administration again. After getting somewhat used to the body feeling (a lot of discomfort in that area for me) I decided that there would be no reason to go much higher with an IN dose (If anything, only to 15mg.) After getting more familiar with the over all experience, I definitely plan to combine it with some 5MEO-DiPT.",
      "Quick Note: As I do the day before the experience, the day of the experience, and the day after the experience, I took 200mg of DMAE. As to whether it effected the trip in anyway is unknown to me. I do know that doing this seems to lessen some of the negative effects I used to feel the day after any psychedelic experience."

      "I used heroin for the first time 6 months ago, and I'm 19 years old. One of my friends whom I used to only smoke weed with, convinced me to try it. He had tons of fresh needles still in the plastic wrap, so I was not worried about the contraction of diseases. I did about a 1/4 bag my first time. He tied my arm up for me and did the shot. 10 seconds later, Im in heaven. I immediately fell in love with the drug. About an hour later I became violently nauseous, and proceeded to vomit 10 times on the way home to my house, 15 minutes away. I ended up doing another shot that night, another 1/4 bag. The next day I had no physical withdrawal symptoms, but I wanted to feel that rush of euphoria again. So I did, this time 1/2 a bag. From then on my life seemed to revolve around the drug, and I naturally gravitated toward people who did the drug. Less then 3 weeks after my initial trial use of heroin, I was doing one whole bag in each one of my shots. I would do perhaps 1 a day, and that would be it, a simple 10-dollar bag. Did I have a problem? Not that I thought so. I could easily afford this amountthat was until 1 bag wasnt enough; I moved on to two, then three, then four a day. Only 2-3 months after my initial use.",
      "From then on, it is all a blur, I would wake up, see how I was going to get money for dope every morning. Mostly getting a dub ($20) off this person or that person; mostly borrowing from my girlfriend. 5 months since I started using I would load no less then two bags into each of my shots, doing about 7 bags a day. One night, I couldnt take it anymore, the people I stole from, and the hearts I broke became too much for me to bear. I went to the ATM, took as much money as I could out of all my visa cards, about 8 of them, only 3 of which still had money on them. I walked out with 120 dollars cash. Drove straight to my dope spot and bought a bundle (12 bags). I was so out of my mind because of this drug, I didnt even bother to prepare my shots, as I normally would have. I simply slammed as many bags as I could into my needle, slammed it into my vein, and drew back 60 units of blood. I removed the needle, shook it up, and bam straight back into my arm. I felt the most intense rush I have ever felt in my life, and then I blacked out. My intention was to die, just to end everything. I woke up, so surprised I was not dead, and drove myself home.",
      "The next morning I checked myself into rehab. It was the best decision I have ever made. Today I experience a great deal of cravings, but I can deal with them. Heroin is not a drug to be messed with. I have seen so many of my friends simply die because of this addiction. Today, I will never use heroin again, and would warn any others thinking of it. Luckily my addiction never cost me incarceration or death, as it easily could have."

I knew this was true after the fact, due to the metallic taste and numbing of mouth and the effects that were similar to other experiences I had read on this site. Now I feel like it's time that I contribute to the community and share my own experience on 25i.",
      "Before this experience I had smoked a lot of marijuana and had also experimented with adderall and hydrocodone.",
      "We both woke up earlier than we normally would have on this day, at about 10 AM. It ended up being a great day to trip since it was spring break and we didn't have to worry about school. Also, the sun was already shining bright. I think the combination of these two things put us both into a good mindset right away (even if it was subconscious).",
      "We both took 1.5 tabs, but this shit was no joke (still pretty intense).",
      "We dropped (kept it under our tongues), and chilled inside for about 20 minutes watching family guy. My friend said that my wallpaper was beginning to breathe and was looking really trippy. Well, this made me anxious, being my first time tripping. I said we should go outside and walk around the park nearby since I was feeling a slight body load and a little anxiety on top of that.",
      "On the way to the park, probably about 25 to 40 minutes in, the ground really started to do the stereotypical breathing you see during a psychedelic experience.",
      "Before we went into the park, we had to walk through a slim trail that was surrounded by trees. It made me feel so close to nature and hearing the birds chirp was amazing. Getting to the park, I see how sunny it is, but there is still snow on the ground. I thought that was so cool and that probably put me into a great mindset. It was probably the perfect day to trip balls on. It was only around 60 to 65 degrees, but the sun was out, and there was still snow on the ground (my friend and I live in Minnesota).",
      "I don't remember walking back to my house but I know the reason for walking back was because I had to go to the bathroom pretty bad. I had heard from so many different sources that recommended to not look into the mirror while tripping but I knew I could handle it - I just didn't know how self-reflective and damaging it would be to my own ego.",
      "Before even taking the piss I looked straight into the mirror, deep into my own eyes. My face looked so damn ugly. Staring into the blacks of my eyes made it seem like I was staring into the depths of my own soul. I couldn't believe I looked so terrible as a person, and I feel like my interpretation of myself was a combination of how humble I thought I was as a person along with my looks. It made me feel like a bag of shit.",
      "I just remember walking out of the bathroom and back towards the door to outside, where my friend had ended up waiting for me. I laughed, relieved that I no longer had to think about myself or whatever I had just seen while looking into the mirror.",
      "My friend and I agreed to go to the chinese restaurant/buffet, which was only about a mile away. At this point I would say that we were about 1 hour and 10 minutes into the trip.",
      "On the way to the restaurant, I told my friend that I had looked into the mirror. I remember him asking 'How was it?' I told him that I pretty much looked like a piece of shit. I know he replied something along the lines of, 'Yeah, I know what you mean.' Him saying that made me feel much better about what I had just saw.",
      "Next thing I remember is taking my iPhone out of my pocket. This is where I could tell I was starting to peak. The apps on-screen would not sit still. I told my friend that my apps were moving on my phone. He said, 'Yeah do you think anything's going to sit still right now?' I asked him what he meant by that. He said that everything during the following hours during the trip is going to look like it's breathing. He was experienced in psychedelics (I wasn't, this was my first trip).",
      "So with that, I just kept walking along side him. Through out this whole story by the way, we were obviously talking and laughing.",
      "When we got to the road where we would take a left, I said we should sit down on the small brick wall that was put there for landscaping purposes. So we sat down on the bricks and then a car drove by. I stared at the drivers side window only to find a woman staring back. As she passed, to the point of where she was far enough so that she couldn't physically look at me anymore, her neck seemed to twist like an owl and her face melted towards the side so that she was still able to see me.",
      "This tripped me out, I knew I had just seen some shit. My friend apparently knew that I had just hallucinated too because he told me to stop staring and to start walking again. I laughed at the situation but couldn't come to terms with what I had just seen. I guess I just couldn't describe it in the moment.",
      "Now we were walking along the sidewalk of the side road (the one we had just turned left onto). The street creeped me out, partially because to my left were large trees hung over us and the whole street, and big houses on top of the hills behind those trees. I just remember that being intimidating. After seeing that, I tried concentrating on the ground instead.",
      "The melted snow had created puddles on the sidewalk, all of which I was trying to avoid unreasonably. The puddles looked much more deep than they actually were. I figured this out because I accidentally stepped into one and the water level only reached the top of the sole on my shoe, when I had thought that my whole foot would fall into the puddle and get wet. That was trippy as hell. Even after knowing this, I still didn't want to step into the puddles. My vision was playing tricks on me.",
      "We finally got to the end of the street where there was/is a major intersection. We needed to cross it in order to get to the chinese place. I pressed the button but the wait seemed way too long. My friend and I were both very anxious. With the the cars driving by so fast I asked myself, 'Why is everybody in such a rush?' I wished that everybody could enjoy the outdoors as much as I was enjoying it in that moment.",
      "We finally crossed the street and the next thing I remember is grabbing onto the handle of the door and entering the chinese buffet.",
      "'Whoa! Way more people than I expected! Fuck' I remember thinking. I just knew that I didn't want to see this many people. Anyways, we picked the corner table and went to sit down. When she finally brought some water I realized I was so dehydrated and just fucking thirsty most of all. I drank like three fourths of it right in front of her. I think she laughed at that. I was satisfied for my thirst, so I approached the buffet, with intentions to snag my favorite sesame chicken. It was empty! 'WTF?' I thought to myself. So I grabbed different shit and went back to my table. Now we were in about 1 hour and 30 to 45 minutes after taking the tabs.",
      "Over the speakers in the restaurant I could hear a song I knew. I started to feel anxious while talking to my friend - I felt like everyone else was listening in on what we were saying. So in my head I tried to avoid this anxiety by singing along to the music I was hearing. I knew the melody but I couldn't remember the lyrics to save my life. Plus the song was warped to shit, it was tripping me out. We had been there for about ten minutes when my friend said mentioned leaving. This place was giving him bad vibes. It was tripping me out too but not so bad that I felt the need to leave right away. However, after he said that I also wanted to get the fuck out of there.",
      "So I paid for the both of us, which was a longer process than desired since their printer takes like 20 seconds to print and also I forgot certain aspects of paying at this restaurant like what the security code on the back of my debit card was. I was getting so fucking anxious when they asked for that - I couldn't sign my name for shit either.",
      "Busting through that door to the outside chilly air was the best fucking feeling in the world. We were free! No more anxiety. 'Good-bye anxiety,' is was it felt like inside.",
      "When walking back to my house I stopped inside of the Super America. I wanted to see if this place had better vibes and it ended up being very pleasant! The music was chill and the lights were very bright. This is where I realized that the chinese restaurant atmosphere was horrible because it had pretty much no lighting. It was dark in there.",
      "Any ways, for some reason I thought it would be funny to buy two four packs of red bulls for the two of us. Paying was easy this time, no security code bullshit. But I could tell they knew I was on something today, my pupils were big as fuck. I was also a regular and I still am to this day (6 months later). So they knew how I acted and looked when I was normal, since I went there every day.",
      "I exited Super America with one pack of red bulls in each hand. My friend grew a big smile and laughed his ass off. 'What the fuck are we going to do with all of this Red Bull?' is how I felt he reacted to this.",
      "I can't remember much more memorable things from this trip besides walking to the park with my friend again. Sitting there on the bench was very euphoric and extremely enjoyable. It was such a nice day out. I remember my friend almost went through a whole pack of cigarettes too, haha! He says he always smokes more when he's tripping.",
      "We also took along my dog to the park after stopping by my house. She was calmer than normal that day. I feel like she knew we were both tripping balls. Anyone else with pets who can relate with this? I feel this is true for when I am on any substance.",
      "If you have made it to this point in the story, thank you for reading. I hope it was enjoyable to you and I hope you can learn something from it as well."

Modafinil doesn't have the addictiveness of amphetamines, and acts pretty much transparently. No side effects noted, except for an oddly scented urine (not bad, better actually than usual).",

      "Taking two doses of 100mg (0500h and 1300h) I can wake daily at 0500h and go to sleep at midnight or 0100h, while doing mentally intensive tasks like poetry writing and calculus.",
      "[Experiences]",
      "I do not do and have not done any 'illegal' substances, meth, pot, anything like that. There is nothing I would assume to be a high, not even euphoria, but that's not why I want it, is it? Upon taking the first pill I noticed nothing. As the hours progressed, I found myself doing things I usually hate, dishes, laundry, cleaning my room, and completing homework with absolutely no feeling of sleepiness. At times, I sat and waited for the usual feeling of dozing off, but it just wouldn't come. I then completed all my tasks and fell asleep at about 0100h. I woke to my alarm, after unusually vivid dreams at 0500h, and went to an early morning meeting. The 'morning' feeling was gone. I wasn't lethargic, or falling over myself trying to shower or dress, and was basically ready to go. At times, I felt as if I were shivering, but I was not actually moving. Somewhat resembled an orgasm, in ways, not euphoric, but quite pleasant.",

      "I recommend highly to anyone that feels that there are not enough hours in the day. This has, in itself, improved the quality of my life.",

      "The following was the strangest, and most unexpected of my many experiences with Marijuana. Reflecting upon it, I still do not understand why this experience was so intense. The only thing I am truly sure off is that it changed my beliefs about Cannabis, and the people I knew.",
      "Before I begin recounting the experience I will provide some  Background information on myself and those present.",
      "I - Male, age: 15, Weight 187lbs, Height: 61, 2 years of experience with psychoactives. No prescriptions or Supplements.",

      "Friend M- Male, Age 15, Weight 120lbs, Height 53, no experience with psychoactives, no prescriptions or supplements. Observer.",
      "The date was November 24th 2006.",
      "I and my friends E, R, and L sat it lawn chairs under the stars in Js back yard. I was completely relaxed, my mind was at ease, and I was ready to smoke. I could hear the soft buzzing and thrumming of the air conditioner in the distance, as well as numerous small insect noises.",
      "T 11:35 PM L brought out the bag of beautiful and highly potent hydroponic Cannabis. L prepared the first bowl of with a large green, silver, and orange bud, and lit it with a torch lighter. Next it was passed to me, and I took a single long draw. I coughed, surprised at the strength of the weed. Within 5 seconds of letting the smoke free I felt the high begin. The bowl was passed from me to E, and then to R. Each of us took a very large hit of smoke.",
      "T 11:40 PM At this point the high truly began. I felt incredible, calm, peaceful, and at ease with my surroundings, that coupled with a warm glowing sensation to from the perfect high. So R, E, L and I sat and talked, about the world, about drugs, about life.",
      "T 11:49-11:53 PM. Two more Bowls of equal or slightly greater size than the first are shared between R, L, and I. E sates that she has smoked enough for the night and so declines both bowls.",
      "T 11:53 PM - This was when the experience became more than a simple smoking experience, and my when my high reached unprecedented levels. I took the final massive hit from the bubbler and felt as though I had punched through some barrier and was now higher than I had ever been. It felt as though a generator had been hooked up into my skeleton and now high voltage power was being passed through it. I could feel my bones buzzing, I saw everything with clarity and yet it seemed distant, and most of all I heard great noises. The thrumming and buzzing of the Air Conditioner shifted into a great booming which filled my ears and a shrill piercing cry which resonated in my skull. I could hear the insects as though they were perched upon my ears, and most of all I heard the voices of R and E (both of whom were nowhere near as high as I was).",
      "They seemed to have changed in some way. Rs Boston accent gained a harping almost wailing quality to it, and Es seemed to become dark and full of a hidden malice. L remained unchanged but for a more dull and timid quality to her voice. However she seemed to change. She seemed almost sheep: timid, slow and stupid, but with a sound heart. I stared at her, intrigued by this, all the while feeling/hearing the great buzzing. I looked up startled to hear two voices, that of Es brothers Q and M, coming towards us. They did not and could not know what we were doing, and thus E and R quickly devised a plan to distract them so that I and L (who were far too high to conceal it) could go inside. R began to speak with Q and M and I then noticed the same change of perception of her and E that I had just witnessed in L.",
      "R began to chat in her now twangy and wailing tone. She seemed to me to be most like an older woman, a witch even. She was quick, powerful, bold, but her heart was as cold as Ice, and her voice seemed to be filled with corruption. E meanwhile had undergone a similar transformation in my perception of her. She seemed to be some great evil. She sat knees drawn up to her chest in her chair clacking her nails, her face mostly hidden. It terrified me for every time she spoke I had the thought of evil, something cunning beyond all else, with a heart as cold as ice, a bold and powerful mind, and a palpable malice. Q and M seemed to be unchanged, if a little more annoying. I sat outside with the worst elements of my friends, paranoid, and filled with great buzzing for 35 minutes.",
      "T 12:48 AM  I finally had an excuse to leave when R convinced Q to strip. L, E, and I then ran for the house to escape that and moved into Es room. I had by this point come down significantly, and the buzzing no longer seemed to fill me, and the images that I had conjured in my mind had dissipated. By the time R re-entered the room at 1:00 all impression of the wailing Bostonian witch had vanished.",
      "T 1:20 AM - I have now significantly come down all extreme effects of the Cannabis are now gone. I can simply relax and enjoy the high. I dismiss the images that I thought off as nothing more than the product of negativity, and paranoia. I sat and enjoyed the movie we were watching(Snatch) all the while growing closer to my friend R. I had now forgotten the Image that I had created of her earlier and now saw only the person for whom I had strong feelings.",
      "T 1:35 AM - The high is still going strong and I feel wonderful. I have my arm around R now and we are pressed close together in a wonderful embrace while lying on Es Bed. At this point another curious effect occurs. I feel amazing, and I feel a tangible connection between R and I. It seems as though we are sharing emotions through some link. No matter how I try I cannot overcome the urge to sleep, and my eyelids close and I pass into deep slumber wrought with lucid dreams.",
      "T 10:30 AM- I awake, feeling wonderful and rested. My dreams are a swirling vortex of  sight and sound. They evade my grasp like sand within the palm of my hand. I begin the day and spend several hours with E,R and L. I do not recall the images of the night before, or the feeling of the night before. The buzzing has left me.",
      "I remembered the extent of that night a week later. At the time I again dismissed the Images as foolish, a product no doubt of very potent weed and naught else, I did not think at the time that they would provide insight into my friends character. I merely thought them to be irrelevant pipe-dreams.",
      "Yet it is not simply because of the strangeness of the experience that I have filled this account. It is the truthfulness of my visions while in the midst of the Buzzing that truly motivated me to do so. Great examination of the character of E and R on my part over the next few months would bring me to a clear conclusion, the visions I had on that night were a reflection of my friends true dark sides. I realized this when I truly thought into who my friends were and how they acted. R was to a certain extent corrupt as I perceived her to be. E possessed the dark side that was apparent to me that night. L also was exactly the same as I perceived her to be. The visions of the Buzzing were completely accurate.",
      "The only question that remained to me, and one I still have not been able to answer was this. Why was I so effected by this weed? I had smoked high potency weed before, and in far greater quantities. So then what made this experience so powerful?  This is a question that I am still unable to answer. However one thing is for certain. I shall never forget the truth that was revealed to me on that night. In that single experience I learned more about my friends than I had in the months that I had known them for. I also learned that Cannabis can be far more than just a means of recreation. This experience was not a happy, funny, adventure, it was a dark vision of the truth that helped me to change my view of the people I knew."

      "I am rather wary with using illegal drugs, so I decided to try some legal stuff, and the most readily available for me was Catnip. I had tried smoking it a few times, but having nothing to compare it to, I didn't notice any effects. After looking on online for other methods of ingestion, I finally realized that I could make tea out of it! I bought some green tea and filled the tea-bag with catnip. The amount of catnip in the bag was roughly equal to the amount of tea that was in it. I stealthily went to the kitchen, under the guise I was 'making some green tea'. I boiled water and let the bag steep in one cup for about 10-20 minutes. The tea is light and minty, with a titch of saltyness.",
      "Effects: Immediately after taking the first few sips, I felt sedated. Not heavily, but comparable to taking 2-3 25 mg benadryls. This was followed by a little laggy vision, not much, but it was noticeable. There was also small euphoria, heavy limbs and general apathy. Another effect I noticed was bodily warmth, but I'm not sure if it was from drinking hot tea or from the catnip. The effects lasted a total of around 45 minutes. I really liked it, and its good for just sitting at the computer or spacing out alone. Probably not the best party drugs, but definitely worth a try!"

      "I recently got a hold of Ambien to aid with my sleep issues.  The white tablet, 10mg variety.  But of course, I also like to indulge and I am not shy with testing the potential and effects of pharmaceuticals that are new to me. ",
      "For the first 2 nights with the medication, I took 10mg.  Having read the experiences online, I was pretty disappointed because not much happened.  At its most potent, I had a slight body high.  Moving around was pretty fun, to be honest.  I felt very 'off center,' in my own body, as if I were drunk, but the difference being, I hadn't made an ass out of myself to any friends at all.  So that was fun.  But in the end, it was completely lackluster, there were no pattern hallucinations, closed eye visuals, or any changes in my thought processes.  But there was one very interesting result which I will elaborate on in a little bit.",
      "Having been completely underwhelmed, I decided to kick it up a notch to 15mg the third night (one 10mg pill, half of another.)  About 15 minutes passed, and the drug hit me like a truck.  At that point I was officially 'too weird to live.'  It hit me in a type of rush, almost like snorting amphetamines or coke when you have no tolerance, but minus all the speedy stuff.  The transition and blur was just similar.  What followed was this bizarre feeling of feeling completely relaxed and being totally out of my mind - but in a calm way.",
      "The body buzz was cranked to 11, compared to my previous outings.  I wouldn't say it was hard to move around, but rather it was an absolute joy to do so.  Typing, walking, moving my arms - it all brought a huge smile to my face.  I suppose it was a mild form of euphoria.  I decided to talk to my friend on AIM and the monitor 'tilted,' as if it were listening to me, and the keys on my keyboard felt like they were at different heights.  But I was still completely sober in mind to type as I always do.  However, at 15mg, there were still no trippy visuals when looking at the wallpaper or anything.  But oddly enough, I was still completely out of my mind.  I didn't feel entirely present in my own head, but it was in such a way, that it wasn't a very negative or bad thing.  It didn't make me dumb, it didn't make me (feel) more intelligent, there were no negative thoughts, and there weren't really any positive thoughts.  The night felt pretty scripted and I was OK with that.  Being in my own body was a complete joy and I was very relaxed.",
      "I did allude to something else though, and that's how the medication affects my breathing.  And I guess that is also instrumental in how it eases one to sleep, because it doesn't make me at all groggy, or drowsy.  I've been a smoker for 5 years, and I am kind of a chimney now because I am severely depressed & stressed.  I have a smoker's cough and my lung capacity is pretty bad.  Breathing in too heavily makes me let out a cough.  But having ingested 15mg of Ambien, somehow, my breathing was completely fine.  It was like I was 18 again and had never smoked a single cigarette.  I could inhale my entire fill I was able to without coughing.  I could take deep breaths and relax.  For about 4 hours my breathing issues were 'fixed.'  I've never really encountered a medication like this that works so profoundly on an issue it wasn't intended for.",
      "My experiences with Ambien so far have not been negative, but one cannot underestimate the potential of its addictiveness.  It's a very powerful drug.  I don't have any experience with 'downers,' this is probably the closest, but I've never encountered a pharmaceutical quite like ambien.  It'll mess me up something good.  At the end of it all, it'll also help me obtain a relatively peaceful sleep.  I never had any hallucinations or weird feelings of other people being present, or any transcendental mind-altering effects, but it's still very strong.  It made my body completely loopy and I was slightly euphoric.  It was a good time.  That's about all I have to report on Ambien (Zoldipem)."

      "Retrospectively Blue Lotus has been a very beneficial plant ally. Nine months ago I purchased 80g of lotus from an internet vendor having heard of its effects and researching it onLINE. My psychoactive experiences have been reasonably limited, being careful of substances I try, only natural ones that Ive researched. My experience history is cannabis, mushrooms, salvia divinorum and other less powerful plants in the legal arena.",
      "I received the blue lotus after a long wait and was anxious to try it once it arrived. It came in two large packs of dried flower material. Ive tested it smoked in joints, through a hookah, in tincture form and as a tea.",
      "The effects seemed to be similar to how I imagined from descriptions I had earlier read, an alert sedation. I noticed extreme muscle relaxation, a lift in mood and a stoned outlook. The effects are noticeable almost immediately, after one hit held for fifteen to twenty seconds and the familiar sense of well-being and sedation are accomplished. Often I would roll two joints of lotus for each of my friends after grinding it. The supply of lotus never seemed to waver either, the large amount I had lasted, as long as lotus is only smoked, a small quantity lasts a long while.",
      "When blue lotus is smoked a gentle stoned feeling begins and even in the middle of college term, it takes me to a holiday zone. An uplifted feeling, distant troubles and a relaxed body, it gives me that holiday feeling, as best as I can describe. The only drawback of smoked lotus is that it seems to make me incredibly tired, incredibly quickly, which can be an annoyance. The lotus is noticeable and active at low doses, anywhere from 2 to 6 grams is enough to feel its effects.",
      "The two exceedingly large bags of unground lotus arrived, I first noted the smell of the lotus, it was very weak smelling- I could barely smell it whatsoever, the vague fragrance is sweet though. The lotus also burnt well, in the hookah the lotus stays hot and the smoke is easy to continually smoke, the smoke tastes fine and after a while it even has an almost caramel quality.",
      "Ive talked to some friends about the effects of lotus and given one of them, T, some, after sessions at my house. I would definitely say that lotus has an almost anti-addictive quality, it never jumps into my mind, I never get cravings or feel particularly like smoking some. Until of course I take a few hits of it, feel the effects- the positive effects and decide to smoke some more.",
      "The effects of lotus also seems very synergistic with other plants and herbs. Cannabis and blue lotus seem synergistic in so much as the effects of cannabis are calmed to some degree. The difference between a cannabis experience and a cannabis and lotus experience is that there is a slower mental high. Often with cannabis it seems that my ideas flow too fluidly- once I almost finish one thought I am consumed by the next and have already forgotten the last. The addition of lotus slows down this process making the high much more tranquil. Lotus also makes me notice their environment more, so the cannabis has an expansive feeling attached to it, often it feels like my peripheral vision has been opened up, though this might be due to the dilation of pupils from the weed and the increase of awareness blue lotus results in.",
      "The effects of this lotus also is interesting when combined with tobacco. I imagine the mind is like a line, to the left is sedation, to the right is stimulation. Lotus certainly is an effective sedative and tobacco is seen as a slight stimulant. When these are combined, there is a stretching of the position of my mind on the line and the result for me is the muscle relaxation achieved by lotus yet the mental buzz of tobacco. This is a very good mixture for chilling out with, it is very stress relieving for me. This is interesting and sometimes preferable to lotus on its own due to its relaxing but nonexhaustative qualities, in my opinion.",
      "Another two situations where the effects of blue lotus prove synergistic are when it is combined with calea zacatechichi or alcohol. Lotus and calea mix well because calea tastes very sour on the exhale, when mixed with lotus the taste is nullified. Also calea is mainly smoked for its dream enhancing effects and lotus undeniably induces sleep- which is welcome when linear and detailed dreams may follow. Blue lotus and alcohol synergise well for separate reasons, its effects on alcohol are similar to its effects on cannabis, it cleans up the high and calms it somewhat. The effects of alcohol are present after drinking it in a tincture and are calmer but more disorientating.",
      "I have only made a tea with lotus once, I used about twenty-five grams but shared it with a friend. The effects of this lasted longer, it was weird actually, the tea (unfiltered since I made it at his house) was really difficult to force down but after half an hour I was feeling the familiar effects of lotus but with a new sense of warmth, we finished the tea around one and continued smoking joints of lotus well into the night (we were out of everything but lotus.) The effects were very strong though, we shared eight joints and after a few hours were really quite stoned. The strange part was that when we woke up to go into London, we were still both light, jovial and stoned.",
      "A really relaxed and pleasant mood continued for hours. On the journey however I experienced effects I never had from blue lotus, a comedown, and a hard comedown at that, me and my friend T just sat on the train in silence, both staring blankly around the train, my thoughts were spiraling very negatively which is very rare considering my optimistic nature- especially around friends. I am sure that this was because of the tea, maybe through use of any method, smoked or drank, this dose would cause depression the day after.",
      "Ultimately though, lotus is certainly a useful herb to have at my disposal, it is the master of synergy, I imagine it goes with everything really, except psychedelics, I have tried it with salvia and no difference was noticeable to be honest, I suppose its because psychedelics arent really on the mind line that I mentioned, only partially sedating or stimulating, I cannot be sure though, some psychedelics might synergise with blue lotus, Ive only attempted with salvia."

      "First, a little background info on me. I am a 22 year old male. When I first used Viagra I was 19. I am taking the following prescription medications. Zyprexa 20mg, Minocycline 200mg, and Adderall XR 20mg, a day. Through some research and talking with my  psychiatrist and therapist, I have come to suspect that the Zyprexa is the culprit for causing my Erectile Dysfunction and Decreased Libido.  From what I can tell.",
      "From personal experience, I can say that other drugs that are also used for treatment of Erectile Dysfunction do not work as well or as fast. For example Cialis. I took cialis one day, waited a half an hour, then two hours and I wasnt even able get an erection after physical stimulation. Viagra has worked the best for me. After taking two 100mg Viagra pills, I was able to achieve and maintain an erection when physical stimulation was used. This affect with me usually takes anywhere from fifteen minutes to a half hour.",
      "After the stimulation was stopped, my erection went away in about five minutes, and didnt come back until sexual stimulation was applied again. This happened for a good four hours. So for four hours I was able to have sex with little time in between to recuperate. I must add, along with the physical part of it helping with my erection, it also gave me greater sexual appetite, and sex was more enjoyable and pleasure was increased. I have used Viagra many times since then with the same affects and benefits."

      "At about 2 in the afternoon, I crushed it up and snorted it. I immediatley felt a head rush, not much of a head rush but it was significant enough to know I was gonna have a good time. Approximately 20 minutes later my body felt very good like I was floating, very much like a heroin high. I felt very blissful and euphoric. I was very itchy the whole time it lasted. About an hour after I ingested the pill, my eyes began to feel heavy. I wasnt quite nodding off, just sleepy I guess. The body feeling kept progressing as time went on. Out of nowhere my stomach felt upset for a few minutes and I puked, very very little though, but once it came up I felt great. Puking didnt decrease my high one bit, it actually made it better. About an hour after that I was in the car going for a ride and I started to nod off a lot. I couldnt keep my head up and when I did I would have double vision untill I shook it off, but it would start again once I could see straight so I just kept my eyes closed, mind you I was still feeling euphoria. I then passed out at about 10pm sitting at my computer. Lol. It was very fun and I will definitely be doing it again."

MDMA and meth passed very quickly as did all the other drugs, amphetamine also passed but it did seem as if the line may have taken a bit longer to form and as if it may have been a tad bit lighter than the other lines. But regardless, it still passed and the line was very real, although perhaps just a tad bit lighter than the other lines. This could be for tons of reasons I assume but it really doesn't matter because it was dark enough to pass."

      "This stuff is seriously weird. It contains several chemicals with dissimilar effects. Several hours after the seeds have been chewed (not swallowed whole) I felt a strong sense of lethargy and sleepyness. I came up with this dose after some not terribly cautious experimentation. I would actually suggest setting an alarm for an hour later, as a different chemical/chemicals take effect. This is where things become interesting.",
      "Music began to sound very good. The electronica, of which I'd lately become bored, became interesting and fresh again. In between the songs, I discovered that I could make out what my neighbors were saying. The supplier claimed that some indiginous people somewhere used it for hunting. I believe this to not be because of it's stimulant properties, but rather because hearing becomes much much more acute. I was also struck by the realization that my neighbor's conversations were incredibly inane. Think - apartment chemical druggy warfare!",
      "These seeds also had a very strange effect on my spacial perception. It appeared to make things more 3d, in an impossible to explain way. I normally have a disorder which interfears with spacial perception (Gertsman's Developmental Syndrome or something like that). I noticed for the first time on my favorite 1st person shootemup game, that one of the levels was not quite physically possible. Bizarre.",
      "Along with my increased sense of space, came interesting mathmatical effects. I discovered, while attempting to up the dose, that I was completely unable to count above 30something. After 30something I would inevitably be unable to continue. This provided me with much amusement (Dude! I can't count! AWESOME!).",
      "The head space was fairly similar to other hallucinogens I have done - but somewhat less disorienting than say, equivalently strong doses of acid. Lastly the visuals were not terribly prominent. There was a bright sparkly texture to the air, slight swirlyness of vision, and such. For much more interesting visuals, I take a benzo (like ativan).",
      "Oh yes, this stuff contains ibogaine, and perhaps has antiaddictive properties? I have come to the conclusion that this, and most likely the iboga plant, is a placebo in that regard. At best it may cause mild, temporary remission of withdrawl symptoms (in this case nicotine)."

      "With the increasing reports of 2C-T-7 deaths by insufflation, I decided to make this trip report hoping maybe it would save some lives. It seems that the reason people snort 2C-T-7 is because it is cheaper than taking it orally, I doubt anyone would actually prefer snorting it if the cost was the same. Well, smoking 2C-T-7 seems to be fairly safe, at least safer than snorting because it allows a level of user titration to the effects. A FOAF placed a small amount of 2C-T-7 powder (about the size of a match-head) on a piece of aluminum foil, and proceeded to light it from the bottom using a very small flame and inhaling the smoke through a glass tube. The smoke was noted to have an odd taste, not extremely unpleasant, certainly not as unpleasant as snorting it.",
      "The smoke was harsh, and a good indicator of the amount to inhale seems to be that an amount just below what triggers the coughing reflex is a good-sized hit. The flame was held far away from the foil as the 2C-T-7 vaporized very readily and too much flame caused it to decompose. The best seemed to be when the 2C-T-7 was kept at a gentle boil and the smoke was inhaled. It took about three inhalations to get the match-head-sized dose finished, at which point I waited for one minute to survey the effects. I then repeated, with two additional match-head sized amounts spaced at approximately three-minute intervals.",
      "At this point, about 10 minutes after I started smoking it and had smoked probably around 4mg or so, visuals were extremely heavy, probably equivalent to an oral dose of 50mg. I was feeling pretty good, had some nausea during the smoking but never vomited. I am writing this about 6 hours after smoking it, and I am still tripping at probably the level of a 20mg oral dose.",
      "I have snorted 2C-T-7 on several occasions previously, and this is now my preferred method... I have smoked it five times, this being my fifth time, and it was always easy to bring it up to the level that I wanted it, and even to hold it there by smoking a very small booster dose when the effects began to fade."

      "Hello there.  Seeing that there is very little info on Kanna (Kagoued to the Dutch) here or anywhere else on the net, I thought I'd share a few things.  This is quite an interesting plant with substantial historical use.  It also can be grown easily in one's home from cuttings or seeds.  It gives a nice, mild buzz.  And it's completely legal. ",
      "I ordered some dried Sceletium Tortuosum powder on the net a few weeks ago and have enjoyed it on several occasions.  There are many ways to do it including smoking, snuffing, or holding it in your mouth and swallowing the juices.  For my first experience I tried all three.  First I snuffed about 50 mg, a very small amount.  It burns a little, but quickly goes away.",
      "Next I put another 50 mg on top of enough MJ to keep the powder from pulling through my pipe.  Different taste, but not bad.  For good measure, I also put a pinch under my tongue and swished it around for a couple minutes.  Five or ten minutes after this the effects started.  It was kinda mild, but nice.  It was very similar to the feeling I get right after finishing a fat bowl of MJ, except without the full stone.  It was more like the physical effects of MJ with the euphoria but without the hazy feeling.  It also made my legs and arms sort of tingly.  Very pleasant.",
      "It's definately worth a try.  It's even well known in Holland.  That says something when the Dutch can get all the best buds around and they still mess with this stuff.  Anyway, it's also good on top of MJ.  A definate enhancer.  Makes the buds go much farther.  Dried herb is kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way and it can be grown easily and legally for next to nothing."

We bought a half gallon oforange juice, picked up the drugs, then headed to 'M's house like last time. With a smile, we downed the drugs and chugged our drinks. Remembering how long it takes to kick in, we decided to go for a walk. Not wanting to get too high too far away from 'M's house, I felt a little uneasy, but shrugged it off.",
      "We walked until we came to a shady boondock apartment complex. Around twenty minutes had passed, and all the talking from the apartments seemed to be very loud and echoing all around me. 'M' seemed to be beginning to feel his trip too because he started laughing and saying how we should head back Now! With a laugh, we ran all the way home, and on the way I began to notice a bright shining on everything around me. A yeild sign looked like it was glowing, and this strong an effect so early startled me a little, but I pushed that negativity away and we settled into 'M's room.",
      "I pulled out my iPod with a playlist that was made for a trip, but the scrolling text on my iPod began to look strange. It appeared similiar to the language of Predator's in the film. The thin wire from the headphones felt strange against my arm and neck - almost like chewed gum. I felt it sticking all over me. I sat down on the floor and felt the hairy rug with my hands, but everything felt sticky. I felt like there were loose hairs on my lips and tongue so i kept picking at them. 'M' seemed to be enjoying himself on his computer, and the disconnection between us made me feel very alone. I had a horrible feeling that things were going to get way worse since barely an hour had gone by and effects this severe were beginning. Fear ripped at my chest and I felt that my only escape was to try to resist it.",
      "Big mistake. I held on to my ego and my sanity with clenched teeth and closed eyes, and in the dark I began to see patterns. Subtle at first but then extremely vivid. Fractal shapes and colors spun around infinity and flashes of objects appeared. I saw a man in a ringleader outfit beckoning me to go deeper into the wormhole. Strange creatures and faces appeared but then melted into new ones, most of which were startling and threatening. I opened my eyes but the bed I had been in was flowing and the ceiling looked a like a huge smooth crater. It pulsated and churned while dripping sounds and colors onto me and the bed, which now looked wide and infinite.",
      "'M' was talking to me but he sounded miles away. Every time I blinked I was sucked into that dark world again, only for a moment, but it lagged into my open eye visions. 'M' jumped onto the bed and started playing Grand Theft Auto 3. He offered me the controller, but I couldn't understand what it was, or where I was. I poked it and noticed I could control my body, but then I didn't understand what my body was, or why I had one. I then realized I was a human, but I couldn't understand why, or what my name was. I was absolutely terrified by this. I tried despirately to sleep, and finally I drifted into a constant nightmare. The closed eye visions became reality and I was pulled, pushed, and thrown through a world of colors, shapes, and strange creatures. I was spoken to, but I couldn't understand. I would be me in this world, but then a moment later I'd be the ground, or the wall, or the air. Neon lights flashed and zipped by, all while I was still moving through this fractal tunnel.",
      "The audio of the game 'M' was playing filled my world, and the shouts, songs, and hum of cars sped up, slowed down, stretching and contorting all around and within me. 'M' would talk to me but his words were jumbled and didn't feel as if they were directed to me. Occasionally I'd drift back into a very twisted and warped normal reality, in which I'd say a word or two that I can't remember to 'M', and interact with him or an object briefly, but the constant terror and loss of sanity was too much for me. I'd fall back into the bed and be sucked back into the insanity.",
      "'M' sprayed a cologne in the air and the smell became overpowering and I felt like I couldn't escape it. I then realized that despite losing myself completely, one part of me remained, the voice that said to KEEP BREATHING. I had been focusing on my breathing the entire time. When I fell back into the trip world, I lost touch with my body and couldn't tell if I was breathing.",
      "My halucinations became more vivid and I began to absolutely panic. I remembered that I had taken a drug, but that filled me with more fear. I didn't think anyone could handle what was happening to me, and I was certain that I had taken too much, or had an allergic reaction to the shrooms. Either way, I felt that I was dying. I looked at the posters all over 'M's wall and they were moving so fast they were blurring. Eyes would stare at me, voices would tell me millions of things at different speeds. Throughout all of this, 'M's computer was playing Dub music off an internet radio program. The pitch of the songs along with the tempo would slow down until it was unaudible, but then would shoot back to normal speed and pitch.",
      "I wanted to tell 'M' to  take me to a hospital, but I had no idea how to say it. Communication didn't make sense to me, and I couldn't understand what language my thoughts were in.",
      "Then I entered a phase that I can't even begin to describe. Reality as I had come to know it was being swirled around me at lightning speeds. Words, songs, sounds, and voices would all be thrown at me in different volumes. I heard a cat meow, a man scream, a laugh, a trumpet blast, a car alarm, just about every sound I had ever heard in my life. All of these spun around me and I couldn't do anything but let it wash over me. I tried to form a thought but it would get sucked into the vortex. I'd try despirately to cling to something, some small fragment of myself, but every thought would go into this whirlpool.",
      "The swirling entity turned and formed into the wall opposite the bed. I was being slowly pulled into it and I looked around, but could see all of it. I was omniscent in this void. I'd look up and down as I went through the tunnel, but it was almost like someone shot a hole thorugh a book and was flipping the pages. I was moving through thousands of walls with a hole in the same spot. As I moved through these layers I realized I could start forming thoughts. I began to think of a class I had earlier in that day, and of the people in it. I felt that just hours earlier I was in school, learning, being productive, making a difference in my life.",
      "I thought I was such a fool to leave that sanity behind for this new, and seemingly endless nightmare reality. I thought of my father, and my friends, all living their lives healthily. I began to long for my sanity again, so bad that I almost cried. Soon after this I could feel myself breathing again, and the walls weren't moving as severely. I remembered my name, where I was, and what I had just done. I sat up and took huge breaths, realizing I was coming down.",
      "I rolled out of bed and talked to 'M', who was on the computer. I couldn't use even a fraction of my normal vocabulary, but I wanted, NEEDED, to talk about what just happened. When 'M' turned around I was startled to see his face was pulsating and morphing as if he was a character in a game with bad, glitching graphics. I was still very high but didn't feel the sense of falling or being sucked in, so this type of visual hallucination wasn't overwhelming at all. In fact it was kind of humourous. I looked at my hands and they were pulsating and morphing as well.",
      "I sat down and opened a beer, drinking it deeply and trying to go over in my head what had just happened. I was covered in sweat and apparently had been chewing gum earlier, which was now all over my shirt. And speaking of my shirt, I had a completely different one on somehow. A large portion of this trip is completely unexplainable, and there are things I can't remember. My heart was racing for hours after coming down, and after around 40 minutes, the pulsating visuals went away and I was somewhat sober.",
      "This experience was life-changing. I had never been more frightened, vulnerable, and helpless in my entire life. This has scarred me deeply, but I'm learning to think of it as an educational experience, not a nightmare. I don't regret it at all."

      "One weekday night, a friend and i had nothing to do, no weed, no alcohol, nothing. then my friend decides that it is time to break out the 3 bags of 2C-T-7 (3, 10mg bags) that he had wanted to save and do all himself. he explained to me that he really wanted to save it for he loved its effects the 2 times he had done it before but was willing to let me have one of the bags for myself while he would have 2 for himself so that the night would not be wasted. He then proceeded to explain that once the small bag of powder was snorted, that the eye on the same side as the ingesting nostril would begin to tear rapidly followed by the sharpest pain imaginable in that same nostril. then he explained that 1 to 2 minutes later i should feel somewhat dizzy and possibly nauseated.",
      "  Well, all of the things he had told me to expect all came true, every last detail, but he forgot to add one thing, that if i had had anything to eat prior to snorting the 2C-T-7 that i might feel an incredible and unstoppable urge to puke.",
      "  i then responded telling him that i did feel like puking but that i wouldnt because generally, i can choke it back whenever i drink or feel like throwing up.",
      "   well 2 minutes later,(about 20 minutes after snorting it) i ran to the bathroom because throwing up was inevitable. i almost didnt even make it to the toilet. i never puked so hard in my life but afterwards i looked at my self in the mirror and realized how horrible i looked and my face was bright red and both eyes were more bloodshot than i ever had seen. i walked back to his room and he laughed and said that he expected that i would puke.",
      "   I sat down, with an awsome feeling of dizziness and extreme comfortabilty. i was no longer nauseated. now here is where the visuals kicked in.",
      "    My friend has a giant POW-MIA banner on his wall. I looked at it as it hung completely flush against his wall with very few ripples in it. all of a sudden it started to move around more and more untill it looked like a flag that u would see high up in the air blowing proudly and violently in the wind. i really couldnt believe my eyes. i blinked a few times to see if i could snap out of it but it didnt work, the flag still flapped in the non-existing wind. then minutes later as we watched tv and looked around the room and also had an in depth conversation all at the same time, i looked at my friends wall out of the corner of my eye at a few spots on the wall where paint was chipped off . i quickly looked over at the chipped spots on the wall and i could have sworn that they were roaches crawling around on his wall, i continued to look in shock for anbother 3 seconds or so and then the roaches disappeared and turned back into chipped paint. i looked at him and told him that this was the most incredible drug i have ever done.",
      "   the rest of the night i had many other amazing visuals and other things as well including my friends face turning diiferent bright glowing colors as i spoke with him.  Coming down from this hallucinogen was very pleasent and relaxing and followed by very enjoyable sleep. the trip lasted about 3 hours or so and was well worth the extreme pain in my nose and severe vomitting."

    "report": [
      "This last Saturday night, a few friends and I set out to do a little tripping... One of my friends was house sitting for a family that had a chill little house in the northern suburbs of Chicago.  My friend R and I took two doses of blotter marked with a sunshine symbol at 9pm.  We waited at the house for the other two, A and B, who were at a local bar finishing a pitcher.  When they arrived, at about 10pm, R and I had already started to feel the acid.  A and B both took three doses and we all started drinking beers and smoking bowls.",
      "This acid was very good; the doses were not very strong, but very smooth and clean.  We spent the first few hours of our trip listening to music, drinking beer, and smoking cigarettes and weed.  The mood was light, we were all laughing and having a good time.  I felt GREAT... I have tripped about 20 times in the past, taking 1-6 doses each time and this night seemed like it had the potential to be one of my best trips yet.  At about 12:30, 3 hours into my trip, we smoked a bowl of marijuana with a big pinch of Salvia extract on top.  We didn't intend to experience the breakthrough salvia trip, just add a little buzz to all the buzzing already in our heads.  The Salvia had seemingly no affect on the group and we continued our drinking and smoking. ",
      "At about 1am, the whole group was on the roof of the house smoking cigarettes and bowls.  We were all talking quietly about the nice weather and how beautiful everything was, but R kept raising his voice.  We asked him to be quiet because he would surely awaken the surrounding neighbors; R responded, louder than ever, that he understood.  However, R just got louder... He started talking about how he wanted a pillow and a blanket so he could sleep on the roof.  Soon it was evident that R didn't understand us and after a few minutes of trying to communicate with him, we ended up forcefully taking him off the roof so that he wouldn't hurt himself.  We walked him into the house and sat him on the couch.",
      "Inside the house, R continued to get weirder and weirder... All he would do in response to anything that we said to him was yell 'exactly.'  He went on for almost an hour, yelling 'exactly' and talking about 'the sounds, me and E (that's me) can control it.'  We realized that R was now so loud that even from inside the house, his yelling was audible throughout the neighborhood.  We decided that he needed to go into the basement.  We had tried to talk him down for about an hour now and he was just getting worse.  We couldn't get him to move, so we all sort of grabbed him and started to lazily push him to the basement.  He fought us with everything he had (thank goodness he's a skinny fucker) but we weren't on guard for what he was about to do.  He freed himself from our grip (which probably wasn't too hard considering we were all a little hesitant about having to physically restrain our friend) then he sprinted to the door.  Before we could stop him, he was outside.  A and I followed him towards the back yard but we stopped dead in the garage when we heard a woman's voice asking 'is he ok.'  We saw two female figures in approaching the garage while we listened to R screaming about how he was going to die in the backyard.  As the two women approached, it became evident that they were about 21, our age.  They asked if he was tripping, and offered to help talk him down. ",
      "The two girls (whose names I don't even remember, we'll call them Y and Z), A and I ventured into the backyard to retrieve R.  At this point, he was completely naked, running around screaming that he was going to die.  We fought him back into the house and this girl started trying to talk him down.  He was still screaming that he was going to die so we decided it was time to try and take him to the basement again.  We got him down there, and he was sitting between one of the girls and me.  I had him locked in a half-nelson, my arm locked up in his shoulders, so that he wouldn't get away, but as soon as he started to relax, I loosened my grip.  As I loosened my grip, R tried to get off the couch and run.  I punched him as hard as I could in the middle of the face; he barely flinched.  This was the first time I had ever punched anyone in the face... but I can honestly say that I was hoping I'd knock him out with that punch.  In retrospect, this all seems so messed up, getting violent with a good friend but it reveals the desperate nature of the situation.  A, B, and I were all really high and drunk and after three hours of dealing with this crazy kid, we were reaching our limits.",
      "We didn't know what to do... dropping R off at his house would have been ruthless - his parents surely wouldn't have understood... bringing him to the hospital seemed unnecessary because he seemed physically normal aside from an elevated pulse... but we all figured we'd end up in jail if he kept yelling.  We decided to just wait it out; at this point he had been tripping for six hours so it couldn't last too much longer.  The next three hours were bizarre.  We all watched R, lying naked on this girl who was trying to talk him down.  He did some super weird stuff like trying to hump the girl.  He foamed at the mouth for three hours, urinated all over himself, and kept repeating bizarre phrases while playing with his genitals the whole time.  He didn't look human at all... therehe wasn't R behind histhose eyes, just a blank confused stare. ",
      "As the sun began to rise, R had become very quiet.  Perhaps he had just exhausted himself, but the important thisthing was that he had stopped yelling.  He continued to mumble weird stuff and couldn't communicate with any of us.  Eventually, a sober driver showed up to take R to our friends apartment.  We argued for a while about who would do the honors and put on his underwear so we could drive him around, then we carried him upstairs while he fought us.  We stood him up at the front door of the house and attempted to dress him, but he fought his clothes off.  He was standing, but he wouldn't move so we pushed him across the driveway and into the car.  We drove about 10 mins to our friends apartment, pushed him into the apartment, and got him into a bed.  We sat back and smoked a bowl, relieved at having finally ending the night.  Just five minutes after going to bed, R emerged from the bedroom completely normal.  He didn't remember anything about the night... he vaguely remembered us pushing him into the car and he remembered the girl's face on a turtles body, but he thought he was asleep the whole time.  He smoked a bowl with us; we went out for a big greasy breakfast and passed out. ",
      "This was one of the most bizarre nights of my life; yet, I think that lots of good will come from it.  I have discovered that most of what I learned about drugs from school and the media was full of misconceptions and bias.  This discovery has perhaps made me skeptical of any negative effects of drugs.  Before this experience, I thought that only people that were really weird to begin with tweaked out on acid.  I figured that if I had a bad trip myself or was involved with a friend that was having a bad trip, I could deal with it easily.  Seeing my friend turn from a normal kid into what resembled a maniac mental patient gave me a lot of respect for the power of LSD.  First of all, I decided that while drinking on acid had become common it is a big mistake because lowered inhibitions don't mix well with ego loss and hallucination.  Second, I now believe in babysitters - a concept that I used to find absurd for relatively low dose trips.  Third of all, for all of you who like myself, think that they can control the mind-bending of acid, think of your friends because you never know if they can.  Monitor the people you're tripping with and look for signs that they might be loosing it, maybe you can stop it before it turns into the fiasco that I dealt with.  Believe me, you don't want to be put in a situation where you feel that you have to try and punch out your helpless friend.",
      "A little side note... I have seen people having bad trips before and they looked nothing like my friend.  R seemed inhuman, repeating weird stuff and fighting us; I really wasn't prepared for this - when I hear him say 'exactly', scenes from the night pop into my head.  I have a little theory about R... I think he may have had a six-hour seizure (I dunno if this is even possible.)  The last thing he remembers was mentally playing with the sounds of the music in his head, making them start and stop.  I suppose this could have triggered some sort of brain wave disruption and a seizure - oh yeah, he was having convulsions for a while too...  My theory is that going to bed for a couple of minutes in a dark room removed all stimuli and his seizure ended.  Anyways, Im not a doctor, just some ideas but Id appreciate input from anybody else that has dealt with a similar situation.",
      "All of you, enjoy your drugs, respect your drugs, respect yourself, and always make sure you're equipped to deal with the worst possible situation."

      "A while back, when I first heard about Salvia Divinorum, I purchased a sample package from an online company, which contained a nice selection of different varieties of their herbal products, including the salvia 20x (woah!), a couple different herbal smoking blends, blue lotus, some nice yopo seeds (which after a few absolutley mind blowing salvia trips, I'm now a little more open to trying that special little lady), as well as a few grams of wild dagga, and wild dagga flowers. Up until now, I haven't smoked much more than the salvia & the blends, and have been putting the wild dagga off. I recently started reading a little more on our friends dagga, and it sounded like it wouldn't put me on my ass too hard, so last night I gave it a try.",
      "I ground up the leafs in my mortar & pestle (just preference, I like the stone on stone feeling as opposed to the electric grinders). I then packed a nice little wooden bowl that I bought for my 'legal' herbs, which is roughly about enough for 6-7 pulls, and then on top of that, I placed 3 of the choicest flowers from the bag.",
      "The smoke itself was slightly harsh, but bearable. Not unpleasent tasting, but I suggest mixing it with some other of your favorite smoking herb, just to cut the slight roughness in the throat. It did produce from me a little more phlegm and saliva, but nothing too bad.",
      "The feeling I got from it was that of very mild marijuana buzz. No insightful musings or anything psychadelic, just a calmed, relaxed, mellow state of being. This lasted for about 20 minutes or so, until I went to sleep. Now, this is where dagga really worked her magick.",
      "So, I had a pretty deep sleep, and I had one 2-part dream, that I can remember, just before the damn alarm went off. now, lately I haven't been remembering my dreams. I used to have very vivid dreamscapes, mostly when I was smoking ALOT of weed, and experimenting with psychadelics, meditation, yoga, astral projection and all that WONDERFUL stuff. I have been a fool as of the last few years, and have been really slacking on that part, but as of late, I haven't been able to recall any very vivid dreams. This is how the dream went.",
      "It started, from what I can recall, with me walking down a street, until I came to a river embankment, which for some reason had a station for a sky tram that went over the river, which was surrounded by a small Egyptian themed amusement park/museum of sorts, with all manner of pyramids, obelisks, and a great statue of Anubis. So, I get on the tram, and travel over the river, and when I get off, I meet a small African boy, who is pushing a wooden cart. He tells me that he needs to go see his uncle, to bring him something. I go with him through the jungle, and in this cart he is pushing is about an inch or two of some dark looking liquid.",
      "So, we get to a clearing and his uncle is there waiting for us. He comes over, and produces a cup, which he dips into the dark liquid, and then pours it right back in the cart. Apparently this is all the boy needed to do, because he turns and start walking back. I follow, and then turn around to see the rest of the tribe surrounding the uncle, and they are all waving their arms to come back, but the boy doesn't turn around. We get to a shoreline, and there is a giant wooden boat/storefront, almost like a walk up window at a fast food place. A white woman comes outside the boat with a cart of her own, which has some bottles containing dark fluid that resembles the liquid in the cart. The bottles are labeled like soda bottles, and the name on them is either Tahi or Tathi. She then tells me that I am not ready for this and turns to go back in the boat, and then I wake up.",
      "Well, my interpretation of the dream is that the fluid represents the dagga, which can possibly be made into a tea. Now the white woman telling me that I'm not ready, just means that she is a representation of our European overlords, who don't want us to find out our true nature as gods in human form. Now, before you get all antsy, I'm white, but I know the deal. We all came originally from Africa, but somewhere along the line, the Europeans took over the entire globe, and now we can't get legal weed, but I digress. Anyways, the dark fluid can also represent the dark matter of the universe, or melanin, the pineal gland/third eye, which is in all of us, and is the key to unlocking our minds and finding the potential for our spirits to ascend and seek out or souls.",
      "Well, in summary, Wild Dagga is a good herb to smoke for relaxation, as well as a tool to go into deep REM sleep and take a journey to your subconcious mind. I highly reccomend it, and am going to be buying an ounce soon, so I can make some of that special 'dark matter tea', explore the effects, and I report on it when I do. Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have much fun on your explorations. Namaste and Ashay!"

      "1g Ecuador & 1g Dutch King @ 1.47pm",
      "This journey was heavily influences by the myriad things recently digested and rolling about in my brain, primarily Daniel Pinchbeck's book '2012 The Year of the Mayan Prophesy', the recent downfall of snow and the films 'Grizzly Man' and 'A Scanner Darkly'.",
      "I felt pleasantly and surprisingly energized with a positive vibe in the morning, having a confidence in the trip, and myself, which I have never quite felt before. With no real nerves or nausea at all, the trip had a calm natural evolution, the transition from ground state through visionary states and back again was smooth, feeling absolutely integrated with my life, as natural as the tide rolling in and out through the passage of a day.",
      "'Medulla' playing, just into the early stages I reflected on the utter clarity of mind mushrooms bring, I feel totally in the moment with no thoughts at all other than the immediacy of existence through all senses, focus is completely on just the reception of information. I focused on creating a 'Swirls' picture with the felt pens in my notebook, which after declaring it finished I would eventually fuck up by over-ornamenting it. I added to the 'L' shaped pattern again, which is still not finished!",
      "Surprisingly early on, the first closed eye visuals I had whooshed me up into a cloudlike murk of greens. It was as if I had poked my head up into an intergalactic/interdimensional meeting place. The impression was of various species sat round in a circle about to discuss things of great import, perhaps involving me, or maybe I was an emissary as well. Even though I couldn't see desks, I sensed them and I particularly recall a being with a squid-like head.",
      "I think of the peak as 'The Download'. I was hurtling through worlds and landscapes of information. Two three dimensional shadows hung in the air in the air in front of then beside me. Initially it was overwhelmingly rapid, and I felt concern about freaking out. I relinquished my fear and relaxed into it passively letting them pour the information into my head. By doing so the CEVs melted through and into me, becoming a 360-degree experience in which I was enmeshed with what I perceived. The clear light circled and arched around the edges of everything. I can recall with clarity a scroll rolled down by two 'Greys', an absurd mix of ancient and futuristic connotations. Along with the ideas in the Pinchbeck book, the new laptop, with its CD burner, Amy had just bought, definitely influenced the theme of downloaded information.",
      "There was the feeling of vast amounts of ancient and alien knowledge being stored in hitherto unused parts of my brain, which I moved my thoughts through as if I were rediscovering and exercising them. Wondering what 'powers' I may have gained I later, half jokingly, tried to make Socrates and myself levitate. During the onslaught of information I telepathically asked 'Why me? Why this time?' and received the answer 'It's always like this. This is what always happens!' The essence of what they were imparting/teaching me was a message of promoting harmony and interconnection, the notion of 'god' in everyone with a Jesus style acceptance of responsibility. I felt deemed a potentially harmonious man, with a sense of congratulations towards me for trying to be as good a person as I can.",
      "To counterbalance this positiveness, thoughts turned to the issues I'd been having with a person at work I had got along with until recently, who in the trip I saw as both a reflection (He has a slightly similar temperament to me, or rather how I used to be) and utter diametrically opposed contrast. I must admit to feeling some jealousy, as he is a talented guitarist, sometimes playing gigs, which reflects my wish to be musical again. Recently he seemed to have taken umbrage at something and appeared to mock aspects of my outlook on life.",
      "There was an undercurrent that all the signals being thrown out were so vague that the whole thing could have been in my head. I needed the quiet time of not talking to people at work to gain perspective on life anyway though. I saw him running away from me, looking nervous and scared and hiding behind a pillar. I must note that since this trip things have smoothed out and we are on good terms again.",
      "I was overcome with feeling positively freezing. I had a numb little finger on my left hand and was shivering down to me feet, which brought a brief worry about pneumonia. I would also be concerned about having a heart attack later due to a rapid pulse and chest pain. I wrapped myself up in the sleeping blanket. Bestowing sentience on him I said, 'Come here you' to Socrates, a stuffed grey squirrel monkey soft toy and the best tripping companion ever, as I pulled him over to join me in my snuggled up state. That it had snowed and settled earlier in the week had a great deal of influence on what transpired next.",
      "Whilst the opening of the Younger Brother album 'A Flock of Beeps' played I went into a daydream-like reverie in which I imagined myself as part of an expedition in a snowstorm, which was attacked by bear, and someone was bleeding to death. Blood lapped up over my field of vision, and the sense of this was so strong I had to check to see if I really was bleeding and hadn't noticed, or even if I had pissed myself and become highly confused. This whole passage of the trip was tinged with deja vu, so much so that I thought I had experienced the exact same thing whilst listening to that album before, but I've since realised I hadn't.",
      "I quickly realised that the album was wrong for the mood, perhaps contributing to conjuring up this imagery, and I turned it off. Unlike Shpongle, the music felt cheap, disingenuous, non-organic, especially the jarring samples from 'Alice in Wonderland'. I even had to put it back on the CD shelf, to get it out of the way, beyond my sight. I came face-to-face encounter with a female entity. Part of this is wiped from memory, and only echo remains. I give her a look as if to say, 'I don't deserve this' which she reflected back at me and relented in agreement.",
      "What haunted me briefly post trip was a realisation that the couple of times I felt I might die I had a willing acceptance of it. I continue to wonder if I really thought I might die and was truly accepting of the possibility or if underneath I knew I was, hence my acceptance feeling so easy, or if the whole emotional response related to ego death, or was a metaphor for something else entirely!",
      "Transitioning to a less weird and uneasy frame of mind I sensed of an alien family, with the inference that we were all doing an activity like skiing. There was an annoying father figure who was taking charge and felt an utter clich. I opened my eyes to, successfully, break this vignette.",
      "'Dark Side of the Moon' yet again did the trick and formed a beautiful accompaniment, especially 'Us and Them', to the trees in the gardens behind our flat plumping out, becoming fat with life, their branches twisting with smooth organic animation. My eyes all misty everything blanked out to the view of a snowstorm, with white sweeping through everything my body turned into a mountainscape and I was hit by the thought 'Why am I buried in snow?'",
      "I underwent a visual and emotional morphing progression through a pleasant review of my life. There was an acceptance of errors in a very matter of fact manner. I understood my development through re-experiencing vital junctures of my existence and was imbued with an joy at a complete understanding of myself and how I am who I am. I felt like I was viewing a map of my psyche with a beautiful feeling of fully understanding myself and seeing how you are assembled throughout your life experiences.",
      "The process of re-familiarising myself with the keynotes of my life so far segued into a preparation of what advice I would want/hope to pass on to Jack. The greatest advice was undoubtedly, and undoubtedly based on the follies of my oversexed teenage years: 'Be a gentleman', especially with regards to women. The clouds broke many times and where I was positioned on the sofa the sun (echoing 'son' in my mind) shone down on me many times, surrounding me in a cleansing heavenly glow.",
      "Somewhere along the line I got up and went to the window and looked outside, all I could see had the rotorscope painted look of the films 'Waking Life' and 'A Scanner Darkly'. Surveying the view of the back gardens, filled with kids toys and other paraphernalia I thought 'Am I Bob Arctor?' For a split second I believed I was, illustrating a fusion of various realms of thought and reality in my mind and how deep the trip went into my subconscious.",
      "The music line up was again a mixed bag. After the iconic Floyd the Super Furry Animals album 'Phantom Power' was an okay album to trip to, it filled the gap fairly pleasantly, if a little disappointingly. There was a doubling and tripling of images and ancient/alien text/symbols I have seen many times before rose up through all surfaces emitting meaning beyond ordinary language.",
      "Perhaps echoing Jack's womb bound maneuver, working my way rotating round clockwise I ended up lying upside down on the sofa, my head hanging down. I considered that everything's much better that way round, for one thing there's NO DUST! This may have been somewhat inspired by a photo I had seen at the Tate Modern earlier in the week of the artist upside-down, tied to a chair, reading a book (held upside down). The artist was hanging upside down, but the picture had been inverted. With pleasure at feeling utterly abstracted from ordinary reality I kept completely losing track of time, I felt outside of it, minutes passing ridiculously slowly. The carpet and ceiling swirled with patterns rising and falling, which I seemed to be able to control with my mind somewhat.",
      "As the experience had been quite profound and intense I had delayed taking the second dosage. I was still tripping very hard when I took it at around a quarter to two. I had a bad case of the fidgets, so I forced myself to sit and relax in silence. Chirruping and other sounds familiar from psychedelic music emerged. A golden Buddha/Alien statue confronted me about my identity, in a scene very reminiscent of the stare of the 'confuse a cat' sketch cat. Opening eyes from this, all was roughly, warmly painted (a la Scanner Darkly) and fluid looking/feeling. I felt like I was floating through the sensation of the happiest sunshine day of the year, a comforting, cozy, connected, contented feeling. The light from outside became bright flaring sunlight, the opposite of the snow scene section of the journey, it felt like peak of summer.",
      "I was in hysterics about having to call Amy at 2.30pm due to the incredibly intangible state of reality I found myself in, and the potential impossibility of being able to communicate in a lucid manner.",
      "I only made it through a few track of 'Ziggy Stardust', imagining 70s Bowie as fake, fag, hag scarecrow. Lester Bangs's assessment of him as a poser and phony came to mind and after a few sublime tracks the album became annoying. I turned it off and put on the mix disc I had made the night before. With the mix disc whispering through the flat, after swift rejection of venturing outside into the cold, I went to the bedroom for change of scene. On top of the covers, curled in ball, I found myself on the 'Lost' island, sensing the character Hurly around. Staring into a rock I drifted out of my body and this reality and down through and into holes in the finest detail of the stone, which became hive-like segments, this came with an a feeling of utter comfort and relaxation. I felt in place and utterly peaceful.",
      "I considered the spark of energy and attraction I sometimes feel between myself and one of the women at work. I had had a vivid dream recently in which we had expressed love towards each other, with the true feeling of falling in love again, exchanging a passionate emotionally explosive kiss, only to be upset to wake and find it all to be a dream.",
      "I considered a fantasy of having a relationship with this woman, in an alternate reality where I wasn't with Amy, or if I could split myself in two and live both lives. A lot of this had to do with feelings of loneliness, sexual frustration (I spent a fair amount of time rolling about on the bed in semi sexual positions, or even in anticipation of Amy's birthing positions), a longing for intimacy and a feeling of aging and longing for some aspects of youth, surrounding the pregnancy. I don't really have any feelings of anything other than friendship towards this woman at all, but she seemed to be the closest person in my life I admire beyond my wife. I found myself saying, 'I don't know where I am in my life, or who I am'. This is not really true, I was testing the waters of my subconsciousness, worried that I'm not more worried about the future. Strangely, as if an afterthought on the experience I had already had/was having, I wrote, 'I need a break from myself' in the notebook.",
      "The alarm on my pocket clock went off to indicate that I should call Amy. I rushed into the blindingly bright living room, light flaring in through the window. I nearly tripped over my trouser leg, but my hands quickly restored balance. Amy says I was slurry and odd, in a funny way, on the phone, very vague and talking much nonsense.",
      "Thinking about what I had, perhaps, learnt during the experience I found it hard to define what had actually happened, asking of myself questions that often occur. Was I operated on/modified by an alien intelligence? Do I know have a mass of new information in my mind? Can I access it? How will this modification manifest itself? Thinking about the TV series 'Lost', the ultimate cliffhanger show, I came with what I think is the best, and most intriguing mystery story title ever - 'I wanted to know'.",
      "With the feeling that I hadn't eaten in years, like a madman. I leapt and squealed with excitement about the idea of food. I sat down perched on the precipice of exploding with delight and joy and had the most exciting bowl of cereal ever. I was so amped up that I took some neurofen to take the edge off and avoid the inevitably imminent ache to my mind and eyes. With extreme keenness I organised a mix disc of the only decent songs on various soundtrack and freebie albums we have.",
      "I suddenly, amusedly, realised 'I Am The Walrus' taking that definition to mean that socially I am an outcast. Briefly, due to the extremely draining tone of the experience I worried I'd driven myself insane, or damaged my brain, I also had concerns about not coming down, my brain felt very strange, more so than usual. The odd brain feeling faded and gradually relative normality was back into the driving seat. I barely noticed the transference back to ordinary perception, comfortably drifting into the evening routine."

      "I came across Baclofen one day in 2005 when I ran out of weed and I really needed something to keep my mind off it, because I had no cash and no way of getting weed for a few days. I was searching my house. The only thing I found was a bottle of pills prescribed to my mom as muscle relaxers. I looked them up online and didn't find any information about its effects, besides what I found on Wikipedia.",
      "Being the curious cat I am, I decided to take a few. I think maybe I took 3. These things don't really take effect for awhile. Whether I have a full/empty stomach, I might as well expect to be waiting awhile. After this first dosage, I started to take the Baclofen more and more, seeing as the bottle was a little outdated and assuming my mom wasn't taking them/didn't need them.",
      "My experiences with Baclofen were anywhere from fiending out and needing something to relax, to mixing it with weed, to taking 9-10 20mg tablets just to see what I'd feel like. I'm sure I overdosed on it one time. It really scared me. I was picking at my face in the mirror in the bathroom and ended up taking a chunk of my nose off because I could hardly feel anything at all. All sense of feelings, emotional, physical, whatever...were all weaker...less present, than they normally would be.",
      "I started to hand these things out to my friends to see what they'd say. My best friend took 6, and mixed them with some benzo's and ended up blacking out while driving and crashing into some trees. Luckily he wasn't hurt and his car wasn't very smashed up. He never took them again.",
      "This drug had many positive effects on me. Appetite is increased, anxiety/worries are virtually gone, creativity pours out of me, I feel a quaint vibration from my inner body to the skin. It isn't like anything else I've experienced. Baclofen works wonders for muscle pain compared to any other muscle relaxer that I've taken, and I've taken quite a few different kinds.",
      "These days, I tend to lay low from these drugs unless I really have no other choice and stick to the naturals. They work wonders.",
      "Just thought I'd let you know how this drug affected me.",
      "------------------------------------------------------------",
      "MARCH 2008 FOLLOW-UP REPORT",
      "I first came upon this chemical in my mom's pill collection. I look it up on erowid and bluelight, but couldn't find any info. This was about 2 years ago. In that time I've had much experience with the drug, as well as many other pharmaceuticals (like most people my age...19)",
      "I have taken this in combination with Zoloft, Gabapentin and Adderall, weed and alcohol and have found that alcohol is the only thing that mixes with it in a bad way. I just gotten super sick and puked everywhere when I drank and took this stuff. The tablets were given in the form of 20 milligrams per tablet. I think the highest dose I ever took was maybe 8...so 160mg...but that was when I was taking a lot of this stuff and seemed to develop a tolerance.",
      "When I was stupid and naive, I even sold these things as Valium's for a few months about two summers ago. Nobody could tell the difference (most likely because they didn't have any experience with benzos) and nobody was smart enough to look up the pill ID.",
      "The effects come on slowly, faster on an empty stomach. It's hard to pinpoint the feeling, the only way I could describe it is almost a swift buzzing feeling in the very center of my body. It's quite pleasant at times, and at other times, it just makes me feel like I'm full of disgusting drug metabolites and will be and have been for so long and makes me wonder how long I can keep this lifestyle up.",
      "As of now, I take 20 or 40mg along with my daily doses of Gabapentin (1800mg) and it seems to potentiate its effects. I'm assuming it would do the same with benzos, but I haven't had a chance to try that out.",
      "A few kids told me this stuff made them feel the best they've ever felt and one of my other friends passed out on this shit driving his car and hit a telephone poll. Luckily, he was okay but the car was fucked."

    "report": [
      "Recently life has been more negative than positive, with many old wounds being reopened and a lot of personal work taking precedence over school and career. The specifics of these things are unimportant, but can be summed up with the word 'anxiety.' I have been on a number of antidepressants, including Celexa, Paxil, Effexor, and Wellbutrin, but currently I am off all of these.",
      "Yesterday I was bored, but in a good enough mood. I had ordered some Syrian Rue long ago, but had never really tried it out. I have read quite a bit about the stuff, and I was somewhat worried about what it would do to me if I was not careful, but as I had not had much to eat during the day, I felt I would be okay experimenting with a low dose.",
      "So I took about 3 grams of the seeds and ground them up in a coffee grinder. The resulting brown-red dust and seedbits were then gathered in rough thirds. I took one of these piles and put it into a glass of orange juice, and stirred the mixture with a spoon. I then drank down the mixture, trying to swallow most of the thicker bits. I then went about with some stretching and walked around the house.",
      "A little while later, I noticed myself staring at things for quite a bit longer than usual. I also felt a fair bit of indecision, but it was not uncomfortable. I talked to my brother, and things seemed to go as normal. Looking in the mirror, I looked very normal. However, at this point I had a sense that things were more 'okay' than usual, and that they might be more 'real' than usual. I do not know if these are mere placebo effects, but they may be, as they were quite subtle, and I do not think I have read of harmala having this effect on others.",
      "Anyway, a little while later, I decided to take in another orange juice mixture, and did so. The results were similar to the first try, and I ended up going to a neighborhood hangout down the street.",
      "The warm, moist weather was nice, and I took great satisfaction from watching the people on the streets. When I arrived at my destination, I found some old friends and talked to them. Also there were some folks who I am usually quite annoyed with, but in the state of mind I found myself in, I was far more patient than usual. I found it very pleasant to just be silent and listen to people. Admittedly, I am a sort of quiet person most of the time, but that aspect of myself seemed to be very much enhanced.",
      "I ended up heading home at around midnight, still feeling quite pleased, quite calm, but certainly not euphoric. I felt then that this was what I had wished antidepressants to be like in the past. A detachment that is subtle, so that I do not become someone else or become unfeeling, but yet is powerful enough that I do not get enslaved to minor anxieties. Of course, as I have said, this might have been a placebo effect, and beyond that, the antidepressants I took in the past may have done such a thing in their early days. But what I remember of them was a coldness, a limiting of affect to a narrow range, and a great discomfort with who I was as a result of said limiting. I realize that many are helped by antidepressants - I think I was one of them, at one time. I just disagree with the 'life sentence' approach doctors seem to take with them.",
      "Speaking of which, I feel that Syrian Rue, though it gave me a good experience would be too risky to take all the time. An MAOI has too many dietary restrictions, and possible interactions with other drugs. But to refresh myself, get a new perspective - it seemed to do this job well, and I do not believe I will have to do it very often to keep myself from Churchill's 'black dog'."

The first time I tried it I didn't get the 4 mm long crystals that I was supposed to get, but the whole extraction process I went through just became a cluster fuck in my kitchen... I hadn't cleaned all my glass properly, and I didn't have what I needed at that time....       ",
      "Now I have seen harmine hcl for sale online and in can cost as much as $100 a gram, and you can buy a pound of seeds for less than half that and do your own extraction.... hmmmm",
      "Anyway, here is the process I used to get the beautiful 1-4 mm long crystals growing on my plate... I don't even know who's process this is that I am stealing, but the one I use is for chem idiots like me, no math or any thing involved...",
      "Step one:",
      "Take your harmala seeds and boil 'em ( you can add an acid or not.  I always add a little vinegar, never measure though).  When they have boiled for about 30 mins, strain the water with a tea strainer into a pyrex measuring cup/mixing bowl thing you can get from a grocery store.  Boil 'em again...  strain into the same container.  Boil 'em again...  strain into the same container. ",
      "Step two:",
      "Dump the seeds and wash the pot you were using.  Boil some water and add rock salt (important to use rock salt because there is noting add to it, regular table salt fas stuff add to it.  If you have to use table salt, make sure it doesn't have Iodine in it).  Keep adding rock salt to your booiling water 'till  No more disolves, so now you have a super saturated salt-water solution....",
      "Step three:",
      "Strain the hot salt water into you hamarla boilings to keep out the salt rocks, Only adding enough salt water so that you have 2 or 3 parts harmala-water and 1 part Salt-water.  I try to make sure that I have 3 times as much harmala solution as I have salt water.",
      "Step four:",
      "Stir it all up, then add a little bit of cold water to aid in the cooling of the mixture...SOMETHING should precipitate out.  That's a good thing: the crystals form when the temp of the solution drops.  Put it in the freezer for an hour.  After that put it in the fridge for a few hours (longer if ya like, but three of four hours is what I did).",
      "Step five:",
      "There should be a whole bunch of crystals and grunge at the bottom of your container It doesn't matter how big the crystals are just yet.... I could hardly notice that they were actually crystals, the just happened to be about 1 mm little needles.  Now it should be strained again...I used a bandanna to strain, but a t-shirt will work... Put your filter cloth over the top of a big stock pot and slowly pour you crungy/crystal solution through it...  Now you can dump the shit in the pot outand lay your t-shirt over the pot under a fan to dry out...",
      "Step six:",
      "It should look like you have extracted sparkling dirt from the seeds... Scrape all your sparkling dirt off your t-shirt and into a clear glass container and add just enough methyl alcohol (ethyl should work too though, and you will know when there's enough you'll have yellowish/reddish/orangish alchy with brown shit in the bottom).  The sparkles dissolve and the crunge doesn't... strain again through a t-shirt and into your a flat Pyrex baking dish or onto a clear plate.  Place under a fan or somewhere with adequate ventilation and wait and watch.... ",

It is numbing to the tongue; burns like hell when snorted; tastes like an alkaloid (very bitter); It also makes my spit and piss glow in unde Blacklight.  It doesn't cause me anywhere near the nausea that regular Harmala brews and extracts do, and I have not tried it as a MAOI for tryptamines.",

      "I was in a tent in my garden with one of my best mates J and his brother, whom I dont know too well, M. I had four hits from a bong loaded up with salvia. The first two simply seemed to emboss everything that I was seeing. Everything began to have a shaky, scaly and colourful look to it. I felt the need to laugh - I simply thought about the fact there was nothing in the room funny to laugh about, and for that reason I found it funny and began to laugh.",
      "I had a third hit, J said to me How are you feeling? I said to him I feel drawn to this side of the tent. I feel like I need to sit over there. Felt some kind of rotating energy to everything. Like a spinning tunnel. I was pointing to the corner of the tent. I dont know what it was, but I just felt like some kind of warm, caring feeling was coming from the corner of the tent. So I sat in the corner of the tent. In this corner, I began to feel quite buzzy. Not in an excited way, and not in a pleasant, joyous way. I simply felt like I had pins and needles all over my body, but it didn't hurt or irritate me. Everything seemed amusing. My sense of humour was definately heightened. I felt very 'witty' as oppose to the 'dopey' sense of humour I get with cannabis. I also felt like that warm presence was now holding up the left hand side of my body, it felt like it was stopping me from falling sideways. It was keeping me in place. It was my seatbelt.",
      "I had the fourth hit.",
      "I dont in fact remember exhaling. There is a black void of nothingness between what I had previously perceived as reality and what I was now going through. All of a sudden I found myself in a completely alternate reality. I was inside my mind. I was walking footsteps upon my mental state at the time. It was an abstract spinning tunnel. J and M seemed to be a million miles away from me. I felt a million miles away from my body. Time seemed to slow down to begin with - completely ground to a halt. What was once 12pm in the afternoon in the tent in my garden ceased to exist. I felt that I had been in this alternate world forever, and that I would forever be here. Its very difficult to describe what I saw and where I thought I was.",
      "I was definitely no longer me as a human being. I had no history, no memories, no emotions. I was all of a sudden in a twisting green and purple infinite corridor. I first remember seeing J and Ms faces looking at me like in a family portrait. Their skin looked so orange and their hair was purple. The strangest thing was that it didnt feel as if they were there in the room with me, it was as if theyd become a distant memory from someone else. And that someone else was me. I had absolutely no consciousness of me inside that tent. The lining of the tent behind their heads created and infinite spinning prism of repetition. They began to spin within the green corridor. At one point they were above me, and at another they were behind me. It was like nothing that words could possibly describe. Before I went on this trip, Id always been frustrated by other reports saying that these experiences are indescribable in human words.  I always thought that it was just the storyteller was just being lazy. But I now know that it is true. The experience you go through completely incomprehensible until you do it yourself. And even after the experience, it becomes incomprehensible again.",
      "J & M were now there but times ten. There were hundreds of unbelievable repetitions of them all around me. They were looking at me, talking. I felt their presence increasingly strong, and suddenly I felt as if they were both staring daggers at me, saying things about me that I didnt want to hear. Its like when you look at people whom you know are talking about you and that dreadful, helpless feeling kicks in. But instead of having the ability to act upon it, I was helpless. The way they were talking about me seemed to be as if they might have well been laughing at my soul, my existence. They were saying things like Oh there he goes. He's just messed himself up. Do you reckon he'll come back? Is he going to come back. Look at him! What is he doing!? I didnt hear them say it, but it was more like that telepathic blonde elf woman who speaks to Frodo in the Lord of the Rings using her mind to speak. I felt alone, in this spinning dark green void. I dont remember really hearing anything, I kind of heard the normality of what was going on in the tent but it just seemed so slow. The sound wasnt remotely slowed down, it just seemed like I was in that tent for an eternity.",
      "The only way I can describe it is literally being a floating mass of nothing which contains all of my memories, all of my emotions and everything Ive learned about the universe. This orb I became is within this infinitely spinning and infinitely infinite multi-dimensional tube. There are a billion exits from this state but I feel absolutely helpless. I feel like my new existence is some kind of alternate, funny and colourful world to what I normally perceive. I feel intensely nave. So nave to the power which now stands in front of I. I dont know if I was in contact with an entity, but more like I was a metaphoric ant on the skin of something which was so much bigger than I am. I was in contact with something which had always been there since I was born, and somehow felt like a deja-vu.",
      "The way to describe this state is as helpless as describing the state which contains all the wonders of what I think when I wake up from a dream. When I do wake up from a dream I think How was that possible to exist and why did that happen? How I feel in one of those random weird uncontrollable dreams is just exactly what salvia is but I am conscious of it but I cannot control it. It is not a lucid experience - because in an experience like that, you have control. The strangest thing about this place I was in is that it felt terrifyingly familiar. Its like the subconscious brain-patterns I have in every day life are completely exposed right in front of me. The drug abuses whatever I am seeing or hearing to tell me some kind of message about myself. During my trip I felt as if I was myself when I was a new-born baby. Id forgotten I had taken salvia and that this new dream world I was in was the re-birth of myself and my mental state.",
      "I began to attempt to realise that I was simply in a tent in my garden. I refused to get sucked into this dark world I was now in and wanted to return to reality. I kept thinking to myself I know that I know these two people in front of me. I know that I know them, and so I was trying to discover who they were. They felt so familiar, but I was terrified by their piercing eyes. I began to understand that I was somehow able to escape from this sense of being inside a tent inside a tent inside a tent infinitely. That was truly terrifying to comprehend. I began to think to myself there is an escape from this weird world. I am in a tent. Suddenly, I felt as if I was now being lifted out of this incredibly strange world. The infinite number of tents aka, repetitions of this dimension began to fold up and become nonexistent.",
      "I felt myself buzzing. I felt the weird aching feeling in the left-side of my body again. I felt like I needed to lay against the side of the tent. I thought I was, but as I began to return to normality everything suddenly began speeding up again back to normal. I felt like I the top half of my body had constantly been spinning around on its own axis, and the visuals began to return to normal. M, who was sitting to in front of me to the left suddenly looked like he was a smear of himself, like a smudged, slowed down, spinning person, and suddenly he became himself again. It became M. I felt a sense of being home. I immediately thought to myself - What in creation could possibly explain that experience without repeating it again? J said Do you think we should get out of the tent. I still lacked the ability to talk, and tried to nod. I felt as if Id been dribbling and spinning my eyes around in circles, but apparently I hadnt been.",
      "J opened the tent and I immediately yelled out Oh my god - the dear sweet outdoors of this tent. I felt as if this tent was some weird dark portal and that the only escape from the state of mind I was in was to actually get out of the tent itself. I dont remember closing my eyes during the whole experience. God knows what I would have seen if I had. I dont remember even feeling the need to blink. I didnt even realise Id been sat down in a tent smoking salvia until I got outside. As soon as I escaped the outdoors everything seemed refreshingly normal. Not at one stage did I think oh no, Im back to reality. If anything I became completely thankful that I now realised I was in my garden. Id apparently been in the tent for at least 2 minutes, but it felt like I had been there for a lifetime. Id just experienced the depths of my mind from 18 years living as a human being all within two minutes.",
      "When I got out of the tent, everything seemed pretty normal again - literally I felt like existence snapped its fingers and I returned to the dimension which I am suitable to. I then decided to walk inside and lay down on the sofa. I dont remember seeing any open-eye hallucinations whatsoever, but I remember that I kept forgetting where I was, and even when I was. All I knew when I was on the sofa was that I was laying on the sofa in my lounge post-scary experience. After each new thought about the trip Id had I forgot the social situation I was in. Possibly the worst situation to be in post-salvia trip is to be asked questions which relate to absolute reality in such a strong way that it is extremely irritating to the point of wanting to cry. I felt bullied by anything that anyone says to me. I remember when I got inside that M was walking next to the sofa and behind me. He was acting so normal that it now felt alien to me and I felt incredibly angry at the question he would ask me. One such question was Oh cool, youve got this game. Is it installed on your computer?",
      "At that point I was so past caring about reality at it really angered me that he didnt understand the state I was in. What he was saying was so normal that I thought he was taking the piss out of me. But he was acting normal while I was recovering from possibly the most intense experience of my entire life. The only way I can compare it to anything else is how you would feel if someone threatened to kill you, set you up in some kind of dark room and then began taunting you of all your insecurities. Thats how I felt whenever M spoke to me. Its possibly because Im not fully comfortable around him and dont feel such a strong friendship and understanding or history between us.",
      "Following from that, I began to sober up, but I was in a strong but strange irritable mood. For example the phone would ring and I would get incredibly angry at the fact it was ringing, but at the exact same time I wouldnt care. Its a weird state to be in, and all that I can ask for following on from an experience like that is to simply unplug your telephone from the wall and not have a television on.",
      "The trip had long-term effects on me, lasting up to at least 10-12 hours after the experience. I felt intensely calm inside my head, and any external stimuli which would distract my calmed train of thought would irritate me incredibly strongly, and the moments later I would stop caring about it. I felt very selfish. I had a night of strange erratic sleeping patterns, and in the morning I felt like I had only had about one hour of sleep, whereas I can guess I must have slept for about 4 hours.",
      "The following day I had work and was still experiencing strange states to reality. Such as, in the kitchen where I work, the lights seemed really dim and yellow as if I was wearing brown-tinted sunglasses, but I knew it wasnt. I knew it was the salvia or something. A day on from this strange experience I still feel slightly different as a person. I feel like Ive lost some kind of innocence that Id carried from my childhood. In retrospect, I feel as if the trip I had completely raped my body and mind and I emerged as a wiser, and different person."

    "report": [
      "First, I have to say that I'm a bit amazed by some accounts on this site where folks just cook up this stuff then walk to the grocery store while they're on it. At the risk of sounding hung-up, I really don't believe that's how to take ayahuasca. I believe/feel it's a very serious and potent plant and that it's best to take in a stable, safe environment, preferably the Amazon, with a Shaman you feel comfortable with...which is pretty much how I took it about almost 2 weeks ago.",
      "Here's my account.  I took the aya at a lodge located off the Madre de Dios River in Peru (the Amazon). The name of the Shaman who led the ceremony was given to me from a friend of a friend. He was quite an old man, and his Spanish was sometimes hard to understand...As is the practice, we waited until it was dark outside. Perhaps 20-25 minutes after drinking the aya, I suddenly felt anxious. I got up to go to the door of  the hexagonal-shaped room we were in, and when I opened it the lighting outside was strange, brownish, and I could see some animals (tapirs?) that were almost like sculptures, just sort of frozen and on the ground. It was very unpleasant, and I couldn't throw up, so I went back inside. I sat down on a mat and was feeling extremely anxious, kind of claustrophobic...like I had to move and needed air. ",
      "I got up again and when I tried the door I couldn't open the latch, which made me considerably more anxious. I felt the room sealing up, and suddenly I found myself at a different window in the room. It felt like the place was closing up. One of the guys who was also taking the aya offered me his lighter, but I said no.  He sounded so calm, in such striking contrast to what I was feeling. I was starting to panic and kept wondering why on earth I decided to try the ayahuasca. I was berating myself. I decided to sit down and not get up again. And when I did, I could see dark shapes around me, but not too close. I blew at them (as the Shaman suggested we do if we felt/saw any negative presence). The feelings at this point were terrible. Time was warping, and I was seeing/feeling funky black shapes that were making strange sounds. I was so scared and kept wondering how on earth I let myself take this chance. I decided to think of my friend Teri, whose done aya before and who is my acupuncturist. She's always been a healing force in my life, so I kept thinking of her and reminding myself that eventually these feelings of fear and extreme discomfort would pass. ",
      "I was sweating profusely...I sat with my eyes open and faced it. Getting up wasn't an option because I was afraid and/or thought I might flip out if I did. Strangely, at some point, early on, the darkness was interrupted by these hourglass helix-ish shapes made of of bright green and red and lines/lights...I  suddenly entered a room where there were lots of them, and I heard a voice say 'welcome'  but I did not feel altogether comfortable there.",
      "The darkness and the shapes came back. Outside the sounds of the jungle - of the animals - seemed to become syncopated with things, a bit like a beat, and that was interesting. At some point I was doubting everything I was doing there, and who the Shaman was, etc...",
      "Then I could see very vague outlines of the hourglass/helix shapes on black, and at some point they seemed to soften up. And I thought, okay this dreadful darkness is letting up and something kinda joked/spoke to me: 'Did you think we were going to give up so easily?' and I slipped back to uncomfortable sickness and darkness.",
      "But not long later I heard a sweet woman's voice saying 'Throw up, go ahead, you'll feel better'. I didn't want to get up, and she suggested I do it right there.",
      "At some point I heard some men outside talking and their voices made me sick, it was really uncomfortable...Then the Shaman started a song and first it struck me as uncomfortable too but as he got into it, it started seeming wonderful, comforting, lovely. And finally I started throwing up, right there next to me, and indeed I started feeling so good when i did it. Felt like big gunks were being released, and I stuck my finger down my throat and at some point it looked like a little frog was sitting by where I threw up out  - a strange, bulbous little frog -not good but not bad...",
      "The hourglass/helix shapes returned, very bright and at some point they started conveying info about the world/life...this is hard to explain, but the information felt so big, so overwhelming that I couldn't take it...it was too much to handle...I felt like my mind could split.",
      "Then the sweet voice started talking more. And I started seeing those shapes but now they were not on black. Sometimes a strange machine-like sounding thing (couldn't see it, just felt it and heard it) seemed to grasp onto the side of my head like it was directly clamping on and doing something. Not bad, but  I can't say it made me quite comfortable either, perhaps because I felt like I had no control.",
      "Meanwhile, that sensation of receiving overwhelming information felt kind of unbearable and then the nice voice said 'She's not ready, she's not ready:' Like she understood i couldn't go further with it. And then i started seeing/feeling these lovely sensations...It's hard to explain but it was like I was ascending into a beautiful room with stones and jewels and the sound of water and it was lovely and beautiful...I felt very thankful...",
      "There's lots more I can write about but it went on and on...Suffice to say the whole thing was rather intense, and two weeks later I'm still thinking about it so much.",
      "Also, after reading more about ayahuasca, I came across the book The Cosmic Serpent which connects DNA with the ayahuasca...This amazed me because the shapes I saw were clearly like the double helix...",
      "This was a very intense event for me. I think people should really respect this plant and the process/ceremony.",
      "Oh, and a very strong message that I received especially towards the end, was that Love is All...Love is where it's at...That may sound silly to some, but it had/has a profound/wonderful meaning to me...Real sweet...Take care, Y'all!"

None of the reports or faqs on Methoxy reported this, which I found it strange, thus I am writing this little note. Minutes ago, while reading the TiHKAL entry on DIPT, I saw reported that it is a common effect with that drug. I suppose that's what is happening to me and my friends."

      "This experience started at my house, from around 11PM to 6 AM. I will try to recollect everything as best I can, although it might not be totally explicit and in order. I can't remember it perfectly, but I'll try my best to put the most important things in.",
      "I had been studying psychoactive drugs for a long time, especially LSD. One day, I found the information that you could get similar effects of LSD from Morning Glory seeds, which contained Ergine (LSA), a chemical similar to LSD. After reading many reports online, I decided I should try this for myself. I'm a very cheap person you could say, so I bought 1200 seeds online for six dollars and fifty cents. All I could do now was wait. After about 2 weeks, they came in the mail.",
      "I came home on this night, March 18, 2007, from a party. It was around 10 or 11 o'clock. My friend called, and we were talking to each other. I went to go sit down and watch the television, when I noticed on the desk right next to me a small package that was opened. It had an envelope inside of it, and in that envelope were 1200 Morning Glory seeds. I told my friend, who I had explained Morning Glories and such to, that I had finally got the seeds.",
      "We both made jokes about how much of a junkhead I was, since I had done other drugs before, and I was pretty happy. He referenced the famous line 'My precious,' from Gollumn in Lord of the Rings, how soon I would be sucking it for Morning Glory seeds, and made other jokes about how much of a stoner I was. I was really quite happy, which I think played a role later on.",
      "I went to my room, and since the seeds were really small, I didn't quite believe there were 1200 in this small little bag. I counted up to about 300 seeds, put those in a separate bag for later, and looking back at the bag which was still pretty full, decided that there were indeed 1200 seeds.",
      "Right now I was very happy and relaxed. I decided I wanted to just see what these little things tasted like, so ate one, and then after a couple minutes another. Also, people had said before that users get nausea with seeds, even if they are untreated, and to see how a user react to the nausea, a user should eat a few. So I ate about  30 seeds..50 at most. I didn't think this would really have any effects on me, since it was a very very low dose. I just wanted to see how bad the nausea was, to see what to prepare for. I didn't want to trip on this night, since I knew I would probably be with my parents the rest of the night.",
      "After eating the seeds, I continued to talk with my friend. We noticed I was sort of talking a bunch of gibberish, which now that I think about it, I was. We continued until about midnight when he had to hang up, since his phone's battery was dying. We made each other laugh for a little, then said our goodbyes. I didn't notice anything different really..just this little, feeling, in my stomach. I didn't want to cook anything right now, since I was tired from a sort of boring party that I had to go to earlier for my uncle. I popped a frozen corn dog dinner into the microwave, and ate that. It had a brownie in it, with lots of sugar of course, so I was awake.",
      "After a while, I noticed that there was some sickness in my stomach. It wasn't all that bad at all, just a little nuisance. I went to the bathroom, and I passed by the mirror. I decided to look at my eyes to see if anything was up. I thought my pupils were starting to grow a little bit bigger, although I wasn't sure. I thought that maybe I was just making this up and telling myself they were bigger, when in reality they weren't. It was probably around 12:30 now. I went back to watching TV, and turned on the history channel. They began a program about the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.",
      "I sat down and watched this. After a while I was really hyper. I thought it might have been from the sugar from my brownie, and I was really enjoying playing with this little stool. I continued watching the show, and playing with the stool. It was pure ecstasy, just playing with this stool with my legs. I thought something was up, but just continued and watched the show about the 300. It was very interesting. Incredibly interesting in fact. It was like watching a movie. As the history channel explained all the strategies that were used, and all the outcomes of the different things, I applauded and gave the generals my two thumbs up. I was very vocal, and had great admiration for all these soldiers-the Spartans, the Athenians, and all the other Greeks who fought these Persians. My dad, who was sitting in a chair some feet away must have thought I was pretty weird. Whenever the show would go to commercial, I'd switch to NBC, and watch Saturday Night Live for a little. One skit I remember somewhat, was some stupid dirty joke. The robots were having intercourse. Usually I wouldn't think this was funny, and just stupid, but I gave it a great big smile and cracked up, while my dad felt apparently uncomfortable watching actors dressed in robot suits have sex. I'd then switch back to the first show I was watching.",
      "Eventually, the television show ended, at around 2 o'clock. I couldn't tell whether it had gone by incredibly fast, or incredibly slow. At the end of the show, I was in complete awe and fascination. Something was definitely up. I mean, it really was a good show, but how could it be the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire lifetime? I went to the bathroom, looked at my eyes, and my pupils were huge. I was shocked. I knew now that these morning glories were working. This whole time I was very very happy. Nothing could go wrong. My dad asked me to go with him to our other house, which we were renting out and are now selling, to go run the sprinklers and turn off the house filling the replastered pool. I decided I probably should, and that it would be nice.",
      "I got my PSP which was filled mostly with music, and turned it on. I put on Beethoven's 9th Symphony, and listened to the second movement. When I first stepped outside, everything went perfect. The music was beautiful, and went in harmony with everything. I looked at this light shining from my neighbors yard, and it was beautiful. It was shining in all directions, and sort of fuzzy with the cold night air, on the dark shade of the clear black sky.  The music was sheer glory. We drove to the other house, which is about a mile away.",
      "As I got out of the car, I wanted to listen to the music, but decided to turn it off. I put the PSP in my pocket with the earbuds. I turned on the sprinklers on this little strip in front of the lawn, and walked into the main lawn. I looked at the grass and the flowers on the front of the house. They were very nice. I then left and walked inside of the house. As I stepped in, I looked around. People had broken into our house before, even though there wasn't much to steal at all, and nothing of value to us. Just stuff the last renters had left behind. The house was almost completely empty. I thought maybe someone had broken in again. Anyways, back on track. I decided to see if anyone was in the house, so I looked around. I went into the kitchen. My dad turned on the porch light in the back, and it flickered on marvelously. It was a weird flicker. It illuminated everything for a second and then it went away. ",
      "I bumped into this cabinet in the kitchen on accident and it sorta grunted, like 'Ooof.' It seemed alive for a second. The whole kitchen was alive. I apologized to the cabinet, and proceeded to open the garage door. Everything sorta' sounded weird and trippy. I went into the garage and sorta toyed with everything. My dad walked in and sort of just watched me and said, 'Alright, let's go.'",
      "My dad walked off, and I got out of the garage, as much as I wanted to stay in there. As I left the garage, I closed the garage door, which squeaked a little, and I heard a train. I asked myself, What the fuck? There're no trains around here, are there? I looked at the door and opened and closed it again. It squeaked and then made the train sound again. I continued to open and close the door, listening to the train inside the door hinges for about 5 minutes. I walked outside to the back yard, opened the gate separating the pool from the patio and back lawn. It made a loud crashing sound. I looked at the new replastered pool, which was so beautiful. The water was blue and dark. I stuck my hand in it, and moved it around. The water swooshed vibrantly, and felt superb and cool on my hand. I walked through the nice cozy living room and left the house. My dad closed the door and locked it on the way out.",
      "I then turned off the first sprinklers, and turned on the sprinklers to the main lawn. I leaned onto the car and looked at the water coming out of the sprinklers shining in the light. I looked at how it sparkled when it made dew on the grass. I looked at the tree. They were all so beautiful and benevolent.",
      "Me and my father got into a conversation about many different things. We talked about the Spartans, about how much mankind has done, which led into talk about technology..the environment, etc. It was a very good chat. I'd normally think it was sort of useless talking about this, and think my father was just rambling on about stuff, but somehow this talk was sophisticated and very fascinating. It had so much meaning in it. All the rambling on of me and my father connected and made sense. I wasn't indifferent anymore to the intellectual value in this talk, and could agree so much with my dad. Instead of just saying, 'Yep. Yeah. That's true,' I could honestly say, 'Oh my god I know. That really is amazing.' I could now tell him my theory on it, what it means. I could jump to different conclusions. It was like I had opened a jar of understanding.",
      "Eventually, we left and came home. I looked at the night sky, and sort of said 'good night' to the darkness, and nature, and the outside world. I said good night to the night, and 'I will see you again tomorrow'. For the rest of this night, I would be in my home. By now, it was about 3:15 AM. It was time to go to sleep. I knew though, that I would probably not be sleeping for a while.",
      "I was still very happy and joyful. I loved everyone right now, and decided I needed to say good night to everyone. First I said good night to my little sister, who was already asleep. I tucked her under her blanket, kissed her cute little cheek, and propped her on her pillow. I then arranged all the little stuffed animals, so that it would be perfect. Next, I went into my brothers room, and sort of put my hand through his hair and patted his head. He was sound asleep as well, sleeping like a baby. I put the blanket over his body and made sure he was cozy. Next, I said good night to my father. Next to him, was my mother. I think she deserved a lot of love since she's the one who works the hardest in my family. If anyone deserves my thanks, it is my mother. But she was asleep, and I couldn't wake her. I sort of kissed her on her forehead and rubbed her arm. She was sound asleep as well.",
      "I took my little Chihuahua, Paco, and brought him to bed with me. I laid in bed, and pet him. I was just mostly thinking now. Things raced through my mind. I could have metacognition of my metacognition. I thought about so many things. I thought about life, about love, about people, about this room..I thought about what was happening. I thought about why I was thinking about this experience. I thought about why I was thinking about thinking about this experience! It might be hard to comprehend now..but then, it was completely normal. I listened to music as well. I listened to parts of Beethoven's 5th and 9th Symphonies, parts of Mahler's 3rd Symphony, a Ballade by Chopin, some songs by The Doors, and some songs by The Beatles. In particular, the 9th Symphony by Beethoven, last movement stood out. I listened to it and had beautiful dreams when I closed my eyes. I could see perfectly what was happening. 'The End,' by The Doors, sounded quite awesome too.",
      "By now, as I lay down and concentrate, I could see some visuals. The first one was this towel that was sorta thrown onto a tom-tom on my drum set. It looked like 3 different things. The first thing it looked like was a Jamaican guy. The second was a Corinthian helmet, like the Spartans used. The last was sort of like Hercules or some majestic figure, looking up towards the sky. I looked at that for a while. As I concentrated on that, the world sort of changed. Everything was 2D sort of for a little while. It was like looking at a picture. Then the world sort of turned wavy and wobbly. Sometimes it would make big straight wave, or little wobbly waves. Then, the walls would breathe with me. It was really  quite interesting and fun to see. It was like looking into a funhouse mirror. I looked up. I have a bunk bed, so there are these sort of bars. I stared at the bars and they sort of just became like a long, never ending line of bars. It was pretty cool. I tried to touch it, but it didnt feel different.",
      "Also, sometimes I could see patterns on my eyes. I'd look, and see weird crystals with a green background. But hundreds of them. It was like they were painted on the outside of my eye. It could best be described as similar to looking at my glasses while they were on. Like I wasnt looking through my glasses at things outside, but actually at the lenses of the glasses. And they were painted with hundreds of patterns on them. Sometimes I would think to myself, 'God, what if this pattern lasts forever? Ah fuck, I think I might have fucked up.' But eventually the patterns would go away.",
      "Also, my perception of touch changed a bit. Everything was kinda fun to feel. I could bite myself real hard on my finger, and it wouldn't hurt a bit. If I wanted to, I could have broken it with my jaw, but I decided that wouldn't be a good idea. I was able to tell when to stop using force or else I would hurt myself, but it was pretty cool to be able to bite myself and feel almost no pain at all. The pain I did feel felt kind of good. Almost similar to a massage. After biting my finger and tongue for a bit, I decided it was enough for now. There were also some auditory hallucinations. Sometimes the fan would sound like trumpets, or an orchestra playing some small thing.",
      "I stopped observing all the trippy patterns, and my touch. I was no longer listening to music. I was mostly now just stuck in my head. I was thinking. I thought again about so many things. Time perception changed completely. Things went by fast. I thought from about 3:45 AM to around 6:30 AM. It zoomed by incredibly fast! I had been thinking for nearly 3 hours, and it seemed like I had been thinking for 5 minutes! I had probably thought more in this time though, than in my entire life. Eventually I wanted it to end. It had begun to stop. I was going back to sanity. Reality began to creep onto me again, and I was coming back to normal",
      "I had learned many things. I learned about karma. I believe it is assuredly real after this trip. I learned about love. I learned about peace. I learned about infinity. I learned about everything.",
      "I wondered if I would ever be the same now. I had thought so much about so many things, and learned so much. I was sort of comforted that I was normal again. I was back to reality. Before the trip I wasn't sure if I was in reality or not. This took me out of reality, and when it put me back in it, I decided I should hold on to it. I decided that I was in fact in our reality now. Maybe they were both reality, but I decided that I should only visit the other side sometimes. This incredibly small dosage did so much for me. I was so happy, and had so much good energy. I don't think I ever stopped tapping my foot for a second. Either the person I bought the seeds from had some really good seeds, or I'm very susceptible to the effects of this stuff.",
      "I think there's still more to learn, and I'm going to find it.  I remember this trip for how much fun I had, with all not only the hallucinations, but again, with everything that I gained. I found happiness during the trip. I can use everything I found in this in real life. I found joy. I found energy.  And most importantly, I had learned, that I love everything."

      "I put 5 cups of of regular tap water and 4 sliced up lemons in a pot. I heated the water until it came to a nice light boil then added the B. Caapi and M. Hostilis. I boiled it all together for about 50 minutes then lifted the pot off the burner and poured the roughly 2 cups of brew through a strainer into a container. I took the contents in the strainer and put it back into the pot and added 4 cups of water and boiled it for 35 minutes. Again I strained it and put into a seperate container. I repeated the process one more time but this time on full boil for 20 minutes stirring frequently. Again I put it into a container.  Finally I took all three containers poured them through the strainer into the pot and boiled it all down to about one tea cup. I wasnt sure if this would be enough and even considered making more. Im glad I didnt.",
      "I should note that prior to this I have never used a psychedelic. I had studied many experiences and read a book on DMT so I had a rough idea of what to expect.",
      "t- 0:00 Mixed 5 grams of Syrian Rue with water and chugged it back. I chased it with Red Rose tea and had a tums.",
      "t- 1:10 The Syrian Rue had definetly kicked in at this point. I was feeling very relaxed. I started sipping on the ayausca at around this time. It wasnt near as bad as I had expected. I finished it in about 10 minutes.",
      "t- 1:20 Im about to puke at this point. Maybe 4 lemons was a little much. I considered taking another tums but I wasnt sure if that might have a negative effect on myself or the trip so I didnt. Instead I just kept sipping on Red Rose tea.",
      "t- 1:30 I start puking for a couple minutes.",
      "t- 1:40 I am starting to see tracers. I remember being  in awe of  how fast this was kicking in. It was some time around this point that the walls were starting to expand and retract. My thoughts were racing at this point. My world was starting to resemble one of Alex Greys paintings.",
      "t- 1:45 I went to my room and layed in my bed. I was feeling nervous. I knew I had made a big mistake at this point. I didnt like this world at all but at least I knew this was just the drug and it would hopefully plateau shortly. I decided to force myself to puke as much as I could to get rid of as much ayahuasca as possible. I did this for quite awhile.",
      "t- 1:55 Still feeling a little bit of nausea I decided to leave the bathroom and try to go to my room to sleep this off. Upon leaving the bathroom things started getting really weird. I walked out of the bathroom and by one of the rooms in my place. There was no one the room and yet I could here this really scratchy music playing. It sounded  like something from the thirties. At this point I still knew it was the drug so I just walked on by.",
      "t- 2:10 Now I start hearing a light sounding carnival music playing in my house. It has a real evil vibe to it. I try closing my eyes to sleep but Its impossible. Im seeing lots of colors. Soon the colors are replaced by waves of purple then a theatre. There are these heads of clowns and jesters on the ceiling and theirs jaws are dropped to the floor. I try thinking positive thoughts to try and change the theme of my trip to somthing postive but all my attemps failed. I opened my eyes trying to snap back to reality but instead it just kept slipping further and further away. I then start hearing a heavy pulse of sound all around me. I later realized that really scary pulsing noise had been my fan.",
      "t-??? I have now lost track of time. I faintly remember going to the bathroom and going into the shower and setting it to ice cold and laying in there. Then later crawling out and moving to the bathroom floor and gripping onto everything I could find. Then moving to my bedroom and doing the same. I clearly remember grabbing my 30gig iPOD and squeezing it so hard it broke in half. In reality i didnt. Then I slipped further into the trip.",
      "All my memories started melting away. I had entered a new reality. I still knew I had a body I could kind of feel it but I had no control over it. I could feel a faint wetness around my eyes and truly believed I had ripped them out. I also felt a wetnness all over my boxers and remebered reading that ayahuasca can cause diarrea. This new realm seemed more real then the world I had just left. It felt like the world I had known had been one big illusion. I wish I could explain all the things that happened from this point forward but it was just way too abstract.  What I can tell you are things I could hear faintly in the world around me. I heard sirens blasting only a few feet away from me. I could also hear a guy and a girl talking back and forth. It sounded like complete choas. I could here the voices becoming more and more panicked. The realm I was living in wasnt much better than the world around me.  In fact it was alot worse. Shortly after I started coming back to reality. I remmeber feeling like I was a god it was so great to have some control. I could see the world around me again it was wonderful to know I still had my eyes. I was in my bedroom.",
      "From the time I felt like I had a bit of control to the time I was completely back to reality was no more than 5 minutes. It felt like nothing had happened. Their were no side affects.  The first thing I did after the trip was quickly check the house. I thought I had trashed it but to my surprise everything was alright.  I had broken a candle taken off all my clothes except for my boxers and puked in the bathtub and all over the toilet. Not too bad. The wetness I had felt were my wet boxers. It was just water. The trip started at 9:00pm and ended at 1:00am. I had to be up for work in 4 hours. The following week I felt a bit depressed and the week following that I felt happy and normal again. Anyone considering doing this should definitely have a sitter. The trip was really insane there are a lot of things that happened that words cant explain. I  was lucky that the only thing that went wrong was I broke a candle.",

      "I'm a 21 year old male.  I didn't start drinking until I came to college three years ago, and first tried marijuana this past summer and have only smoked on a few occasions.  My only other experiences with drugs have been with LSD twice.  The first time I only took one tab and experienced a pretty mild trip.  The second time I took 3 gel tabs and due to the wrong mindset, I had a pretty bad trip.",
      "Even though I had a bad experience on acid that second time, I am still looking forward to trying it again in the future.  Because acid is really only available in the summer months here I had decided to look to other hallucinogens.  After reading up on the use of Morning Glory seeds and finding out that they are pretty readily available I decided to try them.  I purchased three 9g packets of Clark's Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds from Livingston Seed for $1.79 each.",
      "Since I didn't have a coffee grinder available I opted to instead spend two hours cutting up the seeds of one of the 9g packs one by one and then placed them in about 350ml of water to soak over night.  Here is the timeframe:",
      "Mach 17:",
      "-3:24pm - Begin cutting up seeds with scissors and placing them in a bottle with 350ml of water",
      "-5:48pm - All the seeds are cut up and the bottle is placed into the refrigerator.  From this point on, the solution is agitated every few hours",
      "March 18:",
      "-10:45am - Begin filtering solution through coffee filters.  One note, however, I feel that too much of the liquid was lost through being absorbed by the filters.",
      "-10:55am - Solution mostly filtered and replaced into refrigerator.",
      "March 19:",
      "-7:00am - Begin drinking solution",
      "-7:26am - Finish consuming solution",
      "-8:24am - Notice no significant effects other than feeling slightly weighed down.  No nausea is felt at this or any other point prior.  Try walking around outside to see if I notice anything.",
      "-9:46am - I can tell there is a higher appreciation for music, but don't feel impaired in any other way.  No OEVs or CEVs, no auditory distortions, and the weighed down feeling has changed to a general feeling of relaxation.  At this point I doubt that I'm going to trip at all.",
      "As of right now it is 12:30pm and I feel normal again.  Not really sure what went wrong during the cold water extraction.  One thing that I did notice, however, was that the solution wasn't the color most others have reported, it was more of a dark green/brown color.  Some potential things I think might have gone wrong could be that the bottle wasn't all the way clean prior to the extraction process or that it was exposed to too much light as it was a clear bottle.  I also may have simply used too small of a dose or perhaps too low quality seeds (they were only $1.79 for 9g as opposed to the same price for 1.5g for other Morning Glory seeds at the store)",
      "I am a little disappointed, but not unwilling to try it again soon.  I'm thinking at that point I'll just forgo the cold water extraction, however."

      "I thought I would describe my experiences over the last couple of weeks of experimenting with Salvia Divinorum, leading up to a breakthrough experience I had last night.",
      "As a bit of background, I should mention that I'm a 39 year old male with very limited drug experience. I'm a daily drinker and a heavy caffeine user, but have stayed away from illegal drug use due to fear of legal/employment entanglements. The sum total of my past drug use is smoking pot twice back in college. But I've always been fascinated by some of the seemingly 'lighter' drugs like pot or MDMA, and when I heard about a legal psychedelic in the form of salvia divinorum, I had to give it a try. So, I began my experiments by purchasing a tincture from a reputable online shop.",
      "I was drawn to the sublingual ingestion method by reports I had read online of a smooth, gentle come up/down. I was worried, though, by the bad trip reports I had read, and decided to start off with very conservative doses, since I didn't want to get trapped in a bad neighborhood in salvia space for an extended period of time. So I started off by mixing 2 droppers of tincture with one dropper of water, and holding that under my tongue for 15 minutes. That is half of the manufacturer's recommended initial dose, what they say should be the high end of a 'light' dose. I was pleased that I got mild, pleasant effects from that dose. Very mild closed-eye visuals, a near complete cessation of mental chatter, and exceptionally clear eyesight. After having seen salvia described as a meditative aid, the lack of chatter was welcome. I had hoped going into this that salvia might be a help in the meditation practice I do keep up.",
      "The clear eyesight thing was amazing. I had lasik a couple of years ago after having worn glasses for 20 something years. Walking into the lasik center being blind as a bat without my glasses, and walking out a couple of hours later seeing 20/20 was amazing. The improvement in clarity when on salvia versus my normal walking around acuity is equally amazing. And it carried over to my night vision. I had taken this initial dose at about 10:30 pm, and went to bed about an hour later. The alarm clock on my bedside table has green L.E.D.s that make up the numbers, and my room looked like I was seeing it through a night-vision scope. Normally, while lying in bed and after giving my eyes time to adjust, I can make out the trim around the door to my master bedroom. That night, I could see out that door, across the hall into the guest bedroom, and  I could just make out glints of moonlight reflecting off the guest bathroom mirror. That's clear from one side of my house to the other, roughly twice as far as usual.",
      "Anyway, over the next week, I tried the tincture two more times. The second time I did the 2 droppers tincture with 1 dropper water again, and the third time I upped it to 3 droppers tincture to 1.5 water. That was on the low end of what the manufacturer said should be a moderate dose. The effects were very much like the previous times. Possibly because I took this dose in a dark room versus a dimly lit one, what I noticed most was my hearing. It is hard to describe but my hearing had taken on a sort of prolonged, echoey effect. Some traffic noise off in the distance sounded very much like some dark ambient or isolationist ambient music I've heard. Mentally, I still felt together. I didn't feel drunk or impared or anything, and I knew that what I was hearing was traffic noise, but it still sounded like music. At one point I wondered if it was like one of those optical illusions where when you look at it one way you see a beautiful young woman, but if you look at it another way you see an old hag. I wondered if I could make the sound flip back and forth between noise and music. Nope. It was music and it stayed that way until I finally gave up and went to bed.",
      "Well, these intial experiences were positive and enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing in a way. I had experienced some cool stuff, but nothing 'trippy'. I've gotten similar mind-quieting effects from a good yoga session, and I've had vaguely similar sonic experiences from having several beers when in a quiet introspective mood. I've gotten the sense that traffic sounds, and regular sounds around the neighborhood, were somehow part of a composition before, but the sounds themselves always sounded like cars going by or kids playing or someone cutting their grass. They didn't sound like synthesizers like during the salvia experience. But I was still afraid a prolonged bad experience, so I decided to try smoking salvia, since that is supposed to have a much shorter duration.",
      "My first attempt followed a trip to the local head shop, where a purchased a pipe and 1 gram of 1x dried salvia. I went home and smoked 1/4 gram of the salvia to no effect. So I loaded up another 1/4 gram and smoked that. That resulted in a mild tingling sensation throughout my body and some very minor closed-eye visuals. So minor, in fact, that it was more like they weren't really there, but I knew what the patterns would have been if they had appeared, if that makes any sense.",
      "Pretty underwhelming. Even if it had produced more pronounced effects, that was more smoke than I really wanted to be inhaling. So I decided to up the ante a little bit, and I ended up purchasing 1 gram of 5x a few days later. The stuff I bought said that it was standardized to 20mg salvinorin A per gram of leaf. The dosing suggestions say that a light dose of 5x is between 1/20 and 1/10 of a gram, so decided to be conservative again and start off with 1/20 g. It was a good thing.",
      "I was sitting on the floor of my living room between my couch and my coffee table as I loaded up the bowl of my pipe and took the hit. I started counting as I held the smoke in, and when I got to 15 I heard the roaring sound of a wave approaching from behind me. I knew that was the sound of the salvia taking effect and that this was going to be a strong trip. I set the pipe and lighter down on the coffee table. At 18, the wave hit me. Instantly, the world ceased to exist, except for my fireplace, which I happened to be looking at at that moment. At that moment, there was no 'me' looking at the fireplace, there was no 'fireplace' being looked at. No 'words' went through my 'mind' as I sat in that 'room', because none of those concepts existed. There was only this visual pattern, similar to what you get when you point a video camera at a tv that is displaying the signal from that camera. An infinite regress. That's what my fireplace was doing. Infinitely regressing while slowly spinning clockwise.",
      "In real life, there is a little ivy wreath carved in the center of my mantle. In salvia space, that wreath transformed into a woman's face. I took that to be Lady Salvia. Before taking the hit, and after having read many reports here of people encountering a female spirit associated with the salvia divinorum plant, I had explained to that spirit my intentions to explore the near reaches of salvia space, and asking her to treat me gently. I took the appearance of the face to be her way of showing me that she was there, and the whole experience did indeed have a joyous, playful feel to it, even if it was not what I would normally think of as 'gentle'. Maybe to her it was, to me it was closer to 'overwhelming'.",
      "Anyway, I gradually came back down, regaining my concept of self first, then understanding that what I was experiencing was due to having smoked salvia. I understood that I was hallucinating, but that didn't lessen the power or seeming reality of what I was seeing. After a while, a hole opened up towards the bottom left corner of my field of vision, through which I could see back into the real world. I don't think I had been gone very long, because through that hole I could see smoke escaping my lips. Then another hole opened up toward the bottom right of my field of vision, and I could see my cat curled up in my lap, where she had been since before the start of this little adventure. Gradually more holes appeared until finally my vision was back to normal. It took slightly longer for the last of the kinesthetic effects to go away. Then the only thing left to do was say 'HolyShit!' to my cat several times until she got up and walked away.",
      "I had never expected to have such a strong reaction to such a small dose. I really think I hit the 'I' on the salvia experience intensity scale, what with the completely immersive open-eyed visuals and the loss of a separate identity.",
      "I enjoyed the experience and will definitely try salvia again. I haven't decided whether I will try straight 5x again, or maybe cut it with some of the 1x I have left over. If I stick with straight 5x and just reduce the dose, I'm almost down to the point where a dose is just a few flakes of crushed leaf, just a ridiculously small amount. I don't know that I want the presence or absence of a couple of leaf flakes to make a noticeable difference in my experience. I think that if I mix equal amounts of 1x and 5x, that should average out to the equivalent of 3x extract. Maybe that would give me the milder effects I would prefer with the added leeway in dosage size. Either way, I've already had some great experiences, and am thoroughly happy I stumbled across this wonderful plant."

      "[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active as such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See related article]",
      "After a long day of work I got picked up by a couple friends, one of whom made it clear that he had just rendezvoused with his chemical supplier and had an eyeballed amount of a powerful psychedelic '2C-E'.",
      "The only 2C I've come in contact in the past was 2C-I which was to say the least an extremely powerful, if not horrifying experience and created feelings of doubt and anxiety inside. In retrospect the negative experience I had with 2C-I was due to a few factors, namely setting, combinations of other drugs and not having a measured dose (Took well over 40mg).",
      "Since we had a relatively small amount of white, crystalline powder we decided the proper route of administration would be snorting it. I insufflated anywhere from 5-8mg and after a slight burning discomfort in my nose that vanished in about 15 minutes I began noticing slight heart increases and feelings of change. Nothing dramatic, just slight indications of a psychedelic beginning to take its course throughout my body.",
      "A significant body load began to become apparent, a feeling of weight strapped to my limbs. As half an hour came around I decided that the amount I took was not going to get me much further, and came to the realization that another dose was necessary to really 'get the wheels in motion'.",
      "For a second time I snorted a dose, although this one was slightly larger than the previous. Instantly I felt an amphetamine-like rush coursing within my veins and pulsed straight to my head. I sat down and jammed with my friends for a while but hadn't quite start to become 'out of it' this was a strange, but pleasant feeling. No overwhelming feelings of anxiety or fear consumed me, I was just free to be. My mindset had not been completely overrun by the drug by any means, I was just content and aware of it's place within me and began to let it wash over me. We walked outside and I looked up at the sky. The stars were beautiful, how did I just completely overlook this beauty for the past few months. The sound of the wind, the trees and the sky was beautiful. A concept within me dwindled, the concept that stars are signs of hope. Whether or not they are truly real is irrelevant, the fact that we are aware of something beyond our knowledge and capacity excited me.",
      "All of a sudden I realized and isolated these thoughts as true beauty and at the same time was aware that true beauty is a relative concept, trying to express these feelings to others would potentially tarnish the beauty and meaning that resonated within my soul. The visuals I began experiencing were not particularly profound, however they were there. As I stood beneath a row trees, now by myself, alone staring up at the clear night the sky seemed to fold and expand, bending and shifting stars and celestial bodies with it. It was beautiful. I began listening to the sounds of nature and had realized that I had become so out of touch with my surroundings and had actually begun to fear the noises. It was because they were unknown, my comprehension could only begin to guess what the noises truly were. I then dawned on the concept that human bodies are vessels, even instruments of nature and that as time passes we may become out of tune with ourselves. Everything made sense.",
      "I fell in love with the profound insight that this psychedelic had given me, it excited and fascinated me. I walked back inside and relished in some visual distortions and the profound feeling of meaning within me.",
      "After smoking a few cigarettes and cooking some good food, it was time to call it a night. As I was lying in the guest bedroom I was contently and confidently analyzing my daily routines, past events and mindsets. I realized that at any given time within my mind are three bodies: The person I wish I was, the person I should be, and the person I am. It's a sick and twisted state of affairs that after some thought and a cup of coffee was laughed at and deflated. I then turned over and had a decent nights rest."

      "Yesterday we made the decision to have our cat put to sleep. The vet found out that he had a tumor in his liver. He was put down yesterday and we burried him in the backyard.",
      "I wanted to do something because he had been my cat for 12 years. I decided I would wait until my family was asleep and take a chair out to his grave and smoke the last of my Salvia. There was roughly 1/5th of the 1gram vial of 20x standardised extract left. When my family went to be I took a chair out to my garden where my cat was burried and readied my bong and Salvia.",
      "I took a deep breath and then exhaled as much air from my lungs as possible and quickly put my mouth over the bong and set the flame to the salvia. I inhaled as much as I could and held it in. As usual there was no immediate effect but the effects slowly creeped in over about 15 seconds. I managed to hold it in for around 20 seconds then exhaled and took another breath of air, exhaled and put my mouth back over the bong and relight the lighter. As I inhaled the second hit I could feel the familiar feeling of reality slipping away. I was sucked into the back of the deck chair as the darkness around me froze and seemed to break. When the suction stopped the deck chair folded and folded me along with it, I had the feeling of being constantly folded and that soon I would be a mere dot.",
      "As a dot I began to travel without moving. I was going to a place that I can only describe as underground. I felt dirty as if I were in the soil but I couldn't see soil, I just had a filthy feeling. Slowy accelerating from the corner of my vision was a new place infront of me and I was soon encompased by it. I heard a flowing sound and I came to the conclusion that I was inside an eye because the world of different shades of yellow had begun to fracture with dark reds which pulsed in rhytym with the flowing sound.I assumed these were some sort of blood vessels.",
      "It was then that everything seemed to intensify and I felt a great sense of foreboding and intrusion but this feeling slowly melted into warmth, like recieving a loving hug of acceptance which I had experienced before when taking the same salvia. The warmth of the hug branched out from me and formed what looked like a string of distorted eyes of different shades of yellow. I knew in my mind that these were the same as the eye that I was inside. They orbitted me at a constant speed.",
      "I observed the percise and unchanging order of what was happening and realised that outside of the eye I was inside were a string of other eyes of the same size, orbitting around a larger eye and that this was infinite. I think I was being shown how everything is infinite or at least enegry is infinite and that my dead cat would be reabsorbed into the earth and become many other forms of life.",
      "The warmth slowly fizzled until it was no longer warm but cold. Darkness returned except for one rectangular light in the top right of my vision. I turned my attention to this light and watched it for a few minutes before feeling a wetness on my torso. I was once again aware of my body and of my surroundings and I realised that the rectangular light was just the light coming from my neighbours window. The wetness was the bong I had spilled over myself.",
      "This trip taught me that each form of life is equally as amazing as the next, a bacteria is just as amazing as a more complex organisim such as a human being. It was as if I was getting a lesson from my cat who throughout it's whole life could only comunicate in a different language but the language of pshychedelics is sometimes without words and can be understood globally.",
      "In light of this, I went in the house began soaking some Heavenly Blues and I planted 23 of them today below the fence right next to his grave. That way there may be more insights to be had and my cat's body will directly nourish the plants. It might seem corny or stupid because it's just a cat but it was still a lifeform, with a personality and was my friend.",

      "As I pull the first cone and hold it, I start getting a tingling sensation across my skin that makes it feel as though my skin is getting tighter. As I turn to my friend who is packing for me, I notice that when I close my eyes, the image of what I was looking at still slightly remains, but appears to be a ghostish outline of what it was, and certain brighter edges are highlighted by an effect similar to the photoshop plug-in, bubble wrap.",
      "As I pass the bong back, it feels as tho my skin is constricting, and that there is a tightness in my existence (the word existence is pretty much from this point on going to describe my conscience reality, ie, as far as I can think)",
      "As I'm taking the next cone, I close my eyes and start seeing the previous image, but more two dimensional and with far enhanced colours. The smoke hits me quite strongly, and as I'm not a smoker, I get a gag reflex that I try to withhold. I cant and as I'm coughing out the smoke I get the feeling of releasing something that I'm trying to withhold, but in a visual sense. I cannot remember exactly what it is now. The colours seem to be wiggling, and separating.. As they do, it starts to appear to me as tho all the surfaces of the things I'm looking at are coloured in a layer of little sticks that look like dog bones.. As the layer gets quickly deeper, I notice that rather than sticks or dog bones. There is a layer of little people attached to the surface with their feet, and swaying around with their feet attached to the surface... As I look around, all the surfaces are doing this, and the depth of the layer is getting deeper.. The colours of each surface are made up by the predominant colour of the people. Suddenly, I realise that another cone will take me away, so I hesitantly turn to my friend (who I don't remember being made up of these little people) and ask for another cone.",
      "As I hold the third cone, I close my eyes and suddenly get the urge to cough (damn my feeble lungs). As I'm coughing, I imagine (cant remember whether eyes closed or not) my body as a two dimensional section with the smoke escaping. (as I remember this more, I think I may have had my eyes slightly open, and seen the smoke I was exhaling) it, and everything else is moving as tho rats in a maze. Its that type of wiggling motion that the world starts taking on. Its suddenly beyond little people on surfaces, but the entire matter of everything, especially closed eyes is made up of little coloured people moving and changing their positions. Some are in 'l' shape positions, others are standing or sitting, and other are moving their hands to make other shapes.",
      "I start getting really freaked by this, as the whole world takes on this great seething quality that I find quite disconcerting. I get out of the car and stagger over to a patch of grass. I lay down, and everything is still taking on this seething quality. The pattern of it almost looks like the markings on non-slip steel stairs, and is kind of coloured segments separated by a black outline. As I close my eyes, I see to little people in close up, and see them just in my field of vision moving and changing positions randomly. At this stage I'm getting quite worried that the whole world is going to remain like this and that I'm going to have to live the rest of my life in this seething world. (I now realise that as reported by other salvia trip reports, I had completely forgotten about actually smoking the drug, and had little recollection as to why all this was happening).",
      "I get up when I realise that going back to the car may help me regain a bit more control through familiarity. I stagger back, but being near the car feels just a bit too much for the moment, so I mumble something and walk about 40 metres over to a mossy patch of grass my friend and I were at earlier. I lay down again, and as I do the various colours of the grass seems to be seething still, but it seems to be getting smaller, and more like a pattern then absolute definable 'little people'. I suddenly feel urged to snuggle into my jack in an effort to get warm, but also just to snuggle down into something. I lay there. Looking up at the silhouettes of the trees wondering what would happen if this continued forever, and if I could continue my life as per normal if the seething didn't stop. I'm comforted by the fading of the effect, and a strange sound like fireworks gains my attention.",
      "It sounds as tho its coming from off to my left, so I get up (this is about the first time where I actually want to leave the ground. Previously, although the ground was seething, it still felt like it was the best place to be) and start walking over to the sound. As I'm doing this, I see my friend heading over in the same direction (he had also had another two cones strait after me, and I find it interesting that we were both drawn to the same sound).",
      "My head is starting to clear, and the sensation is no longer more than the closed eye 'herringbone' pattern. Closed eyes visuals after this simply are swirls of light and dark, but no other profound or recognisable content).",
      "My friend and I talk about how intense our experiences, and I start recollecting exactly what happened with perfect clarity.",
      "Later, I begin to have the notion that the seething period, where everything was like a rat in a maze (it was just not a visual, it was as though everything, matter it very self was made up of these wiggling sensations), was simply a transition stage to the so called, 'other world'. As time passed, what initially was like the sensation of escaping rats didn't fade so much as just get smaller, from rats, back to little people, and then to the herringbone pattern of everything. This leads me to believe that another hit would have let the seething actually become as big as myself, and would have allowed me into this 'world' between the gaps.",
      "My post trip mindset was very introspective, and although not startling, I felt that I was better able to grasp the issues in my life and see them for what they truly are. I was doing a bit of pre-sleep channel surfing, and found myself empathising with the characters in the movies. Wondering what their reasons for their actions were, and how they had come to the decisions to do what they were doing. Overall, I felt a surprising clarity to my emotions, as was able to dissect what I was thinking into its separate constituents, and determine how they interrelated to form each aspect of my life.",
      "I had been expecting some semi-lucid dreaming as reporting in other salvia experiences, but I only felt a slight insomnia when trying to get to sleep, and little if any dreaming (that I can remember). Although, I did wake up around 4.00am to go to the toilet, and as I stood up, I had a very clear closed-eye infinity tunnel visual, which broke into smiling mouths that formed one larger smiling mouth. No real emotional connection to it, just looked kinda cool.. :)",
      "Hope that this may be of interest to anyone wanting to try salvia. I've been reading a fair few reports of late saying that 'salvia is just bs' and that its a waste of money because it doesn't work. I can only emphasize its potenty. My next experiment with it will be at home, alone, with some gentle music playing and the ability to just take it a bit slower and give the experience time to develop itself."

      "Last friday night at around 11PM I opened up a 30mg Adderall XR tablet and poured out roughly 15mg of the little beads. I then proceeded to crush them up wrap the powder in a small amount of toilet paper and 'parachute' it. (Note: I had smoked a good amount of weed earlier that night and was still fairly high.) Within 15 minutes I was feeling very energized and euphoric. I had trouble keeping still and my thoughts were rushing. Very similar to my one previous experience with Adderall only this time the onset was much quicker due to the parachuting (The previous time I ingested a 20mg tab whole).",
      "After about 30-45 minutes I noticed my guitar laying on the floor in my room, and I immeadiatly picked it up and began to play. I have it set up so that I can play my electric guitar though headphones and not disturb anyone else in my house, which is quite nice. After a bit a grabbed my iPod and stuck my earbud headphones in under the large studio monitor headphones I was playing though I played along with many many songs. Songs i had thought I had forgot how to play and I was playing very very well. This went on for quite a long time. And before I knew it, it was 3AM!! Over 4 whole hours had passed while I was playing. Wow! This drug does a marvelous job helping me concentrate. Then I made the decision I am going to take some before I take the ACT, SAT and AP (college credit classes while in high school) tests. Probably a smaller doseage though.",
      "I made my way down stairs to get a drink and decieded to take  another look at the medicine cabinet. I came across a bottle of pills called 'Seroquel' and vaugely recalled hearing of them being taken recreationally before. I would later find out that Lil' Wyte mentions them in his song 'OxyCotton'. I figured I might as well go online and do a bit of research. Most of the trip reports were negative because people complained that all it did was make them go to sleep and then feel like crap the entire next day. I got the bright idea to mix it with the rest of the Adderall tab. I've heard mixing uppers with downers is bad, but I've tried Diphenhydramine with caffeine and had a mild trip with out any ill effects.",
      "I go back up to my room, now with one 25mg Seroquel. I crush that up with the rest of the Adderall and parachuted it. I felt the initial kick from the Adderall but it wasn't as strong and I felt really groggy. I went to the bathroom, came back and started to play guitar again but my motorskills were greatly deteriorated. So  I decided to stop. I layed down on my bed and started to read a book and listen to some music. My vision got really blurry around the edges and I could only focus in the middle. At times I was seeing double. It goes with out saying, but reading didn't go to well. I layed there on my bed listening to my iPod staring at the lines on my ceiling, I felt as if I couldn't move. I was part of my bed. Then, the lines on my ceiling came alive and started to morph. They didn't become any specific things or act as a 'visulizer' for my music. But this blew my mind. I somehow got the energy and forced myself to get up. I wanted to see what other hallucinations I could see.",
      "This is where the night gets foggy. I wondered around my house probably like a zombie for a quite a while. The only time I remember seeing is 6am. I don't remember where I fell asleep but I woke up in my room on floor at around 11AM to my dad yelling at me to get up get dressed and go out to lunch. Damn. I felt tired and kept having little episodes where I'd space out all day. Nothing too bad just mild.",
      "Overall it was a good experience and I'd like to try it again with a larger dose of each drug."

The result was a cloudy mixture of sterile water and what I only assume is MDMA (and most likely leftover pill matter). I snorted a few of the pills several days prior to the experience and that is my subjective analysis. Note this isn't a chemical analysis, and I put myself at appreciable personal risk trying it.",
      "Intoxication:",
      "30-45 minutes in duration. Ive had some mind-blowing experiences on ecstasy, but not this time. While it was generally comfortable and pleasant, re-dosing every hour or so was a real pain in the ass. By the end of the night I looked like a pincushion. It was generally mellow and for some reason not as psychedelic as my previous encounters with X. Dosage ran the gamut from a very small test shot to  of a pill near the end of my experience.  In total I have injected 5 tablets worth of ecstasy.",
      "Retrospective:",
      "It wasnt worth the damage to my veins. I had a little more trouble getting to sleep than with previous ecstasy experiences. Intranasal and oral administration have given me better experiences in the past. Duration of peak was not noticeably increased with dose. Unnecessarily dangerous. After trying it twice, I have no desire to inject ecstasy again. Additionally, my desire to use the drug again has waned since then.",

      "So we had been experimenting with a homemade 5-meo-dipt freebase. Just put some foxy in househould ammonia and collected the flaky crystals that formed. We smoked it before and it had the very disting foxy feel to it, but it was different, more spacy and more of a 'high'.",
      "I purchased 2 capsules of 100mg MDMA each, planning on smoking half of one mixed with some 5-meo-dipt between three people. I ended up smoking about 20mg of MDMA and about 10mg of foxy. Weed was continuously smoked throughout the experience. The feeling came on fairly slowly, the hits were not big though. After about 10 minutes my pupils were noticeably dilated and I felt a feeling of psychadelic euphoria. The mdma contributed nicely to the foxy, accentuating the visuals and making the foxy feel more warm and complete. When cannabis was smoked it felt as if I had just gotten stoned of some very nice bud, except it was much more euphoric than just weed and there were minor visuals throughout. My stomach became mildly irritated about T+30 minutes but quickly went away. The high lasted for about 4 hours total. Had it not been for the weed I would imagine it would have lasted half that.",
      "When I got home I remembered that I still had 1 and half caps full of mdma and how can I not take mdma when it is available? So I decided to smoke the rest of the half capsule at about T+5 hours from smoking the original mix. It gave me a strong intense rush and I rolled very hard for about 5 minutes till the rush began to subside and I was left with the pleasant after effects. After the rush wore off I decided it was time to take that other capsule. The capsule came on in about 25 minutes and I shot straight up again. I rolled hard for another hour and a half and had difficulty finally falling asleep which happened about 5 hours after eating the capsule.",
      "All in all this experience was very pleasant. I experienced no bad side effects and the mdma and 5-meo-dipt complemented each other well. I wish to repeat."

      "My boyfriend purchased some 2C-E online, not really knowing what we were in store for. We are both experienced users of psychedelics though, and came to the conclusion that 2C-E should never be used for recreational use. This substance gave us a wonderful, powerful trip that will never be forgotten.",
      "We did not have a proper scale to weigh out the doses of 2C-E, which can be very a dangerous situation. So we decided to mix the 200 mg with an even amount of water so we would be absolutely sure we were taking the correct dose, basically 1 mg of substance to each milliliter of water. We read that 10-12 mg are recreational, but we were looking for something much more meaningful than that, so we decided to take 16mg each. It was myself, my boyfriend, and one other friend of ours. We drank our carefully measured water around 10:30 pm and smoked some cannabis while waiting for the effects.",
      "It is difficult to remember the onset, but I remember feeling connected to the natural world. My boyfriend lives in a college town, and we decided to take a walk through the huge campus, which ended up being the best idea ever. My first visuals kicked in while walking. There was a full moon and many clouds. The clouds took the shape of huge faces that seemed to be looking out for us, there were definitely faces that I had seen during previous trips. We walked under through this long tunnel that took us to the main part of campus and it really took off from there- the ultimate rabbit hole.",
      "Every thing around us took on a new meaning, a whole life of its own. Statues and sculptures and trees were becoming living creatures. The visuals were very melty, slow moving, similar to that of mushrooms. Also, energy fields were very pronounced and certain places called to us more than others. We would sit and meditate in these places, and came out with some very fruitful discussions.",
      "After walking for a couple of hours, I started to feel very disconnected from my physical body. The only things reminding me that I still had a body was some mild nausea and jaw clenching, easily fixed by some weed and chewing gum. I did not understand why I felt trapped in this weird thing called a human. I felt like I could be everywhere at every moment. It was unnerving at first, but I got used to the feeling and grew to like it despite how restricting it felt.  I definitely felt like I was an alien life form, put into this body for the night on earth, and it was as if I was looking at earth for the first time. Everything was fascinating. I could walk up to a tree and become extremely curious, touch it, and melt into it. At one point we went into the library to use the bathroom, which was very odd. Seeing other people was really weird because we felt so non-human. It was in our best interest to stay out in nature I believe. I also felt very disconnected on a physical level from my boyfriend and friend, but extremely connected on a spiritual level.",
      "There is so much more to all of this than I can actually describe. Our experiences through this magical journey prompted really amazing discussions once we got back to my boyfriends place, after about 5 hours of walking. Being inside was too much, so we packed a bowl and went to the park to smoke. Still tripping, but with the difficult, heavy part of the trip complete, we sat on a bench in silence. I felt my head and shoulders being massaged by unknown presences, which I had experienced before. I was told they were benevolent 'shadow people' that mean no harm. This was about 4 am, and the trip was wearing down, mellowing out a bit. We relaxed in the house, listened to music, talked some more, took showers, and eventually fell asleep around 7 am.",
      "The whole experience was even more incredible than anything I can remember to write down. The entire next day I was very disenchanted with the real world. It took about two weeks to integrate the experience into my life. Overall, this chemical is not for the inexperienced user. I highly recommend this for those who are searching for a profound experience. I would use 2C-E again, and maybe at the 17-18 mg level, but not for a very long time from now!"

      "One of my first experiences with the chemical 2C-I was on a cold and snowy day in either January of 2006 or December of 2005.  My boyfriend at the time and I went over to hang out with a couple of friends at one of their houses.  My friend gave each of us a 20 mg capsule of 2C-I.  He had ordered quite the large supply of powder from a supplier and measured it out for us.",
      "Although my friend knew what this drug was, he did not have an extensive amount of experience with taking it, and had heard somewhere it hits you harder and faster if you were to snort it.  So, I trusted this friend of mine and I went through with snorting almost all of the 2C-I crystals up my nose.  Immediately after the fact, my head began to throb and I was crying out in pain.  My eyes started watering and I felt as if my head were going to explode.  The inside of my nose felt like it was burning and I was getting the most disgusting painful drip in the back of my throat. ",
      "I was getting really dizzy and my throat was very sore.  One of my other friends suggested some sore throat spray would ease the pain in the back of my throat, so I sprayed some of that in my mouth and it was terrible.  It made my mouth numb and tasted horrible.  I couldnt even make it to the bathroom before I vomited everywhere.  I felt really bad about puking all over my friends couch and I ran to the bathroom to grab something to clean it up with.  When I came back I was already seeing colored dots in my vision and everything was blurry and I felt as if my mind was in a fog.  I was shaking from the pain in my head and from throwing up, so I couldnt do much but stand there holding the tissues and towel and look at everyone.  I tried to help clean it up but I wasnt much help.  My friends took over as I rested on the couch, drinking lots of water, trying to stabilize myself. ",
      "\tAfter we got everything cleaned up, everyone went into my friends bedroom where he had loud pounding techno music playing, with the only lights being black lights and a strobe light.  I felt like the room was spinning and it was all too much for me.  I stumbled back out into the hall way and leaned up against the wall when I felt the nausea rising up in my stomach again.  I ran to the bathroom but once again not in time to lift the toilet seat and yet another mess.  By now I was scared and I felt awful for being such a bother and a mess.  I was in the bathroom for a good ten minutes trying to clean up the floor when my friends began to look for me.  I came out like nothing had happened and sat on the couch again.",
      "\tWe decided maybe smoking some weed would make me feel better, so we smoked a bowl.  Thankfully it did ease the nausea in my stomach and relieve some of my headache.  I felt more relaxed and at ease after this. ",
      "Back on the couch, we couldnt agree on what movie to watch, so someone just put on The Matrix.  When the movie began I was EXTREMELY confused.  I dont know if I was imagining it or if we really started the movie in the middle but I was lost.  I felt like everything I was seeing in the movie had already happened, and that we were watching the same three scenes over and over.  It felt like we had put the DVD player on to just play random scenes from the movie in no specific order!  Everything in the movie looked so fake, it made me laugh that I had never noticed how terrible the graphics were and how unrealistic everything looked.  I felt like I was finally seeing this movie for what it was really worth and I was shocked that nobody ever realized computerized almost everything in that movie was.  This had to be a joke!  On the other hand, even though the movie looked so strange and fake to me, it also looked very real in the sense that I felt like I was there and that this was all taking place right before my eyes.  Besides that, the movie was making me quite anxious.  I was confused because I didnt remember this moving having almost no speaking in it. The only sounds I ever heard seemed very distant and muffled.  Everything had this same overpowering sound to it like every word spoken or sound made had a breath to it.  Every sound made a movement that produced the sound of constant heavy breathing in my head.  Not just breathing, but sickly breathing, snoring-like.  Everything else was quiet, but this was extremely loud and completely annoying. ",
      "The movie got to be too much for me to handle with the noise distortions and confusion.  The rooms colors had changed in a way I couldnt distinguish, but everything appeared as if it were painted on with watercolors.  Everything was very watery and the colors were dripping and wet. I looked to my friends and spoke to them.  They seemed so far away and unreal.  Their faces began to melt with the rest of the world and everything seemed to be falling towards the floor.  Everything looked sideways and two dimensional.  I was experiencing a lot of distortion in depth perception and the size of objects.  I felt sick and confused.  Everything seemed very messy, Im assuming because of what happened when I took the drug. ",
      "Honestly, much of what happened that day besides what Ive already stated has slipped from my memory seeing as Im writing this over a year later.  I vaguely remember what kind of visuals I was getting.  I had sensitivity to light and everything seemed either too bright or too dark.  Things seemed either very foggy or overly clear and more detailed.  The high felt like being high on weed (maybe because I was?) and kind of unattached.  The effects lasted at least 6 hours, but I do not remember coming down, or even how I got home that night.  This trip was not at all like my other experiences with 2C-I.  I felt very isolated and as if I was surrounded by a fog all day.  Other experiences I have had with this drug also gave me an isolated feeling in the sense that I felt very different from other people, but during those times I really did not care, and I didnt feel as paranoid about it.  Other times, I felt more free.  This time I felt chained down, and my mind was clouded.  2C-I for me is generally a very happy and care-free drug filled with laughter and silliness.  This time, it was frightening and confusing. ",
      "If you want to avoid having a sloppy trip like I did, my advice is DO NOT SNORT 2C-I."

I was out of my mind.",
      "At about 5:00 AM I snapped out of it when the drugs finally wore off, and I was confused. Due to having no memory of the night before because Zopiclone destroys your ability to make memories while on it--hence why I kept a log ready so I could record as I tripped--I was horrified. There was I, naked, in a sealed room with water everywhere, smelling like piss and shit, and handcuffed to the wall. The next few hours were the most terrifying few hours of my life as nobody came to my aid, and I wouldn't be allowed out for another six hours.",
      "In conclusion, I am not taking that much Zopiclone ever again. My memory was totally gone, so I suspect I was freely doing drugs without knowing I had just done drugs, it also caused me to snap, along with the other stuff I took, and turned me into a completely sexual nut case. High doses are apparently very pleasurable as what I wrote in the log said, but my judgment and inhibitions were so impaired I just might nearly destroy myself. When I woke up I thought I had died and gone to hell. Not fun.",
      "Much to my joy, though, I had no hangover at all!"

    "report": [
      "One cold evening, I came back to my dorm after drinking 4-5 beers. I was tipsy and definitely feeling the alcohol (I'm a lightweight). I decided to smoke some of the 10x Wormwood Resin I had recently bought 3 grams of online. I put 1.5 grams into a bowl and smoked it.",
      "I took the following notes on the experience the day after:",
      "The dollhouse effect existed slightly, every object in the room seemed like it was in its 'right place'. Everything was good with the world, and I felt a very mild euphoria.  But it didn't hit me, there was no rush. The feeling was extremely subtle in its build-up.",
      "I felt extremely at peace with what was going on around me. My friends were coming into my room having partied all night, and I was glad to see and interact with them. I felt much less inhibited than normal, I'm an introvert and often listen more than I talk. However, my desire to interact and talk with others increased. In fact, I had a lot of fun talking to one kid who I find extremely annoying when I'm sober.",
      "I was definitely energized. It was going on 1:00 AM and the sedating effects of the 4-5 beers I had drunk were in full force, but after smoking wormwood, I felt highly energized. I was motivated to get out of bed (where I had smoked) and do things. I felt focused and motivated to be productive. Simultaneously, I felt relaxed, and content with my current situation. It was a pleasant mixture of calmness and a readiness to get things done.",
      "Interestingly, after about 4 minutes, it seemed that the wormwood had almost completely wiped away alcohol buzz (from ~4.5 beers). I became more in control  it was like smoking the wormwood sobered me up from being tipsy. When I say 'sobered me up,' I mean that the uncoordination from drinking alcohol went away.",
      "I became more introspective, and more thoughtful about everyday things. I had a discussion with a friend of mine who can talk for hours without realizing you don't care what he's saying, but I didnt get bored. I just wanted to know how he felt and wanted to let him know how I was feeling.",
      "There were no bloodshot eyes, no headache, and no dry mouth. The smell lingered for a while afterward, the next morning when I woke up, the smoked wormwood odor was apparent and unpleasant.",
      "When lighting the substance (which was powdered), it was hard to get it smoking.",
      "Over the course of the night, I dropped a shot glass out of my third story window (it had nothing to do with being uncoordinated form the wormwood, I didn't lose any motor control from it). Under normal circumstances, I never wouldve gone down the elevator, passed the guy who checks you in at the front desk, gone outside into the snow, and retreived it. But I felt motivated to do so, and did. Normally I'd be too lazy, but it felt like it would be easy to do - and was the right thing to do. So I brought it back.",
      "I experienced no visual hallucinations. However, everything seemed slightly surreal  I was in complete control of my body and mind, and I could see perfectly clearly, but it was as if there were a layer between the world and me. I experienced settings I was very familiar with (like my dorm room) in a slightly new way.",
      "It seemed like consequences didnt really matter that much, since everything was ok  i.e., I could go to my resident advisor and tell him I just smoked in my room, even though he could report me for that. I didn't do that and wasn't planning on it, it just seemed like the world was at peace and minor infractions weren't important.",
      "I fell asleep easily when I went to bed about 2 hours after smoking. Overall, it was not a body high at all  it was very much a cerebral high. I was clearheaded, but my perceptions of things were altered.",
      "I became more inquisitive and felt like talking (this is slightly unusual for me). And physical activity was a lot more fun than normal  my roommate and a friend were wrestling around in the foyer of our floor, and it was fun to watch and participate in the revelry.",
      "When talking to people, I maintained direct eye contact for more time than would be normal if I were sober. I looked into peoples eyes much more as they spoke (but not in an awkward way). I felt more connected and interested in other peoples' feelings.",
      "I also thought about a bad argument I'd had earlier that day with my girlfriend, and it didnt bother me as much  I simply acknowledged it and thought, 'everythings okay.'",
      "I smoked some more in order to intensify the experience (and hopefully achieve some visuals), but it seemed like I had reached my limit and couldn't get any higher than I was. This was slightly frustrating, as I wanted to be more powerfully affected, but overall the experience was extremely positive. I enjoyed very much the psychoactive effects and want to try it again. It's an intriguing and agreeable experience that I want to feel again. Perhaps I'll try a liquid extract to see how the experience differs from smoking it."

    "report": [
      "The past six months of life have been completely screwed up.  I was diagnosed with depression and was given an onslaught on psychiatric medications, starting with Wellbutrin, then Celexa, Trazadone, Abilify, when the diagnosis was changed to bi-polar type 2, and finally Klonopin for anxiety.  Shockingly even though most of these medications have low side effect profiles I had serious adverse effects which caused me to discontinue use of all medications.  During the experience my body had been clean for about a month of all medications except the Klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks, and I hadn't needed it except for one use (.5mg) four days prior to the experience.  This according to half-lives means that I should have been fairly well detoxed of most substances, except cannabis which I had been smoking fairly heavily for the past 4 months, in an attempt to self-medicate my depression.",
      "Past substance experimentation includes: Cannabis, LSA, opium, nitrous, Klonopin, Ativan, kava, and salvia divinorum.",
      "I had gone to the hospital for some blood work, as requested by my psychiatrist, although due to a serious phobia of needles I was prescribes 2mg of Ativan to ease my anxiety.  This was the third time I had been prescribed it for this exact reason, so I was familiar with the effects, although a combination with another substance had never been tried.",
      "I went to the hospital and checked myself into the blood work area already starting to feel an anxiety attack coming on, my heart started racing and I went to a water fountain and took the Ativan.  I then went back to the check-in area and informed the secretary of what I had done, she laughed and told me I should sit down and relax and whenever I felt that the medicine was working I should let her know and she would tell the doctors.  I sat down trying to calm myself as I knew it would be embarrassing having a panic attack in front of so many other people.  It was packed in the blood work center that day for some reason.",
      "I waited for the feeling of relaxation to kick in, and decided to go to the cafeteria to get a drink as a mixture of the medicine and anxiety was giving me a bit of dry mouth.  Walking down the stairs I felt a slight loss of coordination and my muscles start to give way to the benzodiazepine.  I bought a can of iced tea and drank it, apparently titration of these medicines is very important as chugging a 24oz bottle took me from slightly calmer to feeling nice and 'tipsy' within less then 5 minutes, where as in my previous experiences it took about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours for the medicine to take full effects, it was only 20 minutes after oral administration and I was feeling the effects quite strongly.  The way I still describe it to others is, 'Imagine a chemically perfect alcohol that only gives you the relaxed and euphoric effects without as much of the negative crap like slurred speech and dizziness.'",
      "The trip back to the blood work center was a nice experience although I had to hold onto the railing with the stairs as I was a having a bit of difficulty walking.  I say it was a nice experience because I was now laughing at things which would otherwise seem completely stupid like a large picture of a pink fish that was hanging in one of the hallways, similar to the giggles which can happen with weed.  I got back and told the secretary that I could now have blood work performed, I had a large grin on my face and she clearly had seen many people on this drug, as she also had a smile on her face and asked me if I was appropriately high, to which I responded, 'I've had better.'",
      "The blood work was performed painlessly, the phlebotomist telling me to turn my head and fooling me into thinking that he was going to put the needle in on a count of three, when he actually removed it and had the blood sample.  I left the hospital and got home, I felt a bit sedated but decided not to go to sleep wondering if smoking weed with this medicine would produce a dangerous combination, hopped on the computer and scanned Wikipedia and Erowid for any information, the only warning being that I shouldn't drink with this stuff.  Alright, no mention of the holy herb, guess it's fine to mix them.",
      "I emptied my grinder to find a good amount of weed still in it, and proceeded to grind an additional bowls worth of some pretty strong knock-out Indica I just picked up from the local 'supplier' I prefer sativa but being very hard to get in the Boston area I was content with the White Russian I was about to smoke.  I called a good friend of mine and alerted him and told him if I called him during the experience to come over to my house and check-up although I reassured him I was almost positive this was a safe combination and I would be fine, he agreed and I commenced smoking from my bubbler.",
      "The first thing I noticed was the weed seemed to have an almost instant effect, instead of the unusual 5 minute delay I'm used to.  I decided to take some notes as I quickly realized my memory was about to be shot in the face by the combination, each drug creating decent amounts of anterograde amnesia for the duration of their effects.  I wobbled over to my computer quite happy and turned on some music, opened a word document and hopped on You tube looking for some dumb videos to keep myself amused while I came up on the weed.  I have a really slow drug metabolism, so it can be almost an hour before cannabis really hits me.  Music sounded amazing and everything in the world seemed to be perfect even with the bad situation I was in mentally and academically.  I wrote, 'Highly euphoric effects from this combination, would do this again, vision and time perception very altered, almost comparable to a threshold dose of acid, difficulty encountered while typing, similar to being drunk.'  Little did I know this was only the beginning of the experience.",
      "It was now about 2 hours into the Ativan and about 20 minutes after smoking.  I decided to adventure over to the refrigerator and get some food.  I told myself the 'is your fridge running?' joke aloud to myself and fell to the ground laughing, starting to comprehend how powerful this combo was, and decided it was probably better I had nothing scheduled for the remainder of the night.  I walked into the kitchen and started opening and closing cabinets mindlessly playing with everything in sight.  I drank some milk and ate cookies.  I then staggered back into my room and typed 'Weed + Ativan=probably heroin'.",
      "I guess I was having a pretty great time as from this point on I have little recollection of the night apart from my occasional notes and I did end up calling my friend but I told him 'not to worry, it was snowing outside and I was feeling good.'  It wasnt snowing though, let alone below 60 degrees.  Apparently during the whole conversation my speech was pretty fucked, I also asked him 'Have you ever been to Japan? Place seems ill.'  Those explicitly were the only two things he remembered although he said I was clearly messed up pretty bad and sounded more like I was drunk dialing him than being high.",
      "I went to bed and while relaxing I tried some meditative thinking strategies although the spinning out feeling was quite strong and I saw it as a battle with my mind to overcome it and use this experience to hopefully enlighten myself in my current situation and find some guidance.  I do remember thinking how I needed to change and that psychiatric medications werent going to cure me, and that I had to take the initiative and start on a new path.  While I wouldnt consider it a mystical experience I would definitely say it helped me slightly in overcoming some of my issues I was dealing with at the time.  Everything from that night seems like a total blur now, but I can assure you that it is fun indeed, although if I was to repeat the experience I would smoke less, and maybe drop the dose of the Ativan to 1-1.5mg, I normally like to be more functional than I was during the experience."

    "report": [
      "I am a forty-something-year-old male who used numerous drugs in college: marijuana daily, various forms of hashish, alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, methamphetamine, mushrooms, and a little too much LSD.  Thereafter, I used only moderate amounts of marijuana and a little alcohol for the next fifteen years.  Some life changes inspired me to resume my work with hallucinogens, this time as a spiritual learning tool rather than as a party device.  This led me to the legal-to-possess hallucinogens, including Salvia divinorum and the Trichocereus cacti, both T. pachanoi and T. peruvianus.  The following report documents my fifth exploration with mescaline-producing cacti in the past three years. ",
      "The Preparation",
      "After four previous cactus trips, I found that the two I did by myself were very therapeutic and deep, whereas the two I did with a good friend were enjoyable, but not very deep.  Ive been feeling a need for a therapy session, so the upcoming trip will be solo.  Ive scheduled this trip for a time when I will be the only one in my house for a few days, and I have followed a restricted diet for the past three days similar to that suggested before ingesting MAOIs (particularly avoiding foods with tyramine, such as aged cheese and avocados).  Although there are no strong MAOIs in Trichocereus cacti, they do have a high tyramine content, which can cause headaches, so the less in my system, the better.  I decided to use 70 g of dried T. peruvianus from the same batch that I have used three times before (40, 50, and 65 g trips).",
      "Past experience cooking cacti has taught me to start the oven vent hood first to reduce the lingering odors, which can be a potent nausea trigger even days afterward.  Seventy grams of dried cactus with 1.5 qt of water are boiled for an hour in a steel pot.  The now-softened cactus is ground up in a blender, then put back in the pot along with the juice of six lemons, returned to a boil briefly, and left to soak for two hours.  It is then returned to a low boil for 2.5 more hours, and then the whole mess is strained through a cotton t-shirt.  I note that the strained solids have a slightly sweet taste, but no bitterness.  Since the alkaloids are bitter, this is a good indication that they are in the very bitter liquid.  The filtered liquid is returned to the pot for two more hours of boiling until the volume is reduced to eight ounces of a brownish green liquid the consistency of maple syrup.  The liquid is divided evenly between two Mason jars and refrigerated for the next day.",
      "The Experience",
      "T=0",
      "First thing in the morning, I prepare for takeoff.  I eat a bit of dry cereal to ready my stomach.  Assessment of me: no pains, some sinus congestion, mind is calm.  It is a clear, beautiful day, predicted to be warm and windy.  It takes several minutes to overcome my aversion to drinking this awful, bitter liquid.  Now that my body has experienced it several times, I have a Pavlovian gag response when I even think about committing felonious cactophagy.  I hold my nose and drink the first containers liquid in three swallows, followed by a shot of straight grapefruit juice to kill the taste.  Fortunately, the expectation is worse than the actual consumption.",
      "T=+0:45",
      "Im beginning to feel some queasiness in my stomach and a sense that things are subtly changing.  I smoke a bit of marijuana to arrest the nausea and then drink the contents of the second Mason jar.  The second jar is much harder to get down and my body twists and flinches like the mad scientist in a horror film as he drinks The Potion.  I quickly wash the Mason jar to reduce the cooked cactus odor and then immediately walk around outside in the garden, trying to sneak away from my churning stomach.",
      "T=+1:15",
      "Its definitely starting to happen.  I feel a warmth resonating in me.  My hands appear to be ever so slightly larger and time is slowing.  Writing requires more effort as my motor skills become rubbery, almost like being drunk on alcohol.  I am calm and open, very relaxed and ready for a mescaline adventure.  I take another puff of the marijuana anti-nausea medicine.",
      "T=+1:45",
      "The walls are vibrating with light colors and hints of geometric patterns.  Nothing looks quite level. ",
      "T=+2:15",
      "The mindscapes are incredible!  Im seeing cities floating in space.  Mescaline is appearing in most of my thoughts and beginning the relentless push to enter each cell of my body.  The come-up is slow but steady, and I fade in and out of meditation space.",
      "T=+4:15",
      "Full blown ON!!!  Plus three on the Shulgin scale, and my mind state is in that totally different place I call tripping, which cant (so far) be felt or described when sober.  With open eyes I see the empty spaces in front of me completely filled with pulsating bands of multicolored lights and geometric patterns.  My whole body is moving with these pulses.  Soon my thoughts become highly erotic, crowding out any hopes I may have had about this being a therapeutic trip.  So I go with it, enjoying the sensations my body and mind experience along with the elaborate mental pictures.",
      "T=+5:15",
      "I stagger outside to the hammock and lie there watching the trees dance with each other in the wind.  I feel intimate with the trees and notice how each branch moves relative to the others.  The wind blows right through me, showing me that I am an infinite being connected to everything.  I realize that this is always the case, but that Im usually not aware of it. ",
      "T=+5:45",
      "I smoke some more weed to settle the angry natives in my stomach.  I continue thinking about how mescaline connects me.  Just that: connected.  Empathy is easy with whatever or whomever I think about or look at.  It would be no more possible to weed the garden or do any pruning than it would be to cut off my own fingers. ",
      "I wander back to the kitchen to stare at the linoleum floor, which is now filled with fantastical floating cities in three dimensions with clear details as small as the windows on the many tall, silver buildings.  It reminds me of looking at those Magic Eye pictures when I get into the space where things start to appear, although at the moment it takes no such special effort to seeIm just there.  Unfortunately there is just enough lingering cooked cactus odor in the kitchen to keep me from staying very long, so I head out for a walk. ",
      "With sunglasses shielding my dilated pupils, wearing a fedora hat and tie-dye shirt, I look the part of what I amquite fucked up!  Crossing streets is anxiety-provoking, as it should be, since I retain an awareness of their danger and am aware that I cant judge depth or speed very well. ",
      "I arrive safely at a five-acre wood filled with walking paths near my home.  Here I wander calmly and rhythmically through the woods.  My mind is flying while my body moves on autopilot.  The walking is peaceful and purposeful, providing a platform from which my mind leaps and twists and turns; the forest is an extension of my mind and provides structure. ",
      "My navigational skills, not being very good when sober, are really bad now and I end up taking a side path that goes a long way in a direction not helpful to my return.  Eventually I figure this out and wander back in the correct direction.  Much of this wandering back and forth occurs in a low, marshy area.  It becomes symbolic of my personal growth and the collection of past life wreckage (lessons learned)Every man has his own mangrove swamp to tend to.  Symbolically tramping over healed wounds shows me both how they helped shape me, and how they no longer plague me.  I can just walk right over them.",
      "And that is just the part I could put into words.",
      "T=+7:45",
      "Back at home, finally!  That was a really long walk and I am exhausted.  I hang out with the dog (my universal ground to everything), and munch a little food.  I speak with an old trip buddy and babble semi-incoherently for a while about how everything is still vibrating, and why doesnt that reality just stand still so you can get a good look at it?",
      "T=+10:45",
      "The trip is now in a more introspective, quiet phase.  I watch the movie Satchmo, a documentary about Louis Armstrong, and it brings me to tears many times.  I am moved by how Louis retained his genuine warmth and love for all people despite facing American racism.  I feel connected to him through love.",
      "T=+12:45",
      "Im listening to jazz and drinking tea to soothe my stomach.  Food is finally appealing again.  While I wait for my eggs to boil, I try to figure out what it all meant: the initial erotic surge of energy, the trees dancing with my feelings of connection, the long walking meditation, the phone call to an old friend, and really missing Satchmo, a surrogate for the closer people and animals who have left my life.  I do some writing, but mostly I just sit and think.  My contemplations are gently productive and reach conclusions rather than racing and looping into a twisted despair as often happened with LSD.",
      "T=+18:45",
      "Im mostly back down and am finally heading for bed.  I take an Ultram (tramadol) and three ibuprofen tablets to fend off a growing headache. ",
      "The Recovery",
      "The next day I wake up late, feeling a bit groggy and tired, with a mild headache.  At noon I take another Ultram and three ibuprofens, which work pretty well; no further pain medicine is needed.  This is a great relief since some of my cactus trips have resulted in excruciating headaches the next day.  My guts, however, are not happy with what they consumed yesterday and I experience mild diarrhea for the next four days.  This is the first time for this aftereffect, and I find that acidophilus pills help some. ",
      "Though I was concerned early in the trip that it wasnt turning out to be a therapy session, the process of writing down my experience over the following days showed me what I learned.  The dedication of such a large block of time to these experiences (each consumes three days between preparation, tripping, and complete return to normal space) continues to be a worthwhile investment in myself.",

      "I was 17 and was miserable. Because of the way I was raised by my step father, getting locked up for stupid behavior and refusing to talk or show emotion I was a wreck. I was insecure and was so confused about my world and everything in it. I had this horrible twitch due to a horrible feeling in my body that had been going on for over 10 years. I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder as well with OCD and horrible insomnia. My whole life was basically taking one day at a time and praying almost everyday for answers on why I was so miserable.",
      "I was 16 when I started in the drug culture. I had smoked weed before, but eventually started experimenting with drugs. I had lost all my friends from moving around so much. I only had a few people who I started hanging out with regularly, because I stopped hanging out with the Bad group of people I met and due to my high anxiety. Eventually as I grew more and more depressed, I had herd that drugs such as mushrooms or LSD could change one's perspective on life and cause life changing experiences. I was desperate to talk to my God, or live through whatever experience that would give me answers to help myself. My drug use grew more and more as I waited to get my hands on some mushrooms. Deep down me was self medicating as well as experimenting, as I awaited the day that I would find the answer to why I was in pain. I wasnt sure if drugs would help me. Maybe they wouldnt. However drugs or not I was still waiting for something to come along to help me out.",
      "My friends and I were starting to experiment with different drugs. Ecstasy was never on my List of Drugs to try. I tried some shitty E pills before and noticed nothing more then Controlled Euphoria. Because of my friend being prescribed on Xanax he was quite generous with his bank account. Anyway he purchased a decent amount of ecstasy and was eager to try them.",
      "By the time my Special Day Arrived I was a wreck. I hadnt slept well in weeks. I was depressed and miserable by my chronic mood swings. I felt like shit and deep down wished someone would kill me. I was traumatized by Christianity as a child and vowed never to kill myself in fear of going to hell. However I did plan to join the marines so I could either gain a reason to live, or end my life in an honorable way, (Deep down I just wanted to get killed). I dont remember what day it was exactly, but I will never forget how the day went or the pills that would change my life forever. It was just me and my friend Z that day. He pulled out the bag of Green Fu Pills and we headed to the beach to get ready for whatever lay ahead. Deep down I didnt care. I didnt even think what was going to happen was going to shock me. I ate 2 Pills and 25 min later my friend asked me if I wanted 1 more. Normally I would have been afraid of overdose, or perma frying myself. The last thought through my head was O well if I die today, then it looks like I'm going to die on ecstasy. I just didnt give a fuck anymore.",
      "We were walking on the strand and we stumbled upon a Datura Plant. This made me smile because I had always been curious about finding Datura and the plants effects. I just thought I was awesome on how I actually found it. We stared at the Datura plant for about 5 min then continued walking",
      "I cant explain the peak, because there was none. I cant explain the feeling because there are no words. But I will never forget the first time I Really felt ecstasy. It truly was amazing. I was in a state of heaven that no one can imagine. My problems were all there, however it didnt matter. Nothing mattered except how amazing this feeling was. Deep down I was scared at what was taking place. I had never taken any substance quite like this. My hearing began to get messed up. I couldnt tell which direction sounds were coming from.  Even though I was scared I was amazed. I Remember asking my friend Is this what heaven is like? I cant describe the beauty I saw that day on the beach. I was talking with my friend and just wanted to communicate. I loved talking to him and I felt closer to him then my mother and father combined.",
      "I dont remember which topic was brought up first. However once I started on 1 topic that was on my mind, I then talked about another, then another, and soon I was talking about everything I ever feared in the world and in my life. I talked about my insecurities, I talked about my family, I shared every single fear I had. I talked about my past, the times I was betrayed, and the times I was let down. I was basically sharing information so personal that he now knows 95% of everything about me.",
      "Once it ended I gave him a hug. I was amazed at how much I could relate to another human and how others were also going through similar struggles themselves. I checked myself into therapy and my life has never been the same. My twitch was practically gone and I never felt better. The next day I was so depressed but it was the greatest depression of my life. I remember no one being home and just falling on the floor into tears for being so thankful for my experience that I had. Every time I think about that day I want to cry and cant explain my gratitude for Ecstasy, my friend who helped me out, and the period I was allowed to take a 5 hour walk inside heaven.",
      "My new life goal isnt to get killed anymore, or follow some religion. I now am actively involved in therapy and my new life goal is to obtain inner peace within myself. The once brute guy who shaved his head, and wore tank tops is no more. Ive grown my hair out, and started being myself. Everyone that knows me sees the change and I love the sensitive guy I really am. Even though I was suffering for over 10 years I now believe that it will help bring balance to my sensitive side, and will eventually allow me to gain stronger control of my mind as I handle my problems and emotions The right way. Im no longer Bi-Polar and it turns out the disorder was caused by GAD and my racing thought patterns. Now Im learning to deal and face anxiety, along with depression to help heal my mind.",
      "Ecstasy showed me the pieces to the puzzle. Its up to my to put the pieces together."

    "report": [
      "Set and Setting: it was about 9pm on a very rainy and windy Wednesday night. Ive experienced 4-ho-mipt and 2c-i on several occasions. I wondered what it would be like to combine a phenylethylamine and a tryptamine as this seems to be relatively unexplored dimension....",
      "I started off by downing about 15 grams of powdered kratom leaf. Its better to make tea, but circumstances didnt allow for it. Using powdered kratom makes it easier to down.. After a few minutes I then ingested 25mg of 2c-i followed by 10mg of 4-ho-mipt. I used tv to pass the time as I felt it come on. Nausea/uneasyness was waving over me as myth busters loomed on the tv. I tried candy to settle my stomach, but it didnt work. At a certain point I realized I couldnt keep all this down, and proceeded to the bathroom to puke. Kratom can tend to make ones stomach upset, but it can generally be combined with PEAs, it adds a distinct flavor to the visuals and the body feel...I have been having GI issues/sickness all week so this probably was compounded the normal come up nausea. Either way it brought such a sense of relief.",
      "I flipped around on the tv for awhile and watched an episode of south park. My room mate was doing some homework that night but he came out at some point to watch (there is a common living room). He knew I was going to be messed up, so there were no issues there. As I watched the tv it started to make squiggly waves on tv, this is definitely a tryptaminesk quality. It was if the screen was water and it was doing rippling, but arranged patterns of rippling. When I looked at my arm, the arm hairs morphed into the typical 2c-i/persian carpet geometric pattern. Also the pattern was prevalent on the ceiling etc. This pattern is always encountered, one wonders if it is a pattern intrinsic to the drug or it just draws on cliches of pattern deep in the mind (or both). I attempted to draw at one point but it proved to difficult. I just always wants to take a picture of it, which is obviously impossible...eventually Ill have to paint it.",
      "At some point I decided to take another 10-15mg of 2c-i and 4-ho-mipt each. I had puked a lot up before, so to get the full potential of the experience I needed more. I was pass the come up so any additional drug does not produce that unpleasant anxiety. Soon after I retreated to my room to turn on my trippy lights: a planetarium light that projects either the northern or southern hemisphere and revolves slightly (has a cool shooting star function). Plus another light that projects a red laser thru a crystal and 3 LEDs (blue, red and orange). Together it created an amazing galaxy of rich color on my ceiling. I had a 3d crystal on a base as well that changed color and its LED light could also be seen on the ceiling. Then for some music listening ..The Cure - Disintegration. I had tried earlier but had been too sick. My ceiling came alive, red also looks especially vivid. It metamorphosed into a chasmic arrary of colors. It looked similar to what it does on 2c-i alone but different. Depth was slightly less, but it looked as if a spot light was shooting around my room. Different areas became illuminated in a patch-like manner. How did music sound? It was definitely improved, but I found myself distracted by an inner dialog. Also the emotional pull of the visuals were more flat and dull.",
      "Closed eye visuals were fairly vivid, but not as if on 2c-i alone. Music did not flow with them as much because of the inner discussion. Though at one point I felt my body melt into my bed. My cold tempurpedic pillow enveloped me and I felt the coolness meld into my body. My arm across my face became warm and stuck to me. I reached up and saw black energy in my hand as I reached for the ceiling. It was if a black segment started in the hand and flowed up my finger like a ring band. Without a doubt there was synthaesia..Still the music continued.. Lullaby by the cure is a really freaky song, on candystripe legs the spiderman comes, softly through the shadow of the evening sun, stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead, looking for the victim shivering in bed, searching out fear in the gathering gloom, and suddenly! a movement in the corner of the room! and there is nothing i can do, when i realise with fright, that the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!.... yet I still think the cd is the ultimate trip cd.. It was dream-like state, the rest of the cd played out, yet were I was in the cd seemed to be elusive.",
      "I woke up and looked out the door at the palm trees swaying the cold wet wind... all and all it was a fun trip. The only bad part was a bad headache in frontal part of head, left side (and a good amount of stomach distress). While 2c-i and 4-ho-mipt make an intriguing combination I feel that they are better used apart. 2c-i has such a positive body feel alone and a deep emotionalness to it (quite good for music).  4-ho-mipt combines incredibly well with kratom (wall of euphoria type feeling), and has a more organic character...Both winners!"

    "report": [
      "I have done several other drugs, prescription and illicit. I've tried everything from benzodiazepines to salvia to MDMA but lately my poisons of choice have been cocaine and the occasional tab of ecstasy.",
      "Recently, I have been becoming more and more interested in opiates. Having sampled minor painkillers such as codeine and small amounts of hydrocodone, I decided a couple weeks ago that I wanted to try Oxycontin (oxycodone controlled release). Although I didn't know anyone personally (or so I thought) that sold it, I decided to ask around and got introduced to a guy who said he could get me (3) 40mg OCs for $100, a reasonable price in this area. I handed over my money and he got in his car and drove away, leaving me to think about how I could have better spent a hundred bones.",
      "Anyways, a couple weeks later, I was relating this story to my older brother, who I knew did a lot of drugs but had always been private from, and after scolding me for dealing with sketchy people, asked me if I was still interested in purchasing some OC. I replied that, yes, I was. He walked across the room, reached into his dresser and pulls out a pill bottle of what must have been at least (50) 40mg Oxycontin. He gave me two for $30 each and told me to be careful. He recommended that I try a half of one of the pills to start with. I thanked him and drove back to my house.",
      "A couple of days later, I am watching TV in my room upstairs and my parents are downstairs watching a movie. I decided that then would be as good of a time as ever to break out the oxy. After reading a couple of experiences online, I realized that 20mg really was a small dosage and decided, being that I am a big guy (~240lbs), that I could handle 40mg without incident. As I am grinding up the pill, I see my bottle of Adderall, given to me from a friend, and decide that the stimulant will liven up the high and give good synergetic effects, a sort of pseudo-speedball. Along with the 40mg OC, I grab (8) 5mg Adderall (amphetamine) and grind those up as well. I do the oxy and amp in a few lines and then head into the other room to watch Crank.",
      "I notice the amphetamine high almost immediately, along with the blue mucous dripping out of my nose from the blue Adderall pills. The oxycodone comes on a little slower and does well to take the edge off the speedy high. The combination of drugs makes the movie very enjoyable.",
      "About an hour into the movie, I decide that I wasnt as high as I could be and decide to break out the other OC and some more Adderall. I take half the 40mg pill of OC and an additional 20mg of Adderall up the nose and head back into watch the rest of the movie. As I am walking, I start to become nauseated, which I have heard of with many opiates. Thankfully, as I sip a glass of water and lay back down on the couch to finish Crank, the sickness subsides. I finish crank, which by the way was very enjoyable under the influence, and decide to watch Very Bad Things. The movie starts off tense and is amplified by the combination of narcotics. However, after a few minutes I relax and the high seems to be drifting back and forth between the speedy amphetamine high and the euphoric, intoxicating oxycodone high.",
      "About an hour into the movie, approximately 1.5hrs since last re-dose and 2.5hrs since initial dose, I decide that, yet again, I could be a little higher. I head back into my bedroom to retrieve the drugs. As I head down the hallway, I become very sick to my stomach and rush into the bathroom to purge my stomach of the evil within. After throwing up, I feel much better and decide to continue on with my plan to re-dose. I do an additional 20mg of oxycodone and 20mg of amphetamine insufflated. I head back into the other room to finish the movie again become nauseous. I alleviate the discomfort by lying back down. The added euphoria from the re-dose is amazing, although it makes me a little drowsier than I would like. I finish the movie about an hour later and am still high as a kite. I decide to watch more TV and pop a Sopranos DVD into the player. I lie back down and watch two episodes.",
      "As I finish watching the Sopranos, I cannot notice the amphetamine high anymore, yet the euphoria from the Oxycontin is as great as ever. I stand up while I am thinking about what I should do. As I do this, I become sick again and head back into the bathroom to throw up the water I had been sipping. This expulsion temporarily cures my sickness. I go downstairs, which is now empty as my parents are in bed, and lie on the couch with the lights off. I drifted in and out of consciousness having a kind of awake dream. At some point my mom walked downstairs to grab a glass of water. She said something to me but I remember being almost unable to answer. I regained consciousness sometime around 3AM, almost 8.5 hours from the initial dose, and head back upstairs to my bedroom. I lay there in bed drifting in and out of consciousness, contemplating my place in the universe as well as my relationships with a few other people. I do not know when I fell asleep fully, but I woke up at 8:30 to go to school and felt fully rested.",
      "I got up and took a shower, getting ready for school. As I exited the shower and proceeded to get dressed, I get sick again and throw up a large amount of fluid. In addition to the nausea, I feel very light headed and dizzy. After deciding that I am in no way okay to go to school in my condition, I tell my dad that I cant go to school because I just threw up. He replies that I should go to school anyway. After informing him that this was a possibility, he told me to rest for an hour and then see if I was feeling better.",
      "After an hour of sleep, I feel slightly better, a little lightheaded but not nauseous, thankfully, and decide that I can go to school at least for a few classes. I walk out to my car to drive to school and discover that that my car will not start (must have left the dome light on). After jumping the car, I set off to school. As I drive, I can definitely tell that I am intoxicated, and probably should not be driving. (DONT DRIVE INTOXICATED) However, since I live less than a two minute drive from the school, I continue. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "I arrive late to my second class of the day. We had a substitute and were thankfully just doing some busywork assignment. At this point, I am still too messed up to hold an actual conversation with someone, without them knowing that I am on something, and this is more than 12 hours since the last dose. I continue on with school and although it was definitely more enjoyable than normal, the intoxication really messed with my ability to talk or write intelligently. I head home at 3PM after school and try to do some homework. I am able to work but get nauseas from staring at the computer screen for more than a few minutes.",
      "At the time that I write this (approx 10:30PM the day after the experience) the euphoria from the substance is long gone but I still feel noticeable lightheaded and somewhat sick to my stomach. I am not sure if this is a common symptom or not but it to a certain extent has tainted the experience of the drug. While this drug is certainly enjoyable, I would still chose cocaine over it any day. Looking back, I definitely believe that 80mg was much too high of a dosage to start off with but I dont think that I was ever in any danger of overdose."

      "For starters, I'm 165lbs, male, good physical condition, have been drinking coffee all day but prior to the experience in question (happening at this very moment) not too jacked-up.  I am a regular cannabis user and a chemistry student at a private university.  Around two years ago, I used to trip on acid, shrooms, dxm, and other psychedelics anytime I could, but have never tried any 'hard' drugs such as coke, meth, or heroin.  I enjoy drugs but I've got to draw the line somewhere.  However, I have one small problem:  I really like uppers.  What I mean by this is that I really enjoy drugs like caffeine and ephedrine in moderation.  I like the way they subtly speed me up and make my thinking crystal clear while somehow making me slightly innebriated.  Even though I've never tried and never will try the hard stuff like coke or crystal, I'm still curious about them. ",
      "This is the reason for my latest experiment, taking place as I type.  The purpose of my experiment was to see if freebase  ephedrine would be an active stimulant and if so--what could be its implications?  My first attempt consisted of 2 crushed 'mini-thins' dissolved in about 100ml of household clear ammonia, added 150ml zippo brand lighter fluid, shook vigorously many times over the  course of about 30min, removed zippo lighter fluid layer with medicine dropper, evaporated zippo lighter fluid on a glass dish, and was left with...*gasp*--freebase ephedrine in the form of an oil.  I'm not kidding.  I definitely expected crystals since the ephedrine molecule so closely resembles that of methamphetamine.  Anyway, how the hell was I supposed to smoke this oil?  All I have is the bowl that I smoke herb out of.  I decided to soak it up with some gumless rolling papers.  It took only about two and one half papers to soak it all up (actually, there was a substantial amount remaining on the glass dish but I was just too lazy to remove it).  Next, I packed the crumpled-up rolling papers into my bowl and smoked it.  It tasted awful, of course.  I did get some speedy effects and the same feeling I get from maybe 1/2 of a 'mini-thin'.  The problem was this:  The actual rolling papers burned faster than the oil and therefore there was a large amount of freebase ephedrine that I didn't actually breath in.  I needed a better delivery system.  That brings me to tonight...",
      "I recently bought a bottle of 'stacker 2' pills.  I really like these pills taken orally but I find that the excessive amount of caffeine (200mg) is a bit much for me.  It also contains several vitamins, herbs, etc--but most importantly, ma huang extract (standardized 25mg ephedrine).  I decided to do what the cigarette companies do to tobacco in order to convert the nicotine salt into a freebase--soak it in ammonia.  I opened up one of the capsules onto a glass dish,  added 5ml household clear ammonia via medicine dropper, 'cut' with razor blade until capsule contents were fully saturated, and let soak for approx. 1 hour.  Next, I evaporated the ammonia in the microwave, scraped up sticky goo (light brown in color, almost rubbery but sticky when rolled into a ball), and smoked through my trusty bowl.  That was bout two hours ago.  Since then, have taken about 7 hits of the pharmaceutical-tasting lump and have taken about 5 hits of some damn good shake from the ass-end from a quarter of some damn good herb. ",
      "Right now, I am totally jacked up.  I'm so glad that I'm stoned--otherwise, there's no way that I could mellow out at all.  I have all the classic ephedrine effects but with a rush.  I have no idea whether or not I freebased the 200mg of caffeine in the capsule.  I am feeling no distinct caffeine syptoms.  After about 4 hits of that lump and about the same number of hits of weed (from trusty bowl #2), I got the distinct feeling of coming on to a pychedelic.  I even got some cool visuals, especially with eyes closed.  Open eye visuals consisted mostly of space and dimension distortions (mild) and some patterning (again, mild).  Closed eye visuals consisted of light but pretty detailed patterning with multiple colors (very mild but if I concentrated...).  The visuals started about 2 minutes after my last hit and lasted approx. 10min. Again, I have no idea what role (if any) caffeine plays in this experience.  Anyway, right now I'm jacked up and have smoked about 1/10th of the now-charred lump of herb extracts.  This stuff is obviously potent but maybe a tolerance could be established if used consistently and frequently.  It may also be addictive. ",
      "Please be careful if you try this experiment.  Remember--I am typing this report as I am still experiencing the effect so I very well may have a heart attack and hence fall dead before the trip concludes.  Therefore, I advise NOT trying this experiment at home (it is wrong to use a 'nutritional supplement' contrary to the label's indications)."

      "I have become a fan of 'microdoses' of morning glory seeds in the recent months. I am a healthy male in my mid 20ies and have a background in academia. I occasionally chew up 1 to 10 seeds of Ipomoea violacea ('Heavenly Blue' variety) and hold them under the tongue for some minutes. Sometimes I swallow them afterwards, which might produce slightly stronger effects, but on most occasions I spit out the residues. I have no significant ill effects from this procedure. I sometimes consume the seeds in the morning, after breakfast. Taking the seeds after brushing my teeth seems to increase the effect significantly, which is probably due to easier absorption through the mucus membranes (removal of dead cell layers and mucus, increased microcirculation through menthol).",
      "On most occasions, the consumption of a 'microdose' results in slightly sharpened aesthetic perception, heightened mood and makes social interaction a bit easier and enjoyable. Such microdoses have some nootropic and intellectualizing effects. I am experienced with other nootropics including Piracetam, Hydergine, Selegiline, Vinpocetine, Ginkgo, Ashwagandha and others, and morning glory seeds might be one of my favorites. All in all, they seem to improve my cognitive and 'spiritual' state in a very subtle, yet significant manner. The positive effects sometimes seem to last well into the next day.",
      "It should be mentioned that I sometimes also consume the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline in low doses (",
      "It might also be notable that I have tried the same procedure with seeds of Argyreia nervosa, but did not experience the effects above, or only in a barely noticeable manner. This seems counter-intuitive, since these seeds have a far higher concentration of ergolines compared to Ipomoea tricolor. Maybe one of the minor constituents in morning glory seeds is responsible for the nootropic effects, and this constituent is missing in A. nervosa -- but this is still a very weak hypothesis."

      "I guess history is needed, multiple experiences with LSD, shrooms, ecstacy, weed, coke, mescaline, GHB, DXM, ketamine, opiates and alcohol. I was recently given the opportunity to try 2C-T-2 and was thoroughly excited about it. I had the day off and planned the entire day around the experience, expecting a mild to medium trip, boy, was I in for a shock.",
      "That morning, I got any small chores that I had been putting off done, so as to have a totally responsibility-free day in which to partake this substance. Hadn't eaten since the night before, was expecting nausea as I had read about. Now, I read awhile ago that snorting it reduced the incoming nausea, and for some reason that thought was imprinted in my brain. Why oh why the fact that snorting requires a much smaller dosage didn't stick in my brain, I don't know, so that fascilitated my next mistake. Measured out 24mg around 2:25pm, cut it into a line, got my straw ready, and leaned over the dresser.",
      "OMFGHOLYSHITGODDAMNTHATFUCKINGHURTS@@!#!!!!@#!@#$*^!$....",
      "omg....wow, this is FAST.....holy hell this is fucking FAST...",
      "I mean, I was holding my nose jumping up and down, got maybe 10 feet away from the dresser, and my visuals were starting to surpass any I have ever seen on a 250mcg dose of LSD. That couldn't have been more than 30sec from the time I inhaled it, not even coke is that fast. Nothing I have EVER done has come on that quickly and that intensely that fast. Maybe a minute after that, I started sweating profusely, which actually started to worry me, so I went to the AC in my bedroom, turned it on high, and sat in front of it. There I sat, checking my nose for blood, cause nothing has ever hurt that bad lol, and watching the visuals skyrocket. Well, it felt like a good bit of time had passed, so I leaned around the corner to look at the clock on the wall in the next room. 2:29pm.",
      "........",
      "Holy hell....",
      "After what seemed like an hour, and when my sweating calmed way down, I looked at the clock again. 2:38pm.",
      ".....",
      "Well, I was convinced by then that I had not just killed myself, so I went to get some water out of my fridge. I absolutely LOVED the visual aspect of it. LSD-like visuals, but much more pronounced (moreso than even the 500-600mcg LSD trips I've had), and much more fluid, absolutely amazing. I grabbed the water and went back to the AC. I was laying on the floor on my back, and my cat came up and sat on my stomach, and I watched her rather unusual appearance twist and morph for 5min or so, then I started to get an uneasy feeling. So I pushed my cat off me, stretched out as far as I could, and then I knew what that feeling was: my stomach. I sat up to test it, and it got a little worse. I knew it was coming then, so I got up and stumbled to the sink in the other room, noticing the clock as I walked by (it said 2:48pm).",
      "I pulled a chair up to the sink, kinda kneeled down on it with my elbows on the counter, and stared at the gloriously moving sink drain. (I love that room btw, its maybe 8'x24', with a countered sink on one side, a table with my computer and a tv on the other end, a doorway to the den in one long wall, a fridge and a long table with my turntables on the other long wall. I had all the windows covered by blankets, so the lighting in it is perfect.)  I then proceded to have one hellish half an hour. If my body could have talked to me, this is what it would of been saying:",
      "'What....the...FUCK...is this SHIT?!'      'Did I do something to make you hate me??!'",
      "I so felt like I had been poisoned, and I remember thinking 'This stuff CAN'T be good for you'. After half an hour of swearing at the sink, I thought I might as well try and enjoy this since I'm already here. The problem was, no matter where I went, what position I was in, I still felt terrible. My whole body ached and my stomach was not happy with me. I tried sitting in front of the tv to play the game I had set up. I recently got a Nintendo Wii, and I'm a huge Zelda fan, I managed to find a promotional disk for the Gamecube that came out right before Wind Waker, that had 4 Zelda games on it, one of which was the original Legend of Zelda :):):):), some of you youngins probably don't appreciate what a great game that is, on a side note, that game was on the tv for the entire experience, so that soundtrack is forever etched into my brain.",
      "I remember thinking that I would have liked to try killing time that way, but I just felt like shit, so I couldn't sit there for too long. I then went to lay on my bed for a bit, thinking that this was the peak, cause the visuals were out of this world gorgeous. Which is such a shame, I LOVED the visuals, but I felt too bad to enjoy them, which kinda angered me. Also, my mind was almost totally sober, I felt that I could have directed my thinking in any way I wanted, and I could have gotten very introspective had I been able to take my mind off of the way my body felt, which is another shame, there was alot of potential to work on some issues, but my body kept asking me why I did this to it. So, I decided to take a shower.",
      "That was an interesting experience to say the least lol. Had a nice personal experience in there, and while I was rinsing my hair, I remember thinking 'I'm so glad that I'm not in this state every time I shower.' Rinsing off soap and shampoo was extremely difficult, cause I really could not tell if I had gotten it all out or not. I could have gotten out of the shower still covered in soap and shampoo thinking that I did wash it all off. Luckily, I looked in the mirror and saw that it was all rinsed off. I went back upstairs to my bedroom, looking out the window as I did, feeling sad that I couldn't go out and enjoy the beautiful sunny day. I looked at the clock, and it was 3:45pm. About 20min later, I could tell that the peak was over, which made me happy, I was sorry to see the visuals start to trail off, but I knew that the experience was ending, so I would feel better physically in the near future.",
      "My stomach was much better after the shower, although not perfect, but my body now felt like I had eaten some dirty acid, joints ached and my back was full of tension and soreness, and for the love of god, if I could have only cracked my neck, I would feel better.",
      "I then sat down and talked to a friend online, he knew I was doing the new powder I got, and wanted to know what it was like. I had some Corona in the fridge, and I promised myself that at 9pm, I was going to have the best tasting Corona in my entire life. So, from about 4:25 til about 7pm, I was talking to him online and watching my much loved visuals slowly dissipate. At 7pm, I decided to see what tv was like, so I turned it on, and found a very interesting show on the Science channel (love the Science channel, the Discovery channel, and the National Geographic channel :) ) called Planet Weather: Wind. It's about how wind starts, and globally moves around the world and creates all the weather that we see, was really into it, the mind state I was in was very conducive to learning I found. Until commercials started, the cramming of all of what society is about in 20-30sec really sickened me. Then, at 9pm, I finally opened a Corona, it was godly lol. I basically then rode the entire experience out to the very end, til NO effects remained, which lasted til about 3am. Sleep came fairly easy then. Pretty interesting dreams too :)",
      "All in all, I do not regret the experience at all, it was very intense and an interesting introduction to RCs. I had expected a somewhat mild trip, which I think it would have been if I had eaten the dose. Again I guess I'll say lol, I absolutely LOVED the visual aspect, gorgeous visuals, and the mind-space was very malleable, it could have been a very productive tool for me, however, the physical aspect of it was HORRIBLE. I might find that taking it orally would seriously reduce the physical discomfort, but after the visual aspect I saw, and the mind-space I was in, I doubt I could get back there without somewhat of a heroic dose orally, which probably wouldn't reduce the physical aspect anyway, so I'm gonna pass on the rest of the powder I have. I have a few friends that might possibly be interested, but if they aren't, I guess I'm going to do the same thing MGS said years ago, use the rest for its intended legal purpose: a sink cleanser (which is kind of funny to me in a way, I feel that I thoroughly cleansed my sink during that half an hour of hell ,) )"

      "I'm 34 years old and 10 years ago I was a user of Ecstacy, LSD and cannabis. Not heavy, but enough to have some good times - and some bad. I still dabble very occasionally but recently I was prescribed Tramadol for severe sinus headaches which have always been a problem for me. The Tramadol eased the pain a little but the main feeling I got was 'hey!.. this reminds me of something..' and I then realized there was more potential for recreational use than actual pain relief!",
      "I initially took the suggested 100mg but soon increased it to 150mg for recreational use, beefed up by a couple of shots of whisky. Tramadol comes on so very very slowly and it's not until 2 or even 3 hours have passed that I am fully aware of being under it's spell. I like because it's a mild feeling - no teeth grinding or anything - it just simply promotes a feeling of warm, cozy well-being and makes me want to curl up in front of a fire on a sheepskin rug, close my eyes and listen to music. Which is exactly what I do! It does make me slightly dizzy but quite enjoyably I find. If I take 150mg early evening then, even if I go to bed at 2am, I'll still feel it's effects - and being in bed is a great place to be on this stuff. Sleep is good too. Not that it makes me horny though! And this leads me to my main point.",
      "Tramadol, like some other substances, makes it hard to get erect and stay and erect and very hard to reach orgasm. However - and here's the crunch - If I can manage to get to climax somehow (preferably from sex rather than just a quick hand shandy) then wow! The post-coital feeling is amazing! In this state I really do feel as if Ive had a proper does of opiates, if only for a short time. I lay for half an hour listening to music in the most blissful post-sex state I've ever experienced. It was truly wonderful.. and the best thing is there's no real hangover because all Ive taken is slightly over the recommended dose of a prescribed substance and spiced it up with a perfectly natural (and very hard to reach) orgasm!"

      "In 2004, my favourite friends and I spent a lot of time off our faces. Mostly it was just on weed, though occasionally we were able to lay our hands on some acid. We took it only very few times over the course of the summer, but the trips we had were some of the most beautiful and memorable of my entire drug-taking life.",
      "There is something very special about tripping with people that you care deeply about. There is one night in particular, though, that will stay with me forever - not only was I in fine company, it was also a night of great self-discovery for me.",
      "There were six of us. We were in our friend's band practice room. The tabs simply bore a red square bordered by white. The first few hours of the trip were pleasant but wholly unremarkable - the weirdness grew and grew until I was thoroughly outside of the metaphorical box and in tune with the surreal and child-like side of myself that I love so much. I recall spending quite some time watching a beetle crawling across the floor, and being absolutely mesmerised by the concept of an exoskeleton.",
      "I also spent a good long while with an orange. Examining it in a way that I only ever really do when I'm tripping. Running my fingers over the skin, squeezing it gently, smelling it, digging my nails into it - it was as though I had never seen an orange in my life. I was absolutely enthralled with its perfectly spherical shape. I licked it, I tapped it, brushed it against my face and over my lips... everything I did was centred around getting an absolutely clear picture if what it is that oranges are all about. Peeling it took an awfully long time, but it was okay because time was nothing more than a harmless illusion anyway. And finally being able to pop a segment into my mouth.. slowly chew and feel it with my tongue, all the time marveling at the changes in flavour and texture, then at last to swallow... it was almost orgasmic.",
      "I came to the conclusion at that point that oranges are nature's most perfect creation - and to this day I am still convinced that they're pretty fucking clever. The way they're designed and put together, they really are a bit special (and apart from the occasional satsuma I don't even like the bloody things!).",
      "It was shortly after my little citrusgasm that I was hit by The Badness. At that time in my life, my depression was reaching its most severe. And at that moment I began to experience the most crippling low I can ever remember feeling. I dropped of my chair, crept into a little space in the corner, and fell into an almost catatonic blackness. I would have cried with despair had I any energy whatsoever. I became absolutely convinced that my whole existence was utterly pointless and insignificant. I didn't want to be alive any more.",
      "Nobody else seemed to notice.",
      "I don't know how long I was there, but eventually one of the others gently shook my arm and told me they were going on a mission - to walk into town (several miles down a country lane). I tried over and over to tell them I didn't want to go... in my head, I was ecstatic that they were leaving because it meant I would have the privacy I needed to kill myself. After a lot of persuasion, I was talked into going with them.",
      "Standing up was so difficult that it physically hurt me. Trudging outside took only a few seconds but they lasted a lifetime.",
      "As I stepped out into the warm morning air, suddenly every ounce of the depression lifted. The pain was gone. I looked around, everything looked so beautiful in the vague pre-dawn half light, and I smiled. Had I stayed inside and gone through with my plan, I would have missed this gorgeous moment. Each breath tasted sweet and each step filled me with a renewed energy.",
      "The mission back into town on foot is a long one, but it felt like about 20 minutes. All of the plants, trees, fields.. everything natural was emitting a faint blue glow and the more I gazed over it all, the more it healed me and made me feel alive. I fell behind as the rest of the group went off ahead, and that was okay. I loved them all dearly, but I needed the semi-solitude to get through my little personal battle.",
      "As we reached the town, I opted to head back home instead of going on to the castle. We said out goodbyes, and about ten minutes later I got back. It was about 5am. I made myself a big mug of coffee, cut a slab of chocolate cheesecake, and went and sat outside and watched the sunrise.",
      "And as I sat there, drinking the nicest coffee in the world and eating the best goddamned cheesecake of my life, I watched the world wake up and I had one of those life-changing revelations that one often has on acid, but this one really did change my life.",
      "It dawned on me that the reason the whole night had just been one big metaphor for my life. I'd had some fun, but because I'd slipped into my own little world and started ignoring everything around me I became depressed. It was the show of love and friendship from those around me that convinced me to get up and fight back, and it wasn't an easy thing to do but it made a huge difference and got me to where I needed to be.",
      "At that moment, I finally saw the way out of my mental problems. And I knew it wasn't going to be easy, I knew it was going to be a long and painful road... but I also knew that I'd be okay at the end of it.",
      "That was the first time in a lot of years that I started to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It was still a long time before I was able to say I'd recovered to any great extent, but since then I've always been able to think back to that night and know that everything would eventually come together."

      "I am a middle aged male, deeply happy about my life, in a beautiful setting and quite experienced with various psychedelic medicines.",
      "I have been very excited about trying DPT having obtained some from a reliable supplier.  I have been experimenting with rectal administration of psychedelics lately.  Although the method is somewhat cumbersome to apply, the resulting effects seem to lack the body load I am used to suffering from most research chemicals when taken orally.  My research indicated rectal administration of DPT should probably be active so I set about putting together my first experiment.",
      "12:00  To begin, a 10 mg sample of DPT was insufflated in order to screen for allergic effects and as an added precaution to ensure the material provided the expected sort of reaction.  I have heard of research chemicals being mislabeled lately, and I have decided to test all products this way prior to administering a larger dose.  Little burn was noted and only a very slight light-headedness resulted. The lack of more noticeable effects and the DMT like odour of the DPT suggested that I was safe to proceed.",
      "12:35  I administered approximately 32 mg  of DPT using the rectal method, but unfortunately an undetermined amount was spilled during administration, perhaps 5-10 mg, but I cant be sure.  I decided to wait and see what might happen before re-dosing.",
      "1:30  I sat around my apartment for a while, reading a book and waiting for effects to come up.  After an hour, only very minor effects were noted, such as brightening of colours and a vague physical stimulation. I needed to go to the bathroom, and had been holding out to ensure the dose was fully administered, so I decide to take care of that and then administer a booster dose.",
      "1:35  Having little to no reaction from the previous dose I decide to administer another 40 mg DPT rectally  this time there was no spillage.",
      "2:10  Still not a lot happening, other than brighter colours.  My mind state is clear, and communication with my girlfriend is easy. We decide a walk in the park is on order.  It is a beautifully spring day outside and all of the blossom trees have come out in the past week or so, so my sober girlfriend takes the helm and drives us there.",
      "3:50 - Back home from a beautiful walk through the park. The weather was picture perfect, 70 degrees, with sun and clouds. Little to no wind, so it was very comfortable for taking in the beauty around us. What few effects were noted dissipated during the walk, and I felt entirely sober when we reached the car, so I offered to drive home, feeling comfortable that there were absolutely no effects present.",
      "So, that was it. Sorry to bore you with a day-in-the-life story of Me, but this report should serve to assist someone in some way or another, with dosing at least.  I think my next experiment will be insufflated, or perhaps rectal with an MAOI.  I leave you with this thought:",
      "I am told I live in a free country.  May a time come when my government will allow me the right and freedom to explore my own consciousness, free from the threat of imprisonment and/or destruction of my livelihood.  Do your part, take time to support an organization that fights for our freedom.",

      "March 22, 2007",
      "First, let me begin by telling you a little bit about myself and that the reason I am writing this is to attain closure. I am seventeen years old and I have great parents who are not divorced, I have two wonderful older siblings, I live in sunny California and life is great. I may have recognized and appreciated these basic things in the back of my mind, but before the night of March 19, and my recovery therein, I had not truly come to realize all that I should be grateful for in my life. Before that fateful night, I had smoked marijuana 2 consecutive nights before with one of my best friends. Before then, I hadnt smoked in over 2 months (Id smoked many times before). I had no real reason for trying to stop at the time, but I just knew it was probably wrong and I felt bad that my mom actually believed me when she thought that I had stopped smoking.",
      "Apparently this guilt was not enough of a deterrent when my friend called me telling me that he got some medical marijuana from one of his friends and wanted to roll a joint and smoke it with me. Well I was always interested in new ways of smoking and often made new bongs and such, so I said okay, but I want to roll it. We had never used or rolled joints before. So I get to his house that first night of my three day binge and I roll a loose and incorrectly rolled joint, we smoke it and get high, eat, sleep, and do whatever else one does when high. The next night, we purchase a gram of weed for twenty dollars from a local kid, we had purchased from this kid before on a number of occasions a few months back. We rolled two joints, one for tonight, and one for tomorrow. We smoke it, same story, and my friend asks me why I always want to go into my own world when I get high, and dont want to talk to him, and make weird faces. I tell him its a lot of work to regain control, why not just let me drift off into my mind and you drift off into yours, maybe youll discover something.",
      "Well, it turns out the next day I did discover something, a few things. It was March 19, the eve of our Persian New Year, that something powerful sent me a message and stopped me in my tracks. I smoked the same amount that I had smoked the other night, half of a well-rolled joint (I am a fast learner), and my friend smoked the other half. Keep in mind that we had smoked from the same gram of weed that we had purchased the night before. We were both fine. Tonight, my friend was fine, I wasnt. My urine test that I would have 19 hours later stated that there was ONLY marijuana in my system. I was befuddled, but lets continue on to what actually happened.",
      "We were outside of my friends house and were walking around. The weed hit me as it normally does, but as I would soon find out, its strength would slowly escalate. We walked to the gym where my friend began to run the treadmill and I sat behind him on one of the machines, too stoned to even walk. It was here where I experienced so much pleasure that it scared the hell out of me because it seemed to be in my control. All of my muscles were tense so as to support me in the machine I was sitting in, and I was receiving a lot of sensory input from my eyes (TV, lights, moving machinery) and my ears (TV blaring, treadmill humming, feet pounding on the treadmill). I closed my eyes and felt myself carried away in an ocean of noise. If I concentrated hard, I could regain control, but if I just let myself relax, I would again be carried away.",
      "The more I let myself get carried away in my mind, the more pleasure I would sense. I couldnt believe it, I thought that I might have figured out how to use marijuana, because to be honest with you, I had never really enjoyed all the other times Id gotten high. I was really just trying to figure out what exactly was fun about it. The best thing I could think of was the excessive laughter that occurs about five minutes after you smoke up. But even that has a better natural substitute, just watch a comedy! Anyway I thought Id discovered the secret to marijuana because I felt that I could gradually increase my sensory pleasure. As my friend got off the treadmill he asked me what the hell I was doing because it looked like I was having an orgasm. Excited, I told him Dude I think I figured this shit out. I just experienced the most pleasure Ive ever had. My friend replies, Bro it looked like you were having sex. Obviously I was embarrassed and I said Sorry, Ill try to control it. My friend, too stoned to care for very long, motions for us to leave to get some food.",
      "We begin to walk to his house. I see his little brother and for fear of looking like a crazy person in front of him, I start walking towards a nearby shopping center, to later call my friend when I recuperate. My friend called me asking me where I went. I told him the truth Dude, I am having trouble controlling myself! He tells me his brother left and for me to come back and meet him at the basketball courts by his house. This is where I began to feel like I was twitching. I dont think I actually was, but it only grew worse as I thought more about the possibility.",
      "Alright so I am going back to my friends house, to meet him at the basketball courts. I was so high that when I talked to him, even though we had pauses of about three or four seconds between each of our one or two syllable responses, I felt that we were both really only speaking telepathically. I felt like if I were to say Hey Im over here by the things he would understand and reply with Oh and I would understand that it meant Okay, so youre at the crosswalk, cool, now head over to me. I felt like we were connected mentally, even though he wasnt as high as me. The scary part hasnt even started and I was only getting higher and higher at this point.",
      "So I felt like I was trembling, having a full seizure while awake. Two weeks prior, I had my very first seizure in my sleep. The neurologist thinks I may be epileptic because I also have partial seizures every once in a while. Partial seizures are not anything like the first seizure I had. Partial seizures are just two to five minute instances where I become somewhat anxious, nauseas, somewhat paranoid, and uneasy. It seemed like the only way to slow my seizure tremors down and be normal was to concentrate and be the real me, to not let the weed take over me. When the weed took over and my mind rushed and soared, I felt like I was probably seizing on the outside.",
      "As I reached the basketball courts I could see my friend approaching in the same robotic fashion as myself. The part that scared me was that as I approached him, and he approached me, he suddenly stopped when his eyes met mine. He stopped and idled around as though he didnt want anyone to think he was associated with me. I thought SHIT! I must really be seizing or looking ridiculous. I stop too, and call him on the cell. I dont really remember what happened in the next few minutes, but I think that he was pretty unresponsive on the phone (or I was just getting so high that I couldnt understand him anymore) and the next thing I knew, I was running towards the baseball field dugout to sit down in the corner by myself and let the high pass over me. It had been at least and hour or two at this point and I figured theres only about two or three more hours to go at the most and Id be back to normal. Little did I know, the insanity was just about to get started.",
      "Here is the part that I dont fully understand. If I closed my eyes, the last picture that was in my eyes would remain, and my mind would start doing unusual things. In other words, if my eyes werent open and receiving images, my brain would just make up images for me, and I would believe those were coming from my open eyes, when in fact they werent, and my eyes were closed. As I sat down in the corner, cowering, covering my face in fear my friend approached me and asked me what the hell was wrong with me. Well I now realize that I felt a million emotions in a matter of minutes at that time, let me try to explain what I felt.",
      "Everything seemed so surreal that I thought I had died. I thought, if I am dead, and this is just what I am supposed to see after my death, then why can it change depending on what I choose to do? Shouldnt I be unable to alter this reality (I didnt even believe in the presence of earth around me anymore, or the existence of myself for that matter). So I thought I had died and that everyone who dies before his time because of a mistake of his own like I had has to deal with this: I can see how the world will end, but I cant see how Ill actually die, because I already died from overdose or seizure or stress or something, even though you cant overdose on weed or die from a seizure as far as I know. So I am sitting there really believing that I am dead. One reason why I thought I was dead was because I felt like I was in hell.",
      "My friend said I was yelling that I found the secret that Im in limbo. Well by limbo I meant this: HELL ON EARTH. I was telling him Kill me now. Kill me now please. I thought that was the only way to end the punishment that was about to come to me for being a bad person and ending my life so soon with the drugs or whatever it was that killed me. My soul was becoming detached from my body, as it did, I became something else. I started to think Damn, well I understand it all now. I had a series of epiphanies about life, humanity, the afterlife, the big picture.",
      "I guess my detached self  thought that I was God. Now, what I meant by God was that everyone is the God of their own life. That which we call God is the combined essence of all that is life, from bacteria to humans. In other words, God is simply the miracle of our very existence. Obviously these complex thoughts came out stupidly in the real world. I remember saying I am God repeatedly and that I get it now. I dont really remember a lot of what exactly I thought that I got or understood, but I can tell you what it was that might have made me feel like I was dead, or that I was God or anything else.",
      "If I focused my thoughts on a particular emotion, such as love or compassion, it was amplified tens of times, somewhat similarly to how Id just get carried away with pleasure back in the gym, except this was with any emotion, and much more intense, only increasing in intensity as I dwelled on it. I would feel extremely happy, then I would feel utterly devastated. At first, I had a lot of control. But as I lost control of myself, as my soul separated from my body, as I became someone else I began my descent into that which we perceive as hell.",
      "Okay, so minutes earlier, my friend is kneeling towards me trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me, I try to pull out of this vicious bewilderment and bring myself to reality with the help of my friend yelling my name and pulling at my arm. I pull out my cell phone and call my brother in another state. I tell him I love him and that I think I might be dead, but that I am somehow still talking to him so maybe Im not. I tell him I just smoked some weed and it is doing something crazy to me, and that I cant control myself for much longer. I told him that I love him and I trust him to make the right decision for me.",
      "I hear him start crying on other end of the line as he asks me who I am with, and to give the phone to him. He also asks my address and says he will call 911. I hand the phone to my friend and doze off into more of the same insanity. I dont personally remember what happened for the next few minutes as they talked on the phone, but my friend told me that my brother said not to let me close my eyes or fall asleep. At that point, the drug took over me again, and I guess I was feeling good emotions again, I was thinking I (God) was sent here to make things right, to tell people not to make the same mistakes as I did, to value their lives, to not do drugs, to not yell at their mothers, etc. I began to slowly (I was witnessing this, and I was sort of disgusted but fascinated at the same time) change from my cowering position into a peaceful, happy position with a huge smile on my face. I was sitting cross-legged, with my hands together in my lap.",
      "My friend is obviously freaked out, and my eyes were closed so he slaps me in the face and says that I gave him the most evil, devilish facial expression [he] had ever seen in [his] life and got up and ran into the middle of the field. In my mind I just thought I was being trouble to him and my brother and I should get as far as I can to let whatever has come over me pass over in time. Time was my only hope, time so the drug can leave my system. I ran and then dove chest first straight into the ground. (I still have chest pain today from that) I went on thinking I was God for the next hour or two.",
      "I dont want to describe too many of the details, because in my head it was more of the same. My friend managed to lead me to his house, and my brother had called my parents and they were about to get home. I completely believed that I was God or whatever and my friend was getting irritated because I was cocky as hell because I was saying wow now I understand and he would ask me what it was I understood, and as I began to explain I would say Oh you wont understand! Pathetic.",
      "My parents show up at the door and I, believing more and more that I am indeed God at that point, continue on, saying stupid shit, thinking Im prophetic and very wise. Let me tell you that all this time I still thought that I was shaking, seizure-like. But as I went into my dads arms I felt like my seizure was slowing down close to nothing, to normal, that I was at peace for a second. I began bawling like a baby. I NEVER hug my dad or kiss him or anything like that, I never even cry, but that night, my emotions were raw and I did not care. I was happy to be alive.",
      "So, more of the same, they take me to the hospital emergency room where the wait was very long. I was still thinking that I was God and Id say it peaked there in the hospital. I thought I could do anything and I was pretty peaceful. Then I had a scary thought. I thought well why would God be sent to earth like this? Is this my punishment? I thought that maybe everybody was their own God after they die. That if I didnt like how my old God ran the show, I could try it out myself now and see how I liked it (in a sarcastic tone) and realize its so much harder than it might seem, to have so much power. Haha. Every once in a while I would manage to get a hold of myself and tell my dad Look I dont know what the hell is going on but no matter what keep me alive Paranoia had set in.",
      "Well that night, it made sense to me and it was perfectly possible. So then I thought of the three possibilities therein! Each one was a picture painted in my head, with my eyes closed. I sat there in the ER waiting room as I closed my eyes and this is what I imaged. The first painting/scenario/whatever was of me sitting there with my moms hand in one of my hands and my dads hand in the other, on either side of me. Everyone in the world was in the background behind us. In the scene, I was crying with the most passion I had ever seen, and everyone else was the same way. The world was dark and gloomy and filled with hate. I was frozen solid and so was everyone else. Humanity had lost. Then I felt the opposite, everyone was happy, bright lights from everywhere, emanating mostly from myself, I had become triumphant and had led the world to utopia. The third one was that I would just continue life as my parents kid and try to just see what happens because I cant control my God powers enough and I thought that I would just do more harm than good if I tried to make things better.",
      "Talk about weird, talk about confusion. That was just about the end of me thinking that I am God for the most part, it came back a little here and there but with no new sensations or feelings, just more of the same, filled with a lot more paranoia. I got tired of being at the ER waiting room and decided to leave, I just walked out and my parents followed, we got in the car and my dad noted that I was freezing cold for some reason, and that my heart was beating very slowly and my lips were purple and bruised. I think it was about 12 or 1 AM at that point. We got home, and I felt like my dad was going to try to club me or my mom was going to try to sneak some poison into my chocolate as she offered it to me. When in fact, it seems that in this world, you can really only trust your family. It was disgusting, but I had finally regained control of myself.",
      "Later that night if I closed my eyes and tried to sleep I would have flashbacks and think about what had happened that night. I still had extreme cotton mouth and extreme paranoia. I could only feel comfortable if I was hugging my mom. I could only stay sane if I talked to her all night. From 1:30 AM to 6 AM I talked to my mom constantly and ran close to 12 liters of water through my system. I felt like I had caused my parents so much pain. I have made so many mistakes in my life and this was one of the most hurtful ones that my parents have had to go through for me.",
      "I managed to get a few hours of sleep in the morning and was later taken to a different hospital from before. They tested my urine and turns out the weed was not laced. I just reacted differently. I had a psychotic schizophrenic episode. The marijuana can unmask schizophrenia in those who may have the gene for it, said the doctor. As I ate my hospital food (at this point I had almost completely normalized, it was 4 PM the next day) an old man of 85 years came up to me and told me his story and gave me encouraging words of wisdom. Again, I am not one to cry, but this man was so powerful, or maybe it was my state of mind, but I again began to cry. And as I left the hospital and shook his hand a second time, I again shed tears uncontrollably. As I waited with my mom for the hospital valet to bring our car around, I again cried on my moms shoulder. I will never touch marijuana, or any other drug or psychoactive again because the mind is a terrible thing to waste."

      "The first time I took Salvia was a huge turning point in my life. It was the summer of 2002, I was with my then-partner Dave and our regular trip companion Iggy. We were coming down from a night of especially good ecstacy, and Dave made the suggestion that we round it off with some Salvia. It seemed like a good idea at the time.",
      "Iggy went first. He'd done it once before, and as he exhaled he muttered 'I remember this. Oh yes, I remember this.' whilst bringing his hand to his mouth as though he was trying to smoke a pipe. Then it was my turn.",
      "The part that I remember most clearly was the foul-tasting smoke that felt like it was tearing the back of my throat to shreds. I held it in, and held it, nothing was happening. I exhaled slowly, and the last thing I remember seeing was Dave's face, his eyes staring into mine and a smile on his lips. I felt safe.",
      "The entire room melted like one of those crazy Winamp visualisations. Everything in my field of vision just dissolved and liquidised and started to swirl around each other. I started to panic, and as soon as I did the whole thing froze as it was. A soft, warm female voice came to me, a voice that I felt like I knew. I have come to believe that this was the voice of the plant. 'Don't worry,' she told me, 'It's supposed to happen like that.' I was filled for an instant with a kind of calm joy, then as far as I can remember I ceased to exist. I was not a person, I was not watching any of this happen, I was simply a part of it.",
      "Crisscrossing lines appeared across the frozen image in front of me, marking out the shapes of interlocking jigsaw pieces. One by one they began to spin away, until all that remained was darkness. Pure, thick, tangiable blackness, but it was so very alive. What I saw next, I was not able to describe up until several years later during an especially pleasant journey on mushrooms. Dominating my field of vision was a huge Aum, shimmering and glowing in colours that don't even have a name. Gorgeous bright orbs orbited around it and I was one of them, and at the same time I was observing from a great distance away. At the time I had no idea what it was or how to interpret it, and when the trip was over that's the part that frightened me the most.",
      "I was torn away from that place quite abruptly, and some version of reality started to take shape in front of me. And then another, and another. Different pictures, all seen as though through my own eyes flew through my field of vision; sitting in a field, sitting in a bedroom, sitting in some dark corner of a nightclub. I didn't recognise any of the scenes that I saw, but I knew that if I did not choose one and return to it then my life would be lost. This was not in any way frightening, but at this point my sense of self was starting to return and I remembered that I was alive, and that I was not yet ready to abandon the physical world.",
      "The pieces of reality started to drift away, and once again I began to panic. I reached out and grabbed the closest one to me, and within an instant I found myself sitting on the floor of a room I did not recognise, clinging desperately to a man I did not know. I tried to ask him who he was but I couldn't remember how to speak. My entire memory had been erased, all I knew was that this man was to be trusted. I thought, for a few horrible seconds, that I has ended up in the wrong place.",
      "As my memory started to return, I recognised the man as Dave and the surroundings as his bedroom. It seems I regained the power of laughter before the power of speech, and everything became immensely comical. At some point, Dave handed me a pen and paper to try and aid in my efforts to communicate, but the two repelled one another like two same magnets. Whatever was in my head clearly wasn't ready to be let out. The night drew to a close, Iggy left, some version of sleeping happened.",
      "The next day the problems started. I couldn't stop wondering, what if I had ended up in the wrong place? What if the memories that returned to me were different for each of the different places I could have ended up in? It was on that day that I began to seriously question reality. It is only in the past year that I have felt comfortable enough to stop.",
      "In retrospect, perhaps 10x extract was not the wisest way to take my first tentative steps into the world of shamanic herbs."

I was only diagnosed after I got a job. I took ritalin for two years, about a decade back.  Recently I developed idiopathic hypersomnia, and was diagnosed by a sleep specialist.  The treatment for hypersomnia and ADD are the same - stimulants.  And I was sleeping most of the day, borderline but not positive for narcolepsy.",

      "I highly recommend that if you have a sleep disorder, find the dosage where you feel the benefit but no euphoria.  You can break these pills in half, even quarters.  Actually, even if you don't have a disorder, and somehow got this drug just to stay awake, I also recommend it.  At this dose I can function like a normal human being.  However, I do need to take a break, no dose or just half a dose, for a day every week or two weeks or I start to have trouble sleeping at night."

      "I found a twenty milligram extended release pill of Opana. I had done Oxymorphone once before, but the last time really takes the cake. Me and my friend split a twenty mg. that was split into two, had the coating removed, then took a bump up each nostril each. It was felt within minutes, and peaked within an hour or so.",
      "I have a problem where when I take hard drugs like this, I can't sit or stand still. I was sweaty and got heat flashes, while my friend nodded off occasionally. Huge head rush, extreme body high. For me, the best part was coming down after about two and a half hours, it felt better than the initial high...smooth clean, ultra relaxed. The wierd thing is, I couldn't sleep afterwards, just lie in bed and fell good.",
      "Overall, I'd say It has a huge potential for me to get addicted to, personally, so I probabaly won't be doing it that often."

      "My life is a train wreck at the time of experamintation. I'm depressed, lost my girlfriend, and started smoking pot. Not to mention I have AS. Also known as aspergers syndrome. That pretty much means I have sensory integration and have a hard time focusing on boring shit. Basically I'm a genius at topics that interest me but dont give a crap about anything else.",
      "SI (sensory integration) has made my life a living hell ever sense I was born. I have felt like I couldent even live in my own skin. Until just recently its been almost unbarable. Its starting to disperse now. Clothes no longer bother me. Some noises still do though.",
      "Anyways on to my little trip into my mind. The weed ran out so I was looking for another way to get fucked up. Then I heard about diphhydramine. I looked in the medicine cabinate and what do you know I found some sleepinol which has 50 milligrams of it in each pill. I popped about 600 mg worth in that and then I took 2 dryls also just for the hell of it which have 25mg diphhydramine in each. Then I sat back and turned on the tv to watch 24. After about an hour I thought it wasnt going to work so I stood up to get on the computer and the second I stood up I just fell down on the floor. I tried to get up and walk but my balance was to fucked up so I just sat back down. A little later in the trip about 30 minutes later I had to piss real bad so I got up and stumbled over to what I thought was the toilet but the lights were off. I didnt think the lights where off and I thought I was seeing the toilet. I ended up pissing on the floor. The next thing I know im hearing voices narrorating my life. Telling me of the past and the future. I thought this was interesting and wished they would continue but they suddenly stopped. The walls started moving in and out, in and out. I heard a noise sounding like a tornado so I hid in the closet. Then I remembered I'm trippin and I felt really stupid.",
      "About 3 and a half hours into the trip I put on some music but I couldent understand anything everytime they said a word I would forget it. About 4 hours into the trip I started seeing little things crawling on my bathroom floor but I ignored it and decided I've experianced all I was going to experiance and it was time to go to bed. On my way to turn off the lights I fell and it took a while to get up. I finally got up and turned off the lights then stubled over to my bed. The next day I still felt sort of intoxicated almost like an alchohol buzz and I still found walking a little difficult but other than that I was fine. No real hangover thank god."

      "DXM is the most powerful, profound and scary drug I have ever done. It is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of mind. I've learned to take responsibility for my indulgences, and I was prepared to take responsibility for that night.",
      "But I didn't expect this.",
      "I researched DXM trips for awhile before making my first batch using the 'Agent Lemon' method. It's cheap, the ingredients are easy to find, and most importantly, the theory and procedure were very simple after some experience in the Organic Chem. lab. On our first trip we split a weak batch of 1,000 mg four ways. We thought a tiny taste should suffice our first time (to test the safety of my extraction). We experienced mild disassociation and didn't die... so we decided to take the plunge the following weekend. ",
      "I produced 2/3 gallon of extra pure 'DXemonade' (mixed with lemon juice) using 6 8oz bottles of Tussin Maximum Strength (700 mg/bottle w/no other actives). I was very careful to liberally estimate my percent yield, to help avoid an overdose when pouring out our portions. On Saturday evening, we had 6 doses of 550-650 mg each (concentrated to about 1.25 cups each). Each dose was added to a large glass of grapefruit juice (after adjusting our doses according to body weight), mixed our cocktails and drank up.",
      "After one hour, we all began to feel drunk/stoned and had trouble walking. My stomach was upset from all the tart grapefruit juice and lemon juice, but I was too anxious to care. I decided to read other psychnauts' DXM accounts on the Internet, but as soon as I got onto the web, my eyes failed me. I couldn't read the words. I soon lost interest in the screen, lay in my dark room with 2 friends, and had my first out of body experience.",
      "It was tunnel vision in the literal sense. That within my field of view existed, and nothing peripheral did. I had no concept of right, left, up or down. Anything or anyone in my sight path became the whole focus of my being, a puzzle to be worked out. I lost control of my legs, arms and reflexes. The wave hit me so fast that I immediately assumed that I had overdosed. I had read how dangerous 4th plateau trips can be and decided that I needed more babysitters. I tried to go out in the living room. Gravity increased in strength and my legs felt weighed down.",
      "Most of my friends were as useless as I was, so I was not to be cheered up by them. I was no longer in control of my body, which then stumbled out onto the porch and lit a cigarette. The smoking made me ill, and I was sweating bullets, so I decided to take a cold shower. Instead, I sat on the edge of the tub and marveled at the toilet, wanting to throw up. The toilet waited patiently, like a sea creature, for me to lean over so it could gobble me up. My friend L then came in to rescue me. I ranted confusedly that the world was ending and that I would die 'tonight'. L wasn't as bad off as I, he understood that I was ragingly paranoid. So he sat with me trying to help me calm down. Suddenly, every emotion of which I am capable rushed through me. I was terrified, but excited. I laughed uncontrollably with tears in my eyes. Then I puked.",
      "The paranoia immediately lifted. I knew that I would no longer die tonight because the (very little) DXM left unabsorbed in my stomach was gone now. I didn't feel nauseous anymore, but I was very claustraphobic. L and another friend took me out for a walk. The cool summer night rejuvenated me. I began to enjoy my tunnel vision more. The outer stairway was a momentous challenge. I took a couple of minutes, but I mastered the daunting distance of one flight by crawling down backwards on all fours.",
      "We took long walk around the apartment grounds. At certain times, balance would become difficult (especially in grassy areas), and I would drop to all fours again to walk. This earned me the nickname 'DXM Monkey'. When I walked, it was like gliding. I took long exaggerated, steps which allowed me to see my feet (out in front of me) and remind me that I wasn't flying. I spoke about senseless things, mumbling to myself and my friends for the whole duration. People we passed along the way probably feared me, but I didn't care unless they were standing right in front of me.",
      "My vision shifted like slowly advancing frames of a film. I focused on an object, becoming one with it, until I had successfully circumvented it. Then I found another one to guide me. The decision not to drive was never a problem because it never even occured to us to go somewhere else. The apartment courtyard was a big enough puzzle to master. We went for several 'nature walks' that night, and often ended up camped out in the courtyard again to watch an ongoing night game of sand volleyball played by our neighbors. Seven psychonauts, all completely twisted, sat in the middle of the lawn, smoking cigarettes and staring at the volleyball court.",
      "The rest of the night seemed like a cocktail party. Everybody was loud and busy-playing music, making phone calls, chain smoking on the balcony and talking about our trip. It was the cleanest high I've ever felt. I was pleasantly insane for 6 hours (which took an eternity to pass). There was no waiting impatiently for the comedown, like on LSD. At first, the DXM got right on top of me, but I eventually took control of my (distant) body (or 'took the reins', as we now call it) and had a great time. DXM is by no means a rave or dance drug, but it worked very well for a tame night at home with friends.",
      "The walk through the Nature Tunnel is something I will probably repeat, but I will watch my dosage very closely in the future. We reached the 3rd plateau, and it almost overwhelmed me. I fear what I would find at the 4th."

      "Me and two friends of mine decided to take AMT the other night. i had seen my other friend on it and he had really liked it so we decided to give it a try. we took 40 milligrams at exactly 7:40p.m. we didnt expect it to kick in for about an hour or so, but no more then 10-15 minutes later my friend got really sick. she had to pull over and throw up and she started tripping her ass off and was really fucked up. me and my other friend had taken ours and we felt fine. a couple hours later i still felt fine, like it wasnt working at all and my friend was still totally messed up. then at about 11:30 we decided to go for a ride with some other friends. and about 15 minutes later i started seeing all kinds of beautiful visuals. visuals that were different from anytime i had ever taken acid. i felt really great and i was sooo happy that it was finally starting to kick in almost 4 and a half hours later. then i started to feel really nauscious. i thought it was pass, but it just didnt. so we pulled over and i threw up big time!!! i figured once i threw up that i would feel much better and enjoy myself more. but, the nausciousness just would not go away. i just kept throwing up about every 15 minutes and i couldnt stop. my one friend had stopped throwing up after the first hour and my other friend wasnt feeling bad at all, just enjoying the trip. and as time went on more and more i just kept going deeper into a trip like i was never coming down. at one point i told my friends i was definitely peaking, but then about 3 hours later i told them that i take that back and i was peaking now!!! lol. but i still could not stop throwing up. my stomach felt sooooooooooo incredibly bad. and i was getting this horrible intense headache and any light was really hurting my eyes. both of my friends had the bad headache too. i was starting to get scared b/c my body was reacting so horribly to the drug, but however i was still trying to not let it ruin my trip b/c everything i was seeing was so pretty. at one point i was sooo close to asking my friends to take me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped, but i didnt want to scare them or ruin their trip so i didnt. i just kept trying to have fun. i continued to throw up even at 12 p.m. the next day, like 15 hours later from when i first took it. at that point we still had not fallen asleep yet. it was really weird b/c i never throw up off of anything and i just could not stop. we finally fell asleep at about 1 p.m. and were back up at 4:30. once i woke up i felt incredibly better. i still felt slightly nauscious but it was sooo much better and i knew i wasnt going to throw up anymore. all in all it was a great experience with the visuals and the feeling. but the horrible body sickness was just too much and i dont think i would ever do it again unless i took a much smaller dosage. the weirdest part about it was that all 3 of our reactions were different. our male friend did not get sick at all, neither did 3 other male friends of ours that took it at a different time then we did. but me and my girl friend got very sick. and the time difference was sooo different. her's hit her in 15 minutes and mine hit me 4 and half hours later after i had taken it. i would advise all people (girls ESPECIALLY) to be very careful when taking this and read about it before u do so u can take it right. and girls should take smaller dosage. thats what i feel with my experience. the best thing about the drug was that u didnt have that shitty insecure cracked out come down like u do with regular acid. but the body sickness definitely made up for it..."

      "I decided to try it for myself.  The reasoning was simple:  It might have fun properties, and it's one of the few research chemicals that can still be found online.",
      "Anyway, I bought 100mg from an internet source.  It arrived in 3 days, and I was ready to try it immediately.  The experience went as follows.",
      "20:30 - Two friends and I dosed, 25mg each, by 'parachuting' it in a piece of toilet paper.  We had eaten a few hours before, but nothing recently.",
      "21:00 - I stated to feel a come-on, my friends hadn't felt anything yet.  We weren't worried, since they say it takes a while to kick in.  We were sitting on the couch watching Simpsons, waiting, waiting.",
      "22:00 - By this point, I was definitely feeling something.  We had just gone shopping for dinner food , and the experience was definitely altered by the drug, albeit only slightly.  It was sort of like MDMA, or 2C-I, but with a slight headache.",
      "22:30 - After making food, I suggested that we split the other 25mgs between the 3 of us.  We divided it up into lines, and insufflated them.  (Approximately 8mgs was insufflated by each of us.)  It burned for a minute, but it was a very localized burn, and it wasn't uncomfortable at all.",
      "22:40 - The recent bump seems to have significantly amplified the effects.  I can feel a warm head rush, and the urge to smile.  My friends felt something, although they weren't very vocal about it, which leads me to believe it was relatively minor.",
      "23:30 - The effects had almost completely worn off by now, both from the original dose and the bump later on.  We had just eaten dinner, and were felling pretty normal.  We drank some Sparks energy drink, took .5mg xanax per person, smoked a hit or two of weed, and watched Pirates of the Carribean.",
      "The after effects were non-existent.  There was no hangover, no body ache, no headache, nothing.  This could be attributed to the short duration and mild effect of the drug.",
      "Overall it was a very mild experience.  None of us was terribly impressed.  However, none of us regretted trying it, either."

I didn't know until afterwards that he had taken four hits of the acid (which was very strong), and I had never seen cocaine before. We got it from some cokehead friends and followed their advice on how much to do, which in retrospect wasn't exactly a good idea.",
      "What I wrote the next morning (names have been changed to protect the guilty):",
      "Last night could very well have been the most terrifying experience in my life, and if not, it was definitely in the top five.",
      "Jay had a seizure and ended up in the hospital.",
      "I was right next to him when it happened. He suddenly looked blank and... weird. I asked him if he was okay, and he said no and started to shake. I didn't quite manage to catch him fast enough to stop him from falling, but I think I at least kept him from hitting his head as hard as he would have otherwise. Someone managed to call an ambulance quickly, and then I was trying to keep him on his side. Luckily, I had recently read some information on seizures. Crazy coincidence. I had wanted to know for a game we were playing in English, 'two lies and a truth.'",
      "Anyway, when he came to, he was totally disoriented. He didn't know what had happened, and he didn't even know his own name. For a while he couldn't even speak or respond to us, and when Forrest told him to blink once, it looked like he was trying to, but he couldn't.",
      "The paramedics brought him out to the ambulance on a stretcher with a collar to keep his neck from moving in case it was hurt (they had to cut off his sweatshirt to get it on).",
      "Police searched the house, but I didn't see it (it happened after we left), and I managed to dispose of the evidence so to speak. I ran into Kei's room and licked up the last line of cocaine.",
      "I didn't get to ride in the ambulance with him, but I rode with his parents to the hospital. (I was with Kei's mother at first, and she was not the least bit comforting. I was sobbing and she didn't say a word about. Nothing. She did tell me that Jay wouldn't be in trouble about the drugs, though, and they would be looking for the dealers instead.) When I finally got in to see him, he was still really disoriented. He later said he was having trouble seeing people's faces, so that would make sense why he mixed me up with his mother a few times, and even with his father and the nurse. He told them his name was Alice when they asked.",
      "I was standing next to him for hours, kissing his face and stroking his cheek, and he was much more relaxed and happy with me there. He kept smiling, which was crazy, but it definitely calmed my nerves and I managed to smile back and keep it positive.",
      "He got caught in a loop at one point. It reminded me of the way people's voices looped in one of my first bad trips, but much much more so, and in a different way. His memory was worse than mine was last time, not just churned but gone in a minute or less. He kept saying 'I love you,' and 'you're so beautiful.' At first just to me, but then to everyone, even the nurse (who was a man). Then he started startling and saying 'OW!', but saying nothing hurt when we asked him, and then sobbing loudly. It was really frightening. (He told me later that he felt pain shooting though his head, and thought or saw something about needles, and somehow that was related to the crying.) He was hitting his legs on the bars of the bed, and would sometimes jolt upright suddenly. We couldn't get him to relax, probably partly because he couldn't remember us telling him that he could come home with us if he relaxed and his blood pressure went down.",
      "The loop he was stuck in was in his head, not outside like it was for me. I heard and saw the same things over and over looping (which is why getting up and moving around helped). He thought and felt and said the same things over and over. After a while he did realize he was repeating himself, and he said 'I must sound like a broken record.'",
      "The loop: first he would say 'I love you,' and 'you're so beautiful,' and 'I love you, baby girl,' to just about anyone. Then he'd sit up and cry out, startled by something. Then he'd say he wasn't in pain, but he'd burst out crying. We'd calm him down, he'd relax, then he'd say 'I love you' and start the cycle over again. Anyway, he finally went to sleep when we left, and they at least let his father stay sitting just outside the curtain.",
      "I stayed home from work, partly because I was a zombie from staying up all night, partly because I was still nervous and scared, partly because I wanted to wait in his room for him to get home.",
      "We ended up sleeping all day. I don't remember much of my dreams, but I know in one I was trying to go around a narrow balcony to get somewhere. I was holding hands with a line of people, and when someone (him?) spun out of control and fell, we all did. Nobody could keep hold of the balcony. By some miracle, as we were hurtling towards the ground, we stopped and started floating gently. I was telling people that they could fly, and they should keep thinking that it was possible, and that would make it work. We touched ground gently. The only thing that had kept us from hitting the ground was our willpower, and my idea.",
      "I think later in the dream, someone was searching everyone for drugs. I was a ways away, checking my pockets to make sure I didn't have any. I just had the broken cap of a pen and some other junk, so I walked back to where everyone else was (in some big room or hallway). Someone made a comment about how it had been such a wonderful party, clearly sarcastic. Everyone was standing around a table with little squares of assorted cakes, and I was just finishing one and thinking of having another when I woke up.",
      "So Jay is grounded, in a lot of trouble, and his parents want him to never do drugs again. I can see where they're coming from, because he hasn't been very smart about it, but I think it's impossible to get him to do that. It would take a miracle. I'm sure I can get him to cut back and be more careful, and to take a break, but no amount of nagging from his parents or from me will get him to do a 180 degree turn. It's too much to ask for.",
      "I did some google research, and I found out that it was most likely caused by the combination of cocaine and acid and the high dosage. Cocaine-induced seizures can result from concurrent ingestion of other drugs, apparently, so it was probably the four hits of acid that caused it. An empty stomach and dehydration probably also contributed to it. He had only had one bowl of ramen that day.",
      "So that's about it for now. He seems to be doing better, but tired and drained. He's sane, his memory is back, and he of course is not seeing things any more. He's very quiet and didn't protest anything his parents said about having a serious talk about his lifestyle, or about being grounded, or about giving his credit card back to them.",
      "Uhm... Jay is asleep, and so deeply that he might not wake up when I go in and get into bed. I woke him up to tell him about what I had found out on google, and he was barely awake enough to understand that, and he fell back asleep pretty much the second I stopped talking to him.",
      "-------",
      "So, that happened about one year ago, and now I have decided to go straight. 100% straight as a razor. There were many other contributing factors, but this was one of the biggest ones. Jay kept getting himself hospitalized time and time again, each time for different reasons. Most recently, he took bad acid and it made him think he was having a heart attack. He called me at 3:00 am to say 'I think I'm having a heart attack, and I'm going to the hospital. I just wanted to call to say I love you.' I'm amazed at how long it took before I decided to stop doing acid."

      "First off, I must note that my tolerance to cannabis is very low; usually 4 or 5 hits will be enough to keep me in a state of bliss for 4 to 7 hours. I regard it as a very powerful and religious experience, and thus treat herb with respect.",
      "This happened when I lived in Arizona not too long ago. I was walking around the mesa behind my house at about an hour before sundown, enjoying the view of the Earth and open sky. Before I headed home, I decided to smoke a joint I had with me.",
      "Sitting cross-legged in a sandy wash, I smoked most of the joint before deciding to head home. After the intense sensory 'strobing' started, I noticed the small, fine details around me, all the tiny wonders that we usually overlook. The feel of the fine sand, the crisp purity of the desert air, the simple pleasure of watching a lizard dart among the rocks. I had just read the Tao Te Ch'ing, and reflected on the wisdom of the sages in urging us to be more appreciative of the little joys in life.",
      "As I walked back down the dirt road that went near my house, the sun setting behind the mesa created a gorgeous mix of red, purple and orange, whose richness I found to be very peaceful. I reflected on the myriad beauty of nature. The small desert plants all around seemed more alive than I had noticed before, and I could hear dogs barking in the distance. I stretched and moved my body in various directions, marveling at the complexity of the human body. To think that mere electrical impulses from the brain could dictate the actions of this vessel! I began to think of the soul, how we fit in with the 'cosmic scheme of things.' I contemplated God, who could surely not be a physical entity. If so, s/he/it would be bound by some laws and forces. I thought of what we know as God to be some universal concentration of incomprehensible energy, directing all things from the scurrying of an ant to the slow, majestic wheeling of galaxies. My body was crude and puny in comparison, relying on material sustenance and physical manifestation. The thought kept recurring through my head 'We Are Machines Compared To God,' as if our idea of 'Organic' pales in comparison to the raw life-essence that is God.",
      "The moon was already high and the vivid blue of a Northern Arizona sky framed it perfectly. I stopped and looked around, my eyes tracing the red soil out to the horizon. Standing there, the Earth seemed suddenly vast and wondrous. I could feel through my boots how solid and eternal was the skin of our Mother, how truly great She was. Far off, the Tsaile mountains loomed, the air was still and clear, the Moon was silver and awesome. I began to view the world as some hunter of the steppes must have viewed it in the Pleistocene, as it must have appeared to humans before electricity, before cars, guns, 'civilisation.' All the long centuries of Human existence are but a tiny blip in the life of the Earth and the Sky, which shelter us and whose songs we have forgotten in our modern dedication to money, convenience and noise.",
      "The old Australian legends of the Dreamtime gained a newfound sacredness; I could see reflected in the Moon how our ancestors danced beneath her bright face ten thousand years ago in the stillness of the wilderness. All the cycles of life on Earth were perfectly meshed, like threads in a tapestry: even our species' recent trend toward destruction and rape would soon come to an end and we would once more come to love God, the Earth and Each Other.",
      "I felt very peaceful, serene even; I suspect that if a pair of coyotes had come upon me and decided to rip me to shreds, I would have offered my nourishing body to them, for truly, what is death but a change in worlds, in planes of awareness? The Earth, Sky, Moon were immortal--and so was I. It was a simple, joyous, eternally patient feeling.",
      "This was one of my most enlightening voyages into the mind; the sense of Oneness with nature cannot be lost by Us but only forgotten. That day I found it again."

      "My first encounter with 2C-I was so disappointing that I didnt feel motivated to take it again until a few weeks ago (see my trip report in Erowids archives). For my first experience, a friend and I took approximately 17 mg. My friend took ~20mg on a later date and told me that this was a better experience. So, with this same fellow explorer, in the same setting as my first trip, I took the ~20 mg dose.",
      "I felt the first alerts in a half hour. I started to feel tense and my throat became coated with mucous. My stomach gradually started to bother me and I felt slightly sick for a couple hours. During this period, my mind was clear and I noticed little to no visuals. The stomach cramps and tenseness subsided when we smoked a bowl of weed. In fact, weed was the turning point of this trip. The two drugs seem to have the same kind of synergy as pot and foxy.",
      "After smoking. I laid back as mild patterns and colors started to manifest. I suddenly felt as though I melded with the couch and the rest of the room. My eyes were openings in the liquid-like substance I was a part of and I stared out of these openings at the rest of the room. I had been chewing gum to relieve jaw clenching due to the tenseness. My gum now felt like it was rolling or floating around in my mouth. I experienced a slight panic because this melding experience felt as though I was drowning. I was being swallowed up both physically and psychologically.",
      "This experience lasted only about 5 minutes and was broken by my friend starting a conversation with me. It was fairly easy to snap out of the feeling and talk with him but the impact of the experience stayed with me the rest of the night. I consider that immersing experience the psychedelic high point of the trip as the rest of the evening was visual but not thought provoking as those 5 minutes.",
      "I realized later that that feeling of drowning was very similar to my frightening salvia experiences. That losing my sense of self and melding with my surroundings is present in both instances. While the 2C-I didnt give me the feeling of being caught up in a disturbing system like with salvia, I did feel some of the same panic from loss of self and loss of control. I dont know if the loss of self implies the loss of control or vice versa as I experience them simultaneously. However, this gives me new angles on my salvia question: What do my unpleasant high dose salvia experiences mean?",
      "Maybe the fear of loss of self is a large part of the unpleasantness. Maybe I shouldnt resist and should just flow with the experience, embracing the loss of self.. Even so, I dont think its as simple as the old fear of self-loss cliche. I cant help but think that it would be easier to embrace the dissolution if it entailed melding with something with ultimate meaning. Salvia and research chemicals dont offer a mystical vibe. Thus, when I start to get swept away, I attempt to throw the brakes on, thinking maybe I dont want to become a part of this!! Further experimentation may be the key. I plan to experiment more with salvia working my way up dose-wise, with the specific intent to getting used to the dissolving process. I also want to try the 2C-I/weed combo again but alone because I think my experience couldve developed further if it wasnt stopped short by the conversation with my friend",
      "Now that Ive done 2C-I twice, I like it better but still dont share the same opinion as some of the glowing reports Ive read. In comparison to 2C-T-7 and 2C-T-2, this drug is the speediest of the lot, with T-2 being the least speedy. 2C-I is the least visual and T-2 is the most visual. T-2 and 2C-I consistently give me stomach cramps but T-2 feels more organic like shrooms while the cramps of 2C-I are accented with a speedy and metallic feeling. Ive only endured cramps once from T-7 taken orally and that was because I took a bumpy car ride during the onset. 2C-I is the only one of the three on which Ive had a classic psychedelic experience beyond mild visuals (when taken orally).  This classic experience makes me more curious and willing to explore this substance further."

      "So, I've been experimenting with different substances, namely psychedelics for about 9 months now. I only started after being convinced by my long hours of research on each substance I have decided to try. I had tried weed years ago but I never really liked it and I only use it to power up other substances. I've tried DXM, Ketamine, LSD, and others... But the one I've had the most experiences on is, by far, Ketamine.",
      "I've done Ketamine countless times now and I sometimes am aware of how habit forming it can be. This is being written with a strong decision on my mind to quit the substance very soon.* My purpose, however, is to tell about a very strong experience I had a couple days ago at a friends house.",
      "Setting: My friend's apartment. 21 stories up, with a fantastic view of our city. It's four of us, very close friends. We've tried everything together and it's always worked very well. Before doing our thing we all had some noodles. I thought it would be ok since I wasn't going to move while on K.",
      "Mindset: Joy... our favorite band was playing at our city the next day and we decided to give this a try the night before. We were waking up at 4 am to go and get a place in the line for the concert.",
      "We bought some very good quality weed and got to the bedroom where we would take off. I prepared 90mg shots for everybody and got one of the joints ready. We planned on injecting first, then smoking quickly before the K kicked in. I helped one of the guys with the injection while the others injected their own. The guys lit the joint up and started smoking while I shot my own dose. I saw two of them roll their eyes up while moaning a little. They just lay down staring into space. After injecting, I took about 7 long puffs of the weed... In two minutes, the K was rushing up and time was already fragmenting. I thought it was going to be a K trip with little weird visuals... I'm good with psychedelics. I control my mind fairly well. But this... I wasn't ready for what was to come.",
      "I lay down beside one of the guys while all of us blabbered about how strong this thing was. After what seemed like half an hour (and probably was only a couple minutes). I automatically stretched my hand and turned the lamp off. Only the light from the city 21 stories below came in. After travelling through dark spaces lit up with small distant lights, I came back to myself and realized I was on K. I couldn't believe this was the effect... I had been absolutely drawn out of my body and I realized the dark space I had been travelling through was the dark sky and small lights were the city lights. As fast as I swung close to consciousness, I swung back into the depths of a pot-filled k-hole.",
      "The experience lasted what I would call mental years. I had a life inside my mind. Somewhat like in a dream, but really thinking I was absolutely awake. I was having lunch with my mother (not my mother in real life) and suddenly a frame froze in front of my eyes. The frozen frame drew away from me and became a leaf on a plant full of possible lives. I remembered my state once again. I felt thrilled and scared at the same time about how strong this trip was being. Normally, the k-hole will take me far away... but this was a very psychedelic far away land. Once again I came back to myself (all these visions were had with open eyes) and I heard my three friends still blabbering about their own travels. Each of us was very gone from this place. However, this time I tried to move my arms...",
      "Now this was new. I felt I was two selves at the same time. I felt I was a puppet being controlled by a puppetmaster: myself. My bigger self was a very complex being, existing in more than our usual three dimensions. The MIND behind the mind. My smaller self is the person writing this report right now. The normal human being, merely aware of our three dimensional world. I found out afterwards I wasn't the only one who had that experience.",
      "After realizing this I swung back into the psycho-hole, full of patterns and kaleidoscopic visuals comparable to those of closed eye LSD visuals. This experience, however, has beat any LSD trip I've had.",
      "At a point, I thought every single poster hanging from the walls was a window. The next moment, though I didn't really know what the concept of window was. Ketaminous thinking.",
      "After what seemed like a good year, I realized only an hour had passed. I was feeling strong nausea and I also realized I had a very strong urge to throw up. I looked around and saw a big square of light which my mind recognized as the window. I got up suddenly and stumbled over to the window which looked more like an impressionist painting. I stuck my head out and into a world that felt more like clay. It felt like actually putting my head into a bowl of clay. I could hear every single noise in the city. I could hear people talking, cars, everything. However, it didn't feel like air. I started gagging and finally puked till there was nothing left. Instant relief struck me all over and I got back in. It's amazing how just a few inches make the difference between two different ways of feeling the existence. I let myself fall down onto a matress on the floor.",
      "To this point some of us were now coming back from the huge trip. The visuals were still nuts, though. I stared into space with disbelief as everything looked like I had a translucid film with a comic strip drawn on it. 'I'm seeing everything through a comic'. My friends didn't really pay attention to my comment. I looked at a Sex Pistols poster on the wall. Somehow I saw some creature's snout chomping on the Pistols' logo. It looked awesome... just like watching a cartoon.",
      "After a while I knew I had to give my mind some sleep and I just closed my eyes and relaxed. I fell asleep and woke up on time the next day, only with a mild dizziness left. I was still shocked, though, as I remembered the night I had before.",
      "All in all, it was an amazing experience that brought new thoughts into my mind. Yet it was too strong and I don't really feel like doing it again.",
      "*I've decided to quit using Ketamine as I find it has changed my way of seeing life in an uncomfortable way. LSD has given me some awesome new perspectives but K is way different. Ketamine has made me question every single feeling I have. 'Why do I like this girl? Why is this music good? Why? Why? What is this whole thing?' It's just a pain to be questioned like that..."

      "Preparation for prior ketamine use had previously been 'religiously strict'. No caffeine or cigarettes for several days before the trip itself and absolutely nothing that could mentally impact on the enjoyment...except, for the bad apple that I have to take daily - my epilepsy medication, which happens to be an enzyme inducer on all three of the P450 pathways through which ketamine is metabolized. This is what brings me to requiring 250mg+ doses to 'hole'.",
      "I'd love to stop with the intro there and actually get into the trip report but something very significant happened before I ever racked up the lines of K - I had a grand mal seizure. For obvious, neurochemical-based reasons, I may have chosen to call off the trip there and then but this is literally the last chance I have to take ketamine in a comfortable environment before moving to a noisier, less welcoming residence. I made my decision, somewhat hesitantly, and chose to continue.",

      "I find myself forced to manufacture something out of the k and mold whatever is going to happen into an enjoyable ride...",
      "With my persistence, I eventually manage to drive my consciousness deeper into the normally inaccessible areas of my brain - this is new territory and any visuals are nothing more than black-outlined shapes and what appear to be concepts and philosophies. As images and thoughts continue to intensify, I find myself drawing voices and faint images from todays events, most of which are from the characters within the film 'Human Traffic'.",
      "John Simm (Jip, in the movie) is talking in my mind. He's expressing my sentiments on life, society and analysing my approach to dealing with society. It's all very intense, the frequency of these continues to increase and all I can do is allow myself to watch and listen to his psychoanalysis of who I am and what my weaknesses, strengths and goals are. This continues for some time and is interleaved with imagery of nightclub backdrops. His tonal delivery style is often more akin to that seen on tv show 'Life on Mars'.",
      "As Simm fades out, the trip enters a new, deeper phase of self analysis. I feel myself tapping into the human body and its importance as a life support machine for the brain itself. I am deep, deep within the brain. I can almost feel the outline of the organ itself and how far I have penetrated psychologically. I attempt to communicate with individual areas responsible for anxiety, confidence, pleasure etc. It's hard to ask individual questions but the answers, philosophies and judgements on the state of my life flow freely. I am given advice on my current employment, social and anxiety-plagued issues. These all ring incredibly true as I am told that 'I can change how things are now. You have accessed something that is unavailable to anyone but you at this moment in time'. I try to instigate change but it's generally a one way process as I'm offered counselling and suggestions on where I am going wrong in relationships, my general outlook on the world and the possibilities that are open to me if I make a series of behavioral changes.",

      "I turn the tables on my advice-laden organ and attempt to ask the questions of my brain that I, no - everybody, wants an answer to.",
      "Why am I here? What is my purpose? What future awaits me?",
      "If only the answers were as simplified as the advice that was previously offered! Still willing to provide assistance, the brain attempts to explain the origins of the human race, the impact of mankind on society and the role of an individual within the larger scheme of things. This is where, sadly, it reverts to the complicated 'alien like' imagery so often presenting itself within a k-hole. I struggle to comprehend much of what is offered to me and sadly, much of what I understand is so intensely profound that it cannot cross the divide of a ketamine-intoxicated brain and manifest itself in either short or long-term memory.",
      "The end?",
      "Hell no! I'm not sure how common the 'God Phenomenon' is present in the k experiences of others but normally, for me, it either accompanies or follows ego loss. Generally, I will be at the height of ego loss and it suddenly hits me - 'Am I the central character in this world through which everything else is dependant'?",
      "On this occasion, it is the sheer access to my otherwise restricted brain activity that forces me to question my true importance. I am bombarding my brain with questions about who I really am. Am I a figure of great significance in this world? Is there a great importance in my future pathways that must ensure I reach my goal. This time, it's not quite as godly as normal. On a k-hole trip I have been confronted by electrostatic molecules floating in front of me. As I'd wave my hands, I felt every movement somehow impacting on something, somewhere in the world. This time is different. An image that appeared before me was a stadium. A stadium of gigantic proportions and surely one that is in excess (capacity wise) of anything present on earth. Hundreds of thousands of people, possibly millions of individuals, stand focussed on a stage and I am the 'act'. It only lasts for a matter of seconds but reinforces the idea of my importance and somewhat contributes to the god-like phenomenon.",
      "I wouldn't say things tapered off from there but recall past this point is extremely sketchy and I could feel the neurological impact of the ketamine on my thoughts fading, fading away.",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------",
      "23:33 - I opened my eyes to look at the projection clock on my wall and whilst the mental effects of the k had receded, the physical anaesthetic effect is still strongly active. It takes several attempts to read the blurred, echoed time on the wall. I lay in bed for some time, considering whether or not to go to sleep or wake up and debrief myself. I chose the latter. I didn't attempt to write down any record of this experience but am fortunate to maintain such a vivid recall some 12/13 hours later.",
      "In closing, I would not recommend that k-hole seekers give in to their desire to following such a dramatic event as a seizure or similarly neurological impact with ketamine. Not on the same day, not for a week and perhaps not for a period of several months. I have been in the same situation before and declined to follow through with other drug experiences but I want to stress that if I had not followed through with my plan at this time, it could be 6+ months before I found enough safety and sanctitude for 'holing.",
      "I don't regret it though. A non k-hole is normally the beginning of the end, based on prior experiences but it was the handful of failures following these events that led me to take a more active role in shaping and providing a worthwhile trip, yet still a fraction of true k-hole.",
      "Be safe. If you have options and something like this occurs prior to a drug experience then withdraw from it. I altered my dosage of epilepsy meds in the hope that I could increase the impact of the enzyme induction BUT I also skipped an evening meal and smoked heavily prior to the k dosing - both of which reduced the epilepsy medication in my bloodstream and left me open to a temporary withdrawal-based seizure (lack of food = faster medication metabolism and cigarettes are an inducer of my medication - the results spoke for themselves).",
      "Still, I found myself failing to 'hole, and took a different approach to the experience. Go down a different route and see what you can draw out of it."

      "Id like to briefly recount an experience I had with combining kava kava and alcohol one night last weekend, because I had an unusual and kind of frightening reaction. ",
      "I have used kava kava many times in the past, and had used it every evening for the past two weeks prior to this experience.  My normal dosage is between one and two compacted tablespoons of dry kava root powder that I buy at a local grocery store.  My preparation is very simple: I put the powder in about  of a bottle of regular tap water, shake vigorously for a few seconds, and chug it while the sediment has not yet settled.  This is very effective for me at inducing relaxation, anxiolysis, and sometimes a bit of euphoria. ",
      "On the night in question I used between 3 and 4 tablespoons because I was going to a party and wanted to be very loose.  About 90 minutes after ingestion of the kava, I started drinking beers.  I had 4 beers over about another 90 minutes, and was hanging out, talking with some friends, when G told me that my face was red.  I didnt really take notice, because that happens sometimes when I have alcohol by itself.  When I looked in the mirror, it was indeed VERY red, but in small patches.  The rash was not itchy or raised, but splotchy and pretty disgusting looking.  I asked the host of the party for some benadryl and I took them and got a ride home. ",
      "When I got home about 45 minutes later, I took off my shirt and the red, irregularly shaped splotches were on my face, neck, shoulders, chest, and upper back.  I felt fine (though quite sleepy from the benadryl and alcohol) and when I woke in the morning, the rash was gone.  I repeated this combination once (a week later) but with less alcohol and less kava.  When the rash reoccurred (though less severely) I felt confident in attributing it to the combination of the two."

    "report": [
      "I'll try to keep the club details to a minimum here because I tend to think it makes for a dull trip report, but it's relevant to the story so bare with me.",
      "Last night I went to a club in the UK. I had three MDA windmills and a capsule with 13mg of 2C-B. However I opted out of taking the 2C-B this time as the last few times it's been a bit underhwelming and I ended up being bored (think I left a couple of mg's of powder in the bag when I was trying to snort it). I dropped 1 pill at about 1 AM hoping to come up in time for one of my favourite DJ's, Dave Seaman. Wasn't really feeling it after about an hour (yet my mate was absolutely battered after about 20 minutes) so I took another putting it down to tollerance. Still nothing so I took a third, absolutely desperate to come up before the end of the night. It was about 3.00 and all of a sudden my jaw started rattling all over, shame I had half an hour left and I'd spent the majority of the club being turned upside down practically sober. Tough house and banging dark prog through and through, it was amazing.",
      "I got out the club and was pretty wrecked, still coming up. Tried to have a crack on with the taxi driver but he wasn't having any of it so I gave up on him. Got home and started peaking in my bedroom. Loads of utter nonsense flying through my head - MDA all over. The clocks had changed and for some reason I decided this to be a huge head fuck so spent about 10 minutes trying to change the time. Even bigger headfuck, I've got no idea why but I kept going back and trying to adjust the time, then realsing that I was pressing the wrong buttons and forgetting what I was doing all the time. Decided there was no way I was wasting this or going to bed so I got out my mp3 player and racked up 3 lines of ket that I had left (desperately scraped out my bullet). Put two up my nose and put on on a set on my mp3 player.",
      "Was feeling nothing after 10 minutes so got the other one up there and sat back. Was feeling pretty good and could see very slight psychedelic patterning at one point from the MDA. My vision also kept doing something that often happens to me on MDA whereby my visual perspective suddenly jumps about an inch in one direction. Sort of like everything in my perspective shifting inbetween frames and happens every time. I shut my eyes and was getting another typical CEV for me on both MDA and Cannabis whereby it seems like I'm travelling down a tunnel, with very slight and not too colourful visuals. The ketamine didn't do a lot for me, it never produced the racey experience that it usually does on MDxx, I didn't have enough left really. It did enhance the MDA and particularly the music however. It was going very nicely, I was very euphoric and loving the music. I remember looking at my ceiling and seeing a sort of moving arrow that looked like it was made of cloud. I also seen some floating orbs reminiscent of an MDA experience I had 3 or 4 years ago which made me very happy thinking about it as that was the night first realised just how much I love MDA. I remember holding my mp3 player with my hand curved over the top and suddenly seeing it as a monkey wearing a cap side ways. Was hallucinating quite a bit now and I noticed that the ket had put me into the very beginings of a mild k-hole, whereby I can sometimes make out dark silhouettes of people without being very far gone. I remember sitting there with eyes shut a couple of times and seeing people that I knews faces appear who would say something to me. I'd then sort of go to respond and realise that they weren't there. Was very fun/confusing, I love being in that state.",
      "Seeing as the ket hadn't done a lot I was pretty gutted that it would probably be over farely soon. Then I had an amazing idea, why not empty that gel cap with the 2C-B inside and put it up my nose aswell. So I did. 13 mg of 2C-B up my nose. One thing that I've noticed about snorting 2C-B is that it kicks in practically instantly. It is the second time that I have snorted it then looked down at the carpet a few seconds later and seen typical 2C-B visuals start forming on the carpet as the carpet melts and curls into itself. It's unbelievably fast acting. I lay down in bed again with my mp3 player on, I had my eyes shut and there I was flying down that tunnel once more .",
      "I was lying down flying down this tunnel when all over a sudden a colourful bright flow of green swept in at a medium pace from the side of my vision. Here comes the 2C-B I thought and sure enough when I opened my eyes the all too familiar characteristics of 2C-B were really starting to take effect. I shut my eyes and watched the amazing visuals unfold behind my eyelids. When I eventually opened them again a few minutes later it seemed that colourfull vines were weaving out from the side of my head and into my vision. Visuals were weaving themselves into everything in a way that I've never seen on 2C-B or MDA (I've had my vision engulfed with visuals on 2C-B but the MDA seemed to give them a completely different twist to anything I'd seen before). I was now in a very lucid, dreamy state. I remember thinking that it reminded me of how I expected MMDA to be to some extent from what I'd read about its own lucid dream like qualities. These intricit vines of colour were everywhere, I couldn't begin to describe them any better than that. My room was full of vibrant, bright colours moving in strange ways, along with the typical geometric patterns and melting. I kept thinking that people were standing next to me as not only did I keep hallucinating them via visuals but I kept hallucinating their prescence aswell. My mental perspective was so off the rails by now, I was in a different place altogether.",
      "It was such a perfect synergy, 2C-B is so lacking mentally there is little to no headfuck at all but the MDA filled the gap very well. Music sounded outstanding and I've already been going into detail about the intricit visuals. I kept shutting my eyes and seeing people, then I realised that they were dancing and in a club. It was dark but the detail was unbelievable and I could make them out very clearly. I seem to remember feeling like I was dancing in there amongst them, it felt amazing. Then people would start talking to me (like earlier on but even more clear) and I'd sort of be having conversations with them in my head, then realising I was just buckled on MDA and 2C-B and forgetting and talking to someone else. It was very confusing but in a fun, comfortable way. I actually thought that all my mates were in the room with me then I'd remember and forget again. I remember wondering where everyone had gone when I started coming round a bit later on.",
      "The next couple of hours were a blur, I think I was too far gone to really be concious in the normal sense of the word. I was awake but I didn't really have the capability to remember much of what was going on. I remember realising it was 7 o clock and everyone would be getting up soon, my jaw was rattling like it had a pair of electric prods at either side and I live at home. I took out my earphones and was still getting slight visuals but very much wrecked in side my head, I was in bits. I remember lying in my bed for hours and falling into the same state I always do after MDMA/MDA where I lie there pretty much awake but not with it at all. Then I eventually managed to drift off and woke up later feeling fine.",
      "I've heard that MDMA and 2C-B have quite a big cross tollerance and that it's pointless doing them together. I didn't get this with MDA at all, possibly because it involves mixing a more psychedelic substance into the equation. The synergy is a powerfull one, both filling in the gaps where the other ones can lack. The open eye visuals were so out of this world that I can't even begin to describe them, they were like nothing either 2C-B or MDA have ever gave me. The closed eye visuals were also detailed and intense, it wasn't just geometric patterns it was also seeing different places alltogether. The mental effects of both were intensified and the euphoria was amazing. Music sounded absolutely quality and I find it to be an incredible combination that I intend to try again."

      "The herb looked like little flakes of hay. I thought it tasted a lot like weed but the smoke was extremely harsh, probably because the plant is so dry. Another friend who is a regular pot smoker tried it and disagreed that it tasted like weed. I got some mild weed-like effects my first time but nothing to write home about.",
      "The experience that really floored me was when I smoked it out of a bong with weed. Several nights after my initial experience, I got the hankering to get stoned by myself (I only occasionally use this drug anymore). I didnt have much pot so I packed a medium size bowl with a 3rd weed and 2/3rds hops. The weed layer was on the bottom. I smoked most of the bowl in 3 big rips. I became extremely high but in a different way than with weed.",
      "The heavy stoney sedative effects of schwag were there but very little of the psychedelic effects. I also didnt see any mild patterns or other visual effects that usually manifest with pot. My imagination wasnt stimulated like with weed. It felt like a cross between being drunk and high but more like being drunk. My eyes felt like they were bugging out of my skull, which I have never experienced on just pot. I also had cotton mouth pretty bad. This high lasted for a good two and a half hours and then I went to bed as it tapered off. I had a sore throat the next morning from the harsh smoke.",
      "I smoked several bong loads of hops by itself last weekend and didnt experience the same intensity. I did feel some light effects like with my first experience but nowhere near the weed combo. It was on a small scale what that combo was. I am aware of the fact that weed makes active many substances generally deemed to be inactive. But the difference in highs makes me think that it wasnt just an enhanced placebo effect. My conclusion is that hops is a good filler material when I want to smoke weed for a purely intoxicating experience. This may not work for regular pot smokers though.",

      "First, let me say that this is not the way I usually take cocaine. Typically, I take it after getting very drunk (half a bottle whisky say, which though I am a large man, a seasoned boozer, and can hold my liquor, definitely gets me completely tanked), and in dosages ranging from a quarter gram to one gram. This combination results, of course, in a state of complete gonzoism bordering on derangement.",
      "Tonight though, I started off with about a quarter gram of coke followed by very moderate beer-drinking. I didn't really feel high. After maybe an hour I was wishing I had more cocaine, so I snorted some Dilaudid (10 mg, I'm pretty sure). This took the edge off my comedown all right, but without producing any feelings of opium-like euphoria, though with a nice but far from overwhelming body buzz. My activity throughout the evening, by the way, consisted of sitting around talking with a similarly stoned old and good friend in his apartment.",
      "After about another hour, still feeling fairly finejust slightly more interested in everything I thought about (from the cocaine) but duly mellow as well (from the Dilaudid)I did another quarter gram of coke. This did get me genuinely high, though with no racing heartbeat or uncontrollable volubility, again due to the Dilaudid, I assume. About half an hour later I snorted 10 mg of Oxycontin. I'd never done it before, and knew it could be dangerous, but what with my really moderate (by my standards) alcohol intake and pretty low dosages of everything else, I thought the risk was minimal.",
      "Well, the Oxycontin very quickly delivered the intense body buzz and euphoria you'd expect from powerful opoids. It was (and still is) extremely pleasurable, especially combined with the heightened awareness of it and absence of dopiness provided by the cocaine. I do not feel deranged at all, and absolutely in control and just generally wonderful. Added to this is the calm provided by my expectation of having a pretty mild comedown, though we'll have to see if it turns out that way. But not knowing for certain that a terrible comedown awaits me adds to my sensation of well-being.",
      "I have a lot of experience (10 years plus) with fairly regular episodes of intense impairment from the combination of large quantities of booze and fairly normal amounts of cocaine. This buzz I'm experiencing now is similar to one time when I took over a gram of coke as well as a dangerous and frankly stupid amount of Oxycodone which had me in a drooling, throbbing stupor well into the following day. The combination of smallish doses I took tonight has given me very intense pleasure, comparable to that time actually, with, as far as I know, much less risk of killing myself. Since taking the Oxycontin a couple of hours ago, I've had a bit more cocaine (which was great, despite being the last of it) and am very slowly drinking some wine. I feel content and softly, quietly exhilarated, and I must say, like I've really got my money's worth, something I rarely feel after cocaine alone."

      "Greetings, first let me start of with a little background. I am a 19 year old male, with moderate experience in opiates and all (most) drugs. Since my adolescence, I have suffered from terrible migraines, always leading to vomiting and subsequent relief.",
      "On the particular night in question, I was working cameras at a famous nightclub in Hollywood. It was the second day of me starting my (prescribed) medication Adderall. For those who don't know Adderall is a stimulant add medication consisting of amphetamine salts. Anyway, I took the Adderall in the morning, as prescribed. I believe it affected my blood pressure as later on while working late evening, I was struck with a horrible migraine. I immediately had someone fill for me, and my girlfriend walked me back to her car. I started dry heaving, the pain got much much worse, and I was  burning up and pouring sweat. It was the worst pain I had ever felt, yet I digress.",
      "Anyway, I had her drive me home. By this point I was in horrible pain, and I procured one 1600 mcg Actiq lollipop(Fentanyl). I had never tried this before, and was not yet aware that it was the strongest dose, for cancer patients only. I immediately ingested the pop, sucking on it for over 15 minutes. By the time it was gone, I was swimming in the ocean. After that, the pain relief came on swiftly and strongly. I wasn't aware that the liquid isn't meant to be swallowed, only dissolved in your mouth. I felt relief, and I was swimming in an ocean of loving opiates. I also had an increase in libido, almost immediately following ingestion of the Actiq. The Fentanyl also caused me to vomit several more times, although very mild and shortly. Since Fentanyl is short-acting, I shortly after took one 8mg Dilaudid (hydromorphone). I don't remember too much after that, just swimming in my bed for the rest of the night, vague memories of conversation and sex with my girlfriend.",
      "In retrospect, I realize I took a relatively high dose of opiates for a non-tolerant person. However I was suffering from high-level breakthrough pain, and this helped me immensely. It should also be noted that I was very nauseous the next day, and although I woke up around 9a.m., I lied in bed around 3 in the afternoon with almost no food or drink. I also suffered from a 40 minute period of bleak depression. In my case, I would have puked up anything I took so had no other option but for a lolli or injection."

      "I have a lot of experience with DXM and enjoy it a lot. This is my most profound experience to date.",
      "WARNING: While this trip was amazing and fun, it could easily have been disastrous. At a dose this high, it is probably not a good idea to go out in public. If you do, MAKE SURE you have someone who is at least semi-coherent with you, and watching you. There was a period of 2 - 3 hours during this trip that I had no conscious knowledge of my body or my surroundings in reality. If my friends had not been with me, who knows what might have happened. I hope this report shows the importance of calculating dosage (all of our doses had been calculated very systematically) and the EXTREME importance of having someone watch you while on very high doses of DXM (preferably a sober person, but a low 3rd Plateau 'sitter' should be ok, IF they are experienced), especially in public.",
      "The two friends that were with me I will refer to as M and N.",
      "M,N, and I had been doing DXM pretty frequently for a few months. On this particular Saturday N and I picked up the Robo enroute to M's apartment. Upon arriving there, we proceeded to chug the Robo. I think N had a little more than an 8 ounce and M had almost two. I was trying for a high fourth plateau trip. I got two 8 ounce bottles of Robo Max down, and started on a four ounce. I gave up on it after about half an hour and a little over half the bottle, as it was making me very nauseous. This had taken about an hour and 15 minutes.",
      "We all sat around M's living room, watching TV and trying not to vomit. About an hour after I finished drinking the Robo, it kicked in pretty nicely, and I no longer felt bad. We had wanted to go to the mall earlier, so we decided to head out. It was approximately 2 and 1/2 miles to the mall, on foot. At first it wasnt too bad, just a slight separation from reality and a little time lagging. But as we went, it got a lot worse (better?). I think the worst part of all was trying to cross streets. No matter how long we looked to make sure no traffic was coming, the second we stepped onto the road, we were overcome by fear of being hit, causing us to shuffle as fast as possible across the street. This seemed ridiculous, because on most occasions, I was even looking up and down the street while I hurried across, and I saw there was no traffic coming, yet still I was scared and hurrying.",
      "As we went of course, the DXM was kicking in harder and harder. After a while time and space were very distorted, and I was feeling as if the world was stretching out and slowing down. N must have been feeling the same thing, because both of us started yelling at M, who was leading the way to the mall. We kept yelling at him for talking us into going to the mall, and asking how much further it was. He didn't seem to notice us too much, and just kept walking. Then N and I ran into a small mound of dirt about 4 feet high. N and I climbed onto it and stood there, amazed. From the top it looked as if we were on top of a large mountain, and I wanted nothing so much as to sit there and just BE, forever. It was strange, but I felt very safe on that pile of dirt, right next to the road.",
      "Eventually M seemed to get impatient, I think, and told us to hurry up. I was wondering how to get down off of the 'mountain' when N just ran down the side. I couldn't really understand how he had done it, and was afraid to try it myself. I inched towards the edge of the pile, and eventually slipped and fell off it. I was happy to be alive, elated. We then continued on towards the mall, while I constantly asked M how far it was, and mumbled to myself about never getting there. After a while M said 'There, it's right there' and pointed to the mall. I looked at it and it looked like, I swear, a bunch of large tents shaped like the Sydney Opera house (or whatever it's called) in Australia. I mentioned this to N and he said he thought so too.",
      "After what seemed like another hour or two, we reached the mall parking lot. We lay back on a slanted stone wall and had a couple of cigarettes before going inside. This is where I lost track of reality completely. Lying there smoking, I was feeling very content and dissociated. I looked up at the sky and watched the clouds. They were very odd, stretched out and slow. Then I noticed I didn't feel my body anymore. I looked around, but nothing looked the same. I didn't see myself, or my friends, or traffic, or even the mall. I just saw the wall I was leaning back on and the parking lot, which seemed to extend itself to infinity. The sky had gone black at some point, but the clouds were still there. I was pretty confused, so I just stared at the clouds.",
      "Then another strange thing. The ground receded and the clouds got closer. It looked as though I was floating, but it didn't feel like it. It seemed like I was sitting still and everything was moving but me. Eventually the ground disappeared completely and I was in the sky alone. But it was dark and the stars were out, like I was in space, despite that the clouds were still there and plainly visible, and bright. A cloud floated around me and I kind of became the cloud. I had no sense of actual feeling, I didn't feel like I had a body, even in the cloud. I could see in every direction at once and saw nothing but clouds and stars. For a while I just stayed there, and I wondered where the world had gone. Then all the clouds started moving again, and I just went with them. At the same time as I watched all this, I felt almost an empathy from these clouds and space. Fragments of my life flashed before me, but without visuals or words, just feelings. And somehow I could see how they fit, how they seemed to make sense. All the questions I had every asked and those I hadn't just answered themselves, and I absorbed these answers from the clouds without understanding how, why, or even really knowing what they were answering. I just felt that everything made perfect sense and was content.",
      "This continued for a very long time. Then suddenly lightning started shooting from the clouds, to where I don't know. The bolts seemed to just go nowhere and to go on forever, at the same time. Then one shot from my cloud, and it was as if I slid down this bolt, but without moving.",
      "The next thing I knew I was staring at a repeating lightning bolt. Slowly everything around me dawned on my senses. M was standing to my right, looking at the bolts, and saying something. I tried to say something, but I couldn't really remember how to talk. I just looked at him, and then looked around. There were people everywhere and all kinds of strange things moving around. I had no idea where I was (I found out later we were in Spencers) and wanted desperately to leave this chaos and return to my clouds. I tried to look for the clouds in the store, but I couldn't find them, and everything was very distorted. The place seemed like a random hell of noises, colors, and distorted people. I eventually ended up back at the lightning bolt making machine, and just stared at it, wishing I was back in my cloud. I slowly lost track of everything again, and just kept seeing flashes of lightning. I don't know how long this went on but again, the next thing I knew, I was back in the clouds.",
      "At first I was disoriented and scared, then I remembered the earlier foray in the clouds and was filled with an elation I had never felt before and have yet to feel again. I told myself that this was my place. This was where I belonged. And forgoing all care for the former reality I had known, I just relaxed and let myself drift with the clouds. I reflected on everything I had ever known and experienced, and was glad for it all. I felt as if this was a reward, my reward for everything I had ever done or suffered, and it was beautiful.",
      "I stayed in that state for what felt like an eternity, almost. Then suddenly, yet again, I found myself back in my body. I was sitting in the food court across from N, holding a cup of Coke. At the moment I had no memory of where I had just been (in the clouds) or of anything except where I was right then. I tried to talk to N, and M when he came and sat down, but I couldn't really remember how again. So I sat there drinking my Coke (with difficulty) and watching people walk by in freeze frame manner (like a strobe light, but a lot slower).",
      "M and N wanted to go see A Perfect Storm, so we headed towards the theater. I had a lot of difficulty walking, and everything was looking very strange. All the people seemed to pop in and out of reality, and everything else was shifting and moving. The ATM was tilting back and forth and sliding across the floor, almost like it was on wheels. As we got closer to the theater, this got worse. I could barely even see, just flashes of images. N told me to go up and buy my ticket and I remember telling him 'I can't take this, get it for me'. He went up towards the booth and I just stood there, trying to see, to think, wondering what was wrong.",
      "Again, I was suddenly in the clouds. Peace overcame me again, and all my previous confusion was lost. It seemed as if 'reality' was the dream, and this was the real world, just me and the clouds. Again I settled down in the cloud and just drifted away in happiness. After a while, I noticed I could see the ground again. I couldn't recognize where I was, and the sky was still dark. This made me wonder, and I stared at the ground for a while. Then the clouds started raining. It looked beautiful, these slow graceful clouds slowly pouring tiny drops out onto this dark world. Then, somehow, I knew I myself was forming just such a drop. I had no sensation of touch or gravity or wetness, I just knew I was sliding toward the bottom of the cloud and becoming a raindrop. For a few seconds I dangled from the bottom of the cloud, swaying in a breeze that I didn't feel or hear. Then I fell. This descent wasn't scary (I skydive anyway, so Im used to it), nor was there any sound or wind. But I did feel gravity again as I fell. I looked down and saw the mall, and I was falling towards it. As I got closer I saw a bunch of people outside milling around. Then I saw three people sitting against a concrete wall outside. Somehow my drop was steered towards one of them and fell onto his head. Instantly I was conscious in my body again. Everything was still very distorted, but I had no more confusion. M and N were sitting next to me smoking, so I lit a cigarette and just relaxed.",
      "We then went in watch A Perfect Storm, where I had a few cool sensations. The best one was during the big wave scenes. When a wave would hit, I would lose track of the movie, and feel lost, as if I was in a big dark wave, not being able to see anything but darkness and a strange sense of motion. Then as it crested, I would pop back out of it and watch the movie again until the next wave hit. It also took me half of the movie to realize I wasn't in my room watching it. I thought just M and I were sitting on my futon watching the movie (apparently when N had tried to sit down, I wouldn't move for him, and he had to go down a few rows, though I don't remember it). Slowly the realization dawned on me there seemed to be an awful lot of people in my room, and my room seemed very big. I asked M 'Where did all these people come from', but I don't remember him answering. I also remember there was what looked like a puffball blocking my view for a while, and I would push on it and try to pat it down. It would then move and make strange noises I couldn't understand, and M would tell me to stop in a hushed voice. (turns out the 'puffball' was someones hair).",
      "The most profound thing in the movie was at the end, when some bad things happen and the characters accept it (I didn't want to spoil the movie for anyone). I felt an amazing sense of empathy with them. It was a contentment that just made me very happy and, well, content.",
      "After that we headed back to M's and just compared notes on what happened to us and relaxed for the rest of the trip.",
      "M and N told me that almost the whole time we were in the mall (while I was in the clouds) that I wouldn't talk or really do anything. I just followed them around and really didn't respond to spoken words, just followed.",
      "I hope this was a good example of why a 'sitter' is needed at high doses of DXM."

      "This is actually three different jimson weed experiences spread over several months.",
      "I aquired some jimson seeds and was egger to try it out.  Some how I decided on 154 seeds, how I decided on that number I don't remember.  I used a coffee grinder to grind the seeds up, then swallowed the grounds washing them down with water.  The seeds are small so this was just a small amount of grounds, not hard to swallow.  About 20 minutes later I started feeling weird and got really tired.  I mean really tired!  So I laid down and took a short nap.",
      "When I got up I had more energy and I was really starting to feel stoned, also I was staggering a little bit like I was drunk.  Another notable thing was that my vision was messed up.  I was now farsighted, which is a common side effect.  I tried to chat with my lady friend on the internet but I could not see well enough to read what she was saying.  The next day she told me that I typed a few lines that didn't make much then the rest of what I typed was non-sense, she couldn't even make out words any more.  So I gave up on the computer and wandered off.",
      "I don't remember much more about the night, I remember a couple of hallucinations.  The main thing I remember about that experience is that the distinction between dreaming and being awake was completely erased.  Also its seems it was impossible to hold a coherent line of thought.  I might have had some insane conversation with my dad that night if he got up for a drink of water, I wouldn't remember if I did.  He never mentioned anything odd though.  At sunrise I thought I had pretty much sobered up, but I had another minor hallucination.  The experience carried with it an uncomfortable feeling, a bodily feeling like being poisoned.  The farsightedness was gone in less than 24 hours.  Since I remember nearly nothing of the hours I was tripping I took too much.",
      "I am a person interested in consciousness and its workings, so the complete blurring a the awake state and the dream state interested me.  I wanted to try jimson again with a smaller dosage.  Weeks later I did the same thing again except this time with much fewer seeds.  Perhaps about 50.  This was a big disappointment.  It wasn't large enough dose for me to trip but it was enough for me to feel very bad for awhile.  The feeling of anxiety in the body was not just because of a large dose, it was there with a smaller dose as well.  This second time I noticed no hallucinations or altered consciousness.",
      "I thought I was probably done with jimson after the second experiment, but I still had a lot of seeds and was still curious about its dream quality.  So I decided to try it again.  This time with jimson tea and cigarette.  I ground 100 seeds and boiled the grounds for 30 minutes in the microwave.  I added water along to keep the amount of water roughly one cup.  Then I strained the seeds out.  If you boil in a jar with a neck like a preserves or jam jar you won't even need a screen to separate the liquid from the grounds.  I ground up an additional 35 seeds for the cigarette.  Also I dried out a banana peel in the oven and crushed a little of it up for the cigarette.  The banana peel was just for filler, I didn't think seed grounds would burn well by themselves.  Banana peel makes mild smoke with a flavor that is not unpleasant.  Some people say you can get high off of banana but in my experience they are extremely mild, sort of relaxing effect.  I consider the effects of banana peeling to be negligible compared to jimson.",
      "I let the tea cool a little then drank it.  It had nearly no flavor, just a slightly nutty taste.  Then I loaded my backpack with water, fruit juice, bread, and the joint.  Within about 10 minutes I started feeling odd, doped.  Within about 30 minutes I was 'datura stoned.'  I went walking in the woods near my house, (woods I know very, very well).  The intoxication gradually increased.  At some point I took two puffs off the cigarette.  I had intended to smoke the entire cigarette but once in the woods I had that same bad jimson feeling I had the two previous times, so I decided I didn't want any more.  In hindsight I think it is a good idea I didn't smoke any more of the joint because it just would have been too much.  As it is I think I hit upon a good dosage for myself.",
      "Unlike the first time I remember what happened and I was halfway able to hold a sensible chain of thought, and unlike the second time I tripped.  I fading back and forth between dreaming with my eyes open and being awake.  There were both auditory and visual hallucinations.  I turned around and saw this gigantic woman standing a few yards away, then she resolved into a dead tree.  One minute I was watching and listening to two creature talking one another, completely unaware of myself, then the voices were gone but I could still see the faces with their mouths moving, then the faces resolved into leaves.  That sort of thing was typical of the trip.  Jimson hallucinations are built out of what I am looking at with my eyes.  This might sound fun but remember that all the time there is an uncomfortable physical feeling, and thoughts tend to be disconnected.  I was relieved when I started sobering up.  The clumsiness and farsightedness were there like the first time but less so.",
      "It is important to realize that jimson weed is not classified as a psychedelic, its classified as a deliriant, it causes delirium.  I didn't have any epiphanies or insights to take away from my jimson experiments (maybe Don Juan knew something about its use that I do not).  It seems the more I take the more chaotic my thoughts will be.  Another important thing to remember is that in some cases the farsightedness lasts a couple of days.  I noticed that when I wore my dad's reading glasses I could read fine.  I must have been a funny sight sitting here with those old man frames on.  Jimson weed is the craziest and most dangerous drug I've ever taken, and I've taken LSD, mushrooms, and DOI.  Like I said before, I didn't find the jimson experience enjoyable."

      "I'm getting on these days, really I am.",
      "The whirl of everyday life stops me from recognising it but when I do occasionally emerge from the fug of work/study/relationships I find that it's true: I just don't enjoy chemicals in the way I used to.",
      "Partly this is because of lifestyle and the fact that my peer group no longer spends every weekend clubbing or out in the countryside communing with nature. There are fewer opportunities to indulge. But I think that I have also grown away from the need for these experiences, maybe they have taken me as far along the road as possible.",
      "So, when I do find time to dabble in something new I get quite excited at the prospect of an interesting evening experiencing different sensations.",
      "Opening the newspaper last week I came across an article on party pills and how they are about to be banned in the UK. So, quick as a fox I jumped on to the internet and found a local supplier who happily got a box of BZP/TFMPP pills over to me in just over 24 hours. Excellent, I thought. In retrospect, perhaps, there was a reason for the quick delivery.",
      "When I was younger I often made the mistake of taking various substances in entirely inappropriate circumstances such as LSD when hanging out in a rough part of town, ecstasy at a works function etc. So, I prepared a relaxed environment in which to settle down and enjoy the ride. A glass of wine, a small dinner and then half an hour later 150mg of BZP with 75mg of TFMPP at home with my wife.",
      "Surprisingly, within 30 minutes I could feel a fuzzy, incoherent but quite definite feeling similar to the come up on magic mushrooms. The feeling got stronger and stronger until after around 2 hours I felt really quite unstable. Strangely, the feeling was much more akin to psychedelics than any stimulant Ive had before and had the unfortunate side affect of making me feel really antisocial.",
      "I used to be partial to a trip every now and then but I used to enjoy the visuals more than the physical or psychical dimensions. I was really quite disappointed that the only feelings I got was one of queasy feverishness. Not an especially pleasant feeling when expecting a MDMA/amphetamine type buzz.",
      "Of course, much of this can be put down to the hype created by salespeople to market the product as a legal alternative to Class A drugs. And maybe I expected too much. But I was left with the feeling that perhaps this is only an option for those whose access to the real stuff is limited by supply or cost, such as people in New Zealand, or as a one off experiment.",
      "So, on to the next day. Well, if the hangover could match the ride it would be all fine and dandy. However, the insomnia that it caused and the poisoned feeling that remained for the next 24 hours really wasnt worth it.",
      "Alternatively, perhaps my time has passed and its slippers and pipe only from here on in. Maybe I am too old after all"

      "Weeks before actually trying Belladonna, I researched about it. It was exciting to hear about the realistic visuals that some people received. I was looking forward to being transported to another place upon drinking the dose.",
      "I ordered the plant from a website and received a discreet package containing 4 ounces of the foliage.  I prepared a liter of tea by boiling about a gram of it within. I strained the plant material and drank one cup, with plenty of liquid left, so approximately 300 mL. After waiting for nearly an hour for effects (having heard that it will take a long time and the effects can sometimes jump at you) I decided that my dose was relatively low and I needed to take some more. I dumped out the rest of the tea and put another pot on with 5 grams of foliage in it. Strained the plant out and drank one more cup.",
      "I was slightly anxious, hoping for the best, but relatively in a good state of mind. I was just sitting in my friend's dorm (which is probably not the best setting for such a drug, very uncommon ground) watching tv. My stomach became unsettled. After nearly two more hourse after the second cup, so about three and a half hours altogether, feeling nothing, but slight physical discomfort I went  to my dorm room and tried to go to sleep.",
      "Sleep wasn't easily found, though, as I scrambled from my top bunk down to the trashcan on the first floor. I vomited slightly, but knew it wasn't over yet. I went quickly to the bathrooms at the very end of the hall, furthest away from my dorm room, and vomited into the toilet, second from the left. As I walked back, I was incredibly fatigued and my sense of balance completely shot. I stumbled into the halls and had to walk with my hands holding the wall. I got back to my room, but my night wasn't over yet.",
      "I couldn't fall easily to sleep, my mind was drifting off. I cannot say that belladonna contributed entirely to my wandering mind, I am usually like that anyway, but I won't say it didn't. Nor can I say that the violent upheavels in my stomach were solely accounted to belladonna, (I had a large chinese buffet only three hours prior to consumption) but my stomach is not easily turned, so I would say belladonna was a large factor.",
      "I fell asleep, finally, but didn't stay that way. I woke up three times in the night to vomit or because of cold sweats. I couldn't make it to the bathroom once, a stain marks the hall's carpet to this day.",
      "The next day I was exhausted, perhaps just because of my poor night's sleep, maybe partly because of the belladonna. I found that my reading vision deterioated severely, returning the next day. I received no visions nor any of the 'pluses' pertaining to taking belladonna. I think it could be contributed to the way I took it, the source of the foliage, and the amount I drank.",
      "I may take it again, but hopefully, by that time, there will be more reports on how to take it by other people who were successful. I don't mean to dissuade anyone, just to report. Good luck!"

      "This is a retrospective of my use of GHB. I started using GHB 2 years ago because I was fed up with having alcohol hangovers, bored with pot, and thought other drugs too risky to do on a regular basis. I had read about and researched GHB for a couple of years so I knew what I was getting into before I even tried it. On paper it seemed like the perfect drug. It was reported to be a nice mellow high similar to alcohol that left no hangover and had no toxic effect on the body.",
      "When I first obtained GHB I bought a liters worth. I did not know the concentration so I took 1 ml of GHB and weighted it compared to 1 ml of water. I found that the GHB weighed 1 and 1/2 the weight of the water. From this I determined the dose to be 500mg in 1 ml of water. In case your wondering not all GHB is made to this concentration. I started off by taking 1 ml to see if I would have a atypical reaction. No effects were noticed so I took 3ml 2 hours later. 3ml produced a slight dizziness and buzzing feeling very similar to alcohol, but with less of the mind dulling effect. The next day I tried 6ml (3 grams). This produced a pleasant feeling similar to alcohol but clearer. There was a body buzz especially in my head. Music sounds the same, although it was easier to appreciate it if I concentrated.",
      "The next day I took 9ml. This produced a drowsiness, a feeling of electricity throughout my body, a feeling of falling if I closed my eyes, like that feeling I get right before I fall asleep, and a heighten sense of touch. This was unique from alcohol in 2 ways. The feeling of falling when I closed my eyes was similar to that really drunk feeling I get after drinking a lot except it only came on when I closed my eyes. If I had some kind of stimuli then I would not feel it. The sense of touch was also different from the alcohol high. The best description of it is just like my sensitivity has increased. It is not a mind blowing feeling. If I didnt concentrate on this aspect of the high I might not notice it.  At doses greater then 9ml electric shocks were felt through my body and it was almost impossible to stay awake.",
      "After using this compound on a regular basis (everyday) for 2 years I have learnt a good deal about it. 1 found it is most effective to take my whole dose at once. For me this means taking 3 grams at one time. If I want to increase the feeling I will take 500mg every half hour. If I close my eyes and feel the falling sensation or I feel electric shocks (most common in my hands and arms) I do not take anymore GHB. The high will not get better I will just fall asleep.",
      "GHB mixes well with MDMA (at least in my body). My protocol for this is to take 3 grams of ghb then drop e. I then wait until the mdma hits me then I maintain my state by taking 1.5 grams every 1-2 hours. The feeling is similar to MDMA by itself and GHB by itself. I have not felt any synergy from mixing the two. However since they are both very pleasurable drugs mixing the two is very nice. Also the MDMA will prevent much of the drowsiness that GHB produces. The GHB will counteract the over stimulation that MDMA sometimes produces. I have never taken GHB and ketamine but I have seen others mix these two. Usually it makes the person pass out or delirious. GHB and alcohol is a bad idea. I have never done these two drugs together and I never will.",
      "My withdrawal from ghb is limited to muscle pain. It feels like every old injury I have ever had suddenly comes back. It is not a nice feeling but it is not terrible either.",
      "I hope this helps people who are interested in GHB. I have found it to be the greatest/safest drug I have ever tried. However, I have also seen many people mess themselves up from ghb."

Anyway I had read accounts of people smoking coffee and it's stimulating effects. I figured it wouldn't really work, or if it did it would be so weak I didn't notice. I was wrong.",
      "Anyway I went into my kitchen one afternoon while my parents were away, and took some coffee out. I got some standard computer paper and rolled it into a joint, putting in maybe 2-3 grams. I continued out into my backyard and lit it up. I smoked the whole thing in a bout ten mintues (it was very harsh smoke, lots of coughing) and went back inside. Even as I was walking inside I could feel some effects. It started very light with my vision becoming sharper and brighter. I went inside and started watching tv, and when I stood up about 5 minutes later I could really feel it. I would say closest to a small dose of opiates, with the same euphoric feeling, except the drowsyness was replaced with energy.",
      "It's been about an hour since I smoked the joint, and I can still feel the effects somewhat, though the major effects wore off about 30 minutes after I smoked. Didn't cause any problems, no hangover or headache, just happyness and energy."

More specifically, I had no clue this drug was as psychedelic as I now know it is. My friend did not know how to describe it to me, but explained to me  that it was something beyond mushrooms and lsd. Curiosity thoroughly stimulated, I agreed to try it, having my friend as a sober-sitter. He had one and a half cc's ready to go in a needle and injected it into my thigh.",
      "I waited about one solid minute in anticipation until I finally felt my first symptoms of the drug. My fingers went numb slightly and tingled a bit. A mere 30 seconds later my heart began to race, as my body felt a series of rushes. I decided to get up and move around in attempt to stimulate a trip, not knowing that was not necessary. I started on one end of my friend's front porch and made it barely to the other end, where I sat on a bench.",
      "All conception of reality left me then and very, very quickly. Suddenly I was in a sort of jungle-like world, with many animals roaming about. My life up until then was almost completely forgotten, and all I could think about was how and why I got to this world. The trees and grass constantly swayed in fractal-like patterns. I remember asking many questions, but not verbally, only mentally. My thoughts seemed to be heard by all the animals around me, mostly dogs and panther-like cats. They were all to happy to answer me back as well, in an ESP-like narrative heard only in my mind. Somehow, though, I knew the animals were the ones responsible.",
      "Their voices assured me everything was ok, but they never explained why I was there. They also followed me into newer levels of reality. It seemed I was experiencing most of these 'worlds' through the perspective of the animals themselves. In the jungle-like reality I fluttered through thick, tall grass completely content. Then my environment changed suddenly into a very red, thick liquid world. I felt as if I was swimming through thick paint. My surroundings changed colors, shapes, patterns, viscosity, and textures quite often. Needless to say, I was more than confused.",
      "I eventually ended up back on the porch I began my trip on - only it was miles in length, and impossible to move on. I asked one of the dogs mentally where I was at. She sort of laughed at me, and told me to play. At that point I realized I wanted to discover reality, having completely forgotten what it was like. That's when I finally understood who I was (not an animal moving through the environment) and I realized I had been sitting on this bench, for an undetermined length of time. It could've been weeks in my mind.",
      "I tried to get up and that's when I realized my friend was near me, as he was concerned of me moving around. I remember telling him I was good to go. That was definitely not the case, It seems in my little journey I completely forgot how to communicate to my muscles. I moved in a very robotic fashion to the door, two steps slowly towards, then one away, slowly reprogramming my muscles to listen to me. It took about 40 minutes to fully regain use of my motor skills.",
      "My friend then filled in all the blanks of my intense, little trip. Apparently, I had been sitting on the bench for the entire duration, being roughly an hour. On very few occasions, I spoke aloud. He told me I once said, 'I'm never coming back.' and 'So many realities.' Most of the time, I stared off into space, and breathed really heavy. As for all the animals who escorted me around the many different worlds, my friend owns a bunch of dogs and cats. Yet for some reason, even though my friend was sitting right next to me he was never there in any of my worlds.",
      "Mentally, I don't feel like I'll ever be the same after trying this drug."

I  don't remember putting the pipe down, but I was outside in my backyard with friends nearby, so I felt safe.",
      "I thought to myself, 'I will wait for it to kick in.  It shouldn't take long, I just need to wait.  Waiting...'  Then the voice of Salvia (coming through my own psyche) spoke, mocking me.  She said 'What are you waiting for? A bus?'",
      "'A bus?!'  What is she talking about?  Then I saw something: a colorful pattern of colors, culring like a fractal pattern, and I instantly knew what I was seeing:  my own thoughts.  I was looking at the thought, 'A bus?!' (which of course I was still baffled about.)",
      "As I pondered the notion of the bus-stop further, my changing thoughts changed the pattern that I was seeing, although on more minute levels than at first. ",
      "I felt a deep sense of revelation:  I can't explain it now, but it had something to do with the nature of thoughts, salvia, the colors I was seeing, and this bus-stop at which we all wait.  This struck me as being very odd, especially the part about the bus-stop.  Then, like a ton of bricks, I realized the utter insanity of it all.  I was totally insane!  I suddenly remembered where I was, in my backyard, and felt good that I had friends nearby.",
      "There is a story of a zen monk who aspires unity with the Godhead by clearing his mind through meditation at the time of his death.  Then along came tiniest fleeting memory of a beautiful deer he admired as a child.  He was reborn a deer.",
      "I think that salvia is like this.  A tiny disjoint thought can spawn the basis of an entire trip, and whether it makes any 'sense' or not is irrelevant.  Therefore, choose your set and setting with great care, and always a friend at hand."

      "It was a typical tuesday night:  I had just finished all of my work for the next day and decided that wednesdays are always the slowest, most boring days in the week...so i decided to make my next one a bit more interesting.  Wednesday, i got myself out of bed at my typical 6:30 am, to get ready for work.  My psychologist perscribed me 100mg tablets of the SSRI Setraline (more commonly known as Zoloft).  I popped in 5 tablets (500 mg), and went on my way.  About an hour later, i noticed that i was feeling severe nausea, and massive stomach pains.  I went home from work and lied down all day, being unable to sleep because of the severity of the pain. ",
      "Then around 10 pm, i pulled myself out of bed for some dinner (which i decided later not to have).  I felt like i should have thrown up alrdady, and was hesitant about eating anything.. so i put on my favorite beatles music, some Hendrix and then some doors to try and get me to sleep.  The lights were pitch black, and i had come to the conclusion that Zoloft was a weak drug...  Boy, was i wrong.  About five minutes later, while i was staring at my celing and listening to the Greatful Dead, i noticed that my wall was flowing (literally like an ocean) to the music.  It was rotating, shifting, flowing, in every possible direction, across the celing of my room.  I then saw these bright orangeish-red plasma-like objects dance across the ceiling and clash together, creating an even bigger object.  This lasted for about an hour or so, until everything went quiet.",
      "'well, that's it... looks like i'll be going to bed now,' i said to myself.  All of a sudden, my jaws started spasming, and my teeth started chattering.  Complex retnal visions filled my ceiling for hours upon hours.  The next days were normal ones... nothing else happened like what happened the first night.. But my eyes stayed massively dilated for over three days.",
      "PS-- i do not recommend taking more than 400 mg.  The Deaths from Zoloft occurred on 500mg and more.",
      "Happy trails, and take it easy."

Elated, we got out our freebase pipe and began vaporizing the sucker. I chose to enter the experience sober, while my friend had smoked some marijuana. He let me try a small chunk first, and about five seconds after exhaling, I felt a very strong, light orgasmic sensation throng in my shins and lower leg, pulsing and emanating goodness. My first real rush. I had experience with oxycontin and morphine, but smoking opium certainly took the waves of opiate pleasure to another level. Strangely enough, as the rush escalated, it felt familiar. This was an odd feeling of familiarity, familiarity of some sort of childhood experience. Dj vu of sorts, though I was quite certain I had never smoked opium before. After finishing the chunk, both of us were not very talkative.",
      "I was driven home about an hour later, and proceeded to take three 5mg percocets to boost my state. I settled into my bed, turned out the lights, and closed my eyes. I had a pleasant nod where I went in and out of sleep dreaming happy dreams without any care for reality. I was mentally cohesive, drifting through a fun process without any thought for the external reality. I felt empathetic and good, eventually trailing off to sleep about an hour and a half after entering my bed, maybe 3 hours total into the experience. I enjoyed every second, and wanted only good things."

      "I was in Chelsea with my friends, and I had 200 mg 4-AcO-DMT with me.  My friend, Harry, and I weighed out 22 mg doses and placed them in gel capsules.  There were a few people at the apartment, although I only knew two of them.  I sold two capsules and took one myself, orally, as did Harry.",
      "Harry, Alice (who did not take any), Vince, and I decided to take a walk to Times Square, with a skateboard.",
      "Harry noticed the effects come on very quickly, as is usually the case for him with drugs in general.  I, however, felt virtually no effects except marked drowsiness, which seems to be present at the beginning of every 4-AcO-DMT trip.  I had done the chemical before at ~10 mg, which produced intense physical and intellectual euphoria, and based on all the reports out there, I was excited for what is commonly described a shroom-like trip, minus the nausea of shrooms.",
      "We entered a pizzeria that was adorned with orange and green neon lights, with mirrors everywhere.  Harry described it as 'heaven,' and decided to just sit down and feel the beauty of this particular aesthetic.  It was awkward for the rest of us, however, as everyone was looking at us, as we did not even order anything.",
      "I left the pizzeria and everyone followed.  We were near Times Square and found a sculpture, which we skateboarded around for a little while.  Harry was starting to feel the profound euphoria of the chemical, while I was still pretty much at baseline.  Vince was feeling the effects also, as he had put the powder in water, allowing for quicker absorption.  He became very introverted, and it was uncomfortable to be around him.  Once we reached Times Square proper, Harry was disappointed with its chaotic modernity, describing it as a 'Ninja Turtle city' wherein he felt he would be 'stabbed' at every corner, although he also found it very goofy.  I was still not tripping.  I decided that, due to the social dynamic of the crazy situation, I would need to depart with Harry and leave Vince and Alice behind, who went back to the apartment.",
      "Thinking I had a tryptamine tolerance from a few days prior, when I took 10 mg 4-AcO-DMT, I decided, with the persuasion of Harry, to snort some more.  Accidentally, I snorted the entire 22 mg pill.  I was in for a surprise.",
      "I immediately felt a strange tingling in the right part of my brain (the same side I snorted it).  I kept this to myself, as I did not want to alarm Harry.  We entered a touristy pizzeria, whereupon everyone stared at us.  We went to the basement level, found a table, and started talking (it was rather cold outside).",
      "At first, I found myself feeling quite vapid but also euphoric.  I let Harry do all the talking, and it was hard to please him as a good friend, in that I didn't take much interest in his dreams.  He accused me of being 'one of those people who wants a happy life,' which I found profound.  I believe he was right.  He likened my state to a stoner or an opiate user, who does not appreciate the insanity and the mind-expansion that is psychedelics.  While at this time, he may have been right, I had certainly had very cognitive trips before, and, as you may imagine, I was about to have the cognitive trip of my life.",
      "Suddenly I noticed that the table was full of patterns and I knew I was tripping hard.  People around me seemed fake, like stock characters in a universal play, they all performed a certain function, embodied a certain essence, and I could not imagine exceptions to the rule.  I realized that Alice, my ex-girlfriend, was 'pure,' for many reasons into which I shall not delve, and I suddenly felt the urge to find her and hold her.  Harry was beginning to take on a very ugly appearance, and his smile was terrifying.  He was doodling on a bunch of receipts, in a very psychedelic, end-of-the-world manner, and was insecure about the drawings that were coming out.  (The drawings were tiny and scraggily.)",
      "I informed Harry that I was tripping hard with intense visuals (majestic and green-tinted), and told him that recently in New Jersey I had been hanging out with 'insane' (they are not really insane, but rather honest) people, and I asked him if he knew what that was like.  This was directed at him as a hostile rhetorical question, because I knew he did not know what this was like.  I informed him that I needed to leave - I needed to go on a journey to find Alice.  He was welcome to come, but I needed to go that instant.  He could not abandon his receipts, however, and called me an asshole.",
      "It was very difficult to walk, I felt that I was melting with each step I took, and I was insanely euphoric.  (Moreso than ecstasy).  Even though the pizzeria was closed, the man at the door let me go in and out several times, saying 'He's all right!'  I was getting lots of calls from Harry, who informed me that he had nowhere to sleep that night, as he could not reach his quasi-girlfriend.  I told him that everything would be all right, that he would live, etc.  He replied that he knew he would live, but that it was an inconvenience nonetheless, and he was very mad at me.",
      "The walk from Times Square to 30th St. was the most visual experience of my life.  It looked like everything was in digital video, and all traffic lights were green and all cross walk signs were white.  I felt like a tiny king, stalking the streets, clad in jewels, and invincible.  I knew the city would take care of me (it seemed that no one was around), and I was singing aloud to myself, 'New York City is the place to be!'  I called Alice, who had taken a Xanax to fall asleep, and informed her that I now realized her goodness, and was sorry I had rejected her in the past.  She was all-understanding, although sedated from the Xanax, and told me to come to her apartment so that we might sleep (literally) together.",
      "Unfortunately and fortunately, once I got to 30th street, something very intense happened.  After seeing a lot of police cars, my left arm suddenly went numb, and I was sure I was dying of a heart-attack.  I was so sure that I walked up to the cops and asked them, 'Hello, I think I'm dying.  Can you help me?'  After some blunt conversation they called for an ambulance.  I called my dad and told him what was happening.  He was drunk (it was 12 AM), and seemed shock, but more because he thought that I was under arrest.  I told him I thought I was having a heart-attack and would call him back because an ambulance was coming. ",
      "Before the ambulance came, more cops came.  They were very mean to me, despite my being an honest, vulnerable baby-like person.  I told them that I was tricked into doing the drug, and that it wasn't coke.  (They thought it was coke.)  It seemed like a classic, NYC-gritty movie: they taunted me about being from NJ, and about doing drugs, etc.  They all appeared very small to me, like horrible midgets.  (By this point, the visuals - I should say VISUAL - were constant, in that everything looked a certain way and did not change.  I was in a different reality.)  It was the most horrible feeling I had ever felt in my life, by far.",
      "When the ambulance came, they told me to take my glasses with me, which were on the ground.  I said I didn't need them, and I guess they felt some remorse, and urged me to take them.  As I was carted away, one cop said triumphantly, 'Bye bye!' and to me this signaled that I was going to die.  In the ambulance, there was a fat black man and a tiny Asian man.  At times I loved them, and could see that they were helping me, and at other times, I was scared that they were literally retarded beings who could not understand me or help me.  I wondered if they would torture me, and asked, 'Are you going to make me into one of those vegetable people?'  The asian man said, 'No, we wouldn't do that to you.'  The black man was very playful with me, offering many riddles, which kept me occupied in my frenzied, psychedelic state, and, although his eyes bulged out terrifyingly, I kept saying, 'Man, you're good!' and I asked him to hold my hand.  He laughed and said that they had nurses to do that, at the hospital.  Although I am not gay, I knew, even in my state (or should I say BECAUSE OF my state) that there was a lot of homophobic tension in the ambulance.",
      "Basically, the ambulance ride consisted of me getting cold, then hot, then thinking I was dying and accepting death peacefully (a great feeling), only to imagine the prospect of eternal, torturous questioning from retarded people who could not understand me and would not let me die.  THAT was terrifying, ladies and gentlemen.  For an example: he asked what designer drug I did, and I said 4-AcO-DMT, to which he responded DMD? DMQ? DMR? etc.  Despite me cooperative state, I did not think to ask for a benzo or an antipsychotic, and in retrospect, I am thankful they did not give me one.",
      "They gave me a portable IV drip and attached all sorts of monitor-nodes to my body.  In the ER anteroom, I was still frightened, but nonetheless euphoric and interested in everything going on.  I connected with a lot of 'insane' patients, who told me, 'Enjoy the ride, it won't last long!'  How they were right.",
      "I found myself loving women more than ever for their caringness.  There were also two gay men in the ER who took excellent care of me, who I loved.  I was bonding with everyone like a child, it was intense.  I noticed that I was still tripping, although at this point I knew that I would not die, even though I thought I'd suffer permanent physical and psychological damage, which still did not bother me.  Everyone looked like a comical animal to me, and I couldn't stop smiling.  The head nurse, who was amped on coffee, seemed to twitch and speak at 1000 mph, and, although she was ugly to me, I asked her to sleep with me, to which she responded, 'That would be a negative.'  Everyone admired my snuggliness, and talked about me in a hushed voice.",
      "It was sad to come down from that infantile world of insane fear but also intense interest and euphoria.  For example, even at the peak of the terror, when I thought I would not be allowed to die, I did not mind, and felt that I would be perpetually interested.  I found myself making some calls and TM's to tell people I was okay, and I tried to abandon my wallet and phone at several points, even though they would keep putting them back in my pocket.",
      "I gradually came down and did not sleep.  I left Bellevue at 7 AM, and walked cross-town to my friends apartment.  The experience changed my life for the better, and I would not change anything about it.  I now find it much easier to love and care about others and myself.",
      "Note: my hand broke out into hives during the experience, and there is still a mark there, about a week later.  Otherwise, I don't think I was damaged physically, even though at the time I was sure I would die."

    "report": [
      "I've been using GBL and occasionally GHB for most of the past year.  My doses range from constant use for a month or two, a few days of decreasing my dosage, followed by a few days to a couple weeks of abstinence.  I'll try to be brief. This particular report is about a physical symptom that I get that is not-so-uncommon in me, yet I cannot find another person who has experienced it.  I have read of this side-effect manifesting in patients who are taking GHB for narcolepsy, though I have never read a first-hand report.  I am not narcoleptic and have no idea why this is happening.",
      "It sometimes strikes when I take GBL before bed and watch t.v. or close my eyes, it has happened during the day as well, but under those same conditions.  It has never happened while I was active or standing or sitting up, in fact it only happens when I lay on my back, not while I'm on my stomach or side.  Usually I will try to shift my position or scratch my face, etc., and it will quickly come to my attention that I cannot move at all.  My mind is perfectly alert, but it is trapped inside a body in which I have no control.  Total sleep paralysis.  It's pretty frightening, both for me and my girlfriend, who is almost invariably the only person I'm with when it happens.  The only muscles that I can control are my eyes and some weak control over my breathing.  I then channel all of my concentration into willing myself to move.  It takes many tries while regrouping my energy in between each before I break through that wall of paralysis and suddenly have full control of my body again.  The movement of my limbs by my girlfriend can greatly quicken the process.  Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to get her attention whilst in this state.  The best I can muster is the sounds of deliberate and labored breathing to signal that something is wrong.",
      "No harm has come from it nor have I ever read of any inherent danger in sleep paralysis.  This, coupled with the relative infrequency that it occurs and the fact that laying on my side or stomach almost always prevents the occurance, is weighed against the benefits that I derive from this drug and in the end I choose to continue to use it.  It is very infrequent now.  I do wonder why it happens to me and no one else without narcolepsy.  It could be affected by the anti-depressant, welbutrin, that I take.  It is the only variable that I can think of that might seperate me from the bulk of users of this drug.  perhaps an interaction prompts this response. ",
      "I have also experienced a bit of sleep paralysis in my childhood without any drugs involved, getting frightened very suddenly in a dream and not being able to scream, waking up and having a 10 second trail on being able to move again, or just waking up very gently out of a dream and trying to move before the natural paralysis was gone.  Perhaps I am just predisposed to this paralysis and GBL promts the response.  The response does make some sense.  As we know, our bodies produce a chemical at night that cuts off efferent transmition to our motor nerves to prevent us from acting out our dreams and getting very hurt.  GHB is a chemical that is endogenously released when we sleep.  It is not, therefore, a huge jump to swallow an equation that includes a drug that is part of the chemical processes of sleep, a calm situation where there is little counter-action of the drug from my body, and a product called sleep paralysis... but why me and why does it occur only when I lay on my back.  I don't know if anyone else will be able to relate to this, but I wanted to contribute a report of my atypical effect from GBL/GHB.  Thanks."

      "7mg, smoked",
      "I felt a very pleasant rushing sensation. Pleasantness pulsed through me, and I had visions of a girl I knew from a long time ago that I had felt disappointed at being unable to pursue. Except now, in vision, she changed into a idealistic altruist in my mind, dancing amongst my thoughts. I couldn?t see her, but I thought of her as in a daydream, and was comforted. I had a friend to my left, and when he asked me how I was doing, I was surprised when I had trouble spitting out words. The experience did not seem very intense at all, but I was speechless.  I rested my head on the log, closing my eyes to drift in the pleasantries of a dream state. It lasted no more than 10 minutes, though the first 3 were the strongest. I felt almost completely normal in 20 minutes.",
      "13mg, smoked",
      "I was ready for it to be strong, but still similar to my previous experience. I thought I would be able to handle this dosage quite well, although a friend who had done slightly more told me of nothing but terror. I smoked it anyways, and this time really got some of 5-meo-dmt?s harsh chemical-plastic taste. I barely finished the material, and right after I exhaled the smoke, I was sucked into a rushing tactile vortex (nothing I could see, only feel). The body rush proceeded to rise, rise, rise, peak, fall and slam into me over and over, escalating repeatedly and enveloping the world. I could not believe the pure intensity and explosion of the 5-meo peak was actually real, I was baffled and overcome with destruction. The climate had been slightly cool, and somewhat damp. I could no longer sense temperature, and could surprisingly utter more words than last time. The fear had set in. I thought to myself ?Why do I do drugs? and ?I should never ever do this ever again.? I looked over at my friend to my right, and his facial features morphed and gurgled. I didn?t get any visuals at 7mg, but I certainly saw them mildly at 13mg. The fractal patterns of tree leaves and branches in the woods provided an enhanced visual display, even now as I remember how they shuffled during this experience. I saw the symbolic girl of the previous trip again, and priorities quickly flushed my mind. I learned then what I would regret if I had died that day. I have finally admitted to myself what has been a persisting personal disaster in my life, and understood how much it was limiting me.  I was really only able to use the experience about 3 minutes into the experience, able to think dreamily and quickly.",
      "After the experience on the hike back, I was awestruck, but elevated. I was happy on one level because I was definitely approaching the future instead of looking back at the past, but on another level distraught at the effort I now had to put forth in order to heal myself. The immersive nature of this experience was difficult in stages, but necessary for growth."

      "I have found (and confirmed this by having my girlfriend and roommate try this too) that while under the influence of a phenethylamine (in this case 2C-E, but I've found mescaline works in a very similar way) that if one smokes/vaporizes n,n, DMT it almost completely takes the mental part of the DMT trip out of the equation and allows me to use large doses and watch the effects as if watching a movie.  This is very hard to explain, but I find that large smoked doses of DMT can be very mental at times and sometimes so overwhelmingly so that I don't remember much of the visuals, etc... while on 2C-E, I have found that a dose that would normally blast me off to another dimension, instead it leaves me right where I'm at and some of the most intense and intricate visuals I could ever experience unfold before my eyes- all the while staying completly clear-headed and coherent, its as if I am watching a movie of this, yet I am in the movie and it is really happening, this is most enjoyable! ",
      "In fact, the only reason I would not be able to carry on a perfectly normal conversation during this time is because I am in such awe of the majesty of what I am seeing before my eyes....the experience seems to last a little longer while in conjunction with a phenethylamine as well, I once stayed up much longer than anticipated just to smoke DMT another 4 or 5 times during the experience because it was such a wonderful experience."

Also, I noted that before I fell asleep my body temperature was up and my pulse was more than 120. Somehow, that combined with the fact that it made me sleepy, doesn't sound so good.

      "For months I had been without psychedelic experience. In fact, in the previous year, there have been only a few. The acid was long since gone. It has been hard even to find mushrooms lately. Then I remembered the DPT on the shelf, next to the DMT and 2C-B that were too sacred to use until the perfect time. The DPT was there only because I didn't know what else to do with it. About eight years ago I obtained some DPT from a supply house, and experimented with it. It was freebase, I assumed, because the label didn't say DPT HCl, just DPT. My friends and I smoked it and tripped and generally had a good time. I ordered more when it ran out, but all I could get was DPT HCl at that time. So that came and I had heard that you couldn't smoke it so I tried snorting it, but vowed never to do it again because the drip burned the back of my throat so badly. Then I tried injecting it IM, and that was so intense I only did it once. I put  200mg each into a bunch of caps and gave it to some friends to eat. They had a mellow but fun experience. So I had 200 mg left that I didn't know what to do with. It sat there for years.",
      "The other day I brought it out, blew the dust off. It had turned sort of a tan color from the white that it used to be. Because I heard that it oxidizes over time, I had no faith that it would work in any sort of form whatsoever. I thought about it. Then on a whim I put a little bit into a glass pipe and heated the glass with a flame. It melted immediately! I watched, and the oil did not resolidify. I vaporized a small amount and inhaled it, and waited for something to happen. My legs began to feel restless: an unmistakable alert! It's going to work! Whether the HCl salt is actually smokable, or whether I in fact had the freebase, I do not know. What I do know is that it worked, it is still potent even after sitting there for seven years! I put it away for the time being.",
      "Today I brought it out again. \tI set everything up for an escape. I had the music all cued up and the headphones adjusted just right. I had the blankets smoothed out. My body was clean and naked. Yet as I loaded the DPT into the pipe, I hesitated. Was this really what I wanted?",
      "What I really wanted is to escape from alcohol. I did not want to consume any today. Nor tomorrow. Nor the next day. It has become painfully obvious what a negative force in my life alcohol has become, and yet I have found it difficult to let go of. Perhaps if I plunged into DPT space, I would not feel the urge to drink tonight. Perhaps if I went in there, there would be some answer waiting for me that I had been searching for.",
      "Fuck it, I thought. I held the lighter flame to the glass and watched the 100mg I had put in there melt. Soon, vapor appeared in the pipe, and I put my lips to it and inhaled long and slow. The vapor from DPT is not harsh like DMT, it doesn't seem to burn your lungs. It just tastes warm and sweet and makes your tongue go kind of numb. I took all my lungs could hold (maybe 30 mg vaporized?). Unlike DMT, DPT does not start to come on as you are still inhaling. It waits until you've held your hit for a while. I held it as long as I could, and as I did so the walls very gently began to breathe, the texture on the ceiling began to crawl. I exhaled, and my breath was full of vapor. I had planned to take another hit, but then I found myself just staring at the pipe. I didn't want to take another hit, but I didn't not want to either. I just felt very peaceful and content to sit there and stare at it instead of smoking it.. Well, I'd better set the pipe down, then.",
      "I laid back to be absorbed into the music: Divine Moments of Truth by Shpongle. But I found that the world was much more interesting with my eyes open than with them closed. The ceiling was very colorful and crawling, with repeating organic movements. My inner monologue was very noticeable, the music not so. When I had listened to this song on DMT, I seemed to travel to another space entirely, one in which this particular song was playing with total and utter cosmic genius. This time, it seemed just like some good music to be listening to. I was brought very much into the awareness of THIS space, this world, this body. I could feel my legs getting restless.",
      "When the song finished ten minutes later, I got up. I felt cold. I put on running clothes and shoes. Outside it was late afternoon, wind was in the trees and dark clouds in the sky. I didn't care. I put on a beanie and glasses and called the dogs. I walked out the front door. The sky was shimmering, the sidewalk crawling. The wind was bitter cold and a few snow flurries were falling. Whoa, this is going to be intense, I thought. Fuck it.",
      "The dogs ran out the back gate when I opened it. I ran after them down the trail that leads towards the mountain behind my house. I felt very cold. I don't know if I'll get far, I thought. Everything was moving, but then when you're running, everything is moving whether you're on drugs or not. That inner monologue still very clear. My feet go where they go, my thoughts wander.",
      "Ever since I was first exposed to them, I have been wrestling with the question: 'What is it, exactly, that psychedelics DO?' Its hard to answer, because they don't really DO anything. Maybe its better to ask what they stop you from doing.",
      "So I drop that first hit of acid, and wait a few hours. At first, nothing happens. Then, all of a sudden I discover that the ordinary has become very profound. Only, maybe it hasn't. No, actually, it was profound all along. It's just that somewhere along the line, I stopped paying attention to it. It's funny, people always talk about how profound the psychedelics are. But its not the drugs that are profound, it's the whole UNIVERSE that's profound! Everything! That rock and that tree and that bug and that dog running ahead and the clouds above and all of it profoundly beautiful, miraculous, divine. Whether we notice or not.",
      "When I was a child, and the whole world was new, everything in it was fascinating to me. That is because I was observing it from a beginner's standpoint. I did not think that you knew anything about it, therefore I paid attention carefully in order to learn. But at some point I decided that I had learned enough, and so I formed labels in my mind for things. 'Bug.' 'Tree.' 'Cloud.' Once I created in my mind this simplified idea of things, I could stop paying attention to them and focus on other things. What the kindergarten teacher wanted, for example.",
      "I've come to the first junction. I take the left path, up the mountain. A warmth is starting to seep through my body from the muscles moving inside. My legs are running. The scenery is passing. My thoughts are flowing...",
      "When you were very young, I am saying to myself, your brain was plastic. It was moldable. Synapses were forming, breaking, and re-forming. I experienced stimulus, and I learned action. In my brain, neural connections were made that associated a familiar pattern of stimulus with a pattern of reaction. Clouds, for example, did not require much action, because they could not be interacted with. Likewise, they did not require much attention. How many times a day do I walk outside and not notice what is going on in the sky above you? That is because the sky rarely requires any action, so my brain filters out the visual stimulus of the sky, and keeps it from reaching my conscious mind. It leaves my mind to focus on more important matters. 'What am I going to have for lunch today?' 'Am I going to be late for work?' 'Will I have enough money left over this month to buy that jacket that I want?'",
      "My brain became more and more hard-wired as I grew older. Old neural connections become harder and harder to break, and new ones harder to make. My brain began to function in a rhythmic pattern, instead of chaotically as it did when I was young. I wake up in the morning, go to work, come home, drink beer, and go to sleep. One day starts to blur into the next. Sometimes I think to myself that tomorrow I will make a change, but then tomorrow comes and more than likely it goes the same way as yesterday. This is because my brain has become hardwired for me to behave in this way.",
      "I am on top. Already? I didn't even notice myself running up the steepest part of the trail. Come to think of it, I can't even remember doing it! Huh. It is strangely peaceful under the Ponderosas at the top. The wind has stopped. New fallen snow sits fluffy and white among the trunks. My pace quickens as I begin descending the other side.",
      "I think that what psychedelic drugs must accomplish by binding to the 5-HT-2 receptor is that they stop these neural connections from functioning, temporarily. They stop the filters from working. Poison for the mind, as Pendell would say. Poisoning normalcy. Poisoning familiarity. Poisoning those cancerous patterns that have grown there and make me sick. I glance at the sky and instead of my brain labeling 'Clouds' and diverting attention elsewhere, I am all of a sudden caught by the stunning beauty unfolding above me. And all around me. Everywhere. All of a sudden, the world is new, like it was when I was a child. Everything is innocent again. Everything is beautiful again. I forget where I have to be at a certain time tomorrow, but I am very aware of what is going on right this very now.",
      "In our society we are so focused on the future that we tend to forget to appreciate what we have in the present moment. How many times do we really stop to notice how good it feels to be alive? But when you stop to think about it, it really does feel good to be alive and healthy, even if you're sleepy, even if your muscles are sore from the day before. How many times do we stop just to take a deep breath and enjoy? Most of the time, people forget to do these things, and I think this is a great loss. The psychedelics tend to slap me across the face and remind me of these things. It is very hard not to forget again and slip back into the old ways of functioning, but I think it is a very important lesson to remember that there is a now, and it is amazing.",
      "So why the addiction? Why the drinking? I can see that the influence of alcohol takes me in the exactly opposite direction. It takes me away from the now, away from the present, away from the joy and the pain and the beauty all around us all the time. It is an escape, when the way seems too hard, when things are too painful or too frustrating. It is easy. It demands no responsibility. It is a lazy man's drug. It takes the pain away, but it takes the beauty away too. All the poignancy of this wonderful and terrible world is lost to the drunkard, who escapes to his slumber or his stupor.",
      "The wind is blowing again and a few flurries are hitting me in the face. My chest heaves with the breath that steams from my mouth. The world is cold and grey and stormy and very beautiful. I am running fast, down the hill towards my house, floating over the rocks and around the winding bends.. feeling very alive and very grateful to be here now, in this moment, in this body, in this world."

      "A summary of 8 Amanita muscaria experiences. To start off with try the grade A caps work much better than the extract for me.",
      "At low doses some traditional affects seem to be salvation, increase in mood, interest in previously uninteresting things. I was fascinated with water and gas lines coming into the house. Thoughts of religion, particularly Buddhism, and Christianity. Im more into Native American philosophy normally.  Laughter seeing he funny side of things, enjoyed television which I normally only tolerate.  Profound feelings of oneness.  Deep thinking.",
      "Ive had some difficulty with larger doses however getting stuck in time loops for what seemed like would last forever one loop going into another constantly repeating itself in different degrees. I thought it would run itself out but due to contact with the outside world I ended up in the hospital then mental hospital until things got straightened out. Some negative affects at large doses were time loops, paranoia. Pissing my pants (it seemed like a good idea at the time, I thought I was caught in a mouse wheel spinning upside down and around in a figure 8 pattern and didnt want to move). Also extreme honesty, felt nothing wrong with giving honest answers to everything due to felt oneness with outside objects.",
      "Many mystical experiences resulted. I can not remember most of these dealing with the laws of the universe, humanity and hope in general. Very open to suggestions. Strength wise Id say Amanita is far stronger than mary jane. Not a party fungus. More something to be taken and attend a local church or hang out in nature. Im not a party person lately. Environment is important taking it and attending school got me in a certain amount of trouble when I happily announced to a history class that owning slaves wasnt necessarily all bad and other bizarre conculsions coming out of  not believing what I was hearing plus intrinsic trust in the fabric of the universe.",
      "Overall helpful in the spiritual centers of the body, aiding in compassion and understanding. I viewed these plants as devine and a blessing. I also enjoy the green, regular mushrooms, top 2, in various varities, never tried lsd, very interested. H.b. woodrose better than morning glory, gave me some interesting insights. Im scared very much so of datura, ayahuasca, and salvia.",
      "Far more than a mild experience, amanitas can be downright intense and earth shattering. A 4 mushroom experience left me in a daze seeing opposities disappear, with the knowledge they were only real and maintained by me. I literally couldnt tell which way was up and almost walked up the side of a wall chris angel style, for real. Also couldnt tell difference between dry, wet, night, day, dreaming, awake, future, past all other imaginable differences didnt quite blur the edges enough to reach the white light or atman, but deep non the less, will continue to use these blessed plants."

    "report": [
      "I had been using GHB (as well as LSD, mushrooms, marijuana, DXM, and Ketamine) rather frequently at the time of this incident (late 1997) and had never been more intoxicated than a moderate 'drunk' by the quantities of GHB I'd tried, which were up to 7 grams at once or 11 grams staggered over several hours.  I was my own supplier/chemist and thought that I was thoroughly in control of any situations I chose to be in but proved myself quite fallible one Autumn evening.  I was brooding alone at my flat after my roommate had gone out on a date.  My baseline GHB dose at the time was typically 4 grams and I kept the liquids in the house mixed at a 1 gram per teaspoon ratio. ",
      "I was a bit bothered about a recent breakup and had been using other recreational drugs quite heavily over the past few months so I thought nothing of washing down 4 teaspoons of some leftover GHB I'd found in the cupboard (Oooh! surprise cache!) with a glass of apple juice, which was my favourite mixer at the time.  It tasted a bit stronger and nastier than usual but I wandered back to the computer and resumed perusing newsgroups without a second thought.  Very shortly the effects began to come on with an unusual intensity and within minutes I was unable to focus my eyes on the monitor. ",
      "Out of sheer dumb luck, I stumbled over to a recliner and passed out in an upright position, which may possibly have saved me.  I awoke some five hours later to find my roommate in a pale but relatively calm rage, reading through my own bookmarked research to try to determine if an ambulance ride to the hospital was in order or if sleeping it off was still an option.  He and his date had returned two hours previously to find me unconscious and covered in my own vomit.  After numerous unsuccessful attempts to arouse me, she went home while he tried to work through what to do -- he himself being a lifelong abstainer from any illicit substance.  My assumption is that my being upright prevented me from aspirating my own vomit and kept the damage level to a minimum.  At any rate, my return to consciousness did not signify any level of sobriety, which I soon discovered upon attempting to clean up a bit.  I was still completely demolished and unable to coordinate any movement beyond crawling crookedly across the floor.  I was entirely too dizzy to sit upright and found that standing was completely out of the question. ",
      "Over the next hour I began to regain my faculties a bit only to discover that (as an effect of the dosage, I would assume) I was extraordinarily depressed.  I spent the next two hours sobbing, talking with my roommate and generally feeling suicidal and worthless.  I began to calm down some time later and eventually went off to bed, still completely at a loss as to why I had been so radically affected by what I had considered to be a marginal dose of GHB.  The next morning while doing laundry and cleaning various articles of furniture, I stumbled upon the cause of the previous night's mayhem: the 'extra' GHB in the cupboard turned out to be the remainders of the unreacted lactone I'd had left over from a prior batch.  Yeah, drugs don't always make you the sharpest knife in the drawer.",
      "One interesting (at least to me) sidenote is that I never experienced such a level of depression in conjunction with GHB except on two occasions when I took GHB and DXM together, the first time 3g/300mg and the second time 4g/600mg, respectively.  A good friend with a long history of bipolar depression found this particular cocktail to be quite enjoyable; I personally have no explanations to offer other than that extended chemical experimentation may impede romantic efforts, but that's another story now, isn't it?"

      "Retrospective, took 6 seeds crushed with rock in yogurt also crushed up 6 seeds and smoked them. Very positive experience noticed how I always have to fit into world in some way. As a male I felt I was getting too feminine and should care and honor more of what other guys say and care less about what girls have to say. Upon doing this I gradually noticed a change in perception and a deepening of my voice and sexuality. Started swearing more felt more that god was male, Honored my father over mother, ect. Felt more that it was ok to do chemicals since its a male thing to do ect.",
      "Later next day took 10 seeds thought about job and future career. Need to get one. Affects seemed diminished since I had previously took them day earlier. Next day took 10 more followed by 18 following day. Noticed drowsyness come over me, followed by new creative insights. Social aspects talked with parents hung out with dog, more so than usual. No one suspected anything. Felt very powerful as if I could fight well or rip a tree from ground, very masculine, noticed fellow males were largely feminine, drawn to a different type of male on this. Listened to eminem, liked his attitude. Would recommend this plant a legal herb that does something Possibly mystical at incredibly high doses but it felt more like an add pill for me. Im a big guy 190 lbs and 24yrs old. Its a dont push me around, men own the universe women should play their part in it, the balance is needed everything is termporarly. Perfect experience.",
      "Negative include nausea the seeds do not sit well or taste delicious. Tiredness. Positives would include increased sex drive, I wasnt around any females at the time, touch would have felt awesome, very in control feeling, past experiences I actually broke down crying in mystical fashion at how beautifully the universe was set up and how it was ok to surrender and trust in it as a guide, mushy stuff like that. Overall recommended. Tolerance builds up fast and it doesnt seem like it would."

      "Ive experimented with a wide range of psychedelics (tryptamines, phenethylamines, and LSD), as well as many other drugs, but I never get stuck on one substance.  Novelty is one of the greatest characteristics of experimenting with psychoactive substances.  I very rarely use opiates or any addictive drugs for that matter  I received 2 x 4mg dilaudid (hydromorphone) pills about 3 months ago and still hadnt used them.  I figure I have too many outside responsibilities and interests to let myself get in the habit of using drugs too often.  My philosophy of drug use is that as long as drugs arent detrimental to ones life or getting in the way of ones goals, they are perfectly acceptable and occasionally even beneficial.  This requires a good deal of self honesty, but responsible drug use is possible.  Thats enough of being preachy.  On with the report ",
      "Set and setting:\t",
      "It is my spring break  after months of grueling work for medical school I finally have the chance to completely relax.  The previous weekend I had an extraordinarily beautiful experience hiking under the influence of 420 mg mescaline hcl, which was augmented beautifully at the tail end with ketamine.  This is probably my only trip for the spring.  I plan on tripping 3-4 times a year as long as I can foresee (and using empathogens every once in a while as well).  Ive cut back significantly from the peak of my tripping, which was once or twice a month last spring. ",
      "Today, I slept in late, cleaned up the apartment a little, and got in a workout.  I felt healthy, rested, and stress-free going into the experience.  I had one friend joining me and our only concrete plan was to watch the Tar Heel basketball game.  We ate a light meal about 30 minutes beforehand, so I expected a slight delay and was worried about some nausea. (AET never showed even a hint of stomach issues) ",
      "T+0:00 \t",
      "We take 130 mg AET, its down the hatch at 8:00 p.m.  We drive over to a friends house to watch the Tar Heels play their second round game in the NCAA tournament.",
      "T+1:15  \t",
      "By halftime, I am aware of a faint something, but I cant define it.  I drink two IPAs over the course of the game (I never drink much).  We are both still only a +/- on the Shulgin scale. ",
      "T+2:30\t\t",
      "Im somewhat disappointed.  I look in the mirror and my pupils appear slightly constricted?!!  Im confused of course, because its as if the drug hasnt even entered my system or was somehow having some parasympathetic effects.  I figure that this is just going to be an extremely mild experience.  We plan to go out and celebrate the Tar Heels victory and St. Pattys Day, but neither of us is even close to the state of bliss that we were hoping for.  In fact, we arent even sure we could distinguish this feeling from placebo. ",
      "T+3:15\t\t",
      "We get back to my place to get a little something to give us the boost we were looking for.  Wed hoped to be writhing in pleasure at this point but are far from it.  I recalled the dilaudid that Id dissolved and put through a micron filter over a month ago.  It was ready to be injected (Ive only IVd opiates two other times).  This seems like a good option since the AET seems to be a dud.  Using sterile technique, we both draw up  cc (~1 mg).  Id heard the body rush was stronger than heroin, and I imagine it could be true.  Even at this low dose, I experience a wave of muscle contraction as the drug permeates my body.  Im not sure that I even enjoyed it.  It doesnt cross the blood-brain barrier as quickly as heroin, but damn, Im not sure I could stand a body rush any stronger.  A few minutes later the drug seems to be slowly seeping into my brain and I become peacefully opiated.  I lay down listening to some My Morning Jacket  what a beautiful sound. ",
      "T+3:30 \t",
      "I feel some slight nausea whenever I walk around.  I venture into the bathroom and observe my pupils  they are dilated!!!  Opiates dont make your eyes dilated!  Was the tryptamine finally making an appearance?  Euphoria is building.  I cant tell if it is more than just the dilaudid, but I feel absolutely wonderful. ",
      "T+3:45  \t",
      "We smoke some excellent Moroccan hash and then IV an additional 1 mg dilaudid.  The rush is just as strong  almost unnerving.  We lay around acclimating ourselves to the new state of mind.",
      "T+4:00  \t",
      "The waves!!!  Incredibly waves of euphoria wash over me, they approach slowly building in the distance to awesome heights.  Its as if the intensity recedes for a few minutes and Im not even sure if I can feel the tryptamine, then it builds, and BOOM, it crashes  its a level of euphoria possibly more intense than MDMA.  The waves are more distinct than any other drug Ive ever experienced.  Roughly 5 minutes of heavenly pleasure are followed by 2-3 minutes of Im not even sure if Im feeling the AET anymore.  The waves transition from crashing and receding to an ebb and flow. ",
      "T+4:15  \t",
      "We decide that if we are going to make it to a bar its now or never.  Im not usually a bar person, but I know a bartender that had promised me a drink as a congratulations for my recent engagement.  Plus, we had to celebrate St. Pattys and the Tar Heels!  I talk with the bartender, get my complimentary beer, and we sit down on some couches in the back.  If Id didnt maintain some effort in looking normal I would have appeared as described in another AET report, like I was blowing up and smacked out at the same time.  I wanted to just lean my head back, close my eyes, and just be self indulgent.  In the past I almost feel ashamed when I get to this state of mind, but with the hard work Id put in the past 10 weeks, I felt I deserved every bit of this hedonic thrill.  And despite my desire to writhe in pleasure, it was actually quite easy and comfortable to have conversation. ",
      "T+4:45 \t",
      "A group of grad students sat down by us and we strike up a conversation.  I feel relatively at ease even though in my head Im floating on heavenly clouds and experiencing a pureness of euphoria that Ive never known before.  Talking actually feels great.  The people we met were slightly drunk and nobody suspects that we are on anything (Im sure someone with a keen eye would have had no problem figuring it out though).  It turns out that the brother of one of the grad students is the roommate of my best friend from high school.  There are lots of random connections  if Id been tripping they would have definitely seemed cosmic.  We talk for a while.  The waves come in increasingly rapid succession, overlapping and gradually erasing the troughs.  Some tension is building in my jaw muscles, but I can keep it somewhat under control. ",
      "T+6:30\t\t",
      "The bar closes and we head home.  The cold air outside makes my teeth chatter uncontrollably.  I take 600 mg carisoprodol (Soma) when I get home to try and ease the jaw clenching.  The AET finally reaches a steady state, but were still soaring high on the plateau.  We smoke some more delicious hash and put on some music.  I branch off temporarily from the greatest band in music, MMJ, and listen to some Sigur Rs, Explosions in the Sky, and then Pink Floyd.  The music is very mellow and complements the state of mind flawlessly. ",
      "My senses are ever so slightly frayed, I dim the lights, light a few candles  this fixes the problem completely.  The music is like a warm blanket, delicately insulating my mind.  There is some nodding off  the opiate alone was not strong enough to cause nodding (although Ive never actually experienced an opiate nod).  AET seems to cause some nodding on its own, but the combination with dilaudid and THC made for a wonderful state of mind.  The air looked a little foggy, and the atmosphere in the room was much like a dream.  I experienced some mild hypnagogic hallucinations whenever I would let my mind shut off and drift.  The Soma is starting to alleviate some of the jaw clenching.   ",
      "T+7:00 \t",
      "I feel like the plateau is beginning to taper off and I take 0.5 mg alprazolam (xanax) hoping that Ill be able to get decent sleep at some point.  The hash was a perfect compliment.  My friend IVs another 0.5 - 1 mg dilaudid, but I dont even feel the need  Im already in a state of perfection.  We lay around talking about how wonderful this night of true hedonism was. ",
      "Summary:\t",
      "This experience was hedonism at its finest. This is certainly the tryptamines equivalent of MDMA. It didnt have the forced empathy of MDMA, but felt like an exquisitely clean high. Pure euphoria is the best way I can describe it. It did have a faint tryptamine signature buzz, but really no visual disturbances and only very minor changes in thinking patterns (less psychedelic than even MDMA). The hash was probably the main contributor to the altered thought processes.  Overall, however, AET was definitely the main player in this experience. The hydromorphone was in the background relative to the tryptamine ... same as it would be if hydromorphone was combined with MDMA or any psychedelic.  The AET went from unnoticeable at T+3:30 (not including the dilated pupils) to VERY STRONG at T+4:00!! There was nothing aside from some sweaty palms and a slight mood lift until T+3:30.",
      "I think the nods were the most noticeable mental characteristic of AET aside from the feeling of pure bliss. The hydromorphone blended perfectly and probably added to the dreamy effect. AET felt very sensual at points, but at least with the opiate combination, it would not lend itself to sexual activity  quite the opposite actually. I dont think this one has the therapeutic potential of MDMA, but it is just as pleasurable. AET is a pleasure drug, which is why I think it went so well with the hydromorphone ... self indulgence amplified. I'm not usually a fan of drugs like this, but I suppose the rare experience like this is acceptable (maybe not beneficial like some of the psychedelics can be).",
      "It was very odd that the drug seemed to be almost completely absent until 3 hours after taking it. Ive never had a drug take effect so late. The same delay happened with my friend. Maybe the hydromorphone really kicked it into gear or maybe it was the food, but it was literally like and on/off switch, an almost instantaneous transition from +/- to a +++.",
      "The next day, I slept in late and woke up feeling a pleasant afterglow. I lounged around for most of the afternoon, watching some basketball and jotting down this experience. I took some 5-HTP only because I planed to, not at all because I felt like I needed it. After a run in the late afternoon, I felt great. Tonight I feel tired and Im sure Ill sleep well.",
      "I must clarify that this does not qualify as one of those rare and extremely memorable experiences and was by no means life changing. I value existential ecstasy acheived in a profound trip many 1000x more than I value a selfish night of hedonism. Egocentric pleasure is much less satisfying than spiritual pleasure, the two arent even comparable. The ecstasy of a profound trip can leave your mood affected positively for months or years afterward, whereas this was great, but there was no lasting impact.  This experience was something that Id possibly repeat someday, but I will save it for a special date, and by no means anytime soon."

    "report": [
      "It all started in August of 2006, when I first became interested in experimenting with psychedelics. I had heard all the stories of people who had supposedly experienced God and made spiritual discoveries through psychedelics. The most notable of which was LSD. I thought there had to be some truth to it, as there were so many reports on it, so much evidence. My first real experience was with two hits of blotter in November 2006, and it was not spiritual in the least, but it gave me this constant nagging feeling that there was more to it. I had bitten a small piece of the pie, it tasted good, and I wanted more.",
      "As I experimented further, I became more and more familiar with this state, and became more aware of the global unified collective unconscious that runs through all things, the spirit of God if you will. I gradually became increasingly aware of the references to the experience through the lyrics of psychedelic rock bands, bands such as Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, 13th Floor Elevators, and my favorite, Widespread Panic. I always related my experiences to what I knew about God, what I had read from the bible and what was taught to me in church. To me, everything clicked, it all made sense.",
      "Eventually, I was using some sort of psychedelic, whatever I could get my hands on, about once a week. I would lay down in my bed, put on some headphones, listen to psychedelic rock and let my 'self' go. For a while, it was always a constant flood of new information, always a new experience, and revelations were consistently found. But, I was still looking for that life changing experience I had heard so much about. Yeah, I learned about how the world worked, the way God sets everything up, to teach us lessons that we either realize and learn from or we just pass by as just coincidence and go on about life. I knew all of these things, but nothing major ever happened to change me. I still hid half of my life, all of my drug use, sneaking around, not wanting anyone, especially family, to find out the extent of what I did. I wanted to save myself from their judgment, but in turn was only judging and condemning myself because I knew what I was doing was wrong. Not the drug use per se, but the fact that I wasn't open about who I was and what I did.",
      "Luckily for me, all of these things changed following a Widespread Panic concert in March of '07. I had been trying for weeks to score some LSD, the greatest psychedelic discovered (incidentally, oddly enough) by man. I finally found some about four hours before the start of the concert, how lucky I was. We dropped about 7:00-7:15, the show started at 7:30. The show was great, but I noticed that it looked like we were the only people in the crowd tripping on LSD, and one of the few there that would smoke weed. Eventually in the second set, someone lit up a joint, we followed suit shortly thereafter. After that song was over, the lights came on and security made everyone put out their joints/cigarettes.",
      "When the band started back up, bass player Dave Schools remarked 'Watch the green tree there farmer.' Immediately after, they started playing some of their more obviously spiritual songs, ones that in one way or another directly related to the psychedelic experience found by those who are more spiritually inclined. Yet another one of those wonderful coincidences that happens on LSD. As the show was coming to a close, I kept getting this nagging feeling that something was supposed to happen to me, something incredibly, direly important. I tried sitting down and letting my 'self' go, as I had done while laying in bed in the weeks prior. I would always come so close, but was never able to achieve any significant loss of ego, as I kept being interrupted by people bumping into me walking down the isle.",
      "Eventually the show came to a close, so we thought, and we unwittingly up and left before the encore. As we crossed the waterway to the parking lot, about 100yards away from the venue, they came on for the encore. We stopped and sat down on a bench to listen before heading out. At this point, I knew I had to do something, something had to happen or I would keep leading on in life the way I always had, being a lying sneak, and that thought kept eating at me more and more. I felt that, if I would do something so blatantly out of character, something to show that I really didn't care what others thought, most especially the person I was with, someone who I knew, that I my life in this would would come to a close and I would forever would become one with the cosmic unity known as God.",
      "I thought of my life, and all the things I had in it, and thought how nothing would ever amount to the bliss that comes with being one with God. There were things in life that I still wanted to do and experience, yes, but I was ready to give it all up. All I had to do was walk up to the guard railing on the waterway and let myself fall in, it would all be over and I would be free. As the band played their last song, 'Ain't Life Grand,' I approached the railing. I grabbed the rails with both hands and closed my eyes. I felt my hands slipping into the rails, and a sound of rushing water grew in my ears. I leaned forward, tumbled head over heels and splashed in. I floated to the surface, eyes still closed. As I came up, I opened them to see not just the person I came to the show with, but a short bald man with a knowing grin on his face.",
      "I began to believe that maybe I was wrong, falling into the water wasn't what I was supposed to do, until this man says 'That's what I'm here for.'",
      "'Oh yeah, what are you here for?' I rudely replied.",
      "'Pretty cocky, sounds like a guy whose got nothing to lose' he says.",
      "Piquing my interests, I replied 'Yeah, what do you know about it?'",
      "What followed was such an ecstatic moment in my life that it wasn't much more than a heavenly blur. From the things he remarked on following my last comment, he knew everything about it. As I jumped with vigorous joy, he laughed and commented 'I know the feeling! Believe me, I know the feeling!' I even let out a joyous 'Oh my God!' at which he sort of coughed and got my attention, thus bringing yet another bout of roaring laughter. In between were a couple of more joking remarks regarding my sandals floating away, and how they wouldn't float forever. At that point I could care less about my sandals because I was saved, saved from the wretched life I once led. My friend, baffled by the entire state of affairs was standing next to us. He queried 'What is going on?' with a puzzled look on his face. At nearly the same time, me and my new friend comment 'He doesn't get it.' Following shortly thereafter with a 'whatever' and a shrug of the shoulders.",
      "My friend left saying 'Dude, I'm outta here.' I could have cared less. As things calmed down a bit, he says, referring to not only our current surroundings but the entire world he had created: 'It's nice isn't it?' 'It's beautiful' was all I could reply. At this point I had only one question for him, and that was 'What do I do now?' To which he replied, 'Whatever an honest free soul pleases!' Yet more ecstatic laughter ensued. 'Oh man this is great!' I said. He replied with 'It only gets better from here!' There were a few more words exchanged, yet none I can really recall well.",
      "When it came time for him to leave, he remarked 'Watch out, you're probably gonna get arrested.' I replied with 'arrested? Why would I get arrested?' He laughed with yet another knowing grin. I wanted to follow him, but he told me not to, he jokingly pointed and said to follow some shirtless man headed out towards the parking lot. Naturally, I did, but not before chucking my dead, useless cell phone out into the waterway. I followed the man shortly, exchanging a few words before reaching the parking lot. At this point, I either thought to myself that I needed a new change of clothes (which coincidentally, I had also needed a new change of clothes in life) or someone in the crowds mentioned it. Either way, I was out searching for new clothes.",
      "I approached the parking lot entrance where theatre employees were directing traffic. I asked them if I could get a new change of clothes 'that way,' referring to where they were pointing their traffic signals. I got a couple of 'Are you serious?' remarks and looks, but went on my way unheeded. As I crossed the street and reached the greenbelt, I began to jog in the direction I believed was the way to the mall. As I jogged, I thought 'These clothes area lot of baggage, really weighing me down.' I shed them without the slightest thought as to the repercussions. As far as I knew, there were no repercussions for the honest free soul, which I most certainly at that point was (and still am).",
      "I began to make my rounds of the area, trying to find my surroundings and get to the mall nearby, believing store employees would be more than happy to fix me up with a new set of clothes. After running into various people walking the streets and having some good laughs, and even getting my pictures taken, I wound up in one of the crowded parking lots. I was greeted by a large crowd of rather friendly people who luckily found quite a bit of humor in my situation. Exchanges were made and I continued my search, but not before being abruptly stopped by a police officer who spotted my antics from across the way.",
      "'Son, where are your clothes?!?'",
      "'I'm wearing them?' I replied with a puzzled look on my face.",
      "I really didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing, I didn't have anything to hide, I was wearing my birthday suit, the clothes I was born in. Coincidentally, these were also the clothes I was reborn in, haha. Regardless, I was being handcuffed and instructed not to fight, despite my cluelessness as to what the heck was wrong with not wearing anything. Other people had to wear clothes to cover themselves up, present themselves as 'somebody.' I was me, and all I needed were the clothes I was born with, I didn't need clothing to represent me as a certain type of person, I was just a person.",
      "Shortly thereafter I found myself in the back of a police car, handcuffed and providing information to another one of the nice police officers. I was more than happy to give them my house number and tell them to call my parents. After what I experienced, I was an honest free soul and could tell them anything. And tell I did. After they picked me up, I told them everything I had done, all my drug use, all my previous sins, every deception and lie that I had made built my bed on all these years, and it never felt so good.",
      "After all of this, I've decided to stop searching for God through psychedelics, I've found him, and never letting go. I'll never tell a lie again, and will never represent myself as someone I'm not. I deceived a lot of people through the years, and I won't do it again. It builds up and hurts too much. The best thing anyone can do is be honest. It may not feel like it at the time, because you fear the repercussions of telling the truth. There are no consequences for telling the truth, only benefits, regardless of what the situation is. But there are consequences for lying. I have nothing to lose if I'm an honest free soul, but I've got everything to lose, including my life and eternity, if I'm not."

      "She gave me the little pieces of paper, and I kept them cold and in the darkness like I'd been told to. Today it was decided amongst me and a friend that today was the right day to do it. We took the paper out, and each took two hits (I took a little more).",
      "+00 That entire day I'd been smoking hash and very potent marijuana, so I was already pretty blazed. But once it hit, I really started to experience everything strangely.",
      "+2:00  I'm really trying to put the effects into words, but it's tough. I feel, out of body, and thinking about everything rapidly. And I feel hot, beginning to drink lots of water. Due to an unforseen circumstance, my friend had to leave early so I was completely alone with only some online friends to keep me grounded. My whole body felt strange. Typing becomes difficult and strained. Yet I have incredible energy too.",

Seconds later I feel sad and scared, almost like a little baby, helpless. I begin to think about my father, and how much he cares about me, and I'm able to accept it and cry for the first time in a year.",
      "+5:00 I'm drinking insane amounts of water. I can never seem to get enough.",
      "+11:30 I'm a pretty big stoner, and I tried DXM once, but I've never felt anything like this. It's so close to soberness at times that I even question if I'm really on a drug at all, then shifts into boundless thoughts and ideas. The entire idea of reality begins to melt away and I realize that nothing is real. That is what I love about this drug! My sense of time is completely gone. It's been almost 12 hours since I took the dose. And I'm still feeling strange. I can remember taking the dose, and it seems so amazingly far, and yet close.",
      "Okay, well the experience is over (after 15 hours). During the peak, I became uncontrollably emotional, crying into my pillow for minutes at a time. Music was also really interesting: I was able to listen to it forever, and if my mind didn't like what was being played, it simply switched it off. Sometimes I didn't hear anything, when I realized I did.",

      "Background: This is the tale of my brush with opium addiction. I am a causasian male, weight 120 pounds, currently 22 although the events described in this report take place at the age of 19, over a four month period of the summer of 2004. I always research drugs heavily before even considering using them. Opiates held no great interest for me as I was well aware of the strong potential for addiction as well as the fast tolerance that builds to the effects of such drugs. My main areas of interest and experimentation, drug-wise, were (and still are) marijuana and psychedelics, as well as milder psychoactive herbs. At the time of my flirtation with opium I was a daily marijuana smoker, and had experimented with mushrooms, ecstasy, salvia, absinthe, lotus and passionflower among others.",
      "I got my first taste of opiates the same way most people do, through legitimate medical use. All four of my wisdom teeth had been taken out and they gave me a bottle of tylenol 3s (Im pretty sure they were 30 milligrams of codeine each and a ton of the aspirin or whatever). I was supposed to take two of them three times a day till the bottle ran out. I was honestly quite shocked. Here was a doctor giving me opiates, which I knew were addictive, and his first advice was to take a couple pills three times daily till I ran out (I think it was a four day scrip). Thanks doc, no wonder people get addicted to this shit. Just for interests sake I said What if I run out and my mouth is still hurting? To which I got the reply Oh, just phone us up and well get you a refill. If my jaw didnt hurt so much it would have dropped at this point. Sure, why not hand out more opiates? Its not like their dangerous or anything. I was pretty spaced out the first day taking the codeine, and on the third day I discovered the joy and wonder induced by smoking a bowl about an hour after my evening dose of T3s. I never called up for a second prescription and that was pretty much the end of my opiate usage for a few years.",
      "The summer when I was 19 years of age there was a bumber crop of poppies. Beautiful poppies in all different colours, red and pink and some with purple centers. The pods ranged in size from the smallest marble-heads to golf-ball sized monstrosities. It seemed I could not walk down an alley without coming across some flowering specimens of Papaver somniferum to be admired, often growing wild in waste lots and gravelly soil. There were five readily accessible poppy patches within five minutes walk of my house. Having all these poppies around raised quite a dilemma for me. There was a big difference in my mind between taking a pharmaceutical pill to get high and partaking of a psychoactive plant to get high. The plant has a spirit and I guess I just felt more comfortable experimenting with a plant than little white pills. Opium has always intrigued me somewhat too, knowing that so many famous writers and artists in the 19th century had used this substance. As I child I had read of opium dens in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and in Vernes classic Around The World in Eighty Days. All of this made me very curious.",
      "On the other hand, I was scared of trying opium, scared of getting addicted as soon as I tried it. I had read about heroin and how strong the rush was, and I was worried that opium would be like that, so good that I would not want to live without it. Then I told myself, man, youre just being stupid. No drug could possibly be that good. I trusted my ability to sample opium and withdraw unscathed. So I took a knife blade and gently sliced a few poppies. A thick white juice (the latex  when dried gives raw opium) oozed out from the cutmarks. I smeared the juice on a rolling paper and made it into an opiated joint.",
      "When smoked, this had a very interesting effect. It was kind of like the very early days of getting stoned, when the high would get very intense. I felt completely relaxed, calm and mellow. There seemed an extra visual sparkle to things. The high was very dreamy and enjoyable. The taste of the raw opium was quite remarkable. Nothing would be felt or tasted on the inhalation, but as I exhaled a delicate flowery perfume would fill my mouth and nostrils. I experienced no real comedown from the opium, and I felt no after effects in the next days, most importantly no craving.",
      "Well what were they talking about? I said to myself. Opium doesnt seem as addictive as they say, at least not in the smoke it once and youll be hooked forever way they always warned us about. So I began to indulge from time to time in a little bit of opium, usually smearing the fresh juice from the poppies directly onto a rolling paper or marijuana buds. I quickly discovered that the latter technique, dabbing the white latex onto green weed and then immediately smoking it in a bowl, was a far more effective method of using the opium than when smoking it on the paper of a joint, which seemed to waste much of the opium. I began to really enjoy adding just a touch of opium to a bowl of weed to heighten the effects. It was weird, because after a time the opium was no longer getting me significantly higher anymore, or higher in a more enjoyable way, than weed alone would. But for some reason I just found the whole experience of weed and opium so much more rewarding and enjoyable.",
      "It didnt seem like that extra edge of relaxation and calm was really worth the danger of addiction. I began to worry when I was no longer going more than a few days, a week at most, without smoking a bit of opium. Sometimes I would even smoke it two or three days in a row, an action which I knew with absolute faith was profoundly stupid, the quickest way to lead to addiction. There was something enormously compelling, I now realized, about opium. I began to understand. It is not that amazing of a feeling really, but once youve gotten the taste for it for some reason it becomes linked very closely with the feeling of satisfaction in the brain. I wont be satisfactorily high unless my pot is laced with opium. Bizarre thinking like that. I would always feel like adding a little bit of opium to a bowl of weed, and often had to struggle not to. It was so easy, since all I had to do was take a little jaunt and collect a few poppies.",
      "As the opium high itself was becoming less enjoyable I began noticing the beginning signs of withdrawal. After smoking opium consecutively on two or three days I would panic, and make myself stop. I really was at all times aware and concerned that the substance I was smoking was addictive. It would be truly foolish to get addicted when I knew better, I kept telling myself. I would feel okay on the first day, then the second day I would start fiending a bit, desiring to smoke an opium laced bowl. On the third day I would begin feeling a bit sad and depressed, and this feeling would intensify on the fourth and fifth days, gradually easing after that.",
      "I knew the opium was messing with my emotions. Sometimes I would cry for no reason (other than it having been a few days since my last poppy adventure), and I often felt feelings of sadness and depression out of the blue. Sometimes my body would ache, like I was perpetually overtired, and I would feel like I was just beginning to get a cold. After five or six or seven days I usually felt okay again, and would even question whether what I had been experiencing in the previous days was related to the opium. Maybe I was getting sick, I would say to myself. And so with the temptation all around me I would end up taking another poppy, gently slicing open its flesh and pouring the milky white venom onto my innocent marijuana flowers. As soon as I felt that sweet perfume when exhaling I would feel simulataneous exultant relief and bliss, and a nagging feeling that everything I was doing was wrong, that I was digging myself into some kind of hole.",
      "There was really a week or two that ended the whole thing. It was late august, and I began to come to terms with the fact that I would have to drastically reduce my opium consumption in the near future. I had made a rule never to seek out or buy any other opiates, I would hold it to the poppies and nothing else. I made up a stash of 12 opium-smearing rollies, with the idea of rationing them, a one-per-month limit. I managed to smoke about six of them within the week. I decided I really needed to stop. Same routine, but the withdrawal effects (now that I recognized what they were) were gradually getting more noticeable. There was also this experience I had, which kind of scared me.",
      "I had started vapourizing little bits of opium resin with a hot knife (like one would do with hash or oil), as this produced a very strong rush after just one or two hits. This time I had a freshly sliced poppy, and I vapourized a big amount of the latex and inhaled it all. It immediately blasted me into this space where I lost contact for a moment with the outside world. It was a powerful, heavy rush. Up till this point I had no idea opium could give such an incredibly fast and strong distortion of reality. It was almost like taking a hit of salvia in a way. The main impression I brought back from this short-lived rush was that of an overwhelmingly sticky sweet feeling. The flavour and taste of the opium were burned vividly in my mind by this experience.",
      "When coming out of this opium trance state I noticed that my body had unconsciously taken the initiative, and thrown the opium poppy heads far away from me. There was a feeling that I had then of pure evil and malignance in the juice of the poppies. I think it was really this experience that broke my addiction. After this my desire not to smoke opium was finally stronger than my (still early stages of) addiction and withdrawal symptoms. The first week was pretty tough, the second week easier, and sometime after the third week opium just passed out of my consciousness. A month or two passed and I realized, hey, I havent smoked any opium in a long time!",
      "All in all I consider myself pretty lucky. I dabbled too much, too deeply in the flower of joy and am fortunate I got away with it. I was saved because poppies are a seasonal thing, because I tripped myself out vapourizing the stuff, and because I knew deep down that these beginnings of withdrawal symptoms meant the opium use had to stop. I have used opium since then, however I always leave three or four months between uses to ensure there is no chance of addiction, and I always use very small doses. I would not recommend trying this plant, the high is enjoyable but honestly marijuana is more enjoyable and does not have the same addictive properties and terrible withdrawal symptoms as opium does."

      "This is really a corrollary to Jetsam's 2C-T-7 report (see Malleable Hallucinations), an experience for which I served as a sitter. I'm writing it because I observed very carefully her physiological response during the first 30 to 40 minutes and noted what I believe to be predictable patterns, for the same timing has held for myself and others I've witnessed.",
      "I weighed out 7mg of powder for Jetsam which she split between both nostrils. The burn hit her hard. Following is a minute-by-minute account of my observations of her condition:",
      "At 3 minutes she was flushed, perspiring, and her eyes were well dilated. It was obviously quite an intense coming up.",
      "At 5 minutes she began having muscle tremors. She seemed to plateau at this point for a minute or two.",
      "At 8 minutes she began showing signs of real discomfort. She curled up into a ball and asked that I hold her hand. I took her pulse; it was faint and accellerated.",
      "Between the 9th and 10th minute was her first indication of any nausea. She asked for water. I began to get a little concerned, for Jetsam is a highly experienced psychonaut who's handled a *lot* of hairy situations and here she was having what appeared to be a particularly difficult time of it. I was extremely relieved having done nothing myself so that I could monitor her progress.",
      "By the 11 minute point, she was visibly wincing and having muscle contractions, predominantly in her legs (from outward appearances).",
      "By 15 minutes, she was full bore into the experience and was clearly having difficulty assessing her situation. I helped her into the bathroom after she indicated she was feeling the need to vomit.",
      "At 18 minutes she had a massive purge. I've seen Jetsam vomit plenty, but this was more than I'd ever seen her expel. The duration of each expulsion worried me -- fluid would flow for 1-3 seconds. I immediately recognized the serious possibility of asphyxiation from such prolific puke.  This is a real danger which should be anticipated by anyone insufflating this substance. Have a sitter with you when you snort this stuff!! And especially right there with you if you have to throw up.",
      "By 25 minutes, things were settling in. Once things leveled out, we had a great time. You can read her report for the rest of the story."

    "report": [
      "To start, I would like to compare/contrast the effects of cocaine and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Ritalin is without question (in my opinion) more similar to cocaine than any other pharmaceutical agent.",
      "I have definitely ingested more than my fair share of drugs in my lifetime.  I won't bother attempting to compile a list.  I simply want to share my experiences with Ritalin, and compare the substance to cocaine and perhaps amphetamines.",
      "I did my fair share of Adderall during high school- I had a friend prescribed to 20 mg a day, but refused to take it.  His mother would do her best to monitor his use, but he was skilled at hiding the pills between his fingers.  These pills were diverted to me.  Wow, I must have ADHD, as I am straying very far from the subject I am attempting to report on.  I have a long history of substance abuse.  Started with weed when I was 15, and quickly blossomed into ingestion of whatever was around.  At least I can say I never smoked crack or did PCP.",
      "Back to the point.  I have done numerous drugs intravenously.  Among these are (surprise) cocaine and methylphenidate.  IV cocaine acts immediately, and the effects wear off within 15-25 minutes.  IV methylphenidate takes about 30 seconds or so to 'kick in', and the effects last much, MUCH longer.  The experience of the latter substance goes through 3 (perhaps 4) phases. ",
      "1. At first, an intense opiate-like euphoria presents itself.  This lasts for about 5-10 minutes. ",
      "2. After this, the stimulant effects become much more prominent.  For about an hour and half rather intense stimulation of the mind is very prevalent. I may have the strength/desire to accomplish certain things, but the tasks that come to mind are overwhelmingly intellectual rather than physical. ",
      "3. After this 'peak' phase (i.e. the comedown), dry mouth presents itself and tension of the jaw muscles becomes very noticeable. Chewing on a fingertip can greatly alleviate the clenching effect.  Although I am still stimulated (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), the euphoric effects drastically decline.  In a way, it is similar to coming down off of cocaine.  Similar, but not nearly as serious.  Due to the much longer half-life of methylphenidate, the 'immediate withdrawal' experienced from cocaine usage is not present.  I can recall using cocaine, and after the night's supply was depleted, my subconscious would literally cross over to my conscious train of thought and more or less cry for more.  With methylphenidate, the comedown can be unpleasant- but this crossing over between levels of consciousness, as far as my experience goes, is virtually absent.  My body does not beg for more, but it doesn't exactly reject the thought.  I believe the longer half-life is the driving force behind the absence of overwhelming psychological craving.",
      "4. Definitely can cause/contribute to insomnia.  Depression will more than likely present itself, likely due to the depletion of dopamine.  Jaw clenching will remain- an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl)/dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) can help to alleviate the insomnia and jaw tension. ",
      "Having injected both drugs (cocaine and methylphenidate), I can say that methylphenidate produces a much more pleasurable and lasting experience.  My experiences with it have resulted in very memorable social interactions.  The high from IV cocaine, as intense as it is (probably the most intense 'buzz' I have ever experienced), is extremely short-lived and is basically equivalent to kissing death on the face.  No other substance has caused me to wake up wondering where the hell I am, with a syringe still in my arm and an accompanying trail of blood.",
      "IV use of 40 mg methylphenidate was a rather pleasant experience, and I would be likely to repeat it if given the opportunity.  This is my approximate timetable.",

      "This all started during the summer of '05.  I was completely and utterly addicted to coke during that summer, and after spending nearly $700 on an ounce that dissappeared in a week, I knew that I needed to quit.  August of that year, my friend, we'll call him Hunts, came down from Boston University for his summer vacation.  Apparently, he had been using heavily as well.  In order to help myself deal with the incessant cravings, I called my friend Joe looking for some norcos or klonopin.  He was out, but he had some oxy, and at $10 for a 40 mg pill, it was cheap and affordable.  I bought two to start.  He told me to scrape the coating off and snort 'em, which I did.  I felt totally collected and invincible, like I could walk out into the street and stop a speeding car with my hand.  I kicked myself for ever doing coke in the first place.  That night, I snorted both pills in about an hour and a half.",
      "The next day I hit Joe up again and asked if I could get a couple more.  When he told me that he has 220 left in his script for that month, I cheered and bought ten.  That night, with my coke withdrawal a fleeting memory, I joined my brother B and we drove down to a party being held by some friends.  We were both pretty stoned, as we were both still green at that point.  When we got to the party, I asked the owner of the house, named G, if I could do up a line.  When he saw the oxy, he just about exploded with happiness.  He asked me how much one would be, and I told him that it would run him about $30 per.  I was hoping that the price would be way too high for him and deter him from buying any, but to my surprise, he produced $120.  Little did I know that this small transaction would change my life forever.",
      "The next day, B and I went back to Joes and bought another 12 oxys with G's money.  We each did a 40 and I headed out to G's house again.  I asked him if he knew if anybody else would be interested in buying, and he gave me a hearty yes.  For the rest of that summer, I would buy 20 40mg pills for $200 and resell half of them for $30 apiece.  Not only was I able to do however many oxys I wanted, but I was actually making money off of it, which I usually spent on more oxys for me and my brother. ",
      "Cut to January of next year.  I was up to about 200-300mg a day, and B wasn't too far behind.  Joe was running out of his script in about two weeks now, and for the first time, I experienced withdrawal.  Complete and utter pain.  I had been using upwards of 100mg daily for about 5 months now, so when I ran out, it hit me like a train.  I couldn't function for over a week.  I would rarely eat, as anything I consumed was almost immediately evacuated back out again.  Sleeping was next to impossible.  I would shuffle off to sleep, only to be awoken minutes later, my body dripping with sweat and my body crying out for drugs.  I had the most horrible diarrhea, and many an hour was spent sitting on the toilet crying and spasming while I spewed stomach acid out of my mouth. ",
      "As soon as Joe got his script refilled, I bought half of 'em immediately and snorted two.  While explaining my two week absence to Joe, he mentioned that I would only have to do 40mg or so each time if I slammed (injected) it.  I have a horrible fear of needles and at first declined, but when B offered to inject it for me, I hesitantly accepted.\r[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.]",
      "Joe could not be more right.  Not only did I need to do less, but the feeling came on immediately, the high slamming into me like a wave that refused to subside.  I quickly lost my fear, traded my half cc syringe in for a 3 cc one (thank you needle exchange) and began shooting up three or four times daily.  It only took about a month for me and B to get back up to our usual dosage of 300mg a day, and what with our combined use and countless hungry customers calling, Joe began to run out early again.  This time I found another connect, who could provide me with 80mg pills for $30 and our habit continued, unabashed.",
      "I believe it was in August of 06 that it all came crashing down.  We had traveled to a party in Irvine that night, and upon entering I immediately started pushing.  After selling what I wanted to let go of, B and I sat down and began doing lines.  I hadn't had time to go to the needle exchange that week, and my needle had become dull and painful to use.  I used some of my profit to buy a gram of blow, and I mixed the whole thing into the pile of powder that was already there. ",
      "Evidently, some partygoers arrived late, and more than one of them was a bit miffed when I declined to sell more of my supply.  One of these people, a kid of about 18 or 19, became belligerent and began telling me tall tales of all the drugs he'd done and the ridiculous amounts he had taken at once.  I was very high on oxy, but the coke was very pure, and I could feel an ugly energy coursing through my brain.  Coke had always made me sort of impatient and petty, sometimes downright mean, but it had been a long time since I'd used, and the high must have been more evident than I predicted.  I remember saying 'You're a big boy, act like one,' before cutting him out a huge line. ",
      "The kid looked taken aback, but he had a reputation to upkeep.  He snatched the straw I handed him and did the whole line, sharing it between nostrils.  For some reason, this infuriated me.  I was planning on him pussing out, but now that he'd done the line, it was like he was challenging me.  I quickly cut out another, much to Bs' protest, and practically threw the straw at the kid.  Again, I could sense some hesitation in him, but he regained himself and once again snorted the entire line.  Just as quickly, I cut out another.",
      "Stupid move.  When you put two ultra competitive males blitzed on coke together, expect bad results.  I could tell that he didn't want to do the third line.  I was sure that his nostrils were clogged with powder, that he would concede defeat after that second line.  I was wrong.  The kid began to do up the line, but halfway through, he stopped.  He sneezed, spraying the rest of the rail all over the table.  I went to protect the rest of my pile from more errant sneezes, but when the kid began to cough up blood, I knew that my drugs would be the least of my worries.  Apparently, this kid was an avid oxy abuser, but he had never used coke before.  Turns out he was allergic.  Very allergic.  It took three of us to get him into the bathroom as he was convulsing and vomiting all over.  After cleaning him up a little, I threw him into my car and rocketed over to the hospital. ",
      "I nearly drove my car straight through the emergency room door in my haste.  I got out and pulled the kid out of the backseat.  I threw his limp body onto the ground and jumped across the hood to make my speedy escape.  As I ran to the car, my stomach lurched and I fell to the ground, vomit exploding out of my mouth.  My head began to swim, and I swayed there for a few moments before crumbling to the floor, hitting my head on my side mirror as I went down.",
      "Overdose.  I had no idea how much I had done, but B later estimated it to be upwards of 450mg.  The coke had kept the oxy high retrained, but as it wore off, the opiate high began to kick it into high gear.  My diaphram had collapsed, crushing my lungs.  It was lucky that I was close to the emergency room at the time.  After a dose of anti-narcotics, I woke up immediately on the table.  I sat up and immediately began throwing up before I passed out again.  It was determined by the staff that I had driven the kid to the ER before I collapsed myself.  Apparently, I had saved both of our lives.  The kid couldn't remember much of what had happened that week, let alone what had happened that night, and in my fear, I went with a very tame version of the story, keeping that nights events to that of just another unlucky partygoer.  My brothers statement is probably what kept me from getting in real trouble, as he gave the police almost the exact same story that I did.",
      "I may be stubborn, but I'm not stupid.  I got off very easy for what I had done, and although I feel awful for almost killing another human being, I would never had quit if this event had not occurred.  I was placed into a rehab program by my parents after leaving the ICU, and I've been clean for some time now.  I won't go into what the withdrawals were like again, but rest assured, they came back with a vengence.  Now most of my time is spent trying to keep off oxy, trying to keep busy.  I do a lot of volunteering now, partly as a way of keeping my mind off of drugs, but mostly as a form of repentance for wasting my life for two years."

      "This story is about my first time trying mushrooms, and the positive/negative experiences that followed.",
      "Part I: Starting Out",
      "The evening started out in our dorm, around 6pm. It was my first experience with mushrooms, and I was pretty excited about it. I was tripping with a fairly interesting and experienced group of guys, 8 in all. Most had shroomed at least once, some over 5 times. Overall, we were a diverse mix of personalities, and I was anticipating a pretty crazy time. We had planned to just relax and walk around throughout the trip. After eating about 3.5-3.8 grams each, followed by some orange juice, we departed from our room and headed for the campus quad.",
      "At this point, Id like to make a brief note. I decided to chase the mushrooms with a particularly large and delicious burrito, which turned out to be the worst idea of the night. Youll find out why a little later.",
      "Part II: Up on the Roof",
      "So we headed across the quad. It was a really pleasant fall evening, around 65 degrees. We crossed the campus giggling and laughing, although we all knew the drugs hadnt kicked in yet. We passed some friends, who we laughed at for a bit, much to their chagrin.",
      "At our school, the library has a spacious roof, with a terrific view, that has become a well-known smoking spot for many students. We had decided to just chill up there for a while and watch the sunset/city. At this point, about 30 mins into the trip, I wasnt feeling anything yet. After sitting in the grass on the roof for a while, we began to laugh and talk, and after about 10 mins, I started feeling a little dizzy and elongated. I started looking at the faced of my friends, who were obviously tripping by now, and their eyes and mouths seemed colorful, bulging and exaggerated. I turned back towards the sky and city, which were the most beautiful things I had ever seen.",
      "Clouds and vapor trails from planes seemed to continue infinitely in all directions. I felt as though the sunset was a part of me, and I distinctly remember feeling as though we were all surrounded by a giant dome, on which all these colors and forms were changing and moving. Looking at the city felt so good and so right, almost as if watching was an activity in itself, like reading or biking. Every light and building seemed to glow separately. Looking around, I noticed that the concrete and grass top of the roof seemed to stretch in all directions like a giant plain. My friends were all wandering about in small groups pointing things out to each other. The seemed miles away, or sometimes extremely close.",
      "At this point, I started feeling a little sick from the Mexican. My stomach was churning, and when I tried to sit and relax, my friends voices and other noises seemed to reverberate and echo uncontrollably in my head. I quietly told one of my friends about my condition, and he just stared at me. But I was feeling worse by the minute. Without thinking, I ran down the steps and into the library.",
      "I sprinted down hallways and through rooms, noticing how the angularity of the walls seemed to cause a caving-in sensation wherever I ran. I felt like people were glaring at me from all around. Finally I made it to the basement bathroom. It was about an hour and 20 mins since I had taken the shrooms, and I had the Fear. I leaned against the mirror, noticing my own bulging and bloodshot eyes. Horror. This was the bad trip that I had heard about, and I finally panicked and jammed my fingers down my throat. I ended up booting all over the wall, completely missing the toilet! But afterwards, I felt so purged and cleansed, that I washed my face and returned to my friends as though nothing had happened. I decided not to tell them about my little breakdown, or the pile of puke left in the bathroom.",
      "Part III: The Walk and The House",
      "Around this time, about 1.5 hours from the beginning, I began to feel as though I needed to be somewhere else. My friend actually told me the next day that I had turned to him and said the winds of fate are drawing us to the house or something like that. We decided to split into groups and walk to our frat house. It was starting to get dark at this time. The walk back was my peak of happiness of the night. The campus looked so scenic and mysterious. Lights shone through tree leaves, and I kept thinking I was in some kind of fairy world. Everything was so pretty. We walked and talked, for what seemed like hours, but was actually no more than 15 mins. When we finally got to the house, beers were there to greet us.",
      "I distinctly remember walking up the stairs inside the houseall of us bumping into each other, talking loudly, changing directions, all this played out against the eggshell white sheen of the wallsand thinking that this moment seemed to me like the perfect album cover. Anyway, we eventually made it into someones room, where we all sat down and lounged, smoking hookah and drinking beerstypical frat stuff. Enclosed in this perfectly square room, I felt like we were in a time capsule miles underground. We began (crappily, but with great enthusiasm) discussing philosophy, science and the past.",
      "In terms of psychological effects at this stage, I had this amazing feeling that I understood everything in the universe, and that this master plan made complete sense. It seemed to me that if it was possible for me to experience my surroundings in the way that I could at the time, what would stop me from always being able to reach this new level of reality? Time also became a nonexistent or at least unfixed notion, which slowed and quickened at no logical or predictable interval. This part of my trip was by far the most enlightening, nearly 2.5 hours after ingestion. It seemed that mushrooms had loosened my ability to connect conventional meanings to everyday objects and principles. I was discovering everything for the first time, and everything made complete sense. The things I and my friends had been saying about the nature of life seemed extremely important and unquestionably true.",
      "After about 30 more minutes, we all started coming down, which was a strange experience that I cant compare to anything else Ive ever felt. It seemed neither good nor bad, neither pleasurable nor uncomfortable. We started drinking heavily, and I never had a change to be completely sober after the trip. But the rest of the night proceeded in the usually drunken fashion.",
      "The next day, I felt unusually happy and pleased with everything, and I didnt have any negative hangover effects at all.",
      "Conclusion",
      "Overall, shrooming was a pleasurable and enlightening experience that allowed me to reach mental states that Ive never before achieved. It was also a fucking laugh riot at times, and very beautiful at others. Im looking forward to doing them again soon, but perhaps in a slightly lesser dosage."

      "Last spring, I rolled frequently with my boyfriend and my old friend Ms. X.  Once, at her apartment in Philadelphia, we rinsed out a LSD vial I had recently finished.  We all ended up tripping on about 500 mics each. [Erowid Note: estimations of microgram dosages of LSD are usually baseless.]",
      "Ms. X is a devout Catholic.  Her beliefs came to play a major role in how she responded to the dose of LSD.  She found herself play-acting as the Christian devil, daring me to look out the window and give up my soul to her. ",
      "I belong to a goddess-centered, non-Christian, church and I did not take part in her spiritual experience (my spirit guides, who at the time were visible to me, made it clear that I was not to participate).  We later talked about the Christian concept of 'sin' and how this idea motivated her to use self-destructive behavior to test her own faith.",
      "A few months later, we were in Toronto for my birthday.  We smuggled a few decent ecstasy pills and some 5-MeO-DMT across the border in order to party in my hotel room.  We were rolling quite hard, blanketed by chemical love, when we smoked the 5-MeO-DMT.  While my boyfriend did not have a peak experience, I was reasonably saturated and found time moving very slowly. ",
      "Ms. X was unfamiliar with the substance and her only prior strong psychedelic trip was the aforementioned LSD.  Upon smoking about 15 mg. of the powder, she began to think that she was dying and tried to climb out a 17th story hotel room window.  She later told me that she felt her soul leave her body and had an intense religious experience concerning death.  I physically restrained her from committing suicide and when she returned to her body she started vomiting in the bathroom.",
      "Again, her Catholic beliefs about guilt and sin became crucial to the effects she felt.  I talked with her, held her and encouraged her to let the fear she was experiencing leave her body.  When she stopped vomiting, she became euphoric and started talking about how there was really a cure for cancer (a close relative of hers had died of the disease a long time ago). ",
      "While I had a pleasant birthday, the experience of smoking the 5-MeO-DMT while rolling was clearly very intense for her.  About a month later, I was coldly informed by Ms. X that she no longer wished to have any contact with me or my boyfriend.  She felt that we did not respect her religious preference and had basically been threatening her on a psychic level.  It became clear that my lack of participation in the Christian oriented scenes she experienced while on strong doses of psychedelics had led her to become paranoid about our friendship.  We talked with her, and tried to communicate our care and respect for her, but there has been no further contact.",
      "I have given drugs to many people in the hope that they would help pull them out of certain head traps in the way that they have helped me, and have some experience with guiding individuals through strong trips.  However, last year I had both this experience and a similar ones involving the use of MDMA, 2CB, AMT, DPT, 5-Me0-DMT, 5-Me0-DiPT and large amounts of cannabis in which old friends of mine with pronounced, unconscious Christian beliefs determined that I was trying to invade their spiritual privacy and there was another suicide attempt. ",
      "I have never attempted to alter the religious preferences of my friends in any way, psychically or otherwise.  In both cases, the crucial factor in the extreme behavior of the affected people was my not participating in specifically Christian scenes that came to them while under the influence of strong psychedelics.  I believe that it is inappropriate to take part in spiritual behavior one does not understand and I have no knowledge of or participation in Christianity. ",
      "I am just writing to bring to the attention of the community how large doses of unfamiliar psychedelics can bring young people (we were all between 18 and 22) into very specifically religious settings.  If you are one of those people who find yourselves experiencing strong religious visions while under the influence of psychedelics, as hard as this may be to remember, please do not assume that your supplier knew that the chemical would create that reality for you.  I did not even know what the religious practices of these people were other than generic labels such as 'Catholic' or 'hippie' when I gave them these drugs.  I lost a wonderful friend in Ms. X and my landlady was almost informed by the other, unconsciously Christian, friends that I used LSD.",
      "My conclusion from these experiences is that there is an intrinsic conflict some believers of the Christian religions find between their chosen religious path and the use of strong doses of psychedelics in non-Christian settings.  I have not seen a similar conflict in people of other faiths on strong doses of psychedelics."

      "Initially I did McKenna's Heroic Dose, five dried grams orally masticated, but found this to be too strong to bring back coherent information, it rather served as an initiation for my contact experiences.  I had done Psilocybe before, and had experiences of lethargy, as well as strong visual imagination, what I thought seemed to swim before me.  The degree my trips were affected by McKenna's theories concerning psilocybin is notable, his thoughts encouraged me to seek out this entity.  I found it.   All experiences discussed here were conducted alone.",
      "So, I have had about 4 trips, conducted one year ago to date, after the initial initiation.  My initiation on new years eve 2005-2006 was phenomenol, but only the opener.  I said hello as I felt them come on, and it just said, turn over so I can fuck you.  Then I blacked out and proceeded through the most intense horriying events of my life.  It showed me everything I was afraid of and then some.  It left me alone in hyperspace, where I was found by something that knew I wasn't supposed to be there, and tried to destroy me, I am alive, and I don't know why.  I am still struggling to understand this experience even as I write now.  I am certain, however, that this horrifying experience was an initiatory hazing, to prepare me for my relationship.",
      "The remaining experiments were conducted with a ginseng tea concoction.  I ingest 1-3 grams of psilocybe mushrooms mixed with chopped ginseng in a tea.  My theory is the ginseng opens bloods vessels and increases blood flow to the brain, bringing on the trip and making it more intense.",
      "The first was wonderful, my body rose like a beam of light into the atmosphere and off earth.  I moved through space, I flew past a hole of some kind, and an entity tried to lure me towards it, but I avoided it and moved on, it was like a trap-door spider.  Then I sat inside a Nebula, that was like heaven, except not so monochromatic as traditional visions of heaven.  The nebula shone and shimmered a thousand colours, it was spectacular.  I returned to earth, and decided to visit this girl, who later became my lover, and we are together as I write this.  I came down and her street sort of loaded, components of it coming together in time until it was complete and I was on her lawn.  I flew to the window where she was sleeping and woke her up, I didn't go through the window, but just waved and said hello.  She experienced this, and called on me the next day!  She was dreaming and saw me surrounded by 'little friends' in her room, now, she says I gave her a message, but I suspect it was the mushroom that gave her the message.  That was my first trip, the mushroom didn't talk this time.",
      "The second trip came on with chills and sweats.  Perplexed, I asked the Mushroom, why are you doing this to me!?  It said, 'To create the conditions in your body which I enjoy in life.'  Makes sense, warm and humid, gotcha mushroom.  Then I asked why it enjoyed those conditions.  Away I went, as though answering me, it placed me in orbit around a planet.  Solid green atmosphere, no polar caps I can recall, but I won't discount the speculation.  Then I was on the surface.  It was rocky and the air was THICK enough to walk on (not literally) and somehow I could see strange forms of life slowly moving around, strange slugs, flora that resembled slugs, and very large mushrooms.  It told me, 'The microbial oceans which support the ecology on earth, are here suspended in the atmosphere.  Microbes float around in the thick atmosphere and land upon these rocks, supporting the ecosystem here.  This is where I evolved.'  I am still recalling some aspects of this tour, particularly a biological mechanism that shot spores and rock into space, possibly a geyser exploited for this purpose.  At any rate, I was back in my body, and it said, 'I have two tickets to outer space!' in a very playful manner.  I declined this time, as I could feel the trip receding.  It continued giving me fun visuals as it slowly faded.",
      "The third trip was different.  I asked to see it, and I began a dream-like journey um, inside it.  The landscapes I encountered, whether psychic, or actually physical, or some combination, were very strange.  They seemed constructed with intent, but constructed not of inert matter, constructed entirely of the mushrooms self.  Whether I had been shrunk down, or just entered a vastly enormous mushroom, this is the impression the landscape gave.  Everything was very grandiose, and had a fleshy, living texture.  Seemed to give way a little under me, like walking on a water bed.  It also seemed vaguely floral, stairways that looked like stamens, or some fungal equivalent, basidium, mycelial veils occasionally.  After wandering around for a long while in this wonderland.  I asked if I could see aliens.  I was whisked away by a guide of some kind and plopped into a strange environment.",
      "I sat atop a creature which appeared like a brontosaurus, with short neck, and no head to speak of.  This creature was lumbering, um, quickly, through a jungle.  As I watched the jungle, various species stepped from the jungle, and this bronto seemed to relay information about whatever species I gazed upon, at a fantastic pace.  I must have seen a thousand races.  The most memorable in my mind was an upright standing blue bird-like creature posing with a spear and looking very shaman-like, necklaces and feathers.  I knew that I was inside of an archive, and the brontosaurus was the 'librarian'.",
      "Those are my trips.  I have put the mushrooms aside for some time now, and chewed over these experiences, sharing them with peers whose input has been frugal, I live in rural Canada, there is no psychedelic culture here, only petty pathetic drug abusers.  The internet has been some solace for me, but it is still hard to come together for a cause digitally."

      "So like most people I was pretty skeptical of yoga. I mean it appears to be... I don't know, slow, feminine and gentle what's that going to do for me?",
      "Regardless, I had begun losing weight like crazy and I had tried many different types of exercise. I mean I got into everything, including but not limited to kickboxing, running, walking, jogging, weight-training, tumbling and calisthenics. I was shedding the pounds and just getting used to and loving my new thin frame. So of course I wanted to keep this going.",
      "So I'm at the Sport's Authority or one of those places, and I decide to pick up a yoga video called Strength and Flexibility. This video has two sections with emphasis on different areas and so the first one I tried was the Flexibility one. I know I didn't execute all the poses properly, but I tried my best to follow along and I was physically able to do everything on the video.",
      "It was hard to 'go inward' and focus on my breath or gaze but for most of it I did this without trying, and even though I did catch myself thinking about things during some of it I mostly didn't. Then again I wasn't trying to meditate, which is much harder btw.",
      "Five minutes into it I began to sweat profusely. Not like I would when running on a treadmill, more like one or two beads of sweat rolling down my forehead aggresively. I didn't really notice it I mean it didn't bother me like it does when I'm doing cardio or something, but I noticed that I was sweating insanely and in a new way. I had the AC on in my apt and everything, it was a very nice and temperate setting.",
      "Towards the end it already started to calm me. In retrospect this could have been a placebo effect from when he said 'feel the nervous system quite from the forward bends' but whatever I felt good.",
      "I had a good, slight buzz but I wouldn't really call it that, for the next 20 minutes or so. I felt energized and yet calm and peaceful. I guess you could say I was 'centered'."

      "Since there isn't much information out there about DXM and Wellbutrin, I had no choice but to test it out myself. So one evening I took 150mg of DXM (10 x 15mg gelcaps), puncturing the capsules before I downed them. About 30-45 minutes after this I thought I felt noticably less inhibited, slowed, with a bit of ataxia, almost like being drunk but clearer in a way. My over-affectionate cat trotted into the room and began to throw herself at me. I found this significantly less annoying than usual. I felt very relaxed but that was the extent of it. Two hours later the experience hadn't changed and seeing as it was late and there was nothing to do I went to sleep.",
      "About an hour after falling asleep I woke up feeling very uneasy. There was a feeling of dread, but it wasn't a panic attack. I noticed that I was extremely dizzy at this point, although moving still felt good. A warm feeling pulsed in my body periodically, concentrated mostly in the back of my head and somewhat in the bottom of my legs. This was not a pleasant feeling at all, my head almost felt like it was on fire. I was sweating a lot also, and shaking. This really worried me, but I tried to lay back and calm myself down, thinking that this was a low dose and it would be over in a few hours. This helped some, along with having some water, and I was able to get a VERY broken sleep, with symptoms gradually declining. I woke up about seven hours after taking the DXM, still dizzy, with dialated pupils and a headache. I don't think I'll be taking any more DXM, at least not while taking bupropion."

      "A little background information: I have been experimenting with opiates for a little over a year. It all started when I found out that my mom had a prescription for oxycodone 80mg and hydromorphone 8mg. I had experimented with both and found the oxycodone to be much more easily used recreationally. I do not like to inject. I tried it once when I was throughly fucked up, just don't like the idea, makes me feel like a heroin addict. So I tried snorting hydro every once in a while, but did not find it to be nearly as pleasurable of a high as snorting oxy. I became addicted to oxy for 2 month and got myself off. I now use opiates much more responsibly, knowing their darkside. Anyways.",
      "Today I tried a little experiment. I had a needle in possesion and was planning on trying the injection method for the hydro cause I wanted to feel her true strength. Fortunately (ACK NO INJECTING EVIL!!!) the needle bent and broke off acidently before I even got it ready. Now I just had a syringe with no top. That gave me an idea. I filled the syringe half way with water and then continued to crush an 8mg pill. I then poured it into the syringe and stuck the damn thing right up my arse and pressed it down. No I'm not gay, though after this experience...lol. Worried that the liquid would drain out, I pressed my back up against my bed so I was lying vertical upside-down.",
      "I did this for about 5 minutes (kept my head level as to not get head rush) until I felt a wonderful warmth start to spread from my anus, it slowly spread all across my body. Laying down I realized, 'Wow I feel fucking good! I love hydro!' So for all those adventurers who have access to hydromorphone in pill form but don't want to shot up, this method works WAY better than snorting or oral, fast and it's a FRIGGEN RUSH!"

      "Well, I recently came across a little AET, and I have been wanting to try this since I first read about it in TIHKAL. I never had a desire to experiment with AMT, even though it's been popular for quite some time, but AET seemed to call out to me... eventually, I answered back... by taking the 125mg in a capsule and awaiting the onset.",
      "I took the capsule at about 9:30pm, while I still had another hour and a half left to go at work. I figured by the time I left there I would be feeling it, and would then just take the quick ride home where I would lie around lazily listening to music and enjoying some euphoria of the tryptamine variety (my favorite type of euphoria!!).",
      "At 11:00 I went home, and was BARELY feeling it. I attribute this to having swallowed it in a gelcap, which was the intention anyway. By the time I got home, I was still not feeling it that much, but it was definitely there. I had a few swigs from a 12oz bottle of beer, just to kind of assuage the minor nervousness I was experiencing at trying out a new chemical.",
      "At approximately midnight, it hit me like a ton of bricks... I noticed that I was 'fucked up,' for lack of a better phrase. It was great! I completely understood why this drug has been compared to MDMA, from a physical standpoint, but emotionally it was nothing at all like MDMA, or any phenethylamine I've tried, for that matter. It started coming on like waves, literally. Just like watching a new set of waves come rolling in from the ocean, each set builds with more intensity until the surfable ones are there, and the fun builds to a crescendo. During this time, I couldn't help but notice how this drug was making me nod off, not at all unlike an opiate nod. It's very bizarre, to say the least!! Many tryptamines make me yawn and stuff, but I've never just sat there for hours on end, experiencing the tryptamine euphoria and nodding out at the same time.",
      "I also noticed just how horny this drug was making me, and how I just wanted to fuck fuck fuck. Of course, since I was trying out a new chemical by myself, that wasn't an option... so guess what? That's right, I tied one off!  It felt awesome, and the experience was extremely cathartic. I totally needed a cigarette after it was over, so I went outside and sat down on a patio chair while looking up at the night sky, enjoying how many stars were surprisingly visible in the Florida sky. At this point was when I noticed that the physical effects were starting to make some room for the mental and emotional effects to come on, and I have to be honest-- I DIDN'T LIKE THEM!",
      "First of all, I never had any sense of empathy, which I always experience on empathogens, even when alone. Like, I usually start getting introspective and empathizing with people in my life who aren't necessarily there with me, but it makes me think about how much I value the people in my life and that sort of thing... Nothing like that at all. It didn't cause me to have any epiphanies or revelations of any kind. It didn't cause me to want to call my sister and tell her how much I love her...",
      "Nope. All it did was make me PARANOID!!! All of a sudden I was finding myself thinking thoughts that hadn't come up from drugs in almost 10 years. Like, about how I don't deserve to be able to experiment with rare drugs, because I obviously don't experience them the way they were 'intended' to be experienced (I know, LOL at that, it's funny NOW, but at the time it broke my heart). I was thinking about how I don't deserve to be a moderator on a drug forum anymore for this reason, and I was TOTALLY gonna quit my position as soon as I came down. I didn't even realize that it was paranoia, either. While it was happening, it was like I discovered that I had been lying to myself all along, and AET was showing me the truth, which is funny because even 10 years ago when I had a paranoia trip on mushrooms, I at least knew I was being paranoid while it was happening. Not with this shit. It totally convinced me that it was revealing the truth to me, that I was a pawn in the Universe's game, and everyone, including everyone on the forum, from the admins on down to the noobs, have been playing a big joke on me.",
      "At any rate, I just kept sitting there on the patio, smoking cigarettes and allowing myself to believe that I was depressed, anxious, and paranoid. At about 5:00 in the morning, I was able to go to bed and drift off to sleep. When I woke up the next day, guess what? THE PARANOIA AND NEGATIVE THOUGHTS WERE STILL THERE!! I also had an ever-so-slight hangover-like feeling, but it only manifest itself as a headache and a little speediness. I took some tylenol for the headache, which totally took care of that, and then I smoked some pot for the hangover feeling. This definitely alleviated the yuck I was feeling, but I sat at my computer desk totally going over the thoughts that came up the night before, and still halfway believing them.",
      "I had to go to work that afternoon at my friend's recording studio to do some rough mixes, and I was completely unable/unwilling to go anywhere. I called him and told him I was going to have to reschedule for later that evening, and he started bitching at me about it... and I totally just raised my voice and laid into him through the phone. This is not like me at ALL. I am not confrontational by any means, and when I found myself actually raising my voice and being curt with him, it shocked me. When I finally got to his place that evening, the first thing I did was apologize to him and tell him I was battling a minor form of depression, and thanked him for giving me an opportunity to work with him and the producer and everyone. Being in that control room and getting lost in my mixing actually took my mind off of everything that isn't music, and I left there feeling reasonably good.",
      "When I woke up the next day, after a full night's sleep, I finally felt back to normal-- my happy, non-paranoid, non-anxious self. I was left only wondering if what I experienced was simply too high of a dose, or if AET just doesn't like me for whatever reason. I figured I would never EVER touch the stuff again, nor would I invite my new girlfriend to partake with me. Only now, a day later, am I actually telling myself that I simply took too much, and next time (if there will, in fact, BE a next time) I will simply take less.",
      "Overall, I really liked the character of the physical effects. I liked that bizarre nodding-out thing!!! It was like being relaxed at the same time as having all that crazy tryptamine energy. What a dichotomy! There was a little bit of minor nausea, but never enough that I felt the need to purge. I would just sit still and it passed. Music was slightly enhanced for me, but not to a large enough degree to list that as a primary effect. It was mostly just a euphoriant, to me. That is, until the dark spaces in my mind came out.",
      "Will I try this again? I honestly think, yes, I will, if any more comes around again. At about 75mg, probably. But if it causes me to think dark thoughts at that dose, I will write this one off for good. I am well aware that set and setting will always play a role in the experiences we receive from the tryptamines, and the phenethylamines, but I am generally a very positive person, who loves his life, loves his friends, loves his family, and certainly has no reason to be paranoid. So I know that it is simply an effect of the drug experience, and not some underlying mental bullshit that I have been repressing. I seriously have not experienced paranoia like that in a VERY long time, and back when I experienced it last, I definitely had reason to be paranoid and not like the conditions of my life.",
      "At any rate, would I recommend it to others? YES. I would. I do. My only advice is this: don't start off with 125mg, and definitely make sure you have a significant other around, because this shit is a goddamn APHRODISIAC!!!!",
      "That is all, for now"

After evaporation is complete, scrape off the brown, oily substance off the bottom of the pan. This is your usable extract, no other washes or clarification is required, as the tannin in the cloves is the active ingredient.",

First sensations are a heavy burning sensation, similar to eating a hot pepper.

      "A friend of mine has been prescribed Mirtazapine ('Zispin' brand), as an antidepressant, on and off over the last two years. He was initially prescribed 15mg tablets and is now on 30mg doses.",
      "Mirtazapine has a sedative effect and is normally taken before bedtime. As far as I know, my friend doesn't always take the pills and only really uses them as a sleep aid, as and when he needs them. He therefore doesn't normally mind sharing them with others if we have been out raving, taking stimulants, etc.",
      "We were on holiday recently and he gave me three doses, one to use that night, and another two to use later, because he was leaving the next day. I had taken a couple of the 15mg tablets a year or two ago and found them to be mildly sedating, in a similar way to lower strength benzodiazapines. The 30mg doses, however, produced much more pronounced and noticeable side effects.",
      "Dose 1:",
      "As I closed my eyes to go to sleep that night, I saw a rapid succession of dreamlike images, as though I was starting to dream without really being asleep yet, it took me ages to actually drop off, and when I did, I had a rather difficult and unhappy dream. When I awoke the next day I was groggy and uncoordinated. I was also shaking - I had been drinking rather excessively in the preceding days, however, and put this down to the alcohol that I had consumed. I felt very constipated that day as well, although I didn't attribute this to the mirtazapine at that point.",
      "Dose 2:",
      "I took the second tablet that evening, an hour before going to bed. This time the pre-dream images were more intense and disturbing. It took me ages to actually get to sleep, because of the images that would suddenly pop into my head. I had another very dark dream in which I became lucid. Lucid dreams are rare for me. I remember trying my hardest to wake up by pinching myself and ringing my hands. When I did 'wake up', I woke up into another dream. When I woke up for real I made the decision to end my holiday and go home that day. The mirtazapine hangover seemed to last all day. I felt exhausted, as though I hadn't actually had any proper sleep that night. The constipated feeling continued.",
      "Dose 3:",
      "Once I arrived home I decided to go to bed early that night so I could get a proper sleep. I decided not to take the third hit of mirtazapine and try to sleep unaided. This proved to be impossible. This is very hard to explain...I was dreaming vividly, but felt as though I was still awake...It was as though my body wouldn't allow me to reach a deep state of sleep. After four hours of this, I gave in and took the mirtazapine. I had to work the next day and felt terrible all day...it truly did feel as if I had been awake for days...I also had a terrible craving for unhealthy foods which I normally don't eat. This continued for yet another day, to the point where I almost had a full-blown panic attack at work and had to go home early.",
      "It is now three days since I took the third tablet and my mood, appetite and sleeping pattern are almost back to normal. I wouldn't recommend mirtazapine to be used recreationally, or as a a sleep aid, by people who haven't been prescribed it, especially at higher doses. I certainly wouldn't recommend abusing it for more than one day consecutively. I've had benzodiazepine hangovers before, but this was worse...bear in mind that I was only taking the stated dose - one tablet a day at bedtime."

      "T+ 0:00 Inserted tab in my lower lip. I did not taste the tab unless I touched the tab w/ my tongue. Very bitter.",

      "T+ 1:00 Holy shit. Everything a extremely bright, and seeing patterns flashing before my eyes. When I stare at something it would look like it would dry out and there would be more detail from just staring at the concrete. I decided to leave the cemetery and ride my bike around my neighborhood.",
      "T+ 1:30 I am very sweaty, so I head to my house where the A/C is on full blast and I drink some iced tea. Everything has a slight chemical after taste. I lay on my bed, and my ceiling, TV, posters, and walls are turning blue and every inch of anything I look at would swirl and move in its own direction. I would only see it in my peripherals because there is a swirling pattern of blue, purple, and teal. Wow.",
      "T+ 1:45 I have stopped sweating and go ride my bike around my neighborhood, then meet a friend at the cemetery who was tripping on LSA. My whole body was tingling, I feel like I want to move constantly. Everything is morphing into each other and swirling different colors. This seriously is amazing.",
      "T+ 3:00 I feel as I have hit the plateau of my trip. My skin is red, I am very sweaty, and I still cannot stop smiling. I begin rambling nonsense to my friend, my speech is just like, 'This hard is tripping making me.' Nothing else too significant happens except patterns and morphing.",
      "T+ 5:00 I am still slightly tripping. Visuals are still going on, but I have calmed down and just watched TV, enjoying the A/C.",
      "All in all, this shit is almost as good as 2 - 3 hits of acid if not as good. I had to take an Ambien to fall asleep because I was still rather awake. Next day I felt a little anxious, and I ate so much food because I did not eat much during my trip. This is something I can do every week if I could."

I felt more body energy, people I talked to, I loved talking to more, people I hated, I liked talking to. After the effects wore off, i felt anxiety, and a little tired."

      "Before I begin to share my experience, I must say that I am only 15. Now, with that said, I am much more experienced with drugs than most 15 year olds. I have decided to share this trip with others before I forget what happened.",
      "To fully explain why my experience was so odd, I must travel even further back. It was an amazing day for a concert. My three older friends and I, lets just call them J, L, and N decided to go see a Trey Anastasio show. For those of you that don't know, Trey Anastasio was the front man of an amazing band called Phish. Basically, this day was going to be one of the best experiences of my life. With a bottle full of very strong MDMA, a few 2CBs, some opium, and of course, some cannabis, we ventured to the show.",
      "The show was a mind-blowing experience, and while we were there we traded some of our MDMA for some extremely potent LSD. I took 3 triple dipped tabs, while I was already rolling off of 3.5 rolls. In case there are those out there who don't know, that means I took 9 hits of acid. Once we got back to our hotel, I took the 2cb. I was feeling amazing.",
      "However, about two hours after we got back to the hotel, my mind went completely blank. I can not remember one single moment of consciousness from that point until about 6 in the morning. From what my friends tell me, I was continuously walking throughout the room, standing on tables, and not speaking a word. I still don't know exactly what happened to me. But I know for sure that I was not psychedelically sleepwalking, as I was not the least bit tired when I 'fell out of consciousness'.",
      "Now, for the actual story.",
      "About two months later, J and L told me that they had a sheet of some ridiculous acid. Of course, I accepted when they asked me to trip with them. It was all set that we would get a hotel room at the holiday inn just downtown. But, things don't always go as planned. Even though we had gotten very little snow all year, the weather just decided to snow about a foot. This meant that no one was aloud to drive. We weren't about to let a little thing like snow come in the way of us tripping, so we all just decided to go to L's house. I took a train over, bringing my Nintendo 64, a pastel set, and a sketchbook.",
      "About ten minutes after arriving, they asked if we should start dosing, as it was only 5 PM. Without pausing, we all dropped 2 hits. About  45 minutes later, we all agreed we were feeling something, but we needed a bit more. So, J gave me 2 or 3 more hits. We went upstairs to L's room to come up. L and I started to feel a little sick, but nothing significant. All of a sudden, it hit me. A completely white lamp turned rainbow and patterns were everywhere. I told the group, but only L agreed. So, J decided to take more.",
      "Due to the storm, it was very difficult to find any weed. Eventually, we got a dealer, RC, to drive to us. We waited for him outside for what seemed like hours. But I didn't mind much because for some reason it felt as if I could not get cold. Also, the patterns our feet would make with the snow were beautiful.",
      "Finally, RC came through with a dank quarter. We went inside, and got dried off. J continuously ate more, as we went into the basement to 'dry our clothes'. This was just an excuse to her parents so that we could blaze in the basement.",
      "We went down, and began to toke. This, of course, heightened the acid very much. At this point, I was starting to peak. Everything began to turn into lines of energy. This is where things began to get foggy. I can then remember everything starting to flash in different extremely vibrant colors. I could feel every inch of my body become pixilated. It felt as though a million dull needles were pressing against my body. It was not necessarily a bad feeling, just very odd. Out loud, I then stated 'It's coming again'. This was, subconsciously, referring to the night I tripped in the hotel.",
      "The room then turned into a giant maze with the colors still changing. It was not necessarily the kind of maze one would think of. I, actually, can not describe in words what exactly it was. All I knew was that there was a strong voice saying 'you MUST get out of this maze, or you will die'. At this point I could hardly control my body. I started running around the maze, and climbing up it. I could not control my voice either. I distinctly remember screaming 'Oh MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD'. There was no reality anymore. I did not know anything of real life. All there was was me and the maze.",
      "Now, this may sound like I was having an extremely bad trip. However, in my mind, I kept remembering that I had just taken acid and this will be over at some point. I kept thinking to myself 'I might die, alright. Let's just see where this goes'. However, out loud I was still yelling. J covered my mouth because L's parents were directly upstairs. J said to me 'It's ok, you're just having a bad trip, and youll be fine'. I knew this, and I believed him. But, my body would not let me stop. I continued running and getting out of my maze. Finally, I made it out. J and L looked extremely scared. Again, I had absolutely no recollection of what had just happened.",
      "Now, you may be asking yourself how I retold that if I had no recollection. I will explain that later.",
      "J and L explained to me what I had just done. From what they said, it sounded like I just screamed once very loudly. I was still very disoriented, and had trouble doing anything normally. Although, now, at least I had somewhat of a sense of reality. I apologized greatly to L. However, we later found out her parents did not hear. We went back upstairs to L's room to try and sort out what had happened.",
      "We turned on the Nintendo, and tried to play. I looked down at the controller, and then realized I could not see what it was whatsoever. I then, forgot completely what a Nintendo controller was. I did not tell the others because I could barely speak. It took an extreme amount of effort to do anything. L then turned to me and said she did not think I should do any more acid. I said nothing. I forgot how to communicate. In my head, I thought 'What is acid?'. I then began to think about life. I could not remember the simplest things such as what death was, or how it occurs. I could not even remember that one needs to eat to survive.",
      "Everything was a giant blur, when suddenly BAM. It all came back. I told them both that I was fine, and did not have a bad trip. Throughout the rest of the night I was a little quiet, but still had a great trip. Slowly, very few parts came back to my memory. About a week later, I remembered almost everything else from that part of the trip. However, there are still parts today I can not quite pinpoint exactly what happened.",
      "I think there is a small link between my first blank out, and my second experience. However, I do not think that they were in any way the same thing. The second one was by far more intense and psychological than the first. I have also thought about how my age may have effected what happened to me. After this experience, I have decided to take a little hiatus from acid. However, it wont be too long.",
      "Finally, one effect that I love that has come from this experience is that previous to this trip, I very seldom remembered my dreams. Now, every night I have the most vivid dreams I have ever had that I remember the next day."

      "Trying to deal with the definite issue of coping with crack cocaine 'come-downs' in the daytime, I decided to eat half of the $5 piece.  To do so, I crumbled it as best I could, split it into two piles, and placed each pile into empty gel capsules.  When it looked like the other half of the $5 pile had about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of smoke-time left, I ate one of the pills.  A half-hour later, I ate the other pill.  fifteen minutes after that I finished smoking and went to work.  I did feel blank for a short while, but not particularity negative in the hours that followed.",
      "The time-table was 30-45 minutes as to allow the ingested cocaine to enter my bloodstream both while I was still high and after the smoked cocaine was beginning to lessen in my body.  At the end of the day I felt quite good, and had an extra bit of energy throughout.  Two major error-possibilities arise when I wonder whether my experience would equqate to 'the general experience': I only smoked $2.50 worth that day, I don't have a tolerance or much (bodily) experience with the drug.  Another factor that comes to mind is digestion-rate.  Mine seems to be about 45 minutes, thus I set my plans to follow.",
      "One further point of note:  I did seem to 'crave' the drug more than usual in the days following my smoke-and-eat experiment.  Dependence is an interplay of psyche and physiology, always."

At the meeting point something both impossible and ordinary would happen.  It was at this point that both nothing and everything were possible.  Such as any concept was somehow the same as its opposite I could see both sides at once.  Including the large concepts such as being god and human,  self and other even odd ones like clean and dirty.  I went through these one after another then got caught in a time loop which involved an incredibly dramatic acting out of a story I wrote.  It contained many zen statements.  It was as if I was both reading and writing the story at the same time or living out a memory of rereading the story very intensely after writing it, in a weird fashion such as Id read the ending then not know what was going to happen next then read the beggening and think I would meet at the middle where the world would stop. ",
      "Didnt reach the middle point as I got taken to the hospital by scared house guest before that point.  In the car I kept repeating love the word over and over and talking about religious context.  I was very high and clear headed no one seemed to understand me however. The whole thing seemed fine I agreed to go to the hospital because it seemed like the right thing to do for everyone involved.  I shouldnt have looking back at it.  I was checked into a mental hospital as well.  I wished the time loop would stop or run itself out when going on, it was quite dramatic.  On another experience I was singing at the top of my lungs makings crazy dancing motions and sounds and being very social, that one was more fun.  Overall a beneficial experience even with the time loop and future seeing.  I was also totally able to read minds for a brief period which was exciting.  Had deep thoughts and insights dealing with my faith and life.  On relatively average doses.  A very fun legal fungi."

      "It was my first day off of work in what seemed like forever. I had lots of things that I needed to get done (groceries, cleaning, laundry) and my day off of work was gearing up to be...well another day of work. Though I did have a concert later that evening that I had been anticipating for a while.",
      "I began the day with a healthy bowl of pot and set about my work. Around 4pm I was done all my stuff, and to be honest I was feeling great. Having gotten everything accomplished that I needed to was incredibly uplifting. I smoked another bowl of pot and began to play guitar. Everything that I played sounded like gold and I wrote a new song and some new riffs that sounded pretty tight (and I am usually my own worst critic).",
      "Around 6 I was feeling pretty mellow and decided that it was time for some salvia. I had recently purchased a vial of 10x from my local head shop. I had experimented with salvia extract (5x) once before and had tried the 10x that I had purchsed about three times before. However with each of this previous experiences I had never had the full effects. My problem before, I believe was that I had not been holding the smoke in for long enough. My other trips had lasted around 20 mintues and had felt very similar to the onset of a mushroom trip (objects shifting in size and location, mild closed eye visuals, and generally spacey thinking).",
      "Before the trip I baricadded the door to my room with chairs so I couldnt get out (I had no sitter so I didnt want to risk falling down the stairs or something if anything crazy happened). I sat crossed legged in my chair for about ten mintues and cleared my mind and focused on my breathing and then it was time to begin",
      "*The trip*",
      "I packed my long stemed pipe's bowl to the top and readied my self. I held the flame over the bowl and inhaled a large amount of smoke and held it in for around 30 seconds. After exhaling I took another hit finishing off the rest of the bowl. I wanted this trip to happen so I slowly counted in my head. As I reached 20 things began to change. I felt energy rushing through my body. The room was swirling to the right into a black vortex. I had time for one last thought before I was taken away. 'I definatley did it right this time.'",
      "Everything is very dark. I was very confused and felt like I was traveling faster than the speed of light. I was very aware of my heart beating at this time. I realized I was on a train travelling to another world. Everything was very silent and I could hear my heart pounding. (My theory is that the heart pounding in conjunction with the feeling of moving rapidly is where the train feeling came from) I suddenly realise I am only half on the train and half of my body feels like it is still in the real world. I have a slight moment of panic where I think my body is going to be ripped in half since only half of me is heading to the other world. I can hear the voices of young girls, who sounded very much like midget elves, chanting in a very mocking high pitch tone 'don't forget to call the (this word was lost but it started with the word loco and ended with something sounding latin'). I tried my hardest to hold onto the word but I was unable to. I was entirely unaware of the 'real world' throughout this period of the trip and as generally the case with salvia was entirely unaware that I was under the influence of anything.",
      "I came back to the real world to the sound of my own voice repeating the mantra that the 'midget elf girls' had been chanting. 'Don't forget to call....' I laughed outloud and said 'you are talking outloud like somebody is here' and as those words exited my mouth my eyes opened back up to 'reality'",
      "This next part will be very hard to explain but was the most emotionally powerful moment of the trip. I feel like I am in a salvidor dali painting. I am staring at an old chair and the door to my room (covered by more chairs) and everything is vibrant and glowing and very slowly melting. I feel like I am being watched by some sort of goddess (a very very strong female presence). I turn my eyes to the left to see if somebody is actually there. The next image appears directly overtop of the chair/door that I had been looking at before. For a moment I am seeing two very seperate parts of my room at the same time. I could still hear my own voice ringing in my head 'you are talking outloud like somebody is here'. This continues for what feels like forever, images merging together in combination with my own voice chanting in my head.",
      "I begin to think I was going crazy. It felt like this had been going on for hours. At this point I still wasnt aware that a) I had smoke salvia and b) I was still holding my long stemed pipe. The images melted together had mostly stopped but now as I looked to my right I began to feel like I was outside in a giant field full of bright green grass. My pipes stem was attached to my face and I believed that I was part of my body. My head felt like it was being split in two by a train. I didnt really mind though I was too pre-occupied with my right cheek (the one on my face heh) it felt like it was streching out, at a very odd angle, to the horizon...to eternity I thought. This is when my senses began to return to normal. Suddenly I realised that I was holding a pipe and that alot of the trip reports I had read talked about the feeling of trains and hearing voices.",
      "I still wasnt full coherent though. The message of the 'midget elf girls' had been twisted in my head. It had become 'dont forget to call your friends' I stood quickly up from my chair and rushed to find my cell phone. But upon arriving I was overcome by the feeling that using the phone was a very dangerous idea.",
      "I returned to my chair and tried to make sense of things. I felt like I had been high for days but when I looked at my clock it was 6:19. I had only been gone for 9 minutes! The come down, like the previous semi-experiences, felt very much like the onset of a mushroom trip. I was full of energy and again felt like talking to somebody, anybody.",
      "I spent the rest of the come down playing guitar. Everything, again, felt and sounded great.",
      "*Aftermath*",
      "That night:",
      "I was full of energy but felt utterly calm and at peace with the world. I was extremely pleased with the trip and utterly blown away by what I had saw and felt. Everything felt so real. I just couldnt get over how powerful this plant was. The concert that night was great though I did have a slight headache. My friends that I met there also commented that I talked alot more than normal and a lot faster. I did have trouble sleeping that night. But after taking a melatonin capsule I slept fine. I experienced dreams that night which were much more vivid than normal.",
      "The next day:",
      "I had a headache most of the day that felt very similar to a mild hangover. Though the feeling of peace and calm lasted most of the day as well.",
      "*Final thoughts*",
      "I was left feeling awed at the power of this plant. I have taken a few substances before (lsd, ketamine, shrooms,) but nothing had ever felt this real. I cant wait to go deeper into the salvia world.",
      "My only regret is in regards to the 'midget elf girls.' I believe I mistook their message of 'dont forget to call...' At the moment I felt like they were mocking me as if 'my you are stupid how could you forget to call....' But after I think about it I think they were reminding me to call out to the spirit that I felt was watching me. Next time I hope to communicate with this female presence."

      "I'm pretty small for age, short and skinny, but my tolerance for most drugs and alcohol is pretty high. I am a daily marijuana smoker and have taken countless amounts of pills in my life time. My friends mom had a lot of left over prescriptions so she gave em to me to see if I could do anything with them. I don't have a problem testing out new pharms because of the experience and educational knowledge I have already. Of all the pharms I had obtained the Lexapro seemed to be the best test subject, a SSRI and anti-anxiety med. I started the night with a burger from Carls Jr and bought a dub sac from my homie. Then we traveled to my brothers house were we began to smoke. I pulled out a bottle of Lexapro and proceeded to hand out a few to everyone. I took a couple my self, then halved one with my friend.",
      "Sat out in the garage for an hour or so when I began to feel something kick in. I was feelin slightly inebriated and very awake. The marijuana was superseded. I could smoke but it didnt do anything to me at this point. My jaws began to clinch and I saw small tracers. My anxiety was highly increased. I felt like a tweeker. In my experiences I've concluded that I much prefer downers to uppers, so I hate anything speed/tweek related esp tweekers themselves. It was such a horrible experience, and all I wanted was to sleep but couldn't. I tried, I might have passed out for lil periods of time, maybe a 30 min nap then I'd be awake again trippin. I didnt want to get off the couch because of nausea.",
      "Then next day, very sleep deprived, I felt like shit! I didnt want to do anything and I couldnt eat til the following day. Even then it was difficult to want to put anything near my mouth. In conclusion, fuck lexapro."

      "I have yet to read a report about OxyContin on this page, so I decided to write one of my experiences.  I use the drug recreationally.  Usually once every weekend or two.  This particular experience is when I did 120 mg.",
      "8:00 P.M. - Did first 40 mg pill.  Felt the warm, euphoric rush that generally comes with OC.  I felt really relaxed, but not really wild yet.  Along with the relaxation, I was somewhat energetic/talkative at the same time.  Nothing out of the ordinary.",
      "9:00 P.M. - Did the second 40 mg pill.  This made the euphoria more intense.  I became more relaxed, and perfectly content to just sit and enjoy the buzz.",
      "11:00 P.M. - Did last 40 mg.  After this I was really wild.  I went to a friend's house to play pool.  My body was so relaxed I could only stand for about 5 minutes and then I would have to sit down.  I would nod in and out of consciousness.  I felt as good as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "SUMMARY",
      "The feeling I get from OxyContin is total euphoria.  It relaxes my body, my mind and makes me feel like everything is perfect.  There is no better or more comfortable place to be than where I am at.  This is similar to what I have read about heroin (although I have never tried it).  I have tried morphine however and I felt it slightly more strong in my body, but not nearly as much in my head.  If I were to compare the two I would have to say Oxy is much better."

      "There are many places you can read how to Brew it so im not going to write it, I'm lazy. I am not an overly inteligent guy, details are usually just a bit beyond me, my friends how ever have a slightly better way of comunicating.  But they didn't 'trip' like I did. Me and two of my friends ordered the ingrediants and proceded to 'cook' the two brews. 5 grams each for the seeds, a brownish liquid was extracted. We placed it in the fridge and continued to brew the roots (8 1/2 grams each). It came out bright red, almost blood red. We used pink sobe to make a 'mixed drink' with the root. We drank the seeds liquid. 25 minutes later I drank the blood red sobe root concoction.",
      "Its onset was slow, no puke and only slightly enhanced visual perception, like a half an eight of shrooms.  I was disapionted. I didn't eat that day or at all for two more, I forgot to to be honest. I have been eating valume and doing coke and adderal during this time, and have no idea what it did for the trips.",
      "That following day is where the trip begins, lol",
      "We just cooked 120 grams of the root and split it three ways. I puked an hour later and it began instantly. Everything had a pattern or a face, I started talking to myself in the bathroom, and this thing was in the shower, the thing was being sneaky but I didn't see it, so I looked around the curtain and this little thing jumps out at me to either play a joke on me or scare me out of my mind, hard to explain but it had a 2d, 4d, black and white elf look to it, it was a higher being than I am, so my mind didn't quite 'get it'.",
      "Most people probuably would have freaked out but I got the sense it was all in the name of fun. So I laughed myself silly went and layed on the couch and watched people. I could know what they were thinking, not like a psychic, more like there subconcious wants and flaws. I UNDERSTOOD but can't put words to the facts that I thought.  It felt like all theese drugs I do are worthless, accept this beutiful feeling of enlightenment.  I knew what I wanted, peace of mind peace with myself not the pretend peace you get from oxy or some other euphoric drug I wanted to be happy with who I am. I studied people for the come down, and found myself being judgmental in a sorry for you sort of way. ",
      "The next day I reboiled all the roots because they still had color, three times. And and seeds we had left, This time was the hardest I have ever triped, and I have done a lot of wierd drugs.",
      "This time I layed down and I knew I couldn't sleep but tried to anyway, now this might sound wierd but I clear my mind before I go to bed, like meditation, I focus on nothing.  I layed thier and this time the onset was a creeper. I layed thier kind of sharing my soul with theese two 'spirits', kind of like talking without words or the ability to lie, or like sex with some one you care for, sharing myself, with my consiousness half way out of my physical shell. One of theese spirits had a feminine aspect the other a masciline but not quite male or female.",
      "This is when I peaked, an even more 'enlightened being' caressed me like a plotonic hug. My dumb a** friend shook me and they went away. I was back in my body and my trip was on the come down.",
      "This has some spiritual implications, I think that when I die my soul will be free, maybe to join the cosmos, but this universe created itself, maybe created life and with it thought, I believe we will become an 'ENERGY ENTITY', using energy lightly because if thier is matter and energy why not a diffrent spiritual substance? ho knows maybe I am crazy. I am done with drugs, I might do this Ayahuasca agian but the others wont make me happy, not really."

      "T, R, and I decided the day before to do salvia.  I had read a lot about it, have done mushrooms in the past, and described to them what to expect of the experience: that many people dont hallucinate the first time and if my friends did hallucinate, it wouldnt last too long and I assured them it would not result in a bad trip, as long as they believed that it wouldnt.  T had already tried it two days prior and said it felt as if a ton of bricks hit him in the face and that he had to lean back, but he did not hallucinate.  R and I had never tried it before.",
      "I told them that they had to hold it in as long as possible so that we could take the fewest hits and feel it to the fullest.  I also asked that we all pass it quickly so as to not waste any.  Since I bought the salvia, they decided I should take the first hit.  Before I started, I got my music ready because I enjoyed music when I was on mushrooms and noticed it intensified and added to the trip while it was playing.  I specifically and carefully chose music  stuff that I really enjoy and songs that have a lot of emotions embedded in them.",
      "I packed the bowl, took my hit and passed the piece.  I held the hit for about a minute and then exhaled.  Once I exhaled, I began to feel minor effects.  The way I described the feeling was like being really high on weed.  I also got a pretty warm.",
      "I went to pack another bowl because I could tell I wasnt as far as I was going to be able to get during this experience.  My hands were a little unsteady, I was laughing hysterically, and I had difficulty determining how much I had put in the bowl so far, so I just filled it all the way.  I hit it again, having difficulty remembering how to take my finger off the carb, and passed it.  I was listening to Hey You by Pink Floyd.  After I held in the hit as long as I could, I exhaled and felt like I should sit back.  I was at the part in the song about the ear against the wall when the hallucinations began.",
      "It felt like it took forever to lean back against the mat behind me.  While I was leaning back, I had to duck a bit as a green half-dome (like a sideways awning) came up over my head in proportion to how far back I leaned.  I thought of it as a sort of shield, but Im not sure why.  Things quickly progressed from there.",
      "The left side of the room was normal, but the right was strange.  Just to the right I could see myself floating above and a bit to the left of a stone wall.  Everything beyond the wall was bluish-gray and seemingly snow-covered.  I realized I was choosing to stay to the left because to the right of the wall was insanity, but the left was still sane, and I wanted to remain there to tell the others what I was seeing.  I was also very scared that if I went over the wall I would never come back and that I would possibly be wandering around in some sort of self-created Hell for the rest of my life.  Over the wall, there was no sign of human influence.  It was mostly empty with sparse patches of grass, some bushes, and a few hibernating trees, all still in grayscale and with some snow on the ground.  It was beautiful, pristine, and eerie all at the same time. As much as I wanted to look, I couldnt quite seem to turn my head to look over the wall to, I had to use my peripheral vision.  I came back to reality to but it was only a fantasy.  The wall was too high, as you can see, or right around that part in the song.  During this scene I felt as if Roger Waters, himself, was talking directly to me.",
      "After explaining what I had seen to T and R, we all decided that we should do more, mostly because they werent feeling too much and I was really excited that the salvia had worked.  During this time Breathe in the Air by Pink Floyd was playing.  I filled the bowl again and started it up. ",
      "This time the hallucinations came on full-force.  The song playing was Opening Mandlebrot by Blue Man Group.  I said, Woah, I gotta sit back  Uh Im f***ed...  You guys continue if you want Go ahead and fill it again if you want.  The transition was seamless and I didnt even realize for a while that I was hallucinating.  I dont remember how it began or what happened for a while.  I finally realized that I was standing on a low, yellow pier or dock of sorts leading to an ocean of the bluest, purest water imaginable.  There were a few people talking at the end of the dock outcrop that led the furthest into the ocean, but I regrettably didnt pay much attention to them*.  Another person or being was next to me.  Although I could not see it, I felt it was there and I believe it was trying to talk to me*.",
      "*I had a feeling that these two instances played a larger role in the part of the hallucination that I cant remember.  All I remember is saying, Theyre telling me things, but I dont know what those things were.  R, who was sitting across from me, was the only thing from the room that was I could now see and I proceeded to tell him everything I was seeing in as much detail as I could.  When I came back to the room, Muses Starlight was half over.  I also noticed that T was there and I was a little surprised.  I quickly remembered that he had left on a sailboat for a long journey earlier in my trip.  (Later I discovered that at that time, he was half-hallucinating about the old Mickey Mouse on a steamboat.)",
      "I asked them what I had told them about what I was seeing, but they said that I didnt say too much, that I was barely talking.  I was shocked and a very scared about their response, but they clarified their statement by saying that I was whispering and mumbling a bit, but they couldnt really understand what I was saying.  I believe the reason for things happening specifically to the right of me was due to me only putting the right ear bud in.  They still said they didnt feel much, so I decided to fill one last bowl and I let T start it, and when it came back to me, I finished it.  Map of the Problematique by Muse was playing, and this time I absolutely had to lean back  it felt as if some force was pulling me back.",
      "The various items on the floor werent really staying in place, they were sort of moving in little circles.  There was also a part on the carpet that seemed fluid with two streams beside each other  the left stream flowing towards me and the right flowing away.  I noticed that there were some slanted lines moving across the wall.  These lines were the imprints of waves on the room.  I suppose I had hallucinated before seeing those lines, but I dont remember it.  I then decided to see what closing my eyes would do for me and I put the other ear bud in.",
      "I immediately moved back behind my eyes.  I could see the backside of my face and it was full of action.  The backside of my face had a dark blue color to it and there were all sorts of lighter blue patterns morphing and dancing about.  The air or the rest of what I could see that wasnt my face was red.  I was completely amazed and baffled by this scene and I remember thinking, I never knew this was here!  My vision then started to move back to my eyes, slanting more and more down until I could barely see the backside of my face with its amazing display.  I was thinking, Im not ready [to leave] yet, and I was very sad that I had to leave, for a while I fought to stay.  However, I soon accepted that it was time to leave and I moved back into my eyes and opened them.",
      "Most of the time throughout this experience, I forgot that the others couldnt hear my music and I would talk over it so they could hear me or reference it.  The whole experience only lasted about 30-45 minutes from sitting down and starting to getting up and leaving.  That night I also had an insanely detailed dream that was just as amazing as the experience itself.",
      "I came out very amazed at all that had happened to me during my first experience with salvia.  I was very excited and fairly pleased with what happened, though I wished I focused more on what the other beings had to say - were they the same beings that other users often talk about?"

      "B. Arctor, 25 year old individual. Dabbled with psychedelic drugs and research chemicals since 1997. A list is not neccessary to understand information in this report, but my favourite three drugs are AMT, LSD and Cannabis. I am currently on 60 mg dose of the anti-depressive Cymbalta.",
      "T+00:00",
      "25 mg. of what I was told was ((R)(+)-Diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol) is consumed orally in veggie cap. Two days earlier a test run with 5 mg was made to investigate appropriate dosage and possible unforeseen ill effects in me; I am also on the antidepressant Cymbalta.",
      "I initiate this procedure early in the day, since I had seen references that the substance duration-wise has a long and smooth envelope, both comeup and comedown. Also the beautiful sunny spring weather contributed to this decision. 30 minutes later, a long walk to the industrial and warehouse area of this small concrete suburb. A clearly discernable energy of the little fuzzy type guides my steps in my quest to secure low cost, high quality dry fodder for my beloved kitten, here mentioned only under the alias 'Katyusha'.",
      "T+02:00",
      "Weak undefined sort of bodily euphoria is present - a buzz, but not the driving, grinding (and potentially orgasmic) feelings that larger doses of amphetamine can induce, nor the sort of friendly fuzzy body buzz which I tend to associate with tryptamines. I am in a good mood, working on some web design and at the same time playing host to two friends visiting, drinking wine and generally socializing.",
      "Tend to get laboriously absorbed in the task of setting up CSS-classes and aggregating feeds from various services I employ. It was years ago since I constructed a site before. Sharing some glasses from of box wine brought by my friend who goes under the alias Windows Media Player 9.0.",
      "Mild jaw clenching is noted. My girlfriend remarks on typical nervous tongue movements, but I hardly notice it myself. Some sweating is cooled off in some generous gusts of spring. Mentally, I rather reduce social contacts to a few trusty members, but now it feels like working in an elderly home would fit me well.The feeling is of slowly rising stimulation, expectations of a plateau to come.",
      "Very hungry, both in the 'need energy' sense and having no adverse feelings towards redeeming this. Whip together a mild wok with chick peas, kidney beans and sweet and sour sauce. Turns out not a candidate to be served at the Nobel Prize Dinners, where all the fat cats of the scientific, business and bureaucratic rub each other's back. I digress, manage to get half the meal voraciously inside me before not feeling for the taste anymore. Hunger resurfaces through the day, and I feel very satisfied to have made the acquaintance of a stimulant that doesn't seem to induce extreme appetite suppression.",
      "T+02:30",
      "Oops, here it kicks in. Spontaneous exclamation on IRC, 'factor has been raised significantly!' The smoothness discussed about elsewhere also later proved true at the end of experience - at least at this level. I wonder where in the range of acceptable dosages of 25 mg would be? Is it a nice drug, but limited to being a social tonic with unacceptable side reactions accelerating with dose? Make note to 'Insert more research.'",
      "T+04:00",
      "I am having a quite pleasant evening now, in conversation with my friends, one of whom has decided to accept my offer to try 25 mg. I don't experience at all the sort of jittery egocentric babbling and feeling of 'the world is to slow for me, can't it get faster?'-effects that make amphetamines so lacking in exploring one's psychology alone and in group. Of course I might be perceived by the others in the room as dominating and babbly, but they don't seem to be disturbed by it and confirm their affection for me.",
      "T+06:00",
      "A booster dose of additional oral 20 mg. is added, since time is drawing near to use the commuter transportation system. The voyage is to a long awaited gig at a medieval themed cave pub.",
      "A euphoric, almost psychedelic state stands forth clearly but fuzzily. Not been present in amphetamine, MPDV, Ritalin and other stimulants I have sampled. Euphoria yes, but not those higher spectrum overtones of psychedelic coating. Perhaps BZP in combination with TFMPP had some of this, but there it was a question of a more 'dirty' and bodily felt psychedelic tints. Mellow, but powerful, clearly talking for itself despite indulgence in rote Swedish alcohol culture.",
      "T+07:00",
      "I meet some interesting characters with which rewarding discussions were had despite club loudspeakers playing loud and extremely outmoded and antiquated music of feodal systems of the past. One person remarks about abnormally dilated pupils, which verifies that this chemical at least in me causes almost extreme mydriasis. I feel happy and socially secure.",
      "Soon the main attractions, Vox Vulgaris, a band playing contemporary medieval music, citing influences such as Bo Hansson, Ornette Coleman, Aphex Twin and the KLF. The crowd goes wild in the stony, damp cellar valve. At first shouting and moving around enthusiastically, banging their fists on the sturdy but rough wooden tables, soon straddling them for dancing and the multitude are really getting into the Meshuggah-influenced breaks and the following soaring, wild solos of the skalmeja, the oboe-like double reed instrument once so popular in the middle ages and the renaissance.",
      "It has risen to toot now again! The toot lives! This is the objective state of the concert. The powerful beats and melodies transform the room into a frenzy that can be likened to what happens when a really wild Klezmer/folk band like Kocani Orkestar or some other band one might expect to show up in an Emir Kusturica film.",
      "Dancing on ((R)(+)-Diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol) brings forward a clear and strong good old stimulant character in this yet so mellow substance. There is very little peripheral action as has been reported elsewhere. No 'heart rushes' and overheating were experienced. But yet capable to 'take the lead'. Of course it is hard to speak about the general nature of this substance in cases like this with so little available bio-assay data.",
      "In my interesting state of mind I concoct the slogan that 'the future is theory, middle ages are facts!' A great urge falls upon me to make these findings on specific relationships between that which is to be and that which has been. But, alas, the outcry is drowned out by omnidirectional shouts and outbursts originating from the rest of the ecstatic crowd and their already highly active reptile brains. Man must dance.",
      "T+11:00",
      "Inebriation is receding, lethargic 50 minute night bus is spent in the iffy feeling of coming down from the stimulant, the alcohol making me pleasantly stoned enough to daydream a little, hanging against the window passing by bus stop after bus stop. Almost baseline, but still alert.",
      "My girlfriend preferred staying at home to the medieval festivities. My friends and I drink the wine left over in the bag-in-a-box she spent the evening with and assume sofa positions, which feels great. Some jazz to smoke would have been A+, but life is cruel sometimes.",
      "On the XBOX, the movie 'Ewige Schnheit', which examines the wants and ideas expressed in architecture, body control and general aesthetics of the Third Reich projects. Chronological original and often schockingly beautiful material.. Leni Riefenstahl and so on.",
      "I administer 2 mg. of phenazepam in veggie caps to circle of friends. Time passes with discussions on the movie, sometimes just observing without listening to speaking track (which is rather like an essay). Time is ready for bed.",
      "This concludes our presentation. I had some hours of very good sleep after an interesting success in this bioassay. Insert more research!"

      "(Okay, to start, I'm a bit overweight, but generally healthy, have had mild asthma in the past, chemical addiction is present in family background, depression noted in personal history, and one case of mild self-induced psychosis from anxiety. I have been doing psychoactives since 2002-2003, starting after the age of 18, started with pot, then to mush (up to high doses), datura, morning glory, have experienced 2CE (once, post trip), LSD (post this trip), DXM, and MDMA on several occasions. I have also experimented with mixing/combining some of aforementioned.",
      "I had tried Salvia within a year before this trip, two times, both 10x extract. Both times were actually quite uncomfortable, not totally leaving my body, though loosing track of this reality for moments, but feeling intense salvia gravity, only on the front my body/skin, and the gravity was more like a force field pushing on my front side, and the force field was made of the same thing pins 'n' needles are, like when my leg falls asleep, except a fair bit more painful/uncomfy. It caused me to sweat profusely, and filled me with some type of fear that only Salvia can produce, beyond any other experience I've had to this day. Otherwise it would fade into a somehow familiar feeling, similar to deja vu, but more like a psychic suspiciousness, eventually into a mild stony pot feeling, ending within an hour.",
      "As for this trip, I was particularly excited to try it. My friend, who had had an intense 20x experience once in the past, wanted to see if anyone of our group (5 of us) could get an experience similar to the one he had. So he purchased a vial, and offered it to anyone up for it. I took this as a sign, as I had not done any real psychoactives for maybe a month, and was again searching for some kind of new experience/light. Since this was the 20x I was quite sure I would totally get the full effects, plus there were some others in the group interested in trying a milder extract, and I offered to show them what it was like to have the full experience, from a third party anyway. Everyone agreed, and off we went to the Japanese garden. It was a mildly warm day, sparse clouds, mid afternoon.",
      "In the garden we went onto the dock that sits over the pond, and actually met a couple other acquaintances there. Everyone (now about 9-10 people I think) sat in front of me in a half-circle, and I packed my metal pipe with the whole vial. I kind of remembered how the feeling would creep up for a second, and then rush intensely into my body even before the smoke left my lungs, so I sat quietly for a moment trying to collect/prep myself. Though in retrospect I remember being actually quite antsy, and the anxiety was mixing with my excitement. This was all before I learned how to actually meditate and I can now say that my mind was racing even before we got to the garden.",
      "I inhaled the smoke, as much as I could, and swallowed a couple gulps of air into my lungs for good measure. Held it in for maybe 15-20 seconds before I felt the first sensations putting pressure on the top of my legs, and somewhere deep inside my head and chest. Another 3-5 seconds go by, and I get a bit scared at how intense it's feeling, and I try to blow the smoke out, but I don't actually remember doing it. I only remember thinking 'Oh shit, you've done it now!' and trying to remember to lie back if I had to. Now there was a moment of blackness that I honestly have no memory of, except the fact that it seemed to last for eternity, and it was black.",
      "Somehow I sort of fell out of this space, as if I was lying on some kind of jelly sheet, stretching, and suddenly braking with my weight and me passing through it. Then the view in front of me, the basic box view that our eyes perceive, suddenly blasted away, as if I was looking back at the mouth of a cannon I was just shot from. It kept going and going, and all around this little box of colour (I couldnt distinguish anything in it, as it was moving away way too fast) was a giant empty void, not really black, just sort of no-thing. I totally felt as if my body was this giant void surrounding that box, which by now was just a tiny dot.",
      "Then after again what seemed like near eternity, the box shot back towards me, except it split into long horizontal pillars of light. With the void in-between them, and the pillars flashing across my vision from right to left. At that same time, the perception of my body went from being that huge void, to being trapped in a small container actually about the size of my head, which was very confusing, and confining, as if I was forced in it. And I remember as the first pillar flashed from right to left (Imagine a wall in front of you of stripes, about 18 inches away, each stripe is about 12 inches wide, one stripe being full of light, the next being void, the next being full of light, then void, and etc), it seemed to stop and take over my perception.",
      "Suddenly I was in an entirely new world, I dont recall what this world was, only that it was very frightening, and it seemed to last a lifetime, and still had the sensation of being trapped in a little box the size of my head. It literally felt like it was going on a hundred years. It was just flashing random lights, of non-distinguishable colours. And suddenly it flashed back outwards into a pillar and disappeared, the next pillar of light coming up, and taking me into its world now.",
      "This world I do remember, and I think this is where I finally did lie back, still cross legged, because it felt like I was on a bed, or table, and as I looked up there were your typical mainstream big headed aliens looking over me, and experimenting on me. They were grey, and had large black eyes. Im not sure they had mouths, but they seemed to be communicating to each other. Again this perceived world inside this pillar/frame seemed to again last a lifetime, and it was beyond frightening. Somehow it felt like each frame/pillar was one moment of thought, yet during the perception of being in the pillar/frame it felt as though I was able to think normally. And all I thought about was where I was, who I was, what these aliens where doing to me, that there was something utterly wrong here, and that I wanted to go back home. Wherever and whatever my perception of home was at that time.",
      "And then again, that frame flung away, and the next slid into perception. Now here I am not really sure what happened, because all I remember is seeing what looked sort of like stars, or maybe that fuzzy TV signal. There was almost no feelings or emotions, and my only thought was sort of just confusion. Yet there as a lingering sensation of being in trapped in that box the size of my head, but it somehow was becoming familiar, and acceptable. And here also it seemed to last a hundred years.",
      "This frame flung away as well, and at this point I think I was sitting up, because as the next frame came into existence I could see my friends faces. But they werent my friends. I recognized them as people I knew, but they were not my friends in this reality. The only girl there, who I will call A, was sitting right in front of me, and I do remember her face, except it wasnt her, the face was like hers, but she was a queen sitting on some huge throne, and the rest of the faces around her were all lords and knights, and laughing at me, and pointing. The queen gave me a deep stare, and then began laughing at me as well, pointing at me. I totally felt like I was standing before an old courtroom in the middle ages, and I was being punished for something I had done. It was utterly embarrassing, scary, and completely uncomfortable. A mix between some kind of mass embarrassment that the whole school had gotten to see, with a fear of some higher respected figure condemning me to eternal damnation.",
      "After about a hundred years of that, the next frame came along, and this by far was the worst one. It seemed to coincide with the previous frame, and again, all these familiar faces where around me, looking at me with evil grins, and torturing me while I sat/laid on some table. Again I felt like I was being shoved into this small box the size of my head, but I was too big, and yet somehow I was actually being forced into it. They were also cutting into me with knives and blades, and saws, and stretching my arms and legs, laughing and snarling. Even writing this now sends a chill through me. It was the most emotionally and physically painful experience I could ever imagine. Even beyond my imagination. I dont even know how to begin describing its suffering. It would be my absolute definition of Hell, just maybe different characters.",
      "Once more, a hundred years or so pass by of this, and I am flung into what I think was basically the last frame/pillar. It came over me slower this time, and the pain and suffering from the last one seemed to linger in this reality, instead of this reality having/creating its own kind of suffering. And now before me was people I knew, friends in fact, and they again were all laughing and pointing at me, as if some huge trick had been played on me, that reality itself was some kind of stupid trick, and everyone was in on it, and I was the stupidest person alive and as this frame continued that kind of trick being played on me feeling spread over the entire experience, and it was as if the void, the aliens, the kings and queens, the torturers and now my friends, who I recognized as my friends but still had no idea who they were, or who I was, where all in on this game, this giant trick.",
      "Now here again, I cant even begin to describe the sensation of this feeling. As if the whole universe was one giant trick, illusion pulled over my eyes, that I was really unbounded universal energy, and somehow was forced into this small mind to play out this ridiculous game while everyone else was in on it, and knew all along. It was utterly embarrassing, terrifying, and horrible, and redundant. There was really no physical sensation of pain, but that feeling somehow flooded out, and that idea permeated the whole experience, my whole life even.",
      "This lasted maybe what felt like 30 years or so. And then I began to really recognize who these people where, I looked away from A and over to my best friend, who Ill call C, and I finally was like Oh my god, I know you! Save me please, oh god save me! which sounded perfectly audible to me, but I later learned that I just mumbled and drooled the whole trip. But anyway, C gave me this look that seemed like he was sorry, as if he was almost going to cry, that this trick was a big mistake, and he was sorry for it, and I almost felt like crying, I became very sad and confused.",
      "As another few years went by, which I guess were really seconds now, time sort of returned to normal, and reality pixelized into focus. The faces where pretty clear but everything around where my direct focus was, was very blurry and incomprehensible. I suddenly remembered who C was, and then the memories of my entire life slammed into me in one instant, and I then remembered that I had just taken Salvia. I leaned over very uncomfortably (I was drenched in sweat), and I couldnt stop thinking Why the hell am I not in my bed? Wasnt this all just a dream? No I did salvia, why the hell am I not in my bed? And that seemed to continue a few loops in my mind. I then looked up at A and C and everyone else, and C offered me my pipe again, and said something along the lines that there was still salvia in it and that I had dropped it. I couldnt believe he had offered me the pipe, and I wanted to smack it out of his hand, or smack him in the face for even thinking such a thing, but then realized he had no idea what I had gone through.",
      "I very slowly collected my thoughts to the point of being able to direct them again, and rested on my hands and knees for a moment, as everyone got up. I still was in shock as to why I wasnt in my bed right now, even though I knew that didnt make any sense. Coming out of the experience kind of reminded me of waking up from a nightmare, I just wanted to turn over and hug my pillow and try to forget it. Eventually I stood up, and was just awfully awestruck. Everyone asked if I was okay, and one of the acquaintances we met there said he knew exactly what I had gone through. Somehow I doubt that, but I could tell he seemed to at least know the degree of fear I felt, as he had done 20x like this before. The friend that bought the salvia (Ill call him J) said right after I breathed it in, he felt a huge energy shockwave pulse out from around me. J and I had had a great mush experience, the trip I had before this (we shared a 9g stem), and I think our connection was still there, because everyone else only said they might have felt some kind of energy wave. C said he noticed it too though.",
      "Anyway, the original group was going to head over to As and offered me to come, but I was still quite in shock, and still heavily inundated with the whole trick being played on me feeling, so I just decided to head home, and really try to come to grips with what happened, as still it totally felt like I had been gone for lifetimes. By the time I actually got to my bed, I was pretty much baseline, had a bit of a head stone, and was still filled with that feeling, but the drug was nil. This was maybe 40-45 minutes after inhalation.",
      "As for now, there have been times on mush, lsd, and even pot where I get a feeling like the whole universe is conspiring, not against me, but not exactly with me. So not exactly a feeling of the universe playing a giant trick on me, but still somewhere within view of that sensation. And yet since then Ive had times (like the 9g mush trip with J) where my connection to people has become so noticed, that I am aware of how I am controlling their responses/creating this reality with my thoughts. But still, its as if there is something beyond me that is controlling even my own sense of control. And now after watching the movies Mirror Mask, and A Scanner Darkly, I cant help but think that God, or the Universe is playing a trick on itself, and we are the manifestation of that trick, and somewhere along the lines in the near future, something very epic and personally meaningful is going to happen, for all of us. Something greater then death itself. Salvia has shown me something greatly powerful, and despite the intensity of the suffering in this trip, I will experiment with Salvia extract again, and hopefully I will be more prepared to handle the sudden launch into dimensional reality."

      "To start off, this was my very first experience with any powerful psychedelic. My friends, who I tripped with all had some sort of trip experience, whether it was many times or only a few. I also hadn't done my research well before the trip, so I was unaware of what the mushrooms could or couldn't do.",
      "My friends, who I will name K, J, and S, had decided to trip at K's house one night, as it was our spring break and we had the time. K's house was actually abandoned, as he had moved and the house was still waiting to be sold. K was supplying the shrooms, as he had been growing them from a kit he bought at a head shop. All the wet shrooms he supplied were fresh, and were picked on the spot. The dry shrooms were about a week old. I was somewhat anxious before the trip, as I didn't know what to expect, and didn't know if I would like what I experienced.",
      "We began the night by taking 3 grams of the shrooms. We started rather late, at around 7 pm. Four of my friends took the wet equivalent to 3 grams, while I took mixed wet and dry, and another one of my friends took only dry. We also took a few Vitamin C pills, as we had heard that it enhanced the effects of the mushrooms. To accelerate the effects, we decided to each smoke a little bit of weed. It definitely worked, as within 15 minutes, we began to feel the effects of the mushrooms coming on. We had no idea what we were in for.",
      "Our first plan was to walk to a convenience store about a third of a mile away to get some gum. On the way, I could start to feel the effects kicking in, as the color of the sky began to get more vibrant, and I felt giggly for no reason. We bought our gum, and started journeying back to K's house. about halfway back, I noticed a great change in my vision, as it seemed like I was looking at the world through a fish-eye lens. Trees lining the sidewalk were bent inwards, and I mistook a shadow at the edge of a curb for a giant puddle. Within a few seconds, we were all running back towards the house, feeling great as the wind rushed over us.",
      "Back in K's house, we relaxed a bit in the kitchen. I laid on his countertop, staring at moving patterns on the ceiling, consisting of tesselations, cave-paintings, and faces. I became so absorbed in the ceiling that I eventually felt as if I was in another room, staring at a wall. Of course all I had to do to stop this was sit up. I was still in control of my trip at this point, and was feeling fine. We decided to go up to K's media room to listen to music and chill out. We took off our shoes and went upstairs to the media room. This is where our amnesiatic effects began to set in. K left the room briefly to change clothes, and when he returned, he was confused as to how he was wearing different clothes. We turned on some music, and I began rolling around on the floor like a kid. I was very happy at this point, and still pretty giggly. K's media room had a small half-foot step in the center, and when I looked over this step, it looked like I was looking off a cliff to a great expanse.",
      "This was when K started to become overwhelmed by the effects, and freaked out a little bit. He was quiet for a long time, and began to ask our more experienced friend S if what we took was okay, or if what he was feeling was normal. He didn't tell any of us, which was good, because it probably would have freaked us all out there. We decided to leave the media room and walk around outside more. When I got downstairs and saw my shoes, I was completely dumbfounded as to when I took my shoes off. In my time in the media room, I was completely oblivious to the fact that I wasn't wearing shoes, and it caught me so off guard to find them down there. This was when hell really started to break loose.",
      "While we were about to leave, my friend J decided to walk to his girlfriends house, a good two miles away. While he wandered off and eventually was picked up by his girlfriend, his erratic behavior started to make me kind of anxious. These shrooms we took were a beast, and as I said earlier, had amnesiatic effects. After J departed, we walked over to a park with a gazeebo to sit at. During the walk, I was questioning normal parts of my reality. Somehow time was brought up in conversation, and it seemed so absurd to me, as if it was just ridiculous that a thing such as time could exist. I also had these same ideas concerning people, and felt as if all people were united. I was still pretty happy, although a tiny bit anxious.",
      "When we finally got to the gazeebo, I sat down admiring the sky. It was intensely colorful, even for a night sky, and I stared at it for a few brief seconds. I noticed S was on the phone with J, and listened in on his conversation. He was telling J that he thought the shrooms we ate were bad and poisoned. I became decently anxious at this point, since my friend S is a pretty experienced tripper, and if anyone would know he would.",
      "At this point, the effects ramped up to another level for me and S, and the effects were too intense for us. Somehow we ended up at K's house, although I don't entirely remember how. Now S was in a full blown panic, and it was spreading to me. He was really worried that the shrooms we had taken were bad and was suggesting we call the hospital. Then he went outside and panicked. I stayed in the house, with my emotions slowly sky-rocketing. I hadn't had many mental effects before this point, mostly visuals and a few insightful moments. However, my brain exploded at this point. The feelings of fear, panic, and regret I was feeling magnified themselves, and I just sat on K's stairs screaming because I felt I was going to die, I regretted doing the shrooms, and I was deathly afraid that my parents would find out and be disappointed in me. S came back into the house and began spouting gibberish, such as how he needed to call his parents and tell them his life was out of control, and how he thought we were all having gay sex. He called one of his female friends and demanded that she come over to K's house to have sex. All of this was too much for me, so I went to the kitchen to sit down.",
      "Doing that was a bad idea, and I quickly became overloaded. We had left quite a mess in the kitchen, and K's countertops seemed to be covered in liquid to me. I didn't know exactly what was going on, and was unable to speak to my friends. I suddenly began to experience every memory I had from the past two days at once, and it confused the shit out of me. I couldn't figure out what I had done that night, as those memories were jumbled up with other ones, and I was afraid I had gotten in my car and killed someone. At the same time, I also thought that we had never actually gone outside that night, but had been vomiting for hours in the kitchen after taking the shrooms. The mess we left in the kitchen of cups and orange juice, as well as the liquid appearance of the countertops reinforced this idea.",
      "I had an intense ringing in my head, and was worried that I was dying. My reality seemed to skip in and out, and I'm pretty sure I was experiencing all five senses at once, so I couldn't see or hear in the true sense. My memories continuously flooded back to me, and I thought my whole life was flashing before my eyes. I was like, 'this is really it, I am dying on the floor of my friends kitchen, and no one is going to find us here to help us'. When I began to come down a little bit, I was able to speak to some of my friends, asking them to tell me I was gonna be ok, but even when they did, I didn't believe them. I was coming down at this point, and when I started to gain portions of normal reality back in my brain, I thought I understood what the trip was, what it was supposed to teach me. I finally believed I was gonna be ok, and the effects only went down from there.",
      "Somehow we changed rooms to K's parents' room, although I don't remember exactly when we did. It was a good change, as getting up and moving around had restored my sense of self. I was mentally normal when we were in his parents' room, and I was living for the most part in a sober person's reality, only with really cool visuals. The fact that I was alive and still sane was such a great relief to me that I was happy for the rest of the night. S was still in a somewhat bad trip when we went into the room, but my friends and I talked him down as he was coming down. We spent a while talking in K's parents' room, recounting our personal experiences. We then went to K's room to crash, and I experienced 5 blissful hours of uninterupted sleep.",
      "If you are going to try shrooms, try to figure out the potency of the shrooms you are getting. My friends and I, after a second trip with K's shrooms, have come to the conclusion that they are too potent, as almost any dose can send me into a fifth tier experience."

      "(I recently did a search on Deja-news for an old nutmeg FAQ I had posted years ago. It was gone from Deja, but I searched my own archives and found it again. I was disheartened by the bad trips that the present FAQ on Deja-news is now reporting. I thought for sure someone from the original Hyperreal site would have grabbed this FAQ off of usenet years ago [when they hosted these drug info archives], but it never showed up there and I don't see it in Erowid's vaults. So here it is. I really hate the bad rap nutmeg gets by those who overdose or don't use it properly. Maybe this will enlighten a few that are ruining a good thing for everyone, or more accurately, ruining it for the select few for which Nutmeg was meant. p.s. Thanks so much for providing TRUTH on this planet. It's hard to come by these days.)",
      "You MUST plan ahead for nutmeg.  The effects last well over 24 hours. The hallucinogenic portion only lasts the first day, but the body-effects go well into the next day, usually 36+ hours later.  One guy I knew who did it his first time was 'mellow' for that whole week. He was a type 'A' personality and everyone kept telling him how calm he was that whole week.",
      "It would also be good to do this with a close friend, both of you on nutmeg.  Some of the effects (the stranger ones like shared auditory and out-of-body hallucinations/experiences) might be dependent on having someone who you are close to with you (like a best-ever friend). Otherwise, you may never even notice some of the more elaborate things nutmeg can do.  I also wouldn't suggest you use nutmeg for a rock concert or rave kind of thing.  To us (back in the '70s) nutmeg was more on the order of a spiritual kind of event, if you can call it that.  The campfire outing or the overnight gab-fest seem to be the best kind of environments for nutmeg.  Going out to a small bar while on nutmeg was fun, but it got boring due to the topics and sights (distractions) there.",
      "Use freshly grated or fresh-powdered nutmeg.  Try to obtain it from a co-op, as their supplies are usually fresher than in any grocery store. Then carefully WEIGH OUT .75 grams to 1.25 grams per 10 pounds of body mass for each person taking it. Do not try to measure nutmeg by spoonful or other 'volume' measures --this can lead to disaster. One teaspoon of a compact, solid whole-nutmeg will NOT weigh the same as 1 teaspoon of powdered nutmeg. Nor will a spoon of fresh grated weigh the same as that sprinkled from an old can.  ALWAYS WEIGH dosages of dry substances.  Try not to do more than the amounts stated, and especially not for a first time use.  There IS an overdose level to nutmeg, but to date we've not really ever heard what it is exactly. It has an extreme central-nervous-system (CNS) depressant effect at times.  If you are 150 lbs. try 10 to 15 grams your first time. Depending on your sensitivity to it, you may not need or want more. If you can tolerate it, you MIGHT want to up it to 1.25 grams per 10 lbs. of body-mass.  Recently someone just reported overdosing on his first nutmeg trip when he took 23 grams and weighed 200 pounds.  This is high but within the recommended dose, so be warned.  His attempt at nutmeg turned into a nightmare by doing what was suggested (he also didn't weigh the dosage, just divided up a full, 56 gram spice-container in half by sight. Don't rely on store labels for accurate weight). One time I did 25 grams and weighed 180 at the time, with no bad side-effects, there seems to be no cut-and-dried rules to nutmeg dosages. So BE CAREFUL! If you are not sure about your sensitivity or the effects nutmeg will have on you, you should probably start with as little as half the recommended dosage (or even less than that).  You will have to find what works right for you.  There are no guarantees. Don't put yourself into a hospital over something that could have been a wonderful experience by foolishly jumping into a maximum dosage of something you've never done before.  Nutmeg CAN BE and *IS* a powerful drug!",
      "We tried all sorts of ways of hiding its flavor, but there is none (short of putting it into capsules, but the amount you have to take makes that a long-term project).  Above all, DON'T try to put it in any liquid, cooked oatmeal, or whatever to help you eat it.  Putting it in any foods or drinks only releases the flavor even more.  Nutmeg is fine as a spice in small quantities.  In hallucinogenic dosages, it takes on a puking-flavor quality of its own.  We think it's similar to a combination of turpentine and soap.  Be warned, that the nausea most experience is from the flavor only, it seems.  I've never become nauseated by it, but I've got a strong stomach and will.  Others have become nauseated, though, so be prepared to ignore its flavor.  One person wrote to me recently and said he found some wonderful success by mixing nutmeg with ripe lemons, making a sort of a 'nutmeg-lemon slushy' as he put it.  I don't know, I've not tried it, but he claimed the sour lemon cut the disgusting nutmeg flavor considerably. Maybe it was working along the same lines as the way lemon juice cuts the smell of fish (fishermen know to wash their hands in lemon juice after cleaning the day's catch).  Try a nutmeg-lemon slushy, see if it works, if it does -- GREAT!  And if so, our collective thanks go to the guy that found the nutmeg-flavor antidote. :)",
      "Measure out the right dosage for each person (only each person will know what the 'right' dose is for hir), and then simply spoon it into your mouth, trying not to moosh it around in your mouth too much, and then wash each mouthful down with a large glass of water [or lemonade? :)]. The trick is getting it past your tongue before you can taste it.",
      "There are some warnings against nutmeg, such as that it can cause 'nutmeg liver,' in which deposits of fatty tissue form on your liver. There have also been reports of dangerously high heart rates, anxiety attacks, general distress, dehydration, and constipation  There are other contraindications to nutmeg (maybe others can add what they are).  But due to its noxious flavor, nutmeg is not something you will want to do on a regular basis.  In some ways, this makes it nicely self-limiting for any abuse. As with all things in this world, different people react differently to all things. Nutmeg is no different. If you know or suspect you are chemically-sensitive, do less than the recommended dose your first time. No matter what new drug you try, always approach with caution.",
      "For the first 1-2 hours, you will probably notice nothing, except for the occasional nutmeg-burp (yuck).",
      "About 3-4 hours later you will probably start experiencing a sort of alcohol and pot-like buzz, lasting up to about 8 hours after ingestion.",
      "After that is where the very strange effects of nutmeg start to kick in.  It has a powerful 'downer' effect, but more importantly, reality starts to take on dream-like conditions. I'd say on average, the best effects kick in about 9-12 hours after ingestion.",
      "As examples:  One time a friend told me to run an old 'john denver' song through my head.  I preferred NOT TO! but I thought, what the hell. She told me to close my eyes and envision soaring through the canyons and pinnacles like an eagle or a hawk while thinking/hearing the song (the name of the song was The Eagle and the Hawk).  When in this downer/dream state, my daydreams take on VERY REAL qualities, like I am there. I opened my eyes and could only say 'WOW!'  Then as she smiled at me, I heard a loud eagle scream, 'EEEEEeeee, EEEEEeeeeee...' in her apartment, behind the chair I was sitting on. We both looked startled and I said, 'Uh, did you hear something?' She said, 'Uh no, I mean, you mean that 'mouse sound'?'  And we both started to laugh, we were both trying to deny what we had heard and then confirmed we heard an eagle/hawk and heard it scream two times, in her locked 3rd floor apartment, in the middle of town at 3am. (To give you a time-line here, I think I remember we took the nutmeg in the early afternoon the previous day, making this experience about 13-15 hours after ingestion.)",
      "These 'dreams' seem to be very easily controlled and often are very whimsical.  Another example is where I had 'dozed off' into yet another day-dream and found myself paddling down a beyoooteeful tropical river somewhere.  It went on for what seemed to be hours (but was only a few minutes) and when I finally looked down at the boat I was paddling, it turned out I was paddling a giant peanut shell. I started laughing, which of course broke others' concentration and topics.  Unlike other drugs, the hallucinations/dreams on nutmeg never seemed to be threatening nor ego-damaging.  They were fun or mysterious, or just darned fascinating. Yet another time, with the 'eagle-friend,' we shared an out-of-body walk through some woods somewhere, again verified by later carefully comparing notes of the 'dream,' without trying to lead the other into answers we expected of each other. Just as the dream/OOBE ended, I opened my eyes and quickly said, 'What are you thinking?!' and she woke up in a start. What freaked her out so bad is that, as she stated, while half laughing, 'Don't EVER do that to me! Fuck! You scared me, just as I saw you step back into your body in the recliner you asked me what was I thinking! Jeeze did that scare me! Like someone yelling BOO!'  And we laughed and compared notes--and then became REALLY amazed over our 'shared dream.'",
      "See if you can sustain this nodding dream-state as long as possible, having the dreams and then comparing them with friends, which can lead to things like the shared spontaneous auditory hallucinations (which seem dependent on going into and out of these states of mind). Nutmeg seems to initiate an other-worldly synchronistic effect of sorts. You can sometimes bring parts of your dreams into your reality or... something. Dreams and reality truly do overlap on nutmeg. But you'll need another nutmegged friend to find that out. How can two people hear the same 'hallucinated(?)' noise? Or share the same 'Dream'?",
      "These kinds of effects started to happen on maybe our 3rd try at nutmeg (done months apart), but I've heard where others have had similar things happen on even the very first nutmeg experience.",
      "Eventually, the 'downer' effect of nutmeg becomes overwhelming (not to mention you've been awake for quite some time now) and one of your little nods into nutmeg-dreamland turns into a full-fledged",
      "snore-fest.",
      "The next day, don't expect to do anything energetic.  In fact, we almost enjoyed the next day more than we enjoyed the hallucinogenic part of it.  Your muscles might be a little achy/stiff, like after a long hike [hmmm I wonder now if maybe we hadn't REALLY gone somewhere on nutmeg :)], and you'll feel generally tired and you'll want to do nothing but lay around, maybe share body-rubs with your nut-meg friends, take hot-showers, drink herb tea, watch the fireplace, listen to favorite tunes -- in short, a MAJOR kick-back kind of day.",
      "Granted, these were the experiences that we 'generally' had on nutmeg, but others have experienced nothing but nausea or just a light buzz (or the serious side-effects). No two people seem to fully react the same way on nutmeg, hence all the contradictory stories. I truly believe there are certain 'nutmeg people' for whom this drug was meant.  I hope you might be one of those people, because nothing I've ever taken has compared to a nutmeg trip with a good friend. I wonder if, of the many people that say it had no effect, they just started getting off on it and nodded off right into sleep-land instead of exploring its effects. Most might be slipping right past the fun part with no memory of it the next morning.",
      "Even if the other people or person does not want to take nutmeg with you, try not to do nutmeg alone.  Due to its hypnotic/sedative qualities, it would be very easy to wander off and wake up finding yourself in a strange place, which could be dangerous, or driving which could be disastrous, not to mention the serious side-effects if you are unlucky enough to experience any of them. At one camp-out (just a few years ago), a guy wandered off chasing the coolest fire-fly he'd ever seen. We thought he had gone to bed. The next morning we asked him why he was up and about so soon. He said he just got back from being lost in the swamp. He was fascinated by the hoards of fire-flies that night and just laid down in the dry swamp-bed to watch them. He could easily have gotten completely lost or if it had been cold, gotten hypothermia.  Have someone watch over you, even if they too are on nutmeg. His first nutmeg experience turned into a fascinating trip with nature, he couldn't stop telling us how fantastic his night was--but it could have ended badly, if the weather had changed, if he couldn't have found his way back.",
      "I hope this has helped.  If you have a good experience, let others know. There's been too few good stories compared to the nay-sayers. But when they are good, they are really good. I think most are just not doing it right is all.  Extracts, milk infusions... in my opinion they're a waste of time and only lead to disappointment.",
      "Have fun at play, but play safe!  Just like the 'New Games Foundation' motto from back in the '70s--'Play Hard, Play Fair, Nobody Hurt!'",

      "Ok, The road I took to achieve this information was long and very painful. But with my pain and suffering, came out alot of information and study. The first time I started using Tramadol was for about a year straight, from June 2005-July 2006 non stop, at 200mg in the morning, 200mg Afternoon, then 200mg at night. It was the 'perfect drug'. When I woke up in the am I felt like a million bucks!! Got dressed went to work Cheerful like never before, full of energy, just happy as hell, like the world was just a perfect place. Tramadol did decrease my appetite but I was able to eat a light lunch & regular dinner and in return I lost 30 pounds over the course of that year with out even knowing it!! So I thought to myself this is a super drug, why stop. I live 10 minutes from the Mexican border so I have a never ending supply and very very cheap!! So my Tramadol experience continued until July 2006. After a year I thought this has been going on long enough I cant keep taking this for the rest of my life, so I decided to just quit cold turkey!!! BAD IDEA!!!",
      "Friday Day 1 of Withdrawls. No sleep at all!! Anxiety, very shakey, stomach cramps. Felt like I had just been kicked in the groin. I couldnt keep my leg from twitching. Skin felt like it was on fire!!",
      "Saturday Day 2 of Withdrawls: High anxiety. Stomach burns a little more, skin went from burning to a feeling of a bunch of needles poking all over my body. Hallucinations, and I mean some crazy hallucinations, just wierd pictures of objects and colors flashing before my eyes, even when I closed my eyes same thing. Nope no sleep again. I had to go out at night and walk. Just walk around because I couldn't sleep I was in pain my head and brain felt like it was being ripped apart. I thought I was going to die, I was thinking about turning myself into the hospital but I can't because I am military and I can get into alot of trouble for abusing substances. So I just told myself one more day, I can do it.",
      "Sunday Day 3: Very high anxiety. Everything stayed the same as day two. I even told my self I can't handle anymore of this, if it feels like this on the morning of day 4 I am going to the hospital and bite the bullet.",
      "Monday Day 4: Alright I fell asleep last night for about three hours off and on but much better. The needle feeling in my skin was fading away, no more hallucinations and flashes, still a nice stomach cramp but manageable, I was able to think straight again. Started to feel like myself again.",
      "Tuesday Day 5 : Back to normal. No more cramps, I feel like my old self again, dragging ass in the morning, not cheerful like I am on tramadol, But I was sober!!",
      "I was sober for about four months, because like I said I am military, so I had to go overseas for that four months, and everything was fine. I totally forgot about Tramadol. But when I returned home I ended up in Mexico with some friend, and I stopped at a pharmacy and picked up a bottle of 50mg Tablet Tramadol. Why? Because I like the way I felt when I was on them. So on I went back on my Tramadol life, Cheerful, happy, I even got a promotion, because when I worked on Tramadol, I was able to concentrate, happy go lucky, and loved to work on my projects. So I continued for about three months. Well it came that time again, for me to go overseas for six months. I didnt want to go buy a half year supply of Tramadol so I decided to cycle off it again. So what I did was taper.  Before I started the taper I was using 600mg a day.",
      "Week 1: 200mg in the A.M., 200mg in the P.M.",

      "Week 4: 50mg A.M., 50mg P.M.",

      "No withdrawals!!! I didnt notice or feel anything!!",
      "Yeah this took a while but I was able to work and have a social life while I was kicking the habit."

      "I write this story about a rather extreme experience I've had with alcohol last year, at age 17. It was my first experience, and hopefully the most extreme I'll ever experience, because I know if I had drank more i would be dead.",
      "It all started at my friend M's house. We were sitting in his basement bored and he asked if I wanted something to drink. Suprisingly, I had never drank before, but decided I would anyway. So he got a bottle of Irish cream and some glasses and we each took a little. It tasted aweful, but I chugged it down easily anyway. We decided to have another. And another. And another. After about 4 we walked up the stairs and noticed we were light headed, and had the famous 'buzz' everyone raves about. So we got some Jack Daniels whiskey and started going at that. Eventually another friend R came in and had a few shots. I kept saying we should stop, but was enthralled by the fact that more felt better. The more I drank, the better and happier and more giggly I felt, and my friends and I kept chanting 'one more.'",
      "Soon the rancid acidic taste of the hard liquor vanished and we were chugging out of cups rapidly. We went to get more. I remember walking up the stairs and going to the bathroom and noticing I seemed to have no feet whatsoever. I was flying! Wow that was strange. Tried to piss in my friend M's toilet but urinated all over the seat and wall, but laughed saying to myself that I was so drunk that the urine contained enough alcohol to actually disinfect his bathroom. I nearly fell down the stairs and then decided to run circles around my friends pull table. Then there was a blackout. My friends claimed M and I became so drunk that we stopped drinking out of cups. We just chugged hard liquor right out of the bottle for a while, until I got so drunk that I started pouring it into my eye. In a quest to get more I tried to go upstairs, but ended up falling down the stairs trying to get up.",
      "Afterwards I fell into the pull table, and with blood running down my face I ran over, fell over again, and started vomiting. For around 2 hours M and I vomited nearly continuously, constantly choking on pieces of food in our vomit. I had long since stopped responding to any outside stimulation including screaming and slapping. My friends panicked. I was completely unconscious for quite a while. I finally woke up to my friend A jamming his hand down my throat to pull out chewed food I was choking on and bit him and punched him. Eventually the vomiting subsided.",
      "I woke up later in a state so miserable I cannot describe it. I've had severe cases of the flu and skipped sleep all night but NOTHING could compare the the feeling the next morning. Immediately upon waking I noticed wiping my face there was dried blood all over it. M's little brother came down to notify me my mother wanted me to come home, but as soon as I looked up I barfed my guts out. Apparently from moving my head fast after nearly drinking myself to death. I dragged myself upstairs to take a crap, only to find crapping also made me vomit. It was wretchedly gross. After somehow getting home I immediately went to sleep. I tried to eat but couldn't I threw up. I tried to drink cause I was very dehydrated, but couldn't I threw up. I couldn't eat until 11:30 that night and that was only half a bagel. It was miserable.",
      "Since then I've been drunk plenty of times and smoked plenty of weed, mostly with good outcomes. It comes to show though, if your drinking with your friends in private, just make sure you wait between each drinks and try to stop. I know if I had drank anymore I would have gone into a coma. I basically was in one at the time and would estimate my BAC to probably have been somewhere around .30"

Just recently, I've become so ill from withdrawal that I stole about 20 of them from a family member. They found out, and I almost went to jail. It was at that point that I finally snapped out of it and realized just what I was doing. I was a junkie. A horrible, fiending, thieving junkie that would do anything for my next buzz.",
      "So, I called and scheduled some time at our local rehab clinic, but I figured, 'Well, I've already been there once. Who's to say it'll work this time?' So I made a few calls, did a bunch of research, and finally came across a drug called Suboxone. Turns out my family doctor prescribed it and had his own program for detox. I was ecstatic, called him for an appointment, and he had me in the next day.",

Probably not the best type of treatment, and I doubt they intended for me to get high. But quite honestly, it's like reinforcement kind of, because I can't imagine not getting high when not taking a pill. Pretty soon it'll probably just make me neutral, but in the meantime, I'll enjoy the quaint buzz.",

It had been perhaps 7 years since I had done any hallucinogens when I tried the salvia.  This was written three days after the experience.  Still trying to integrate it.",
      "My best friend, D, is a guy I have known for 20+ years, and was/is my tripping buddy. We have done a lot of unwise things together.   He was bound and determined to try salvia after watching some pretty funny youtube videos.  He had gotten some 'incense grade' salvia a few weeks back.  We are both heavy weed smokers, and I was not at all impressed with the plain salvia.  I thought the high was kind of like paint thinner, and did not smoke any past my initial trial of it.",
      "D got some 5x extract a few weeks later.  He and his girlfriend, P,  of several years tried it once earlier that day, and said they just basically laughed their asses off.  D and P came over to my house that evening.  I smoked it twice during their visit.  While I am still not sure if I liked it, I am certainly impressed now.",
      "We are all good friends and have known each other for years.  The setting was relaxed, we smoked a little weed first. It was daylight outside, and the lights were off inside.  The TV was on low, for background noise.  D, who is a pretty huge guy, and has a bad hip, was sitting in this old, high-sitting office chair I have in my living room.  Its easier for him to get up from.  His girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch.",
      "The first time, I took one stout hit, and then a fairly half-hearted one.  I did not want to take of my pants and run around nekkid or anything.  The effect was sudden and very intense.  I had a physical sensation of some sort of field or membrane passing over/through me.  The effect was kind of like an electric shock, very buzzy and quite physically unpleasant.  I muttered I dont like this.  Soon, all the planes in the room, like the flat parts of the couch and the table and the walls all pixilated and broke apart into very brightly colored hexagonal tiles about the size of my thumbnail.  I could still see the table, but the flat parts of it were made of tiny colored tiles, slightly offset from one another.  I looked at my friend D, and I could see a sheet of tiles intersecting him where he sat in the chair, looking very much like wings.  I was still together enough to know I was sitting on my couch, at home. ",
      "I had something that seemed to be made of jello that was the color of Coke all over me.  I was able to very easily wipe this stuff off me, it disappeared into the air as I wiped it away.  I was wiping it off my whole body, kind of like you sluice the water off yourself after a shower.  My friends were watching me do this, and asked, What are you wiping off?  Without a moments hesitation, I said, Failure.  This amused them highly, and they were laughing, and I was laughing a little  but it felt very weird and mechanical at first  becoming more natural after that.  After a few moments, I felt pretty normal, except for general giddiness, which went well with the weed high.",
      "D and P had their turns, and they basically just laughed through their trips (and said I was weird because I didnt laugh during mine), and we smoked some more weed.  After a couple hours, we all decided to have another round.  This time, I resolved to pay better attention.  I took two MONSTER hits and quickly put the bowl down.  The effect was again very quick and this time extremely intense.  When passing through the membrane/field this time, it was even more uncomfortable than the first time.  It felt like a sustained electric shock passed me wherever I passed through the field.  It was fortunately over pretty quick.  The tiles came back, but this time, were not limited to only flat areas, but quickly covered everything.  The tiles were all brightly colored.  The colors of the tiles were reminiscent of the Aztec/Inca/Toltec art I have seen in National Geographic.  The way things were made up of tiles was like that sort of Aztec/Inca style too, only far more detailed.  I remember thinking they were like scales or something.  It was very, very beautiful.",
      "After that, the wall behind me disappeared.  I could feel the warm sunlight, and could turn around and feel/see the countryside behind me.  Without transition, I was sitting with my back against this tree that is out in my front yard, but I was still in the living room.  I cannot adequately describe what happened next.  I believe it is described as total ego loss and synesthesia (sp?), but I am not sure of the technical terms.  As I was sitting there against the tree in my living room,  the entirety of creation folded itself around me and blended together, and I lost myself in it.  That sounds all melodramatic, but I cant think of any other way to put it.  I totally lost all awareness of everything for some indeterminate time.  I had no idea who I was or what I was or where I was.",
      "The first recognizable mental process I remember was the sensation of being trapped in something that was moving in a slowly revolving pattern.  For some reason, I remember the tree from earlier  it was somehow part of this pattern that seemed like it held everything.  I also remember seeing my mother and sister (versions from when I was about 6-7) all swirled in there, in ways that did not make sense.  It was somewhat like those dreams I have about work, when I am doing the same horribly tedious task in an endless loop, never accomplishing anything.  Only weird  very, very weird.  It was not pleasant at all.  One oddly clear moment in it, is that the guy in the TV looked right at me and Oh man, you are fucked, and looked at me with disgust and pity.  Then he said, Well, I guess you wont die and turned away.",
      "I felt like I was falling deeper and deeper into this loop. Then, somehow, it felt like a wise and benevolent being was peering at me from a great distance.  I reached out my hand, and the benevolent, shining being took it.  That was actually the thing that broke the loop for me  it was P that took my hand when I reached out.  It felt to me like she literally pulled me back though that membrane I had passed through earlier.  I was still tripping pretty hard, but I knew I was me, back on my couch, in my house.  Over a few minutes things got back to normal. ",
      "They said I just stared into space for a while, then started leaning slowly forward.  I put out my hand as I leaned forward, and P grabbed it, and I sat back up.",
      "Then P took 3 big hits, and she pissed on my couch. :(    Yep, she did.",
      "I am still trying to figure out what I should learn from this  apart from putting down a towel for P next time. I have always felt like I have learned profound, if not easily explainable, truths on my previous heroic trips with shrooms and acid.  The Salvia trip was so alien and bizarre that I am not sure what to take from it  but I do feel like something is there to be learned.  Despite how this article might sound, I probably will smoke Salvia again.  There is something to learn back there behind that membrane."

      "On March 23, 2007 I thought it would be quite comical if I took all the remaining drugs me and my friend had. We'd both been sober for quite a while, and hadnt done anything but acid since November. Although on New years I took 2 hits of acid while on the anti-depressants Wellbutrin and Seroquel. I also had taken 1 hit of acid on two occasions while on Wellbutrin and Seroquel.",
      "On 3/23/07 I took 5 hits of acid that all my other friends had only taken 1 of and said they had 'one of the best/most intense trips ever' I had not taken my lithium in 2 days (this day was the second day) because it made me extremely drowsy and I couldn't wake up to go to school, by the way I am 16 years old and in high school. Me and 2 of my friends did not remember that I was on a pretty high dose of anti-depressants. I remembered that I hadn't taken my lithium and joked that it was 'a sign from god' that I would be okay in taking the acid. Oh, and about 20 minutes before when we picked up the second friend, I had the 5 hits on my tongue and stuck out my tongue at her. She replied 'you are my fucking hero'. We had lots of laughs about it when we arrived at a mexican resturaunt. I went to the bathroom to crush up the pills of ecstasy and parachute them.",
      "By the time I finished, the acid already started kicking in. I went out to the tables to smoke some cigarettes. 10 minutes later we got in the car to go to another friends house to hang out with one of the friends girlfriend. On the way, I couldn't even see due to the trails everywhere from lights + the shaking of my eyes from the ecstasy. Her parents were still home at the time, so I was told to go on a walk, which usually are quite enjoyable on LSD, But this time wasn't as enjoyable as I expected. I say down on a knee high brick wall and smoked some cigarettes. Behind me was the backyard of a house with some kind of water fountains that dripped at a constant interval every few seconds. This repetitive dripping echoed through my head until the next one, causing some discomfort.",
      "Also, which I'm guessing was due to the lithium (since I had taken acid with ecstasy before) I feel like there were cats purring in my ears and saw vines crawling up my legs and wrapping around me, and I didn't have that usual 'acid feeling'. The purring  kept repeating over and over again, exactly the same as the time before. Also I could hear the hiss of the grass swaying in the wind, also constant. I tried calling the two friends over and over hoping they would pick up. After I think 10 - 30 minutes I got up and tried walking the 100ft to the car. I stumbled around on the pathway but couldn't tell exactly how noticeable it was. I got in the car, curled up in a ball and held my head. I kept calling  till one picked up. I begged 'you need to get over here right now. I'm fucking freaking out, I don't know whats going on!' calmly they responded 'where are you?' and I replied 'IN THE CAR. HURRY UP' and hung up. I waited for 10 minutes and no one came out side. I called and called again. The friend picked up again and I said 'where are you hurry up?!' so they finally came and sat in the back seat of the car asking if I was okay and I replied 'no I don't know what the fuck is going on. We need to leave'. Within 10 minutes the girlfriend's parents left and we went into the back yard. I tried to drink some Gatorade but just choked on it and stopped drinking.",
      "For some reason, 10 minutes later her parents returned and I hid under the table. I couldn't handle the anxiety, so I got up, and stumbled out the gate. Her dad tried talking to me and tried to shake my hand but I couldn't understand anything he was saying. They told him I was just really high on weed and we eventually left to go to another friends house, leaving the girlfriend there to baby sit her brother. Once again, in the car I could see nothing, just trails of lights and trees, and the whispering continued. At this point I started to lose memory of what happened.",
      "According to one of my friends, walking to the house, I feel and hit my head and just lay there and they dragged me inside. I remember sitting on the couch, rolling around on the floor, and twitching and all the shit. I was incoherent, and couldn't understand what my friends were saying. I remember saying words, that I thought they would understand but I would just say things like 'doug' (I don't know anyone named doug) and 'gyerm' and other random things. I started to become frantic, when one friend called another and told him what was going on, asking if I'd be okay. I began to freak out even more, when she called him again telling him he needs to come over immediately.",
      "I can't remember much after this point, but I remember my friend N, M, and S coming over. and I remember everyone pinning me down. According to my brother who came with my dad after an hour this whole thing was about 3 hours in duration. I began to scream and bite everyone, and I was being held down by about 5 people. I was screaming 'parents' and 's..s..s..sho..should I be dying?!' and 'bones ! I need my bones'. I remember both of my arms being broken with the bones popping out. but that was only in my head. Due to my screaming, the next door neighbors called the cops, who called an ambulance.",
      "According to friends, any time someone let go on my arm , I would grab anything I could and pull it to my mouth to bite it. If I couldn't grab anything I would bite my fingers, and it was no play bite. If no one pulled my hands out of my mouth, I would have no doubt bitten all of my fingers off. The medic's put a hard monitor on me, and I had a pulse of 160. I had horrible twitches and seizures and my eyes were shaking , and my pupils covered my whole eye.",
      "The next thing I remember, which was 16 hours later, at 11 am the next day, I was in the hospital which bruises and huge scabs all over my body from carpet burn and people holding me down. When I was first admitted to the hospital I was screaming at the top of my lungs and was strapped down. My brother, who was there for the more recent hour of trip said he had never seen anyone that 'gone' before, and he did a lot of acid when he was in his teens (hes 22 now).",
      "According to friends I seemed somewhat like a rabid dog, one moment being extremely aggressive, then the next moment full of paranoia and extremely frantic. All my friends were covered in bite marks and bruises. They all agreed that I would probably be dead (by suicide, or getting hit a car or something) or at least be missing a few fingers if I was by myself. In the hospital I had a very low lithium level."

    "report": [
      "I live in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and lately it seems black tar heroin has been getting more and more popular amongst the youth here. It's commonly called 'cheeb' and it's sold in $30 (about 0.25g), $60 (0.5g) and $110 (gram) wax-paper-wrapped chunks covered with tin foil and tied into a small balloon. Because of the sticky, toffee like consistency of the drug, it's not really practical to sniff it, and not many of my friends shoot it. Most of the people I know prefer to smoke it.",
      "I open up the balloon and unwrap the $60 sack. It's about the size of a marble and it has a dark brown, shimmery look to it. Using my thumb and forefinger, I pinch off a small amount of the cheeb and press it down onto the shiny side of a small 4x4 inch square of foil. It is much like a piece of hard candy: sticky, but prone to break up into a sort of coarse dust, it sticks to the foil quite well. I hold the foil and lighter in each hand, and a purple plastic drinking straw cut down to about 3 inches in my mouth. Holding the lighter beneath the foil under the small chunk of heroin, also called a 'dot,' I begin to inhale through the straw which is held directly above so as to catch the smoke. Almost instantly, the dot melts into a small, boiling pool of reddish, dark brown liquid and a plume of smoke funnels up the straw. The taste and smell of the cheeb smoke is very distinctive: I would describe it as a burnt-barbecue sauce odor with a very bitter, almost vinegar-like taste. It is not a pleasant aroma.",
      "I let off the lighter and top off my lungs with a short inhalation of fresh air. I hold the smoke for as long as possible, and then exhale. Very little visible smoke is seen upon exhalation, but the bitter taste intensifies on my tongue. Almost instantly after blowing out the hit, I begin to feel its effects. It's possible to get 4-5 hits from an average sized dot. Its a typical opiate high with typical opiate side effects. Relaxation, a mild tingle in the extremities, and a relief of anxiety are all some of the positive effects. The taste is quite bothersome, so I take a sip of some Gatorade which is pretty good at rinsing it out. It takes about 3-4 hours of casual smoking for me to kill a $60 sack, if I allow about 15-30 minutes between dots.",
      "There are some shitty things about this drug however, not including addiction, the shittiest of all. First off, the nausea and vomiting can really sneak up on me. One minute I can be feeling high and calm and the next I can be hit with an overwhelming wave of nausea. Vomiting provides temporary relief of the nausea, but if I smoke more, I am dry-heaving later on. Secondly, I personally get very, very itchy. One night I became so itchy the next day I had many visible scratch marks all over my chest and arms. Lastly, it's possible to become strung out on the cheeb, that is, I feel like I'm not high and continue to smoke despite the fact that I am greatly impaired. Balance is affected and driving becomes difficult and dangerous: It is possible to 'nod out' or fall into a sort of daydream in which I am not asleep but my eyes close and I enter a state of limited responsiveness.",
      "I am not addicted to cheeb, I only smoke it maybe once or twice a month and I have never experienced withdrawals of any kind, physical or psychological. Some of my friends unfortunately, have made smoking cheeb into a daily habit. They are constantly low on cash and generally in a crappy mood: After taking their first hit of the day however, they suddenly become Mr. Friendly and begin to behave energetically and sociably. In the absence of the drug, they experience negative physical effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise/discomfort. Some continuously call their dealer when he doesn't answer in hopes of scoring a sack despite the dealer's vehement requests not to do so.",
      "In conclusion, smoked heroin is a powerful method of ingestion, although less common than injection or insufflation. It can produce a strong opiate high lasting about 20-30 minutes followed by a period of drowsiness and lassitude. It is an expensive way to get high, considering the inherent wastefulness of the smoking process, but probably safer than iv use. Addiction potential is very real and the agony of withdrawal has been described as extremely uncomfortable. The high is very nice though, no way around that."

      "What you need:",
      "1 veggie burger. I used Garden Burger's Savory Mushroom. Any type will do. If you eat meat, use hamburger... A joint's amount of weed. I was lucky to have some nice bud, so I ended up using less than a joint. NOTE: Make sure you remove all seeds and stems!",

Mix and mash veggie burger & weed. (Re)-shape into a patty. Place patty on wax paper. Place in microwave for about a minute and a half. Take out, and enjoy as you would a regular hamburger! NOTE: Weed in the microwave will give off a smell, but it's very faint and goes away after a moment... ",
      "Not only is this tasty, but I didn't cough up a lung! In my experience, it took around 30-35 minutes for the buzz to set in, (similar to LSD) but the high lasted in excess of four hours! Be prepared! I had a nice, calm, stony buzz."

Hearing the syrian rue could make salvia better I had an idea: Take half a cup of water with lemon add a tsp of syrian rue, then strain out the seeds, add the salvia leaves pour into shallow dish to evaporate and scrape off everything and keep.",
      "So on friday I took my smoking blend to a freinds house. Six of us passed around a jay then I loaded a bong with my blend. It had a punch but not rocket ship power of extract, but it did not instantly go away like salvia tends too. So we pass around two bong loads of pot and a few of my blend, and we were fucked up hardcore and it lasted for several hours. It did not go away. I only had like 6 hits of pot but we all had strong closed eye and some open eye visions for 2 hours. It was a lot like a high dose of LSA but without the energy drain and bad parts of LSA. The closed eye were different too, not colors and patterns but weird objects that would change into new objects. It was a state that I had never had before way beyond stoned. It was like the brain scramble of salvia but hours long. Salvia, Syrian Rue, and Cannabis, is a great combination, a lot of synergy."

      "Several 22 mg doses of 4-aco-dmt were quickly weighed out at a friends apartment in Chelsea, the doses were distributed to a small group of people. I took the first dose and then began to convince others to join me on a journey, after about thirty minutes had elapsed the effects began to manifest themselves as a subtle and persistent mania. I had to go skateboarding, I had to go outside. I became extremely impatient. I convinced a few of the people to leave with me and left the apartment with a skateboard in hand. I walked out onto the street in New York the night was cold, but I felt good, the air felt clean. Little did I know I was about to embark on the most frightening journey of my life.",
      "I sensed strangeness in my good friend Adam who I had not seen for several days, he seemed inhibited and less funny than usual. I tried to ignore this, as the colors began to saturate my vision. Everything was coming on very slowly, very gently. 4-aco-dmt is to psycilocyben what Delsym is to Robotussin. We approached a giant metal sculpture of a needle and thread I hung from the giant needle like a sloth. I felt like we were a group of children playing in a strange post-apocalyptic playground, the atmosphere was thick.",
      "We began walking to time sq. we walked past a pizzeria and I stopped in awe of its beauty the walls were fitted with beveled mirrors, each mirror wore a crown of neon lights, the shop was empty I sat in a chair and felt infinite ecstasy wash over me, I closed my eyes and saw pure white light, the summation of the entire spectrum. The pizzeria was heaven, I was in a trance. The rest of the group wanted to leave, and I left, though I thoroughly regret it.",
      "As we approached times sq. Adam decided to take an additional dose because he was not feeling the effects as strongly as me, I told him to split 22mgs with me but he foolishly snorted the entire thing by himself, shortly after that we left the group and went off walking together. The lights of times sq. looked like an ocean and I felt like strange mutated shrimp were swimming around me. We went into the basement of a Sabarro to talk.",
      "The visuals at this point were fairly mild, less than what I would have gotten from 1/8th of mushrooms but the insanity was very much preset. I tried to engage Adam in a discussion, but he was unable to communicate with me, his observations grew more and more distorted and he became convinced that one of the group members was evil. All of his observations were retarded, and I found myself disagreeing with everything he said. He became more and more agitated, until he ran from the table into times sq. leaving me behind, I took out paper and began to write down memories I was recalling from my childhood of a baby sitter who used to hit me. Adam returned a few minutes later more crazed than before, he blurted out I'm gay and ran off again, this time not to return. All of my belongings were at his friends apartment and I had nowhere to sleep it was around 2:00 in the morning, I knew things were about to get very scary.",
      "For reasons I cannot remember I ate a transparent rolling paper I had in my wallet, then hurriedly collected my notes which were written on written on receipts I had in my wallet, I filled my hat with receipts and put it on my head. I looked very noticeably insane and was almost instantly mocked by people walking by on the street, my self-pity was overwhelming strong, I felt like a child lost in a wal-mart I wanted someone to call my parents on the PA system. I called Adam's cell-phone repeatedly to no avail. I called numerous people in my phonebook including (regrettably) my parents. I walked to a McDonalds and starred in awe at the golden arches I wanted to tell them how much respect I had for them, I walked inside and saw a drawing I had done on the wall one year previously, this filled me with an overwhelming sense of deja vu.",
      "I called Adam again and he hurriedly picked up the phone and said I'm dieing in an ambulance then hung up the phone. At this point I really started to freak-the-fuck-out. I was overwhelmed by fear, horror, sadness, confusion, and an unexpected sense of euphoria. A pure despair penetrated every dimension of my being and I became immersed in a fantasy about telling Adams parents that I was responsible for their sons death, I felt as if seeds of insanity were being planted deep inside my brain.",
      "Eventually I contacted my girlfriend and was able to go stay at her apt. The next morning I spoke to Adam after he left the hospital. He sounded differentin a bad way. He was profoundly changed by the experience, he seems to have lost a lot of the edge and humor he had before the trip, and when I told him he confessed his homosexuality to me he became extremely uncomfortable and denied it.",
      "Not something to be played with by the weak of constitution. For everyone else enjoy time-release mushrooms."

      "A tribute to 4-aces and my cousin.",
      "Before and after a 4-Aco-DET experience and 2 years later.",
      "Before my first trip, I was afraid of drugs. I did not know much about them. I knew only what I heard in school and what my parents had told me. I guess I was typical. I was upset over a girl very much so, she drank Robotussin and I looked down on that behavior. What did I know? I know now, that it was not cocaine or heroin or oxycontin that she was doing. With what I know now I would tell her that she could order pure pure DXM +-98.9 %. This was all before I had been awakened from my dogmatic sleep.",
      "I was upset. So much so that I was more upset with the drugs than I was with her. But deep down I was curious about what it is like to take DXM or any psychedelic for that matter. I would like to talk to that girl and have he share her experience with me. If only I could do it all over again but this time not to push her away and treat her like she was a drug addict. I had to get away. I went down to Florida with my mother to visit my cousin and aunt. My cousin did all types of chemicals. He just done did it. I was reading stuff all over the Internet about magic mushrooms. Mushrooms because they were natural, I assumed that they were the safest of all the psychedelics and thought LSD was the most dangerous and if you did it you were insane. I figured only people that are insane would want to take this drug. I now know that the people that do are the strongest sanest people around",
      "We got to Florida I talked to my cousin after a long disconnect. We smoke weed. I have been smoking weed for a year. I asked him about psychedelics and he told me some great stories about the adventures in his mind. He said you know, I have something in my pocket that can make you trip and it's cleaner than a mushroom trip, unlock your mind.' I was nervous but I wanted to do it, so I did.",
      "The trip was mind-blowing, I found myself on a level where I had so much access to my subconscious. Sensory overload. To enplane this type of experience is like trying to explain to a blind person what it is like to see a garden. Or be it as if an unborn twin had to explain to his unborn twin brother after he had briefly came out of the womb only to go back in and then try to explain the experience to his unborn twin brother. Or if someone reading this was to visit some space bearing civilization more advanced than us than we are to the apes. Explaining their math to us would be like us explaining 2+2 to the apes. Do the intelligent beings use psychedelics? Did they unlock the powers of them? Are they required for intelligent life to advance their civilization past technological adolescence and not destroy themselves with the discovery of radioactive isotopes? Would the blind person on a dose of some psychedelic see the light? Would the unborn twin say that is crazy talk? Or would he say you are a god and never did I here anything more divine?",
      "After I was re born into the world I was mystified. I found out about the world of research chemicals. Before the operation web trip incident, the Internet was a psychedelic playing field. After the experience I was a changed person. I was not upset about the girl and was finding out I was wrong on my assumptions. I was free. Free from the shackle of the mind but not out of the cage.",
      "This is a tribute to 4-Aco-DET and to the fight to end the drug war and the death, violence, and convictions to people who just want a free life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Murders are serving 10 months because 60% of the world prison population in drug users. ",

      "I read up on morning glory seeds a lot before I actually even bought some to try out. It was probably months and months since I found out about it, and I decided to try just recently. And here's what happened.",
      "I purchased a bunch of packets of MG seeds from Wal-Mart one night when I was with my friends. A few nights later, I took about 130 seeds, and without washing them or anything, put them in a coffee grinder, and drank down the powder with a glass of iced tea. It was pretty late, maybe 11 or 11:30. An hour and a half later, I really didn't feel much besides my body feeling a little tense, yet still nice. I sort of felt a body high coming on, I just felt kind of light and giggly also. I remember getting a grapefruit and eating downstairs, because I fucking love grapefruit and that's what I do all the time... I was on the computer for a bit after that, and had to get offline because my concentration wasn't what it should have been, and my game of spider solitaire was going miserably. So I lay down on my bed, and I just kind of smiled and rolled about for a while, because it just felt so comfy and nice to do so. But not too long after that, I began to get stomach cramps, and an odd dull pain around my belly button. I felt a little nauseous, and I wouldn't have been able to sleep through the night if I tried my damndest. So I ended up trying to sleep, but instead I'd doze off a little, only to be woken up again by sharp sickening stomach pains, and having to run to the bathroom a few times an hour. I didn't throw up, but the diarrhea was fucking rediculous. It sucked so bad. I felt like I had a bad case of food poisoning.",
      "Next morning, I got up a little late for school, probably around 7. I felt a little sick, but not too bad. I was actually gonna go to school, but I ended up staying in bed a bit, and going to the bathroom a few times. But this is where it really kicked in, and I mean the sickness. I began having horrible stomach cramps and pains again, and spent a while on my toilet with my head over my sink, just letting the saliva drip out of my mouth, because I was secreting so much, and it tasted of the morning glory seeds so much it was making me sick, on top of the nausea I was already having. I kept getting these odd painful sensations of weakness in my legs and back, and I started to feel really hot, and even sicker. I got off the toilet and went into the shower, and as I was turning the shower on, I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I was swaying a little, and everything started to fuzz up and get black, so I had to lay down in the shower before I fell down. I pretty much lay there in the shower until the water ran cold. After this I went back to bed. I felt kind of crappy all day, and had diarrhea all day too.",
      "That's probably the sickest I've ever felt, and I'm always god damned sick. I'll probably try it again, but next time wash the seeds, and use a different method of preparing them. And if I get sick this time, hell, I give up. I don't think it's worth getting that sick to trip, or to experiment with that crap.",
      "I'm not saying don't try it, everyone is different. Just start off small, and try different methods. I only had 130-something seeds, and look what happened to me."

      "I had been addicted to Methadone for about two years prior to this experience taking 10-40mg a day. After an unsuccessful attempt to wean myself off at the local methadone clinic I stopped cold turkey... not fun.",
      "I had been under about three days of horrible withdrawals with no sleep, shaking, vomiting, hot/cold sweats, and the rest of the whole nine-yards. I had moved back home with my parents two days after I stopped, and they knew I was withdrawing so I lazily laid around the house trying to get comfortable.",
      "I just wanted the withdrawals to stop! I found an old prescription of ultracet in my mom's medicine cabinet and remember doing it a couple of years ago. I broke five in half and ate them and sat down and started reading in my physician's desk reference about tramadol. I came across something rather startling... It said that people currently under alcohol or opiate withdrawals are likely to have seizures if tramadol is taken. I immediately felt sick. I started feeling much better as soon as the tramadol started working so I lay down on the couch.",
      "The next thing I remember is waking up with my mom over me and my dad hunched out of his chair like he was about to jump out. They both looked very concerned then my mom asked if I was okay. I didn't even know it had happened but my mom told me I started shaking around wildly.",
      "After a minute or so everything was normal again. They must have thought it was just a sign of withdrawals otherwise they probably would have called 9-1-1.",
      "I was fine for the remainder of the tramadol effects and had no problems resulting from the seizure. I even tried 90mg of tramadol about a year later (withdrawing again) and had no problems except for a strange in and out of it sleep. I decided that if I'm ever withdrawing like that again... no tramadol!"

      "Now Before this dreadful night Id had numerous experiences with MDMA, Amphetamines, Cocaine, Hash/weed, Opium and various strains of Shrooms and so I guess I had slightly more knowledge of psychedelics than my friends I was to be tripping with.",
      "Setting,",
      "The night began when I visited my friend 'E's flat, at the top floor of his dads bed and breakfast. I arrived in normal spirits yet hadnt expected to be eating any mushrooms, only smoking odd joints and certainly a drink or six. I had however, recently been on some strong trips- five or six- the previous month on cyanascens a POWERFUL strain which grows naturally from wood chippings here in southern England.",
      "It so happened my friend A had acquired several batches of Stropahria cubensis, from a source in the Netherlands. At approx 9pm I was offered a pile weighing 4 Grams which was swiftly washed down with some wine, while my companions, E, J, A and T had already eaten 5 or 6 Grams about 45 minutes before my arrival. The manifesting effects were glitteringly evident in J, A and E who were laughing uncontrollably, and in a tone and manner which was very different from there normal hysterics. This was something that had kind of freaked me out minor on a previous trip, not because it was disturbing (which it was) but because I was often not quite in the same state as them, Tripping Balls to quote.",
      "At T+ 1 hour I had began to get that giddy confused rush coupled with a familiar euphoric anticipation. Me and J had just stepped out to go and pick up some weed off a source of mine who was somewhat inconvenient. I waited patiently for 35mins with J for a very busy supplier, it being only a few days before Christmas he had many customers so we were forced to wait. J was getting understandably doubtful and occasionally forgetting I was there while tripping over the  sight of the scaffolding net.",
      "T+1hr 45 and were back smoking nice fruity spliffs inside from the cold. We all were feeling strong effects but werent quite peaking yet, with the exception of T who told me that he was only feeling minor effects and was of the opinion that they wouldnt hit him properly. I sat back in my chair and swilled down mouthfuls of wine trying to convey to him the deceiving character of the mushroom. I was also keenly observing his eyes, which normally sparkled blue in contrast with his ginger hair, but had become black from pupil dilation. Then after passing me a joint he informed me that he had to leave to have a roast dinner with his mum and grandparents",
      "T+2hrs We are now reaching our peak and conversation had become a random stream of difficult gibberish. I felt I was not in an ideal atmosphere at this point and began to get the restless and confined feeling that many seem to get also. T had just left in a highly strung state, feeling very paranoid about going for the meal and had poured wine in his hair to disguise himself as drunk. A was laughing hysterically making me go into creases too. We kind of sloshed around in his very littered flat, occasionally slipping on plates and crashing into furniture E and J were practically incapable of putting any visual entertainment on the computer. We staggered and babbled to and from one another passing a surviving spliff which hilariously resembled a crappy chip as we all were past capable of rolling another.",
      "T+2hrs 45 We were all in a very incoherent way and went through waves of confusion, laughter and soon enough, fear. I was enjoying myself but hadnt actually taken a single minute to think to myself about where I was mentally, or anything actually, for ages. I spent a couple of quiet minutes on the sofa stoking half a joint and watching in good humour, the condition of my companions. It was very messy. A seemed in an absolute state of hysterics, J was giggling and walking around doing a lot of things I cant remember and E kept looking at everybody with a couple of blank glazed orbs and saying shit like, Pardon? Whats happening man? Fuck, did we eat something?",
      "I was on a wave which told me to sink another beer or two as I was still not managing to keep up with all the madness, when E went crashing into A and fell very heavily into his T.V causing it to crash to the floor alongside him. This made the whole room fall silent, and at first I thought A had knocked him out somehow as I was gazing very distortedly when it happened.",
      "E began to jerk and spasm on the carpet for about twenty seconds before stopping. I began loosening his collar and trying to get a grip on things as J had just ran over seizing Es hand shouting  Oh my god! Ed! Ed! Ed!!!!!!!! A was also attending to poor Ed and we looked at each other, both holding our heads in shock. I opened one of his eyelids and it was also clear he was still breathing. We momentarily considered an ambulance but I insisted he would come around and we should take it easy. J became quite nasty snapping at me saying  No, no hes not alright, how is this fucking alright?! E had been down no longer than three minutes before he came around very shaken but remarkably clear headed in comparison to the previous events which now seemed like a whole other reality.",
      "T+3hrs  E is hanging his head down the toilet and is shoving his arm down his throat desperately trying to vomit the poison from his system. A is on the floor in the corridor next to him making sure he doesnt pass out, choke etc. J appears very pale at this point and any attempt I made at humouring him was met with a lot of coldness. J no longer seemed to want to communicate with me after his freak out, and got even more testy when I suggested we should shrug it off and settle down. Hey, Im just trying to get some fucking levity here man I exclaimed, but J had dropped me. A was kind of in the same 'jumpstart to the system state of clarity that I was in but was very quiet. It was then I turned toward J in horror to see him sliding down against a cupboard unconscious but eyes open and sank to the floor in a very alarming way. It really looked like he had just kicked it and died of shock right there in front of us.",
      "E was unaware of this at first and me and A once again stared on in disbelief as we began dropping like flies. At this point panic coursed through me very intensely. However J was quickly coming around and muttering absolute shit, which was quite nerve racking. Me and A both decided that this must be the result of liver poisoning, we both felt flutters of panic as E came back to life, and in a strange monotone began repeatedly saying CALL AN AMBULANCE, CALL AN AMBULANCE.",
      "T+ 3hrs 30  We all had all cooled down a lot, the whole event having neutralised our trip to a certain extent. E was still severely freaked and was near tears when A and me humoured him in a way that struck memories with me of a teacher trying to cheer the spirits of a schoolboy thatd fallen and grazed his knee.",
      "Well its a fucking wake up call for me, mate Said E glumly, sniveling and pulling on a cigarette. I genuinely felt for him a that moment as it was such an innocent emotion he was experiencing, and so I think I gave the bugger a hug. A and myself went and sat with J who was sitting bewildered on the sofa in a deep contemplation. Then A & J began singing a familiar old song of bollocks, announcing with no conviction that they would not be ever using any drugs again. This I found a little annoying as I knew (and was correct) that within weeks theyd be dropping ecstasy and sniffing coke again. I ventured an unwelcome bit of wisdom that with drugs, especially psychedelics, that one should either jump in with both feet or not at all.",
      "T+4hrs I couldnt leave any sooner, Id sat stoking the remaining weed with A and J before hitting the road with A I left saying stuff like No hard feelings huh? But everyone seemed too spaced to respond  anyway, and I also know that J was bitter with me for some petty reason, mainly that I shunned his initial overreaction and he may have felt some kind of ego flop. After getting outside I instantly felt ten-times-better, the cold, sobering December air was pleasing, but was left feeling alone and graduated to a sort of spooked reverie. I walked through the train station experiencing some strong alterations in perception and auditory distortions which lifted my spirits a little.",
      "T+4hrs 30 I ended up calling on one of my closest friends, Joe, and sank a chain of beers which refreshed my mind to a very good state, and after getting the whole ordeal off my chest and laughing about it I actually felt in a very good way, experiencing an afterglow which afforded a state of mental clarity and an open minded optimism which made me feel very thankful and At peace.",
      "Ive not taken psychedelics since (4 months) but have every intention of tripping soon, but in the future will not take with people who I am perhaps uncertain of, and certainly not in the casual way which was done that night, which I feel is very disrespectful of the enormity of the Mushrooms power. I am now considering, but not searching for, a hit of the world famous LSD but in safe and natural conditions of course."

    "report": [
      "My buddy M and I traveled to the Vibes fest in the Summer of 2005.  On Saturday night, Darkstar Orchestra were set to headline.  I ate the acid at the start of the show.  As I came up on the acid, I lay back in the grass and imagined I was back at a real Dead show.  The show ends, but another show is starting on the smaller stage.  It's The New Deal - and they're throwing a rave in the middle of the mountains.  Glow sticks, ravers in costumes, so much sound.  My friend V and I are dancing hard - the band makes the crowd bounce and the crowd feeds back more and more energy up to the band.  A guy named George walks by selling some Molly.  He's in a great mood and his pupils are dilated as hell, so we know it's gotta be good stuff.  V and I each buy a capsule and break it open in our teeth (bitter, bitter powder - but so worth it).  V had also eaten a hit of acid earlier that night. ",
      "As the show goes on, I start to feel that fuzzy shivering at the top of my skull that I always feel when I do E.  Also, the initial feeling of my brain chemicals shifting around is intense so I decide to go sit back on the grass for a bit.  The beats just keep pounding, pounding - the lights flashing like a mad tempest.  I sit down, and an older man to my right is in a lawn chair, laughing to himself at the scene in front of his eyes.  We get to talking, and he's good friends with the guy who runs the festival.  I'm mostly listening to him, smiling like a clown and nodding as I hear what he says.  After a few minutes of silence, he looks over at me and inquires, 'I take it you're just having a really good time tonight?'   'Yeah!' I respond.  Clearly, my eyes and my demeanor give away my state of mind.  After The New Deal is done playing I meet up with V and we wander around the grounds a bit.  We're both in such contentious and ecstatic moods that we decide to just sit down and chill for a bit. ",
      "We sit and V smokes a bowl of some hydro (I pass, feeling that my head is plenty well fed for the time being).  He and I talk for a while - about our ancestral heritage, our jobs back at home, etc. (I had only met him the day before).  The feeling of connection and harmony is difficult to translate into words.  V and I get up and find a drum circle gathered in the middle of the grounds.  There's about 20 drummers and plenty of smiling dancers.  We stand and watch the drums and the dancers as the dawn begins to break on the horizon.  My thoughts were racing around in my head, each one as joyful as the last.  I reflected on the evolution of the universe - and the gratitude I felt for getting the chance at consciousness.  The happiness I felt that life fought hard enough and long enough to spawn the Homo Sapien - the language gifted bipedal beast.  I began to feel I was transcending time - going back to the idigenous days of early humanity.  The drums - the drums, the dance.  The contrast of The New Deal which has been so electronic and modern to the drum circle which was so primal and acoustic - yet both of them clicked perfectly with the rhythm that is the cosmos, the rhythm that is life, the rhythm that is the beating heart. ",
      "Eventually, the morning rears its head in full and the drum circle dies out.  On the walk back to the tent, V and I walk by a cackling fool who informs us that he dosed Wavy Gravy earlier that evening (who knows?).  I'm still full of energy.  When I look around at the trees in the mountains, they all appear to have extra colors coating their leaves and branches.  The beats are still in my head.  For hours, they continue.  I try to sleep in my tent but it's no use.  The combination of the heat of the summer sun and the drugs in my head keep me awake.  The beats keep going - my brain synthesizes and improvises them over and over.  A good candyflippin' night it was."

      "I have had difficulty sleeping for eight years or so, and for the same amount of time I have been prescribed a myraid of medications, Temazapam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam. My sleep problem is real, but I present it to my doctors as worse than it really is in order to aquire higher dosages and more prescriptions. Because I found right away that these pills, unlike the other pills I was taking at the time, could be used recreationally.",
      "Last year, a doctor of mine wanted me to switch to Lunesta, telling me that benzos lead to habituation and aren't recommended for long-term use, which I already knew. He insisted I try it before refusing it, so he gave me a sample of Lunesta 3mg. Let me say that I was more than satisfied. In terms of sleep assistance, Lunesta is the best thing I've ever taken. With Lunesta, I can sleep for LESS than I usually need to and wake up more easily and more refreshed than with any benzo I ever took. It also helps me to get to sleep when I *want* to get to sleep, not fourty-five minutes later like some benzos (or hours later some nights with nothing). Definitely an amazing sleep aid.",
      "In addition, it provides an amazing high by itself when taken in a wakeful state. One mere 3mg pill is all I need (taking too much seems to *decrease* the enjoyability). Friends of mine have compared it to marijuana, which I do not like but can see the resemblence in effects. It causes everything to be very... amusing. Thought patterns are very noticably altered. Anxiety drops to a near zero, except for certain circumstances. Tedious tasks are quite easy, and may even seem novel or quite fun. It causes an incredible decrease in some kinds of judgement - I've been shopping while on it and found myself the owner of some very strange things the next day (an electric skillet and three cans of sweetened condensed milk!). It does not, to the best of my knowledge, impair me in so much as it causes my brain to operate on a different level. It doesn't make me stupid, just a little ADD.",
      "I experience a mild physical or musical euphoria from it. I also get a mild, metallic taste at the back of my throat (once I got used to it, it is pretty pleasant). I also have minor loss of motor control, particularly after taking an overlarge dosage. I have sometimes experienced retrograde amnesia, particularly after imbibing alcohol or smoking cannabis. There are no hallucinatory effects, which I've read to be a possibility with the related drug Ambien.",
      "It's helped me sleep, and it has been great fun, too."

      "I'm not really sure where to begin with this trip report. Salvia is definitely not like any other hallucinogen I've ever encountered, and produces some very bizarre hallucinations.",
      "First let me tell you about my set and setting: It was an uneventful afternoon and I decided that it was as good a time as any to have a go with some salvia. I started by first preparing one bowl of 10X extract, which I suspected would be a perfect starting dose. I was sitting alone in my room staring out of the window, getting myself mentally prepared for the experience to come. After about 15 minutes of quiet meditation I decided I was ready. I lit the bowl and took a nice, deep hit, comprising about 20 seconds of constant intake. I closed my eyes and held it in for 30 seconds, as instructed. After I let it out, I waited for it to take effect. I waited for about a minute until I realized not much was happening. The only really noticeable effects were a general heavy feeling throughout my body and some vague patterning. Naturally, when I opened my eyes, I was rather disappointed to still be in my room.",
      "I continued this same pattern through another 5 bowls of this 10X salvia, and was similarly disappointed. Here is where I made my big mistake: I let myself become irritated and frustrated, thus disturbing my positive mindset.",
      "I decided 'to hell with it, bring on the 40X!'(my second big mistake). I loaded up a large bowl of this stuff and did the same as before. About 5 seconds into holding my breath, the effects began. It took me totally by surprise and I actually didn't realize that I was starting to trip. First, the afterglow of my room on the backs of my eyes spun away from me and a glowing, 3-D text field appeared. The text seemed to spell out whatever I was thinking, which happened to be 'What the hell?'. As I observed the text, each letter came towards me and I saw each one in close detail. The letters were actually comprised of people! As the letters became closer and clearer, I realized that these people were all me! There I was, 10000 times, staring back at myself.",
      "The only difference was that these letter people were not happy. In fact, they looked downright insane with anger. I recall myself frowning back in the 'real world' and then everything in my field of vision totally shattered. Everything fractured and spun out of control everywhere and I was looking down on my body back in the real world, except I was a little different. On my left forearm, there was a zipper. I got closer to the zipper and it began to unzip and inside, where I expected to see my muscles, tendons, veins, etc., but instead, saw something much different.",
      "My extra-body self continued to get closer to my now unzipped arm, and eventually went inside completely. After I was inside my arm, I turned around and looked back to see that my skin and body no longer seemed to really be a part of me. My arm zipped itself back up and my field of vision began to magnify again. I zoomed in, unimaginably close to the zipper track itself and realized that the zipper was not actually comprised of the normal zipper teeth you might expect to find. Nope, instead, the zipper was made out of the same people as the text that I had seen earlier. These people seemed to be even more agitated than the last group, and they were chanting something. A louder voice rang out yelling 'there are too many of them!' in a very dramatic voice at which point the zipper people began to enlarge and get louder. At this point my physical body twitched several times, causing me to spill some bong water on my leg.",
      "This little spill seemed to bring me back to reality because, everything in my field of vision seemed to decompress and expand. With the visuals becoming too incomprehensible, I opened my eyes and looked at my body, thinking that the trip was over, but I was wrong. While the visuals were gone, the accompanying feelings were not. At first I felt primarily confusion, which gave way to fear and then panic. I couldn't figure out what I was freaking out about when I saw a tiny drop of spilled water on my desk, and what I felt afterwards is hard to articulate. I suddenly felt EXTREMELY, unimaginably filthy. I seriously couldn't stand being in my clothes and body, and this feeling of dirtiness only served to amplify my panic.",
      "I sprang up and hit my head on my loft bed. All I could think about was the filthiness. It was unbearable. I tore off my cloths and tried to rub the invisible muck off of my skin, but to no avail. I stumbled my way down the hall to the bathroom, where I turned on the shower, but realized I couldn't get in until the water warmed up, and I felt several waves of nausea flow over me, but I didn't throw up. I paced out in the hall, realizing that I had to get a hold of myself. Walked all over the house doing my best to ride out the remaining effects for another agonizing 10 minutes or so. Finally, I returned to my room and sat back down where I started. I took a deep breath and began to wonder what to make of what had just transpired. I heard the shower running and remembered my original decision to bathe, so I turned it up nice and hot, sat down, and let the steamy water wash over me.",
      "I was totally stunned at the power of this stuff, and I felt somewhat embarrassed about my panic. I've used several hallucinogens, including LSD, Shrooms and DXM, and none of them came anywhere close to producing any similar effects. While most people seem to think of LSD as being 'the most powerful hallucinogen', I'd have to say that LSD is nothing compared to salvia. During my LSD experiences, I always felt as if I were in control and even when things got a little weird, I was able to maintain my cool. Salvia, on the other hand, totally overpowered me.",
      "In retrospect, while this was probably the most difficult trip I've ever had, I would consider using it again. I've still got plenty of the 40X leaf left and I'll have to find something to do with it. I'm lucky no one was home when I did this, considering that I stomped around the house totally naked."

      "There seems to be a rich source of information from people who have lots of experience with high doses of everything. I am curious about the experiences of others who enjoy X on a much more occasional basis and offer this as my two cents. My experience with recreational drugs is limited to alcohol and a couple of hits of marijuana.",
      "I think my first X experience was with a slightly tainted batch (speed, Im guessing), as my experience was limited to a feeling of being slightly drunk, with some muscle shaking while descending stairs and very mild teeth clenching. My partner, on the other hand, experienced quite a bit of euphoria, became incredibly talkative and excited, got very touchy and acted jealous and possessive -- all behaviors that he does not normally exhibit. Another behavior he does not normally exhibit is insisting on sex (were both sex fiends and insisting is not usually necessary for either of us, but I wasnt into it four hours after taking E)- and while we both enjoyed it in the end, neither of us was able to come.",
      "NOW FOR THE CRASH: five days of UNBELIEVABLE listlessness and fatigue - felt like having the flu. A little depression - the kind that makes me think, am I a little depressed or just really tired? Nevertheless, profoundly unpleasant: physically, emotionally.",
      "I tried E for the second time because I found the changes in my boyfriend during the high so fascinating, despite the awful crash. This time was with a different, what I believe to be a purer, pill. Because I suspected we had overdosed somewhat with the first pills, I gave him 3/4 and me about 2/3. Also, we each took a bunch of Vitamin E and green tea pills a few hours beforehand. This was a very different experience for me: LOTS of euphoria, very feely, very sexual. More emotional outpourings from the boyfriend. Fabulous orgasms for both of us, and NO hangover or crash. Three more great experiences each about a month apart, then the supply dried up for five months.",
      "A new supply arrived last week and we were both so excited that it didnt occur to me to start with a really small dose. He took a whole pill and I took 3/4. Onset was very fast - within 30 minutes (usually takes  me over an hour) and I felt great, but in retrospect, I seem not to have been quite as euphoric - very, very high, but not in that fabulous way I had become accustomed to. Im completely convinced this was due to taking too much, especially as I am now experiencing the second day of a vicious hangover. Totally killed the sex drive for two days, although it seems to be back now for both of us. No depression this time, but again incredible fatigue, a bit of lightheadedness and an overwhelming need to sleep. So Im putting us on a three-week drying-out period and trying it again, maybe a half pill for me next time.",
      "Epilogue: the boyfriends emotional loosening up is always entertaining and somewhat useful. A little annoying in that he doesnt want to admit to everything he said afterwards, and hard to sort out what is meaningful. On the other hand there truly has been some meaningful progress, because he has in fact become more open in everyday life. Because of the potential for exhaustion its difficult to fit this stuff into my life but WOW is is fun!",
      "(I forgot to mention that  except for once, we have always had a drink or two shortly before taking E and noticed that the high seems to be of slightly better quality and duration with alcohol.)"

    "report": [
      "I decided to write this because there wasn't a lot of clear information about 2C-T-2 and the reports I've seen have only been about taking this chemical orally.",
      "I've tried it orally before at a dose of 21mgs and it was just a horrible experience.  It was 6 hours of vomitting and severe muscle discomfort.  I didn't have a chance to enjoy the hallucinations at all and I felt like I'd been hit by a bus the next day.  Having plenty of this left over I began to ponder seeing if I could get anything useful out of it.  Having read reports about insufflated 2C-T-7, I decided to give it a shot.  My first time trying this was with about 10mgs.. too much.  I didn't puke but felt like I was going to all night and my body was heavily discomforted.  All my muscles tightened and the next day I had a horrible headache.  The hallucinations were outrageous, though.  At one point I had put on some goa trance and I got sucked into the headphones.. not only did I see the music, but I was actually floating through it like it was a whole dimension of sound.",
      "Again I tried this substance, again by snorting, but only taking 5mgs.  This was perfect.  The hallucinations were still out of this world.  Ever shifting like LSD, but more intense like mescaline.  It seemed like a pretty good cross.  Mentally I didn't feel very strange at all.  If it hadn't been acting as a stimulant, and I hadn't been seeing and hearing weird things, I would have forgotten I had taken anything.  Incredibally vivid colors and sounds.  I stayed up all night taking short walks around my neighborhood gazing at the stars and watching cars drive by.  I was in enough control that I wasn't too afraid of anything going wrong.  But I was tripping quite hard.  At one point I remember watching the branches of trees fight each other.  There weren't really any profound or deep thoughts, however.  In my case, I was happy about that.  This is more of a substance that'd be useful to just enjoy the visuals and listening to music.  Since I was alone, I couldn't tell you if it made me feel any harmony with others.. but I doubt even if others had been around, it would have been much of an empathetic tool.",
      "On another occassion I had ingested a tablet of MDMA 2 hours prior to snorting 5mgs of 2C-T-2.  These drugs interact in a most incredible way.  The first 2-3 hours after taking the 2C-T-2 seemed to amplify the effects of the ecstasy as if I had taken at least 5 tablets.  As the ecstasy wore off I started hallucinating like I was on another planet.  Everything was so incredibally distorted I couldn't make out what anything was if it was farther than 20 feet away.",
      "On a final note, I would add that this is probably not the safest of chemicals.  In the low 5mg dose, it seemed alright.. but again.. it SEEMED that way.  From the effects I got from higher doses, it seemed as if my body didn't like it AT ALL.  As well, when I mixed with MDMA it was out of this world intense, which might not neccessarily be a good thing."

      "9:30 - this is where things get strange. I had eaten a rather large meal before taking the dex capsule, and because of this there was a distinct latency between the come up of the opiates (most of which I snorted) and the dxm, which I ate. At this point I smoked a little weed and I noticed something. At this dosage ratio, the morphine MIGHT have been stronger, but it was hard to notice because the dex was DEFINATELY potentiated. All of a sudden, I noticed the distinct patterning of dxm closed eye visuals, the opiates had a definate effect on the weirdness of the dxm mindstate, making it much clearer. Overall the effect was extremely pleasant, and I could see it being incredibly addicting for the right people. I don't know if I would up the dose any more as the feeling was already becoming sort of overwhelming at 50mg/100mg."

      "It was the third time I had come across Magic Mushrooms.  The first two times has been smaller doses, about half an eighth each time, and has been in such an environment that the trips were exhilirating and entertaining, with only slight O.E.V.'s",
      "This time, 4 of us were making the psychadelic journey.  There was me, and my friends B, J, and K.  We met at a coffee shop at about 2:00 PM and headed up to a large house in a rural, mountainous region nearby my home.  This house had just been sold by my OTHER friends, and was now occupied by about 4 of them playing video games, and little to no furniture or objects.",
      "3:00 PM. We divided up the goomies, about an eighth each, and forced them down our gullets with some orange soda.  Its all we had.  My friend K saved a few of her stems for her friend S that was supposed to be joining us later.  We all had shroom powder left on our hands, and we licked it off, which I believe made the trip kick in much faster.  As soon as we were done, we each smoked a bowl of pot out of a two liter bottle.  Again, its all we had at the moment.",
      "At this point, my three shrooming friends and I left the others, we left the house, with no sitter.  We started our walk up a rural trail that eventually led to an abandoned mine.  We never made it there. We passed by rows of widely-spaced residential houses.  We made it past them undeterred, and suddenly the visuals began.",
      "I noticed how vibrant and green the whole landscape seemed to be, and couldn't help but comment on it.  My friend K, a gorgeous young lady, seemed insect-like and insane to me, most likely because she was as pumped up as I was, and couldn't stop smiling.  We continued up the trail, all of us commenting on how the trees and bushes seemed to reach out and try to grab us.  In this part of the mountains, its very dry and dead, the predominant colors being grey and brown.",
      "Soon, K had to pee, so we stopped and she meandered back down the trail a bit while the boys, (me, b, and j) sat on the dirt trail and waited.  We began to discuss how all the plantlife resembled bodies and faces if you really analyzed them.  Although it was unsaid, the three of us were beginning to become nervous and frightened of the trees, and as for me, I was much more frightened of the implications. Let me try to explain.",
      "Every single tree and bush became a mockery, or imitation of humans.  They stood high, with their branches in the air, seeming like weapons.  They seemed threatening.  I began to wonder if this was perhaps the animals, or the gods, or some force trying to communicate to us in the only way they could, by showing us how THEY saw us.  Crude, hard material with nothing but hatred in their hearts.  As you can see, I was tripping balls, and it wasn't heading the right direction.",
      "But soon K came back in to sight, and, Lo and behold!  Her friend S had joined us on the trail.  She ingested the leftover mushrooms.  We all said hello to her, not being familiar with her, but the girls stayed somewhat behind us, talking in what seemed to be low voices.  This was not acceptable.  I kept becoming confused and asking S where she had parked, and why did she need to go back to her car?  She kept telling me, but I could not retain the information because I was too preoccupied that they were muttering things about me and my friends.",
      "Then the girls got ahead of us, and picked up the pace.  But the boys and I were thirsty, and decided to head back down the trail to get some water.  My friend B had become very serious at this point, and I later discovered that he believed he was going to die from lack of hydration.  It WAS very hot and dry.  So we turned around and headed downhill, and the girls kept wandering up toward the mine.",
      "The visuals took over at this point.  As we headed down, I would look back up toward the girls and not see them, only the blurry, nebulous mountains they were supposed to be hiking.  The mountains seemed very flat and small, and they all looked the same.  I looked toward the sky and my vision became kaleidoscopic, I saw blue prisms twisting and turning at impossible and inhuman angles, so I looked away.  I looked at my friend J, a 6'5' black man, and noticed a third eye in the middle of his forehead.  This made me nervous, and I decided we should sit down, although what I said was 'You're making me feel short, lets sit down for a minute.'",
      "Sitting there in the middle of the dirt trail, all of undergoing extreme mental and visual bedlam, with a growing sense of paranoia and panic, as we noticed a helicopter not far overhead.  My friend B says, 'In reality, we are just sitting here, tripping'.  This helps me, and I think it helps them too.  I began to look at the landscape again, and again I see faces, but this time I see them not only in the plantlife, but in everything at once.  The muddy, dry creek bed formed a 30' long frown, two dead bushes formed eyeballs, and a pile of rocks formed a nose.  I began to dwell on the question of why this planet was so unhappy that it had a thirty foot long frown, and I began to feel depressed.",
      "I could see the panic, disorientation, and fear in my friend's faces that I felt myself.  I demanded that we get moving, but J began to comment that it was too much, it was all too much, and that he HATED mushrooms, yet he kept doing them.  These comments were not helpful.  I told him to lay on his back and look at the sky, because it was more simple and it was beautiful.  He did this, and it calmed him sufficiently.  We got up and started walking again.",
      "We determined that we were lost, but B insisted he knew where we were, and since he was the most familiar with the area, we lined up behind him and placed massive pressure on the poor boy.  I knew we were all lost, including B, but there was really only one way to go, and we were just being paranoid, so we should just lighten up and keep walking.  So B is leading us, he doesn't say much, he looks very serious and sad, and ocassionaly he dodges an invisible tree branch, or stops to regain his balance, or simply to stand there with his mouth open, seeing things that I never even asked about.  J is behind me and he stops repeatedly, often screaming very loudly and stating that 'they were climbing up his socks'.  I think he had some pebbles in the fibers of his socks.  He spits, sees the discoloration from the orange soda, and tells us that its blood, and also that the Yeti is behind him.",
      "So as we journeyed down for what must have been a thousand years, I often had to grab J's arm and pull him along to keep us moving.  I tried to make small talk and light conversation with B, but to no avail.  Eventually, we rounded a corner and came face to face with an older couple, walking their dogs.  I thought about the the helicopters immediately.  Before the couple was in hearing range, I whispered to my friends to pull it together now, and just keep walking.  We did, I stopped and said something nice to one of the dogs, but kept walking.  B says that the man said 'be careful' as he walked away.",
      "Walking past the residential houses, some of them with people in the yards, most of them with dogs, was very difficult.  We had to walk in close proximity, so I kept some chatter about my sunglasses going for about ten minutes, hoping the neighbors wouldn't catch on.  They didn't, and we made it back to the house, with dificulty.",
      "Once we were in the house, things changed considerably.  I felt very much calmed,",
      "and spent the majority of the trip playing Fight Night: Round 3 with my sane friends.  B lost his mind, forgot who he was, and spent his trip wandering around the house staring off in to space, still fearful.  He told me later that he wondered how I was 'acting normal' at the point, because I was having conversation and playing games.  He had the urge to pull his eyeballs out of their sockets to stop the hallucinations.  J was doing a little better.  He played games with me, and insisted that there were people outside the window behind him.  He had trouble enunciating and forming coherent thoughts sometimes.",
      "At one point I walked in to the bathroom and looked at the tiles.  They were 6x6 white tiles.  They turned in to white whirlpools, and I saw a frog doing a backstroke around the perimeter of each one.  I think it was Mr. Frog from the 'Frog and Toad' series.  This is no joke.  Other hallucinations were mostly limited to pot-like animation hallucinations, and peripheral vision movements that kept startling me.",
      "Eventually, K showed up with S, and they had a fantastic, bonding trip up to the mine, and they felt great.  They also had a lot smaller dose than we did.  I'm not too sure what their experiences were like.",
      "Coming down was like returning from animal mode to human mode.  I felt like I was shaking off some insane, alternate personality, and coming back in to reality.  I literally shook my mane like a wet dog several times.  I was really depressed for a few days afterward, plagued by feelings of meaninglessness and insignificance of the entire world."

      "It does help. I started using this not too long ago.  I'm an insomniac and kind of a modern hippy, so I didn't want to use prescription sleep aids. The first time I only felt tired, but without the ability to sleep.  Another time it worked. Then read online that it alters dreams sometimes, and that's when it started to alter my dreams.  I don't usually have dreams, or very lucid ones. It's been a long time, and I usually have them on a Saturday, barely ever on a weekday. It was Sunday, which is usually the night I can never fall asleep or get really little of it. That night I slept for a nice 8 hours, (wish I had ten though) No dream that night.  The next night I wanted a dream so I took another 3 mg pill. ",
      "I had a crazy dream about me and my uncle buying a bunch of junk food because we had to spend 80 dollars because he wanted to get cash back I guess. we managed to get two carts full and it ended up adding to 15 dollars and 12 cents, and so I walked to an isle where this lady was stocking up the shelves with spices. I looked way up and saw a spice that said 'the missing spice' I guess it was the spice I could put in any food that'd make it just perfect. So I grabbed a little jar and it cost 326 dollars, so I asked her for a smaller sized one and it came up to be exactly 67 dollars and 88 cents. The end. I woke up.  my dreams never have a conclusion, or I guess they just end early.",
      "I relied on my internal waking system and always woke up for school with like 6 minutes to get ready.  I take the pill two hours before I go to sleep because that's when it ends up being most effective.  I wake up at 5 am, and just go back to sleep till 7 that way the most lucid dreams occur in the two hours I have.  I stopped getting the dreams after two weeks of use, and just use it for the sleep I guess. The difference between 6mg and 3mg dream wise made no difference, for me at least. It also feels less effective sleep wise also.",

I had all but given up on mushrooms, I had done them 5 times and had 5 bad trips, The last 2 times both ending in paranoid breakdowns. I felt I had done something horribly wrong, everyone hated me or was reporting me to the police, I saw girls from past relationships in the mirror looking back at me, but nonetheless I decided to trip one last time.",
      "Hallucinogenics take a long time to manifest themselves in me, usually a hour and a half to two hours, I had eaten lightly the previous day and had been ingesting Vit C for about a week prior, Thats about all the preparation knowledge I have, but it works for me. About 90 mins after ingestion, I noticed my hands were about 3 times bigger than usual, each finger the size of a whiteboard marker. I closed my eyes, I started falling through blackness, actually being drawn into it, the blackness tore open and revealed a field of red, green and blue stars and planets racing past me, a familiar hallucination that occurs in me on just about any drug, or even if Im just very tired.",
      "All sorts of odd sounds seemed to be coming from outside my room, detuned saxophones, people yelling, soft piano lines, then these sounds would slowly fade back to the traffic on the nearby highway, The world outside my window beckoned me, trees moved slowly in my direction, their branches curving around to from ornate designs, I stepped outside to the bluest sky I have ever seen, I lit a cigarette, looking at it and my hand, something seemed amiss, the scene looked very distant. I walked around my neighborhood, feeling very tall when walking downhill and about 6 inches tall when walking uphill.",
      "When I returned home I was fully tripping, it had been about two and a half hours, After using the bathroom I glanced at my reflection, this is when I completely disconnected, mirrors are usually what grab my attention when tripping and this time was no different. The light was off, so all I saw was a dark figure that seemed to be about fifteen in front of me, The figure was unrecognizable, but as soon as I though that, it became reality and my mind was gone, rather my ego, I wasnt me, The only thing in existence was this scene of the dark figure lifting its arms, it was in my field of vision but I didnt feel I was even there, It was just the only thing their, After five minutes of this (or maybe only 2 seconds) I composed myself and turned on the light, My face immediately began to melt, Then my shirt became my old football uniform, complete with shoulder pads, My shirt was black and red, so the uniform was too, unlike the purple one I actually wore when I used to play, Then my reflection became her again, a former girlfriend that I often dream about, I loudly said No! and jumped back, shaking my head, I felt exhausted so I lay down.",
      "I put on my Ipod and lay down listing to radiohead, my ipods white backlight seemed trippy, so I held  it up to my face, with a rush my whole consciousness was sucked into the sea of white light, I was in my ipod, Each note making my body jolt with a myriad of tactile sensations, Thom Yorkes voice was fluctuating from fast to slow motion, new parts of the song formed, which I remember, but dont actually hear when I listen to it now, For another hour I just laid down on my bed immobile, glued to the ground, part of it. Staring at my ceiling, It glowed brilliant White, then faded to Pitch Black, then slowly became nothing. Not Black, Not White, Not Gray, it was just nothing. A sort of transparent indescribable cloud, Kaleidoscopic arrays of color came next.",
      "I went outside to have another cigarette. I had the quintessential false feeling of sobriety, I wasnt hallucinating but something just wasnt right. I sat on a curb at the bottom of my apartment complex, To this day Im not sure if the next events actually happened. A car pulled up, its owner got out, went over to the lease office, opened the mail slot, looked inside then left, Another car did this, then another, When I predicted that the next car driving by would do the same, it did, two more times. I saw a woman walking on the street, then I would see one of the exact cars that had already passed me, pass me again. I floated home in confused stupor. While trying to sleep I suddenly felt a deep religious conviction, God was talking to me, I felt a massive sensation of guilt for all my past sins and broke into tears, After about an hour I fell asleep after twelve hours of tripping.",
      "Since then, The world has never been the same, every horizon appears to be painted, with all sorts of specs of light dancing in it. Stationary objects stand out much more, I occasionally experience flashbacks of varying degrees, sometimes a clocks hands disappear, sometimes I mistake a car or bush for a fully formed person, in khakis watching me and smoking a cigarette, I was diagnosed with Persisting Perception Disorder, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder in 2007 and have since ceased the use of hallucinogenics, I still remember the last trip I had though, It was undoubtedly the most profound and mystical experience I have ever had, But if your mind is still clear, and you havent tripped yet, remember its not for everyone"

      "The day I decided to take such a large dose of Seroquel, it wasn't even a planned descision, I have a history of impulsively taking drugs to end my soberness when I'm feeling bad or, just plain want to end soberness. I had an argument with someone and was pissed and depressed and decided to down 10, 100mg pills at about 3:30 AM one morning.",
      "4:00 - I was still online talking to people, still no effect",
      "5:00 - No real effect, maybe a slight Marijuana buzz, when I looked around at a rapid pace, my vision smudged and dragged behind a little bit, but nothing serious",
      "5:20 - I leave a note near my bed saying what I took and how much of what I took, in case something bad happened (note was to parents if they found me having a seizure or something) and I try to sleep.",
      "5:21 - every couple of seconds I have a very alarming experience, I have my eyes closed and I'm trying to sleep, but I see myself awake somewhere else and I go to do something, then my arm moves, moving my actual arm, forcing me to wake up, this happened several times until the scariest one happened.",
      "5:25 - I see myself in my kitchen, standing on a bowl, balancing, then I lose my balance and fall on the table, and I jerk myself awake scared shitless almost",
      "5:30- I decide I can't take it anymore and I wake up my parents, they are asking me shit like why would you do that? and what's wrong with you? and all I would do is scream because I felt totally disconnected and on the edge of passing out, my mom called poison control for advice and we were told to go to the hospital",
      "6:00- We arrive at the hospital, while in the car I kept passing out and my mom kept shaking me awake, my heart was also pounding really really fast. I am put into a hospital bed, and hooked up to an IV and vital signs machine, I remember little for the next 12 hours. Apparently my blood pressure went to a disturbingly low 63 over 30 and stayed there for several hours, and a doctor asked me if it was a suicide attempt and I just casually answered that it was a recreational attempt, but I have no recolection of this, also, nurses kept trying to pry my eyes open for me to look at them, but it was so damn hard to keep them open, and overall the nurses irritated me, I didn't lose it tho, every1 is lucky I didn't lose it.",
      "1:00 PM: I am transferred to a different hospital where I am to stay the night, I remember the whole ride and all, but I went to sleep again as I got to my hospital room.",
      "The rest of the time at the hospital was long and shitty, the vital signs machine alarm would go off whenever my pulse went below 50, causing me to wake up and get no sleep since my natural resting pulse is between 45 and 65. I was in the hospital for 30 hours and now my relationship with my parents is lower than it already was which I didn't think was possible.",

      "I recently acquired a prescription for adderall, a substance which I have had many months of positive and very negative experiences with. I just took 40 mg about twenty minutes ago, and I'm already recognizing the coming euphoria. It starts at the head, a small tingling effect, and I become more alert of my surroundings. As the alertness intensifies, so does my desire to just do something, anything. But the part of adderall I got most addicted to, and still struggle with, is the massive appetite suppression.",
      "I struggled with my weight when I was in elementary school and junior high, and my obsession with weight and getting thinner began around seventh grade. Although I never really bothered to do much about it, I thought about my weight constantly. The years went by, and nothing eventful happened. I got progressively more and more depressed, and instead of working out or trying to eat healthier, I used food as a coping mechanism. I just couldn't figure out how to flip that switch in my head to turn the 'FOOD' signal off. It was then, in eleventh grade, that I discovered adderall.",
      "The first time I tried it, I really hadn't meant to. I was sitting alone in a hallway, and a girl came up to me and just started talking to me. She later told me she was on adderall at the time, which makes the very sociable behavior understandable. I glared at her all the while, wondering why she was talking to me. I then asked, sarcastically, if she had any 'uppers.' She laughed and said 'Actually, yes I do.' She pulled out a pretty little prescription bottle and popped two 20mg, peach colored adderall into my hand. 'Down those with a coke. You'll feel better.' she promised. She was right.",
      "The rush came quickly, as I hadn't eaten anything so far that day. Again, it was the tingling sensation first, crawling down my body. Then it was the increased awareness of my surroundings, almost like I hadn't seen colors before, and all of a sudden such wonderful colors were everywhere around me. Imagine a blind man suddenly being able to see. I smiled constantly, and babbled with her to no end. We virtually competed for who could talk about the most random things the fastest. It was such a wonderful, euphoric rush. I suddenly thought to myself, wow, this is what it's like to be normal. Not quite.",
      "As the high continued, I noticed my thoughts of food completely subsided. Not only did they subside, but when I thought of food, the thoughts merely grossed me out. This had never happened before. I asked Leslie, my 'best' friend by this point, if she received that effect from it. 'Yeah, but I just smoke some weed to offset it.' I wondered why the hell would you want to offset the feeling that food doesn't control your life. I bummed about six more pills off of her before the end of the day. Her doctor had prescribed her a bottle of 120x 20mg pills, to be taken 4x daily. She said she rarely took more than 2 a day, and she was more than happy to supply me with my little, peach appetite killers. My obsession began.",
      "To make matters worse, as I began to lose weight, which started almost immediately. I virtually stopped eating, consuming less than 400 calories a day. People would compliment me. 'Wow Lex, you look great. Keep it up!' etc. I loved it, and it gave me a feeling of power. The feeling of power, combined with the powerful euphoric feelings the adderall gave me, I quickly started becoming a different person. I wore my hair differently, I dressed sexier, and I tried harder to fit in. When I'd gone from 155 lbs down to 130, I decided that I was done using some girl for my adderall. I wanted it myself.",
      "I convinced a psychiatrist that I had a horrible case of ADHD, and that adderall was the only drug for me. It was my 'savior.' Ironic how this term can be applied in so many ways. I thought I was finally saved from my weight obsessions and the constant weigh-ins with myself, the endless lists of foods I made during the day that I would eat later, the limitless combinations (never above 400-600 calories!) that I could eat. However, something strange happened when I got the adderall for myself. It was no longer enjoyable for me. In fact, it became like a burden, and a my obsession with getting thinner rose, so did my doses of adderall.",
      "I started taking the 60mg a day I was prescribed, along with two to three more 20mg pills per day that I would get from Leslie. The euphoric rush was gone after about two months, and the only reason I took adderall was to control my weight. I really thought I was in control, but in reality, my weight, and the adderall, were controlling me.",
      "I'd first used adderall in early October of 2006, and by that christmas, I was down from 155 pounds to 120. I am 5'9', and 120 was a low weight for a girl my height. People stopped commenting positively on my weight, and started advising me to 'eat up' over the holiday. My family in particular was worried. They were completely oblivious to my obsession, however, and I was fine with that.",
      "I won't detail the following 3 months, but they happened pretty much as follows. I continued to take adderall, and started almost eating less than I was before. By late February I was down to a mere 100 pounds, a nice 'even' number I'd decided on. But I wasn't happy. In fact, I was miserable. My misery surprised me, and I was mad at myself for not being more content with the 'progress' I had made. In March 2007, my parents finally figured it out, and took the adderall away. Now, here I am, once again taking adderall, this time illegally, and wondering where I'll go next. I'm up to 125 pounds now, but I still obsess, with or without the adderall."

      "As I woke this Sunday morning I found myself in the warm blanket of the sun at my friend L's house. The night before was an all night spiritual jam with guitars, banjos, xylaphones, drums, rainsticks, High Dro etc. L woke up with my bong packed with some crystally stuff that reflected the light of the sun. She told me it was the coveted DMT. I had read everything there was to know about Dmt. I was one step away from being an expert. I got a headrush as I pulled my lighter up to the bowl. 'hold it in' L said as the sparks and flame lit the Spirit Molecule.",
      "When I saw the bowl was cashed I pulled the slide, before I could rip it, the rest of the world diffused into obscurity. Colors danced from around my head. they were so far away and I could still make out every detail. But wait, I heard a voice. The Voice sounded like every molecule in the entire known universe coming together to give me a message. I felt welcome. Just as soon as I saw complete darkness, I saw a womanly figure growing closer. The Voice also was getting louder. The Womanly Figure was right in front of me. Her skin glistened with the shine of millions and millions of suns. Her palms gleamed with light, colors streamed away from her and wrapped me up and laid me down. The Voice was speaking another language, maybe that of a far away species of beings in another galaxie, but I understood. For hours she told me stories of her times. Her eyes were not those of a woman, but those of universes together forming a noble being. Her book in her lap was as big as a planet. as she turned the page the old ones crumbled into the past. 'Need those days, you will not, my son.'",
      "As I was about to reply to The Voice, I was back in L's living room. I felt enlightened. I was too amazed to stand up. I laid there for hours."

    "report": [
      "The Substance and its Source: While talking to a highly reputable entheogen supplier and acquaintance of mine about recent extractions of kava kava and future hopes of performing extractions on kratom leaf, he produced a bottle of an isolated kratom alkaloid, 20mg 7-Hydroxy-Mitragynine, dissolved in 10ml of ethanol. From what I understand, very little is known about the effects of the isolated alkaloids of kratom, and the extraction of 7OHM from kratom requires some fairly advanced lab procedures such as column chromatography. I purchased the bottle for $25CND and proceeded home.",
      "As there is so little information to be found about 7OHM and no previous experiences on Erowid, Ill include my limited knowledge of the substance.",
      "7-Hydroxy-Mitragynine is a potent partial opioid agonist (could be a full agonist but I believe I read something about it acting on the mu-opioid receptors specifically). Though content by weight in kratom is quite low compared to other alkaloids, it is currently believed to be one of the most active. Lab tests on rats resulted in strong opiate agonistic effects, and seem to have a stronger analgesic effect, in terms of dosage weight, than morphine (This fact causes some confusion for prospective users, and just because it is more active by weight does not mean it feels better or will get you higher). Unlike morphine, 7OHM is very orally active. 7OHM cannot be made into a hydrochloride salt, anything sold as 7OHM in solid form is likely something else. The source of this substance seems to play a major role in its quality, as suggested doses seem quite high (possibly even dangerous) in retrospect and the few reports Ive read about 7OHM attained from online vendors, appear exceedingly mild.",
      "Subjects:",
      "3 college students all experienced in a wide variety of psychoactive substances",
      "Myself- male, 125lbs, 511 substances of choice  opiates",
      "L- female, 150lbs, 54 substances of choice  amphetamines, psychedelics",
      "M- male, 135lbs, 55 substances of choice  cocaine, alcohol",
      "Experiments:",
      "Took the 7OHM two different times.",
      "The first time, we began by looking up as much possible information on dosage as possible. We found almost none, except one suggesting a dosage range of 5-15mg, which in retrospect sounds excessive. We had no real accurate way of measuring the dosage except for the dropper on the lid of the bottle, so we decided to start at about  of what the dropper was able to pull into it. The first dose, even though considerably smaller than 5mg, produced immediate effects. Over the course about 5 hours we took approximately 4mg (or 2ml each) of 7OHM each by squirting the dropper into our mouth and attempting to hold the rather hot (from the alcohol) and pharmaceutical tasting liquid for as long as possible before swallowing. We all felt quite relaxed and spent most of the time indoors, except for a short walk M and I took.",
      "Taken in this manner the substance produced definite and noticeable effects. Almost a minute after taking the 7OHM I began to feel as if I were coming up on Hydrocodone, but it was a much cleaner, more lucid kind of high. At less than a dropper-full, there was a warming rushing calming kind of sensation, which peaked after about 30 minutes or so. Smoking a bowl seemed to prolong the effects. As we continued to take small doses like these over the course of the night however, a longer term of sedation occurred, and at about 2  dropper-fulls, M felt sick but the feeling subsided after a few minutes. Also, I noticed 7OHM is by far the best aphrodisiac Ive ever had. When I came on this drug it felt like I was taking nitrous oxide almost. I had the feeling afterward that I had experienced something much closer to a female climax than is usually possible for myself, and have wondered for some time since what men are really missing out on when it comes to pleasure.",
      "The second time, after a day off, just L and I took the 7OHM. Feeling comfortable with the effects of the drug, we decided to experiment with what more concentrated dosing could yield. Knowing that the come up on 7OHM can be somewhat intense, we thought it best not to dose up to the desired level all at once, but to space it out over the course of 1  to 2 hours, taking 1 dropper full every half hour at first, and then with slightly less time in between as we became sure we could handle the dose. With this method we ingested the last 2/5 of the bottle.",
      "While I think it may not be for everyone, for L and I this seemed like the best way to go. This method of ingestion produced a long pleasurable (euphoric, but not to the level of full opiate agonists) come up, followed by strong physical sedation and analgesia, but with a much more lucid mental state. With this method of dosage, during the sedated period of the high L and I were still euphoric and talking was enjoyable.",
      "Effects Summary:",
      "All 3 subjects reported that ingestion of small doses of 7OHM, even a dose of less than a half a milliliter of the solution, results in an enjoyable rush, similar to coming up on a stronger opiate, which lasts about half an hour and subsides in a relatively short period of time to a subtle but definitely noticeable calming effect. Though the majority of noticeable effects fade rapidly, further dosing, even after euphoric effects have dissipated, results in another less noticeable rush followed by longer lasting analgesia and mood elevation.",
      "L and I noticed administration of consecutive small doses of 7OHM, far enough apart to avoid nausea, with a cumulative dose of approximately 4mg over 1  hours, results in a much more pronounced euphoric rush, which continues through the dosing phase and doesnt begin to dissipate until an hour or two after the last dose. This higher dose produced definite euphoria, as well as extreme analgesic effects. Movement became difficult and L could barely balance herself, yet our minds seemed to remain clear and lucid. Mild respiratory depression was present, as well as cardiac stimulation (to a degree uncharacteristic of other opiates). While I cant say that there was a definite hallucinogenic effect, L and I both seemed to experience some unusual visual distortions and enhancements in color, however this could be exaggerated due to a resurgence of previous hallucinogenic experiences triggered by more mild-moderate visual effects of 7OHM, as L and I both experience some level of persisting hallucination. Despite all these effects L and I had surprising mental clarity and cognitive ability for such a high level of physical sedation/analgesia.",
      "The first time taking 7OHM, there were no noticeable effects the next day except for maybe some apathy and a strong desire to stretch.",
      "The second time there were slight effects the next day, the worst of which being lethargy and some general agitation.",
      "Conclusion:",
      "From the effects I experienced, my hypothesis would be that 7OHM acts strongly on mu (respiratory depression, euphoria, possible but not unavoidable nausea, analgesia) and sigma (cardiac stimulation, hallucination) opioid receptors.",
      "7OHM is a very pleasant, relaxing alkaloid I wouldnt mind using in the future. It does not seem to be as physically draining or addictive as opiates can be, and though my experiences with 7OHM were quite good I feel no real need or strong desire to take it again in the near future. Of our 3 subjects, M was the only one who got sick, and the feeling subsided after a short period of time. I believe though that there is a danger of overdose similar to that of any opiate, and as sensitivity to 7OHM seems to vary drastically, people just starting out with it should treat carefully.",
      "Far beyond the recreational uses of this drug I believe are its pharmaceutical applications. For the past few weeks Ive been coping with nerve pain in my left elbow. On the first night I took 7OHM, the pain was rather severe. After taking just the first dose, the pain was notably reduced. After another dose the pain was gone completely, even after the euphoric come up subsided. When taking the doses more rapidly the analgesic effects were some of the strongest I have ever experienced, I felt completely disconnected from my sense of touch. On this dose, the never-ending funny-bone sensation in my elbow and entire left arm, for the first time since the injury, almost was funny. The sensation turned from pain into sort of a warm tingling. While on opiates Ive always felt pain was still present but I was more placid about it, on 7OHM pain was simply nonexistent. I really feel the medical industry should look into this alkaloid more, as well as individuals with severe pain looking for a less addictive more effective alternative to pharms like oxycodone and morphine."

      "Began with 35 grams Mimosa Hostilis dried inner bark. It has a purple hue to it and exudes a purple dust cloud when broken apart. The bark was pulled apart into  inch strips less than the width of a quarter. The Bark was then placed into a jar with 350ml of purified water and 150 ml lemon juice plus 500mg vitamin c. The jar was shaken regularly at 5-minute intervals for 2 hours before opening. It smells like lemons everywhere. The liquid and pulp was then boiled for 6 minutes on low heat before straining. The bark was then put back into the pot with 400ml of water and the juice of two lemons. The straining process was repeated before discarding the bark and pulp. The final mixture of liquids was then boiled down from about 700ml to just below 600ml. This means that the dosage is just below 200ml per person, what appeared a reasonable amount to swallow.",
      "For all intents and purposes, A, B, and C will represent the three participants in the study. Though floating in and out of tenses, all perspective-based writing remains in the head of participant A.  Participant C presents a cursory description of effects, along with tips to facilitating the most rewarding at-home experience.",
      "+0:00- Weight and chemically appropriated doses of powdered Syrian rue are measured out, along with three 200ml doses of brew.",
      "+0:01- A ingests 1.8 grams powdered Syrian rue. B ingests 2.3 grams of the powdered rue. C ingests exactly 2 grams with little complication. The powder is dry and coats the throat like a spoonful of cinnamon. There is no amount of water to quench a powdered throat, only time and saliva will do. The powder is bitter beyond reckoning, which makes the process of working it down the throat even less desirable. The taste subsides slightly however, with a small swig from the Listerine bottle.",
      "+0:10- My jaw is tingling. My face is full of pressure and my stomach has two butterflies (only two) duking it out at the early gates of heaven.",
      "+0:15- First bitter gulps. The brew had an olfactory appearance of little to no threat. It smelled much like tea with lemon and with an intriguing purple hue and oddly mystical low-swirling fog seemed far from the claims of retch, or that the taste alone could be the cause for sickness. During the cooling process however, it attained a slight odor of armpit. Upon drinking, it became obvious that the pleasant odor was quite deceptive. The slightly textured slop burns with acidity that sticks to and rapidly dehydrates the inner mouth.",
      "+0:20- 100+ml now down the hatch(es)",
      "+0:25- The body is quickly overtaken by an overwhelming repulsion towards any use of energy. The ability to move, speak, and interact are all present but carry an innate sense of discomfort.",
      "+0:30- A vomits. After ingesting second gulp, B experiences mild but constant nausea that remains unrelieved throughout the experience.",
      "+0:40- B has first visual hallucinations, mostly involving minor light and color refraction and shifting. The brew has had substantial effects on subject B, leading to a discontinuation of the drinking process at slightly less than 100ml.",
      "-The face is very full now and pulsating slowly while my stomach writhes quietly in what feels like a small vortex in my intestines beginning to twist them up.",
      "+0:50- After a second violent expulsion that led to extreme perspiration, the shower seemed for both A and C to be a viable source of comfort. This proves to be a good choice, leveling the head, centering the body, and most importantly facilitating the peak of visual hallucinations.",
      "As the plane of vision is normally shortened vertically as it is elongated into the distance it may seem possible theoretically for the distance to be so great that the height is barely noticeable, even absent. This process occurs in full force within all three great dimensions as the water runs down my face. All of existence (time, social constructs, physical manifestationsetc.) is compressed into the paper thin plane of purple and yellow that floats not far away, but what seems like it must be universes of difference. What exists outside the plane cannot fit be processed in any language other than that of the mind and the absence of everything in the plane. Imagine, if you will, a child growing in the womb. The womb is all that existence entails for the growing child. It contains all known notions of time and being and all the applicable social constructs and structures.",
      "Imagine now, that the womb is gone, though not in the sense that it disappeared, but that it was never there to begin with. The mind is reduced to its internal structure and base form. This is what remains outside of the plane - nothing but the mind. In the great void of being, a small red dot appears as far as the eye can see. Upon a focusing of the eyes, the dot grows to become a rose and it is not the dot that is growing at all(!) but the distance that is shrinking. Before one could say disambiguation the rose is all that the eyes can see. For a brief passage of time, as the rose remains at precisely the correct distance, every detail, every perfectly systematic thread of every petal is visible. Soon however, the field of vision is overcome with the brilliant red and orange hues of the rose. There is nothing but color. Blink, back in the shower.",
      "+1:15- Though the true-hallucinations (i.e. hallucinations not derived from or manipulations of what already exists, but complete fabrications of the mind) have ceased their brief but powerful overwhelming of the senses, there are still potent lingering hallucinatory effects. The ceiling for instance, is not normal.",
      "There is a skin on the ceiling made of thin and pliable wax. It is pliable by the forces of gravity and of the movement of the eyes. Darting eye movements require a moment for space and vision to catch up. Upon closing the eyes, the mind and body are for the first time simultaneously overwhelmed by a mutation of the body. Various points of the body, both as an image-like manifestation in the closed eye plane of view and as a physical awareness. The body elongates and contracts, bulging with energy at the points of return. The hallucinations of the mutating body seem to run away from the comprehension of the mind, constantly a single step away from synchronicity. This multi-faceted experience immediately triggers an overwhelming sense of deja-vu, dating back rather than recently, to early childhood visualizations in the moments before sleep. The visualizations are not unique in this however, as the entire body is overcome with a feeling of familiarity and comfort.",
      "- At this point, participant C experiences a radical perceptual objectivity, rendering all five senses mere distractions. Following lines of logic was more pleasurable than the here and now.",
      "+1:30- The motivation to talk or move begins to show its first minimal signs of presence, as they have been entirely absent as of the MAOI ingestion. Though still physically lethargic and heavy, the mental instinct of repulsion towards movement or labor is no longer present.",
      "+2:00- The senses retain a general provocative psychedelia of auras, both auditory and visual, sometimes expanding into potent hallucinatory manifestations.",
      "+2:15-  In the majority, the effects have ceased. The minor physical lethargy still lingers with a general feeling of warmth and well-being. Though still not entirely absent, the hallucinogenic properties of the drug seem to be potent but short-lived.",
      "+2:45- After thorough musing, appropriate reflection, and the occasional outburst of laughter, A and B rejoin the ranks of structured society and begin a walk with the generous sitters, reveling in the potent journey of the afternoon.",
      "Though initially the effects of the psychotropic substances seemed absent after a short duration of time, retrospectively, the effects lingered almost unnoticeably in the background. The general field of vision retained minor distortion, and the cognitive processes affected by the ingestion do not return entirely to their original states for almost a full 24 hours.",
      "Details, and hallucinations",
      "The following is a written record of experience by participant B.\r",
      "The ceiling is not a ceiling at all, it is a force, a moving flowing being. Its outside is a skin of spidery cobwebs brown in color, and inside it is a writhing mass of energy in a wondrously eclectic and heterogeneous mixture. My body does not feel the bed, my body only feels the most sentient and tangible of things. Then there is no body only mind, a mind harmoniously connected to every other atom in the universe through time and space and an overwhelming desire to be. Its so clear. But the present calls, the body needs food and water and rest and time passes even while one is away. To be one must fulfill the petty desires of bodily chemical reactions, so it must for clearly this is what the universe desires.",
      "Good Time Advice",
      "1. Keep the rue powdered. Adding the powdered seeds to a beverage will merely prolong the acidic taste of the rue. Take a deep breath and hold it.  Throw the powder to the back of your throat, making sure not to breathe while the powder is inside of your mouth because it truly tastes vile.  Immediately follow up with a strong-tasting, pleasant chaser.  Hawaiian Punch for instance, provides enough sugar and flavor to overpower the acidity without the need for mass ingestion, possibly leading to additional intestinal complication. On this note, ensure that your chaser isnt too high in Tyramine.",
      "2. In regards to the Mimosa based beverage, also have a strong chaser very nearby. Plugging the nose for a good 15 seconds before drinking, and keeping it plugged, was relatively effective in preventing the taste from becoming overwhelming.  Also, since the bitter flavor lingers, rinsing the mouth between gulps with strong mouthwash made the imbibing process far less painful.",
      "3. Directly following the ingestion, sitting or lying still greatly reduced the bodys initial repulsion towards the liquid.  Anticipate, however, an intense vomiting period to come.  It happened happen, and it seemed to focus on the face, dont be afraid if your cheeks and eyes swell up a bit more than normally, itll go away shortly.  This clearly initiated the beginning of the DMT experience for A and C, the two of the three that threw up.",
      "4. Even after anticipating the process of vomiting, it was more overwhelming than we thought!  A shower is an easy way for to clean off without having to focus on the process of cleaning, and leaving one to begin the journey unfettered.  It also brings the body temperature back to normal in a quick, relaxing manner, after throwing up so much, the body tends to get very warm and unpleasantly sweaty.  Coming out of the shower can be a good way to clense the body of the remnants of the purge",
      "5. A very rewarding part of the experience was when thoughts were directed inward, rather than focused on the setting.  Unlike many other psychoactive chemicals that encourage the individual to marvel at the beauty of the external world, DMT seems to encourage introversion and personal discovery.  Dont be afraid of just sitting down for the entirety of your experience  it can be just as powerful, and can take you just as far.",
      "Reflection",
      "The experience as a whole was unlike any other, both of substance and of mind. In comparison with other psychotropics, specifically those commonly referred to as psychedelics, it was remarkably unique, though contained hints of familiarity from several substances. The experience is not all inclusive as many psychedelics tend to be, stirring the vast sensory input into a cosmic goop through which one experiences the world as whole, with sight, sound, smell, taste, and the countless senses of the remaining body and mind as a single experience. The body can experience an unparalleled sensory overload while the mind remains placid, or drifts into wanderless meandering, while the eyes, still a separate entity, can experience vast sensory input and manipulate and augment the field of vision in an entirely unrelated manner. The diversity of the non-integral experience leaves a lingering desire to explore that may be assisted in the future by the use of a more powerful MAO-A inhibitor or perhaps a higher dose of DMT. The journey however was far from unsatisfying, but not for the light of heart."

      "The first time I had ever heard of GHB was on a trip to Huntsville with my friends and at that time I was just big into marijuana and shit like that.  I knew this guy from church and he had some cause his dad was a nutrionist and could get the shit for him. He had it cut with some stuff to make it not so strong but it would still fuck you up.  We were riding around after church one night and he had a bottle of it and was selling a cap for 5 bucks and it was cheap so I decided to do it. Well just before then me and my friends had decided to buy a 20 bag of pot to smoke that night to. They told me that it would fuck me up good and bein my size, 5'7', I would be totally fucked up.  I haven't done much drugs but doing this shit totally fucked me up.",
      "I took one capful and the stuff smelled and tasted like ass but i figured hey if it fucks me up I don't care what it tastes like so  I took it.  We then went to go get some pot and I was hyper as hell and wanted to fuck just about anyone.  I felt damn good and sorta was looking to fight someone.  We got to the dealer and got the pot and more people showed up and bought some and we all decided to match blunts and we all rolled some about 5 or so and we started smoking which I got completely blowed off this shit cause it was some fire.  We smoked it and then decided to leave and I decided then I was fucked up.  We drove around and I felt great and was looking to fight someone or fuck the hell out of a girl.  At that time I didn't care what she looked like just if she wanted to fuck.  I felt great for about an hour.",
      "The Mess Up",
      "After an hour I started feeling like shit and I needed to puke. I had had tacos that night and it was tearing into my stomach.  I told my friends to pull over so I could get out but I just started puking all over my friend's car.  I finally made it outside and puked about 3 minutes.  That made me start tripping.",
      "My Trip",
      "We went to go smoke some pot after I puked and stopped at this boat dock.  I didn't know where we were and thought we were parked on 12 feet of snow.  I was tripping out hard.  I thought I saw a guy talking to me for about an hour while they smoked the pot.  My friends said I was talking to noone for a long time and kept saying that we were going to fall through the snow.  There was no snow on the ground it was just white pavement.  About that time my eyes started REM (Rapid Eye Movement).  I couldn't focus on anything and I was freaking out.  My friends didn't know what to do.  I got home about 2 hours later and went to sleep.",
      "My Experience all in all",
      "I liked the feeling I got off of it and would definitely recommend it.  I did it about 3 days after that and had no problem comboing with marijuana.  I had a definite good experience then.  The last time I did it was about a week ago and I smoked alot of pot and did a capful and drunk about half of case of beer and have never felt that great."

After around 2mg intranasal, I noticed some irregular heartbeats consistent with mild stimulation, plus a sudden urge to empty my bowels. I'm at around 2.5ml (=mg) and once again it feels like a couple cups of coffee. I have decided to take it up to 5mg and will load another couple ml into my nasal pump. I feels that ",

Note that I have something of a general stimulant tolerance, if there is such a thing.",
      "+ ~00:30 - solid 3mg ingested, I finally notice a little euphoria! This is much better...  I will go slow on the last 2mg.",
      "+ ~00:45 - (~4mg) feels something like a couple solid lines of coke in terms of both degree of stimulation and general enjoyment. I should probably just stop here, but dunno. In any case, I am much happier with this stuff today and highly recommend that it's used when the body is well fed and rested, which is a good general reco. for enjoying oneself on any stim.",
      "+ ~01:00 - I have slowed down/backed off at ~4.5mg... except for the degree of intestinal activation I'm very, very happy with this substance. Final post here will be when it appears to be wearing off, barring any unforseen events.",

      "+ ~02:35 - That's enough... although fiendish, the substance gives a clear warning sign I have learned to heed/obey or pay the price (propylhexedrine gives this too, strangely methylone does not and I could abuse myself to death on it).",

Doing/coming off of MDPV is like winning a Mercedes and being told at the last minute they got your name wrong. Uggh. In the future I will have to reserve kratom for the aftermath, but being so close to my recent 'O.D.' + severe stomach issues I don't dare use any for at least a couple days... that was far too traumatic to risk again so soon.",

      "+00:30 since redose - on the way back up, bowel stimulation noted right away. If same level is not reached at ~4mg as last time, I will give up completely and absolutely not push the bounds of this stuff (and next time I'll go rectal for improved bioavailability, and probably duration of effects too). I likely have yet to find the optimal (for me) way to administer this stuff.",
      "+00:38 since redose - Entire 4mg administered, I will wait and see if peak occurs at 60-90 min. as before, and what that peak looks like. Still nothing even remotely resembling anxiety/panic, just an obvious energy boost.",
      "+01:00 since redose - High is not comparable to the first time. Feels much more jittery and less pleasant. If this changes, I will say so and I'll post about it.",
      "+02:45 since redose - Added a mg or so to nasal atomizer somewhere in there (sigh... at least it's not hit after hit like smoking would be). Nearly at or over personal dosage limit (fingers tingling slightly), but things are currently good. Peak has likely been hit, but no sign of downslide in effects yet. I am frankly about ready for it at this point. A sedative has been prepared on the side in case it's needed.",
      "+03:15 since redose - Very interesting... substance appears to still be fully active, albeit still jitterier than the first dose. Let's hope this doesn't turn into some 6+ hour thing, or whatever. This was unexpected, but if there's a 'build up in the system' effect then in retrospect it's not surprising. Others have noted 'anxiety attacks' after a couple redoses (despite feeling like they came down in between) and attributed it to overdosage. It appears re-dosing once may be 'necessary' with this substance to fully enjoy it, unless brief effects are wanted for some specific reason (such as a sexual encounter, followed by sleep).",
      "+04:15 since redose - Substance is still fully active in my system, no sign of comedown yet. I hope there won't be an ugly crash this time . I am going to pre-emptively go with the sedative, there should still be enough MDPV effect to tell when it's wearing off (and the stimulation is becoming annoying).",
      "+06:00 since redose - Effects definitely on the downswing (I can instantly check sexual responsiveness to see what dopamine's doing in my brain). It may still be a while until I'm 'completely' down. Feels like the crash is gonna be worse this time, but nothing twisted or evil after this short a period of dopamine depletion. I have been to coke parties where a friend begs me piteously for a single small line, knowing it's the last anyone has for the night. None of that crap around here.",
      "+07:00 since redose - Aftermath. Better than most stimulants, frankly. Better than anything but a short methylone run, better than propylhexedrine, *far* better than coke. I ate something and had a cup of black tea (brand contains only a small amount of caffeine). I feel back to baseline now, no depression and no cravings unless he purposely thinks about the drug. Another hour and a half or so browsing the web, then off to bed. Hope you have enjoyed reading this first report... MDPV requires caution, but appears to reward patience and experience (anyone can get there, but the latter requires the former).",
      "Notes on the high: My appetite is killed by this stuff, but I managed to force 1/2 a protein bar no problem. Constant fluid intake maintained, as is my practice on stims. Increased stomach acid (as noted below with snapper's monkey). Periodic muscle spasms (mainly in face and legs) minor but evident. Some lower back pain/strain, as with any stimulant. Heart rate seems to be boosted very little, likely BP too (minimal peripheral sympathomimetic effects) although he's on a low dose of beta blockers. Boost in sexual interest present = telltale sign of increased dopamine. Periodic 'standalone' euphoria noted, but it's mild compared to some other stimulant substances."

      "I started by taking two tabs in my room at +0.00. The guy I got them from said that each tab was 100-150 micrograms. The tabs tasted slightly bitter/metallic as soon as they touched my tongue, but after they were wet they had no taste. I left them under my tongue for 30 minutes, then chewed up and swallowed. Apart from the utter excitement, around the +0.30, I started to get my first effects. Uncontrollable laughter and a general feeling of something happening, something changing. After about +1.00 I saw the first signs of visual distortion, the face on my digital clock is flat, but it looked like it was bubbling up and the numbers were morphing. I could look at my clock, then look at the wall, and still see the time on the wall. At this point I realised Id finally got good tabs, and was pleased. (last holidays I bought bunk tabs)",
      "I decided I go out to the kitchen and get a drink of water, and have a look at what was going on out there. As soon as I walked out of my room I realised how much of a bad idea that was. I felt extremey uncomfortale walking around, with everything feeling so foreign and knowing I might run into my parents at any minute didn't help either. I made it out to the kitchen and filled up a cup with water. I headed back and had to walk past my mums room who had her door open, she called out to me and and I jumped about 20 feet in the air and spilt my cup on the ground. My mum didnt notice that I'd spil my cup or jumped, so I walked back over to her. She said 'you can have your pens there in my cupboard'. Pens, what are pens I thought, not being able to think clerly caused me not to really understanding the concept of this word, I sort of looked at her confused and asked Can I have them? she looked at me very strangely and said yes. I realised how dumb I was and immediately thought my mum knew that something was wrong with me. I walked into the cupboard, grabbed the pens, and as I picked them up I completely forgot how to act around my parents. The person who I really was just became so foreign, I had completely forgot who they were, let alone trying to act like them. I walked out and my mum was staring at me real weird, or so I thought, I quickly muttered, I cant sleep, im very tired, Im gunna make tea then ran out. I got back to my room and thought for sure my mum knew I was on some sort of drug. I kept seeing her face in my mind, it looked as though she was analysing me, she knew something was up. Being around people who aren't tripping and even worse who you don't want to know that you are tripping is extremely weird. I felt so de-tatched and so far away from her, like on a completely different plain or level.",
      "Now I had to go back out to the kitchen and make tea! Not cool, I was coming up really fast and getting more confused by the minute. I walked back out to the kitchen, boiled the kettle and as it came to a boil the sound slowed right down. I could hear every pop of each bubble, the sound of the bubbling and click when the kettle had finished was slowed down so much. The usual click of the kettle button which takes around half a second to click, took what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds to finally stop. All while this was happening, everything was moving, sort of stretching and shifting, everything around me, which continued all night, the strange thing was, although I always thought hallucinations were going to be cool on acid, visal or audio, at this point all they did was confuse me more, I didnt find them cool. I didnt experience any anxiety or fright, I just was confused, I was trying to piece together what was happening, while the acid was completely ripping away these pieces and any sense of logic. After the kettle boiled, I ran back to my room with a cup of water, completely forgetting I was supposed to make tea, luckily my mum didnt see me on the way back. I got back to my room, and this is where things started getting really intense.",
      "I think it was around +2.00 now and I got back to my room and jumped in bed. There were many times throughout this trip I had to coax myself out of a bad trip. It was a very mental trip, I had to face any fears or worries I had ever had with acid or anything else which arose. Luckily, instead of becoming impulsive and letting the paranoia feed, I had researched these worries and knew it would be OK. I was able to think bad thoughts through before indulging in them and bringing on a bad trip. The first fear which arose was when I realised if my parents came in I could not act sober. I would probably not understand a word they were saying, let alone be able to talk with them. It scared me, and I started to feel nauseous, then I realised, they have never came into my room during the night, why would they start now. I felt much better and started listening to music. I saw the album art on the screen changing colours, and becoming extremely 3D the longer I stared at it, it did this all night. It was a psytrance band, so the album was trippy, I understand why psychedelic art was invented in the 60s  . I remember at one point myiPod and my hand actually shrunk, the bottom half was the size of a matchbox and the top half growing out bigger than normal. The clicker wheel turned cheese yellow. Another time my iPod actually started to melt away in my hand and I could feel it melt. Now as I was lying in bed, I had no idea what was going on. I was losing touch with reality at light speed, yet the clock was moving so damn slow. I thought two tabs might have been too much, because at the rate I was watching myself go up compared to time was scary. After about 10 minutes of deep thought (it's very hard to focus on anything whilst on acid), I realised the come up on acid was about 2-3 hours long, so realised I probably had another hour of going up. At this point I completely lost all familiarity with myself and my surroundings. Everything became amazingly foreign. This was the most frightening and confusing part of my experience. It would have been around +2.30, and I kept forgetting where I was, who I was, falling into these deep mind traps then jumping out of them for a split second just to touch with reality one last time.",
      "I stood up and didnt know what to do. I felt like I was enjoying myself, but so confused as to what was going on I couldnt make sense of anything. I realised how fucked up I was and being so unfamiliar with my real self, thought there was no way I could come back to myself or being sober. Reality and soberness just seemed so distant and far off, it scared me. Although the acid was telling me I was never going to be normal again, I knew deep down I would be back to myself again by normal, and just stopped thinking about it and enjoyed the experience, knowing that one simple thing was probably the most important aspect in warding off a bad trip this whole experience. Things kept happening in which the trip was so close to turning bad it wasnt funny.",
      "My dog started barking and yelping outside, I didnt know what my dog was at first, I thought it was some alien creature come to get me, then slowly I realised I had a dog, and immediately thought it was a puppy theif (recently heard about them on the news), I thought someone was trying to steal her. As soon as I thought this the sounds morphed into grunts of a human and yelping of my dog. This was very hard to deal with as I love my dog very much, but I tried to convince myself it couldn't be real. I thought to myself if I was asleep, there is nothing I could do, with a head full of acid, theres even less I can do. I wasnt sure if the sound of my dog was real or fake, but I warded it off to deal with in the morning. The next thing I know I feel this incredibly uncomfortable urge, creep up on me. It hits me like a pile of bricks. I have no idea what this is. After analyzing the feeling for a while, my best guess is that the water I drank now has to be pissed out, so I stumble to the toilet.",
      "I get outside my door and hear my sister talking. The words are all jumbled and fragmented, and IMPOSSIBLE to understand. They echo over each other and sound like complete gibberish. I had no idea whether she was talking in her sleep or talking to my mum. I think its OK to go the bathroom, but I dont want my mum to think Im still awake, as I already thought she suspected something, so I leave the bathroom light off. Bad idea. I get in there, close the door and the whole room is close to pitch black, I can only mae out outlines. The walls start to rise up around me and start dancing around in circles. I get very frightened and have no idea how I am supposed to get out of the bathroom. I put my hands out and walk and hit the shower. I know I am close to the door, and used the shower to guide me there and turn the light on. I walk over and try to piss, it takes about 5 seconds for anything to happen, but when it does happen, it feels like everything in my body just lurched out through my piss. Very strange feeling. I wash my hands and look in the mirror to see my face. I used to have mild acne, but its cleared up, so theres still a few red scars/spots left, my face becomes covered in the red spots which turn into big red pimples and I grow hair all over my face. Normally I would think that was awesome, but I just thought it was confusing, not scary or fun, just weird. Another time, a little while after that I had to do another piss. The feeling was still very confusing to identify. The same thing again except this time when looking in the mirror I saw my skin not melt away but sort of become really tight on may face, so my head took the shape of a skull.",
      "I really didn't understand what was going on. I manage to get back into my room and lay down. It is silent. I begin to hear this audio hallucination, it sounds like mechanic bubbles popping, the silence sort of bending back and forth. Any time in which there was silence throughout the rest of the night, I would hear this strange noise. I watched a movie on my iPod, and turned on an episode of heroes. It's like there are frames missing as the film sort of skips a beat. The characters have a soft glow, sort of aura around them, which occasionly becomes stronger for a few seconds when they move. Watching it some parts completely scared the crap out of me, I saw a guy jump off a building, then guns and shooting and some guy all alone in the middle of the desert get stalked. Concentrating on the movie was impossible, so I sort of just stared at the screen while my mind jumped from one thought to the next. At one point, I became convinced I was going to lose control of my actions and kill myself. It was quite scary but I tried to stop think about it, and reasoned with myself to make sure I knew I would never kill myself, and felt a little better.",
      "I tried to get up and draw, but as soon as I stood up I forgot what I was doing. It took me around 10 minutes to walk half a metre across my room as I' realise what I was trying to do for a split second, take a small step then forget again. I ended up getting to my desk, but was too fascinated with the construction of a chair, that I forgot about drawing. I finally ended up realizing I wanted to try and draw, and sat down, but I didnt know what to draw. Any decision I had to make like choosing a song, episode, what to draw etc. took almost 10 minutes to decide. My mind was racing so fast, if I didn't pick straight away I'd forget about it for another 5 minutes. I picked up the pencil and drew a face, whenever I pressed the pencil on the paper I saw squiggles in the paper come all across the paper and I could see right in the texture of the paper. When there were a few things on the page, I sat back and looked at the paper and could see all the drawings move around the page. Took me about half an hour to try and draw anything as Id get halfway through and forget what I was doing.",
      "I gave up trying to draw and just sat on my bed, amazed at how unfamiliar my own self was and my surroundings. I remember at one point every time I looked at the clock, the time would be further back than last time I looked. I think knowing the time on acid is pointless as I never would understand what it meant. Then another time I was holding my iPod and the song sped up in fast forward, I heard it speed up then go back to normal and saw the blue bar speed across the screen. I hadnt touched the iPod, so it wasnt me fast forwarding the song. There was a tarp outside, anytime the wind blew it, it would echo very strangely, it scared me at first, as I had no idea what it was, but I remembered the tarp and calmed down. The audio hallucination were amazing in retrospect. The way they echo and slow down is really cool. When I was tripping, I'd hear something echo or slow down, but my perceptions being so altered, I had no idea what it was.",
      "Somehow I stumbled across almost controlling my audio hallucinations. I could think up words, say them in my head and hear them out loud as they would echo in my ears. I could think up any song I had recently listened to, and play it in my ears, without speakers or earphones or anything. Again though, being so confused it wasnt special to me, just confusing as to why it was happening but still slightly interesting. By +4.00 or +5.00, my head started to clear up, and I began to surface back to reality. The first 4 hours of my trip were the most intense and confusing of my life, I had no idea about anything, almost like being reverted back to a baby or child and experiencing everything again.",
      "Everything was so unbeleivably foreign, I had no idea whether a chair was as normal or a hallucination, and thought both were just as interesting. Its very hard to explain. The best I can put it, is as being a baby, in a sense. As human beings, we think it awesome that a baby gets to have so many new experiences. Even the simplest of things like a chair or flashing toy can be of great interest to a baby. Yet take the baby to a theme park, although to us, a theme park is much more interesting than a chair, to the baby it is no different, just another new experience. The baby takes all the new experiences, and doesnt question if they are normal or not. That is how I felt. The hallucinations were the same level of interest as a chair to me. Both new experiences, both very confusing, both equal in their intrigue. I always imagined the hallucinations would be fun to look at, because theyd be awesome sober, but when tripping they were just another added bit of confusion to my jumbled world.",
      "Well after that intense 4 or 5 hours of my trip, my mind started to clear up, and I started to float back to reality again. It got to the point, where I felt, in my mind I was normal, I became familiar with my surroundings and somewhat more familiar with myself. I ended up spending the rest of the night watching the hallucinations at my computer screen, while trying to make sense of what had happened. After a while I got bored, and went to look in the mirror again. I felt very clear minded at this point, the only part of the acid trip left was the hallucinations, or so it felt. While I was sitting at the computer, the mechanic bubble sounds still played, when it rained heavily it sounded like a machine. The sound wasnt all in one long sound, but it would rain, then stop and echo, then rain, then stop at echo, sounded like a washing machine in a massive cellar. I felt quite exhausted, mentally and physically, so headed back to my room. On the way I stared into the mirror and saw myself grow hair all over my face, and then morph into some giant ape like being. I fumbled around a bit more, till the hallucinations and almost completely ceased. It was around +7.00 or +8.00 when I went to bed. I drank some chamomile tea, and fell asleep, I remember I was still getting slight visuals as I fell asleep.",
      "I Woke up feeling basically normal no hallucinations, no hangover no nothing, except a slight feeling of dis-attatchment with reality. Its just confusing merging back into this life which was so foreign only a few hours ago. Im still in utter confusement/astonishment over how powerful and intense this whole experience was. I am still slightly confused as to what happened, its like Ive been hit by a ton of bricks. In my naivety, when the trip was at its most intense, I only had my room to explore as my parents didnt fall asleep till late. Although I was really only exploring my mind, I would of liked a larger environment to experience other objects in such a perplexed state. Once my parents went to sleep, the intense phase had passed and I just sort of mellowed out. I was super confused and could of easily done something stupid, a trip sitter would have been preferred to help me out. But the powerfulness of LSD still amazes me, I was completely shocked and would have never expected what happened, to happen. Although I was prepared to accept anything, the intensity still overwhelmed me. I think if I am to do it again, I will make sure I have a much better environment and a sitter, but overall, the experience was not frightening, it was not bad either, it was not fun or exciting, but simply astonishing now and confusing at the time. All in all, it was quite rewarding in experiencing new perceptions."

      "I had tried smoking weed on about 2 previous occasions before this one, but had never been able to get stoned, most likely because I was not inhaling the smoke all the way in. It was after school, and I was at a friends house, who just happened to live one street over from a police station. He had scored some weed so we were excited to smoke some, since at that time it was rare to get a hold of any weed. ",
      "Well we went to the parking lot of his building, and went into a laundry room where we proceeded to roll a fat joint, and began to smoke it. This time I really inhaled deeply as much as I could and held the smoke in for longer than I had ever done. We finished off the joint kinda fast because we didn't want to risk getting caught smoking. Afterwards I really didn't feel much of an effect besides a slight buzz, it was getting dark, and I knew I had to get home, so I said goodbye to my friend and walked down the street because I had to phone for my ride home. I had to cross a busy street and at the other side is where the public phones were (at this point I was still feeling normal other than that slight buzz).",
      "I called up my mom and asked for a ride home and during the phone call THIS is when the weed began to hit me!!! I'll never forget it, because as I was talking to my mom trying to arrange my ride home, it felt like I was suddenly pushed into an unfamiliar world, I couldn't remember the last things I had just said, and when I talked my own voice seemed distant and unfamiliar, I got really nervous and I just finished the conversation saying 'yeah' and 'uh huh'. Well, then I hung up the phone and by then the weed had really set in...I felt like I was way in over my head, I was feeling like I was in a slow-motion movie, and I felt like I was watching the movie, and everything in my view was the movie screen.",
      "This was the very first time I had experienced anything like this, and I began to get really frightened because everything seemed to be moving so slow, so I began to run, and I felt like I was also running in slo-mo, ...then I had to cross back to the other side of that busy street, which was another nightmare because there were cars everywhere, and there was no crosswalk. I waited and waited and time went sooo slow, until it was all clear then I made it to the other side.",
      "I don't know how or why but then I began to pace back and forth on the sidewalk, at some point I remember I kept telling myself 'you're just stoned, don't worry..'  but, I was REALLY paranoid and I didn't know what to do, being one street away from a police station also added to the paranoia, because I began to get the terrifying feeling that a cop would see me acting strangely on the street and arrest me. I saw a cop car go by, and I got scared and made myself stop pacing, and I went to sit down on some nearby benches.",
      "At this point I was really concious of my hearbeat and I felt like I could hear each thump very loudly. As I was sitting down, I was able to calm myself down, and the paranoia subsided, and for the first time I was able to appreciate how numb my body felt and my mouth was also extremely dry. But I was still waiting for my mom to give me a ride home, so I also began to worry that she would notice that I was stoned or smell the weed on me. I was feeling much better so I went to a store and got a drink and guzzled it all down. By the time my mom arrived to get me, about 25 min. after I had called, I got into the car and tried my best to act normal, although I still felt stoned, but I was able to control it.",
      "I tried not to talk much as I was afraid I might act stoned or say something wrong and I also knew my eyes would be red, so I avoided eye to eye contact, but the surprising thing is that my mom didn't really notice anything or even mention anything, so I arrived home and was thankful to have gotten that over with. I still felt stoned afterwards and I listened to some music, and I found it seemed to sound much better....",
      "Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you decide to get stoned please don't do it anywhere near a police station, you don't need the extra paranoia."

      "Jaded by the lack of street-acid I recently ordered a quantity of Syrian Rue and morning glory seeds from a well known auction site. This was after researching the various herbals available and deciding that these there the most attactive proposition.",
      "I am fairly well experienced with hallucinogenics mainly our indiginous scottish psilocybe mushrooms - so most of the LSA reports made perfect sense ( including the reports of nausea which in my experience is usually a feature at some stage during a psychadelic journey, and therefore was not at all daunting)  The MAOI interactions concerning the Rue is a wee bit disconcerting but we do not take any other prescriptions and a quick check list on the 'avoid' list gives us the all clear to proceed.",
      "So.. a  friend and I had decided one evening to indulge in a wee taster of each herb, to establish the potency, test the method of ingestion and to ensure its not complete poison!",
      "The syrian rue had come all the way direct from Turkey - i had read a little on the preparation , and my version was to add 5g approximately into a stainless pot, juice from 1/2 a lime( no lemon), and a mug of water. then simmer whilst grinding the seeds with a spoon, before straining into a cup.  Product: 1 steaming cupfull of dark brown liquid largely without sediment.",
      "The morning glory seeds had been purchased as garden seeds grown by a wee old man - therefore no industrial chemicals. i had read various guidelines on refining with solvents etc. but improvised as follows : - 25 morning glory seeds approx placed inside folded paper and coarsely crushed using steak hammer. Ground seeds placed in a pot with a generous 50ml of Famous Grouse. ( at 40% this was the strongest alcohol in the house on the day therefore decided it was most suitable for the brew). Heated gently in pan (not too hot - didnt want to evaporate all the alcohol), again grinding seeds with the spoon before straining into a glass, and adding a bit more whisky for flavour.  Result :- 1 big shot glass of rich toffee looking liquid complete with seed bits.",
      "Time 9.00pm - ingestion",
      "Friend and i first gulped half the cup of Rue mixture each. Tastes like bile but definitely tastes like it contains 'drugs'!",
      "After grimacing a bit we gulp half each of the whisky/morning glory shot. It actually tastes very pleasant - like butterscotch.",
      "We retire to watch TV , drink beer, listen to music.",
      "Time 10.00pm  - has become a little 'strange' like coming up on E or something. cant quite put our fingers on it - we put this down to the fact that these are 'different' drugs therefore not strictly comparable. ",
      "Time 10.30pm - a peculiar feeling of definitely being a little wasted but then again maybe not? slight trails in vision. very slight nausea.  music enhanced.",
      "We decide at this point to 'cook up' another batch since it is clear that no harm has come from the first. The same quantities roughly are treated in the same way and promptly guzzled. Rue mixture definitely tastes like bile! yuk i cant finish it so.....We take the opportunity to mess about with the remaining Rue mixture under blacklight - this is incredible!!!!!!!  the morning glory whisky mix is still tasty.",
      "Time 11.15-12.00 midnight Back to music and lying on the couch, as walking has become a little difficult!   trails from vision all over the place. each time i move my eyes its like a discoball, visual inertia ( everything a bit jelly like ). Lost in own thoughts. Difficult to have much of a conversation. Very happy - (not giggly though) Each object / thing seems to emit its own colour, and own frequency of low hum. Time a bit harder to follow.  TV seems be morphing from one shot to the next ,but we think this was just clever editing.  There is still this strange feeling of ambiguity about whether or not im actually under ther influence. i cant seem to make up my mind the extent - it comes in waves.",
      "Time 1.00am - im going to head to bed, since i have to get up for work, can hardly walk to bed! like being on a boat in a storm, discoball going overtime. ( slight nausea and taste of the rue mixture at the back of the throat but nothing serious ).I am without a doubt tripping - nothing too hardcore though. Eventually get to sleep and wake up at various stages over the night and in various states of dilerium , pleaure, comfort. All pleasant though. ",
      "Time 7.30am - time to get up for work - still a little wasted, a bit uneasy on my feet! this wears off over the rest of the morning and no ill effects except a slight headache and a loose stool in the afternoon.",
      "Similar story from my friend who stayed up a little later to watch the swirling TV until the second lot of brew peaked and there was no point watching tv as it made no sense.",
      "Conclusions:-",
      "The amateurish preparations were certainly effective.",
      "From what i understand to be a fairly low dose of each herb i was most certainly completely wasted!",
      "I am not sure if the effects we were getting were from the Rue or the Morning Glory... well i presume from both but i dont know what each was contributing to the fun - maybe someone can help enlighten me?",
      "The Rue tastes really horrid, disgusting, and i blame this for the slight nausea.",
      "I wouldnt have said these were party drugs in any sense- expect maybe a small amount of the rue for its amazing luminous UV property!!!",
      "I would definitely experiment a second time, on a quiet evening - with close friends. Round two is going to be less Rue, considerably more morning glory.",
      "I could imagine that a larger dose of Rue could detract from the pleasantness of the experience.",
      "I will definitely do this again as a cheap and interesting experiment. Certainly something had a bit of a kick about it!!",
      "Enjoy"

      "Finding mushrooms was not difficult.  I asked a guy that was selling regular gourmet mushrooms at a farmers market that I have known for awhile.  He came up with 2.5 grams of dried shrooms, and said that they were a variety called oasis. ",
      "So, I invited my man over on a Saturday afternoon.  He called me about 45 minutes before he arrived and about 10 minutes before he arrived, I ingested 1.00 grams of dried shrooms.  The mushrooms were chopped finely, and taken on a slice of rye bread with honey.  My intention was to enhance my environment, and not take a mind bending trip, so I think my dosage was lower than one might want to take.  I told my man that I had taken some shrooms, and wanted to feel him while the shrooms had me.",
      "About 30 minutes after ingestion, my sense of smell became much more intense.  Take for instance, if I smell a pizza.  Well this was like, smelling the ingredients of a pizza, instead of smelling just the pizza.  My man was with me, lying on the bed, with his shirt off.  I was taking in his essence.  This made me incredibly amorous. ",
      "As we made love, the oneness became overwhelming,  I truly have never been so close to someone.  Every sensation was amplified.  He began at my feet, and enveloped me.  I became part of him, like I was inside of him.  This was incredible, and the culmination of this was long lasting.",
      "The amplification, of sexual contact caused by low doses of mushrooms is beyond compare."

      "I was doing my senior paper on Daniel Pinchbeck, DMT, and global consciousness. The only psychoactives I had tried prior to this were Ketamine, MDMA and LSD. I talked to a guy that I had only been in contact with for maybe a month. He sold me the ketamine, and MDMA. I asked him about DMT because I was doing a paper on it and was just plain interested. He told me he could get it and that he could walk my best friend and I through the experience.",
      "But first, he wanted us to try something else. He called it the 'salvia trick.' For a day we were put on a strict diet that lacked caffiene, dairy, red meat, and large amounts of sugar. Somewhere in the evening he gave us huge capsules of MAOI's that we took. An hour we drove to his house and were already seeing trails and feeling quite happy in general. His room was very plain with only pale green on the walls and a few black and white pictures of smiling impoverished people.",
      "He had us take whiffs of frankincense and cedar wood extracts to calm us down. By this point, I hadnt smoked a cigarette in a few hours and was craving one. He reluctantly handed me an all-natural no additive cigarette. I took one hit of this and as I exhaled I felt and saw a ripple pulsating out of my body. He talked for a while and I stared at a picture that had a man standing. I saw this picture moving with a ferris wheel in the background and a rollercoaster cart slowly being reeled up towards me. When the time was right he handed me the salvia.",
      "I took one hit and did not pass out but my mind was already clouded with its affects. My friends said so uhh.you gonna take another hit. I picked up the bowl again and took another hit.",
      "I remember a huge net made of people holding on to each others limbs diagonally. I was part of this but the person supposed to hold on to my lower left ankle could not get a hold of it. The people suddenly were all wearing sweaters and jeans and one of these people was a lady who said something incredibly annoying and whatever she said had an insane amount of audible dissonance. Her phrase repeating very quickly and all I could see was a windmill of colors that did not match and I had the notion I would never escape this place and be swept up in this aesthetic dissonance forever.",
      "My eyes opened to the room and saw my dealer sitting in a lotus position. I swear he was saying the sky is falling, over and over and just smiling. I looked at the walls and the room was fleeting through somewhere at a very fast pace. I got up and walked across the room. He got my attention before I ran into his closet and I turned around. He said something along the lines of is it over?",
      "I thought it was and tried to walk to the couch and then fell flat on my ass just as the guy said maybe not.  I saw that the walls were constructed of the people connected in that net and thought that the guy had set me up for a bad trip. For an instant, I hated his guts. I stood up and grabbed a bottle of water and tried to drink it. I ended up getting some in my mouth and substantially more on my clothes. I sat down and passed back out. I do not remember my trip after this but I passed in and out of consciousness for 50 minutes tripping my nuts off.",
      "Looking back, this part of the trip must have been rather hilarious to watch. My friend told me I was passing out every minute or so and all the while I was trying to add in pleasantries as my dealer was talking very fast. I only remember waking up again and again and saying uh huh, or nodding my head to make sure he didnt think I was ignoring him. I hit a joint that he had rolled during my trip but afterwards lacked the energy to finish it. By the way, I drove straight home to my mom after this and left my friend in my passenger's seat, slipping in and out of consciousness until his girlfriend came and took him home. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "It was disturbing beyond belief for that small amount of time and the paranoia remained for about a day. Now, I am just interested in what the whole experience meant. It was so random that the only way I can sum it up is to say I experienced a very annoying, random, infinity. But I am very much still interested in pleasant infinities that can be reached through such means."

      "10 of us, all young men ranging from 17 to 19 decided to pitch a tent in a small nature preserve, set like an island in the middle of inner-city life. This island served as a great source for experimentation of all kinds and a place to commune with nature. It also made for a fairly safe place for a first acid experience. As I think back to it as a man in his 40's I gain new insights all the time. It was an experience I will never forget or regret.",
      "We pitched the tent and started a fire and dropped. My dose was 1/2 tab orange sunshine( a saccarine sized barrel of orange color). $3.00 a hit. The only other things with us where a radio and a pack of cards. We sat inside the tent at dusk and began to attempt to play cards waiting for it to kick in. There where 2 of us who had tripped once or twice before..the other 8 first timers. I remember Dave one of the 'experienced' one's saying things like ' Whats the matter? Are you f**ked up' purposely making his voice sound like a slowed down tape. Everyone laughed at that. The funny thing was...his voice still sounded like that after he had begun a normal discussion with his normal voice. The climb to the peak had begun for me. After a few tries, we all realized playing cards was not an option because the numbers and suits where indecipherable we began flinging cards at each other acrossed the tent, watching the trails and laughing hysterically.",
      "I fell back trying to duck a card and felt my head hit the radio. Ouch! I sat back up, put my hand to my head and then looked at it. Blood! I started freaking out 'My heads bleeding' I shouted. Everyone looked quickly at me in horror. I was staring at my hand that was full of crimson wetness that oozed around as though it was alive and I felt a sense of panic growing. A voice( not sure who's) said laughing 'your not bleeding!'. The blood in my hand faded away and so did the pain in my head. I wasnt. Few! This instance however..set the tone for my complete trip as I got this notion of how vulnerable we all where now. For the rest of the night I was like everyones mother which I'm sure was a drag for everyone else. ' Be careful! Don't do this! Don't do that!' My consern grew worse as a few decided to run out on the major highway, laydown in the middle and wait for cars...then jump up and run! I was freaking on that enough where they stopped, after calling me some choice expletives. Maybe I saved a life? Who knows? :)",
      "A curious thing happened that I do remember. Because of the close proximity we all had inside this tent/cocoon we all experience pretty much the same trip..purely by a verbal cue from someone else. ' Look! He has an eye in his forehead' as we all ooohed and aaahed at the same sight. Another was the power of the sense of smell. David was sitting in the middle of the tent..lighting matches and looking at them until they burned out and then lighting more. The smell of sulfur permeated the tent air. I shouted ' Don't do that you'll start the tent on fire!' As I was finshing that thought/sentence an orange glow lit up the outside of the tent and I heard what sounded like flames burning and crackling wood.  We where surrounded by fire! I thought. Another tripper stuck his head out of the flap after I shouted ' The woods are on fire'! He looked around outside, stuck his head back in with a goofy grin and said ' No its not'. Instantly the glow and noise stopped. It was a long strange trip that night...I could be keep writting...but I dont want to take up to much space. Laughing leaves, primitive chants around the campfire, crumbling glass like leaves in my hand, pulling space bugs from my mouth, incredible fractal images and colors etc. It was all mind opening and altering...and def scary. But not enough to scare me from tripping again. The first time though was the most intense and memorable of all trips."

      "This report isn't really a warning to anybody, because as bad as it might sound, I really don't feel that it is. Its as much for the people reading it as it is for me to get things together and organized in my somewhat confused head.  I'm 16 years old right now.  I have been smoking pot just about every day for the past year an a half, maybe a little more.  I took my first drinks about two and a half years ago, but didnt get more than a buzz till about this time two years ago, over spring break of my 8th grade year.  I had just turned 14.  I remember I drank a few shots of whiskey and a few shots of cherry vodka.  Keep in mind that I was probably about 115 pounds and only 14 years old.  I had the most amazing time of my life, up to then of course.  I kissed a few girls that night, and had fun.",
      "This started my pattern of every weekend drinking, then summer came, and I started drinking at least twice a week, but normally three to four times.  At the time a good drunk was 4-5 drinks.  I tended to drink with one kid most of the time, and occasionally a few others. Throughout that summer I felt the need to drink all the time in order to have fun.  That summer I also tried smoking grass for the first time.  My first time I smoked a shitty joint out of regular paper and didnt feel much.  The next time I tried it, about a month later, I smoked a gram of KB to myself rolled up into a joint.  I remember running to catch up with my friend and it all falling right on top of me. Laughter, light headedness, euphoria, music was rolling through my head that I had no control over. Rain was coming down unbelievably hard and everything was blurry.  All of the sudden the sun came out, I was soaking wet, really stoned for the first time, and had to walk probably about a mile to get to my friends and dry off.",
      "It was only two months after that that I started smoking pot regularly with a kid who I would be spending most of my time with up until now, which is over a year and a half later. Im not the most popular kid in school, I cant say that I have to many real friends cause I get ditched by them a lot of the time. I stopped drinking for a while when I got into heavy weed smoking.  But that didnt last long. Five or six months later I drank a lot again.  I started experimenting with more drugs about 8 months after I became a regular smoker, and a year after I got drunk for the first time. I tried mushrooms.  I ate some of them, I dont really know how many, and me and my friend smoked bubblers most of the night.  I cant say it was a 'life changing experiance', but it was a start to my experimenting. ",
      "Over the summer of 2006 I tried more drugs. I moved into acid and tried some pills like vicodin and ritalin.  I took acid regularly for a few months, then stopped after realizing it got me down pretty bad.  Once I was crying for no real reason the day after I tripped, I didnt know what it was, but something was really bringing me down.  I had problems with depression in the past, but this was differant.  I stayed away from acid for a little while after that.  The fall of my sophmore year I tried a vast amount of pills.  And I fell in love with my next problem drug, Amphetamine.",
      "The first time I took adderall I had no idea that it was a cousin to meth.  I thought meth was a drug only for hard core addicts.  Ampethamines are wonderful. They give me so much influance and euphoria.  I enjoy creative things like writing and drawing, and on amphetamines I could never stop coming up with new ideas.  I was so happy and the world seemed like there was nothing wrong with it. Once I blew a 30 mg and a big line form another pill, Im guessing it was about 35-40mg of the stuff.  I summed up my ideas about God and religion in a notebook, all in all it was about 5 pages long.",
      "I also tired things like xanax, percocet, more vicoden, a lot of ritalin, and ambien.  There are probably a few more in there that I cant think of now.  That winter something new came along. Cocaine.  I never thought I would be blowing a line of cocaine. Ever. But I did. It became pretty big at my school and I thought why not try it.  I did it probably about 7-8 times in a period of a month, and I loved it.  I spent over a hundred bucks on it in only a short period of time, and got probably about a gram for free.  I didnt wanna get hooked though. I gave it a rest for a while.",
      "In the past few months, to start 2007, I have started drinking more, and a lot of people are saying I am drinking pretty heavily.  I know I am, and I care about it, but I love drinking and I always have.  I care, but I dont care. I think about alcohol every day and have been smoking pot every chance I get since I got out of rehab. I was in an outpatient program for about 2-3 months because of my parents, I still smoked, I failed almost all my tests but refused to go back, and it worked somehow.  I have also been taking amphetamines and any uppers I can for the past few months once a week if not more.  I always think about them, and cant write without something to put me in the right state of mind.  Even now, I felt like I needed to sum all of this shit up earlier today, but I wanted to wait to drink more, and get to smoke too before I wrote it, on the basis that it would be a better story if I was high...right?  So as of now I am smoking heavier than ever, drinking more than ever, and always snorting or popping some kind of upper or downer.",
      "This may sound like complaining about some sad slow process of slipping into addiction.  I dont know if thats what it is really. I know we are all going to die one day, and Im going to live while I have the chance to live."
