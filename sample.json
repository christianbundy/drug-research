      "My friend had some experience with X and had told me about it.  One day, she said she had come across some really good stuff (chocolate chips from Amsterdam), and asked if I was interested.  I had done acid once before, and was a seasoned pot smoker.  I was ready for it.  We got the tabs, and prepared ourselves by getting some comfortable clothes, a video (alice in Wonderland), and generally psyching ourselves up for the event.",
      "Upon taking the drug, I was somewhat anxious for the fun to begin.  After watching TV for a while, I noticed K acting funny.  She is significantly smaller than me, so I guess it hit her faster.  I wasn't feeling anything.  Then, I decided to stand up.  WHOAH!  COLD FLOOR ON BARE FEET!  It was like ice.  It was so cold it tickled.  Happy happy happy.  I began to dance around.  I could almost hear music in my head.  I settled down and we proceeded to massage one another with a mentholyptus rub (half a jar in all:  the smell was in my room for 3 days).  Masturbating was never this good.  I was shuddering from the waves of pure, unadulterated delight that were just sweeping over me like a rising tide.  I honestly heard some heavenly choir singing. ",
      "I received a couple of random phone calls from some people I hadn't heard from in a while, some of whom later came over.  Hearing those voices was like a reunion of some long-estranged family or something.  Utter elation.  I could NOT hold anyone close enough to me.  I wanted to keep squeezing until I had totally absorbed them into myself.  The drug is aptly named.  If you are ever looking for that total mind/body massage and spiritual connection with another person, this is the way to go.  We finished the night wrapped tightly in a fuzzy blanket listening to some beautiful violin music.  I was so happy and at peace that I almost wept."

      "It's now 7:20pm. it appears as though it's been 3 hours. Mild visuals. good tracers. hard to concentrate on spelling. have snorted about another 10mg. its all good. Very pleasant happy body high.",
      "It's 2:55pm(next day) - woke up at about 1:45 this afternoon. Had a very good time last night. At about 3:30am I went to bed and lay there contemplating my existence and realizing my perma-fry insanity caused by salvia. Realized that 'it's all good' is a reality anchor that I use to re-focus my existence. I always say this and never really understood why it makes me feel good. Last night AMT helped me realize that I have programmed myself to believe that 'it' - being my subjective reality at that moment which is always changing now - really is 'all good.' A",
      "Finally fell asleep around 8am. Throughout the night I took 220mg of DXM as well as another 10mg-ish line of AMT. I noticed that the AMT masked the effects of DXM and just made for a pleasant night. I would describe this drug as 'slightly psychedelic, very happy happy happy, functional, empathic, speedy but mellow calm acid.' I would also describe it as 'emotionally hallucinogenic.' The visuals were great in the dark or with my eyes closed however they were mellow enough in the light with my eyes open that I could still easily function in society.",
      "I believe that as that entire afternoon and evening was beautifully gleeful. Smiles and great conversation as well as admiring visuals filled my night. The conversation was at great as meth conversation but not as sporadic and unfocused or tweeked. Anyway overall experience was superb. This was my second experience with AMT. Looking around I am still noticing very very mellow tracers and auras around lights."

      "'Such Beauty. Fuck.' These three words were all I could conjure to explain what I was experiencing with the new and yet-to-be fully understood 2C-I-NBOME aka 25-I. Those three words do not even present the tip of the iceberg that is this wonderful experience from such an interesting and inspiring molecule.",
      "First off I will 'qualify' my understanding of the psychedelic (and otherwise intoxicated) headspace. I have used a variety of psychedelics including the classics LSD, mushrooms, MDMA and also a few of the Shulgin line - 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, DPT, 2C-I, 2C-E. I am a regular cannabis user, and have experienced a wide variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, and dissociatives.",
      "At the time of this experience I was as sober as I could be considering I am tapering off both Suboxone (buprenorphine & naloxone) and clonazepam. These substances were taken at small maintenance doses over 24hrs prior to ingesting the 25-I blotters to ensure they would not lessen or otherwise change the trip but to keep my body in a state of relative homeostasis. I was admittedly breaking a few of my own rules - tripping on a whim with no real plan at home with some family who I knew I would probably end up avoiding as the effects took hold. Keep in mind I have tried 25-I in previous sessions at similar dosages - the first was 900mcg taken foolishly with a large amount of clonazepam and buprenorphine still active in my system and the second a few days after 1.2mg IV. The 25-I experience itself I now know is very malleable - much more so than LSD and even mushrooms. The one startling aspect of this chemical is its overwhelming euphoria and positivity. I have never felt this feeling other than small glimpses during orgasm or the rush of a strong intraveneous opiate. MDMA experiences were not even close - I personally find MDMA a useless and very superficial experience. The absolute pleasure from 25-I is not only felt and understood but multiplied by its exploration/understanding and is almost controllable. The headspace differs entirely in that it has 3 out of 3 times been positive, euphoric, and almost relaxing. It seems to have everything I am looking for - it is wildly visual and euphoric while leaving the minds logic systems mostly intact - this is the only chemical in which I have experienced such intense feelings of euphoria and both open and closed-eye visuals without wondering 'what is going on?' and losing touch - the loss of ego. I suspect higher doses will be needed to yield this kind of reality-shattering. That is my summary of 25-I but now on to last night:",
      "T 0:00 - 2 blotters are placed between the gums and cheek, one on top and one on the bottom lip. This is not complexed but since it is the hydrochloride salt of 25-I, it is well absorbed if proper buccal technique is observed. I personally recommend keeping the blotters in contact with the gums/cheeks in various positions even as the drugs effects come on.",
      "T+0:30 - Although many say this is a slow-to-develop experience, I have noticed the familiar shimmer and intensifying of colors while also feeling a building energy - some friends have noted this come up as 'frightening' in intensity but compared to the 2C line it is just a small buildup of energy.",
      "T+1:00 - I decide it is time to prepare a shower as I find the effects building and building. My pupils are already dilating at this point and I can feel fluctuations in body temperature much more. There is a bubbling in the stomach that I would not call nausea by any means - just something I noted. In fact food/hunger is not only perfectly normal but strangely enjoyable tripping on 25-I, whereas with LSD and most other psychedelics I find any unnatural foods bizarre and unappealing. As I shower I also note the physical pleasure of this chemical coming on - I can imagine it would be a potent aphrodisiac used in the right setting.",
      "T+2:00 - I decide to take a night time bike ride with headphones - great idea! I am feeling the euphoria kicking in full force now and combined with the small but noticeable 2C-x energy I venture deep into the woods. At this point I can not fully see because the visuals are multiplying rapidly. I stop and smoke a cigarette and contemplate how hard it is for an American to find secluded nature anymore. I feel apologetic for paving over natural landscapes and natural beauty with our suburban and urban centers. At this point I note my euphoria is stronger than anything I have felt in my life previously (possibly due to the extreme affinity for this molecule to certain receptors).",
      "T+3:00 - Time dilation has begun and the entire world is awash in patterns and tracers. A note about pattern recognition. Visually, at least, this chemical seems to play tricks with the brains system of 'filling in' periphery. Usually when I focus on a point the brain fills in the rest of my vision with memory and logical assumptions - while on 25-I this trick of the mind is exposed. I focus on a point and it becomes almost 4-D in clarity as the entire periphery flows with reccurring patterns the mind inserts to fill in the lack of visual stimuli. These are not like any other visuals I have seen which are usually purely geometrical - they are also MC Escher-esque in repetition - rows and rows of horses marching into shadows of other rows of horses - tree branches interconnecting and exploding out in ways that defy physics, etc.",
      "T+4:00 - At this point time becomes of no concern. I walk around the street with my dogs and feel extreme empathy and understanding towards them. It is as if we are linked. Conversation with some friends at this point is very fun as I can interact with an almost unnoticeable amount of confusion - as we all know other psychedelics that produce such profound effects also seem to profoundly affect communication and thought. 25-I, at moderate-strong dosages seems to leave my sanity and social abilities intact which still rewarding the user with incredible physical/mental euphoria and inexplicably beautiful visuals.",
      "It is yet to be seen what large doses would do to the mental facilities as I have only heard of increasing confusion with the already overwhelming euphoria and visual experience. I spent a few hours listening to music, drinking beer, and talking with friends over cigarettes and cannabis. This psychedelic agrees with cannabis more than any other. It does not illicit the instant intense paranoia that may be precipitated if one smokes, for example, during the peak of a strong LSD trip. It will increase visuals and euphoria but leave the mind in a positive and relaxed state. I'd venture to say this stuff is almost sedating at points - especially with cannabis thrown in. I could sit still and feel my head getting heavy almost like the nod you would get from a strong opiate.",
      "To sum up a long and convoluted, quickly-written report: this is my new favorite psychedelic. After enough intense trips I had sworn off LSD entirely and most research chemicals due to either bad trips or just dirty, crummy physical feelings. This chemical does everything I want and more. A very unexpected surprise that I feel should continue to be explored as safely as possible. I would recommend this to any beginner because of the guaranteed positive, enjoyable, and very entertaining quality of the experience but would also dissuade them because of the relative newness of the molecule and widely varied experiences among individuals/dosages. 2 other friends have used this chemical at similar doses (2 blotters totaling 1.2mg) and at first expressed fright during the come up. I attributed this to them having only experience with LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA but none of the weird electrical energy during a 2C-x come-up. Later they said much of the same - all positive thoughts and euphoric feelings both physically and mentally coupled with amazing visuals and an ease at thinking/socializing with sober individuals.",
      "One last note. The first trip ended pretty abruptly probably due to the amount of benzodiazepines in my circulation and my taking more to purposefully get to sleep once I had satisfied my psychedelic urges. Last night, after a full 9hrs past ingestion and 1hr after ingesting 5mg clonazepam, 3mg buprenorphine, 50mg diphenhydramine, a few beers, a few joints of high-grade west-coast bud (Master Kush and Berry White), and a large meal, I felt tired but was unable to sleep and could still, with barely any focus, experience incredible visual patterning and Escher-esque repetitions. Such beauty.",

      "Morning Glory Seeds (Clarke's Heavenly Blue)",
      "I took five 1.6g sachets of Plantation Products untreated Clarke's Heavenly Blue (8grams of total seeds)  and with my coffee grinder, ground the seeds into a powder. I had a container full of capsules of St. John's Wort that I never used, so I pulled those apart, dispensed the wort and refilled with the ground seeds.",
      "It was tedious, but when I finished, I had about 30 gelcaps filled with ground morning glory seeds and the residue of the St. John's Wort powder that was originally inside them. It's important to mention the St. John's Wort because hyperforin (chemical in the Wort) is a reuptake inhibitor for all kinds of neurotransmitters, and there may have been enough residue in the gelcaps to have had an effect.",
      "At approximately 1245, I began swallowing gelcaps, three at a time, with a chaser of strong ginger ale. (This is just regular commercial ginger ale that I've added a couple grams of ground ginger to.) Getting all those caps down took some time, and a lot of burping.",
      "Effects became noticeable within twenty to thirty minutes. Very much bloated feeling. Lethargic. Tired. A little antsy. Not so much nauseated as just really heavy abdomen. I became aware of a flickering in the periphery of vision. I finished my last gelcap as these early effects were coming on. Yes, it took about half an hour to swallow all those caps.",
      "Not knowing, really, what to expect, and both excited and a little apprehensive  I enjoy both the recreational and also introspective visionary aspects of psychedelics, but I've also heard the stories of terrible vomiting, muscle cramping, bruising, vasoconstriction, and generally undesirable effects  I smiled to myself and just let it come on.",
      "Thirty minutes later and I'd stripped down to my boxers because I couldn't stand any more pressure around my waist. My eyes were beginning to dilate. My right eye for some reason always dilates noticeably more than my left, always. This was starting to feel a lot like the come up of 6-APB.",
      "I let myself fall forward onto my bed, like collapsing into a dream, and the physical euphoria was coming on strong. Any thoughts I had were followed by a tangible echo of that same thought, kind of like how after you throw a rock in a pond the waves ripple out like an echo of that first action. I'd lift the blankets above me, and bring them down, and that physical action followed and repeated itself two or three times. Very much like being extremely inebriated on alcohol and everything spins or moves back and forth repeatedly.",
      "By now tactile sensations were feeling really good. I was swimming on my bed like I do with other serotonergic chemicals. My fingertips on my skin felt like it was someone else touching me and not my own hand.",
      "I was also feeling a little physically distressed. I hadn't had any nausea, per se, no dry heaving or anything like that, but the load had been increasing, and my joints were starting to hurt, especially in my hands. My knuckles were swelling up a little. Strangely, I decided to eat a slice of pizza that had been in my refrigerator. I chewed every mouthful of pizza into a superfine gel  I didn't want to upset my GI system any more, but I did want to nourish my starving body. Soon after eating this slice, the colors around me took on depth and hue, especially greens. (The ginger ale cans around the room were practically glowing like an alien metal.)",
      "At this stage, and I was only about an hour and a half into it, I was feeling mentally stimmed out. My body was under seriously heavy load, though, and physically, tactile sensations were really euphoric. Naturally, I pleasured myself. (It happens.) Explosively. I had filled the bathtub with water for a soak, which I enjoy with most trips. But after I put my feet in the water, the defraction of light from the bathroom window made my feet, when I looked at them submerged in the water, look pallid and graycolorless and corpselike. I got this weird premonition that I'd end up dead if I took that bath. I got out, pulled the plug on the tub, and jumped back into my bed.",
      "I'd been listening to Emerson Lake and Palmer's Tarkus and Van der Graaf Generator's Godbluff. But after a while the music was just too loud, too present, too in my face, and I needed a little silence to collect myself.",
      "But as soon as I turned off the sound system, my ears picked up on the sound of the air blowing through the ductwork, and could still hear the fizzing of escaped carbon dioxide in the several cans of ginger ale strewn about my workstation. The walls were pulsing with bubbles of some transparent energy causing every surface to ripple and melt. Fractal patterns became very obvious.",
      "At this point I was coming up strong and with a fear of how powerful this was going to get I found myself wondering if I'd peaked or if I hadn't even arrived yet and that this trip was a still a long way from over.",
      "I started to connect with BL personalities I've known and others I thought could teach me something. Admittedly, I was a little bit nervous. I wrote to my pal fools gold, and just about shared my name, just in case something really bad happened, but held on to reason enough to resist that impulse. (Anonymity is too important.)",
      "I could hardly type. I could hardly keep myself focused on the screen. I was correcting typos left and right. I sent a message to jesusgreen, who, in my opinion, is a genuine philosopher, sharing that this morning glory experience was redefining what bodyload meant to me, sharing with him that I was trembling like a Parkinson's victim. I decided to watch my copy of Moonrise Kingdom, which I hadn't seen yet, and this movie has since topped my list of favorites, along with American Beauty, Donnie Darko, and a few others. I sent a message to Morninggloryseed, who I had just reached out to for advice I made a few posts in different forums. I shared that I feel like limbs could fall off. He suggested I listen to a particular Bwiti initiation music from Gabon for Iboga shamanic journeying.",
      "I stopped the movie and listened. I noticed the animals who share my home reacted quite energetically to the music. They seemed slightly afraid, and I immediately responded by calming them. This action helped me relax, and sure enough, I felt good again. I connected with what I'm going to call an animal spirit that is present in this home. I feel that my daughter has a dog totem, but I have always had a strong affinity for felines. I became aware that I am very animalistic, and this interferes with my theological direction. That is a conundrum to solve another day. Right now it seems like I'm trying to walk a path perpendicular to my nature.",
      "This, to steal from Morninggloryseed, ended the Mental Stage, and I was about to proceed into the Visionary Stage. One particular fractal pattern overlay everything I saw, eyes open, eyes closed. In fact it got to the point where I thought some kinetic energy had rearranged certain low-mass objects throughout my house to form the same fractal pattern (the dog hair on the carpets, for example).",
      "Four hours later, and a meal of bread, cheese, and cottage cheese, after having finally finished Moonrise Kingdom (again, fantastic movie), I found myself going outside for frequent tobacco breaks. I was in a situation where the fractal patterning was apparent everywhere I looked. I wondered if it would be permanently etched to the back of my eyelids. I wasn't scared of that. I am a poor illustrator, but I attempted to draw the fractal shapes that I saw. I mentioned to Morninggloryseed that the concept I drew was...this shape, and it was readily apparent that it goes on outward for infinity.",
      "But when I looks into the center, which at first appeared to be an empty white square, or rectangle, or triangle, or whatever polygon it was, then, if I let myself understand that it is inward that infinity goes and not outward and that to look into it is to look into myself... That is the lesson I learned. I'll ponder it further, especially after this coming weekend when I enjoy 450ug of AL-LAD I have acquired.",
      "All in all, I have to share that this has been a worthwhile experience. I won't be doing this again for a long time, though. The bodyload is so very taxing, but this next day, I have no hangover. I'm not depressed by any means. But I don't have the motivation to do anything but think about yesterday's events.",
      "Enjoy the report, friends."

Now, it went from being completely unheard of to one of the most popular party substances, and myself, the casual observer, should note some effects on dosage, as Ive witnessed massive overdoses that turned out fine and normal doses that went whack.",

      "We had gathered at Kyle's house, after leaving Kelly's house, nearly 1:00 am. Jon was still going on about his new 'legal' mushrooms, as he had been for the past few hours. Eventually, Kyle started to get interested in trying them, and urged me to try them with him.",
      "I had no reasons to be skeptical of these interesting little mushroom caps, so I took the first dosage Jon gave us (3 caps of roughly 1g each), and ground it up in a grinder, then mixed the little crumbs with some peanut butter. It tasted a little bad, but not intolerable.",
      "After sitting around for about 10 minutes, Kyle appeared to be getting antsy, and wanted more for a sure, full on trip. He ground us another 3g each, and we made it into a little game by competing to find who could eat the pile of ground up mushroom first. We pinched a bit, and chewed. It tasted really dry and gross, but we chased it with lemonade.",
      "Kyle still wasn't satisfied (although our initial consumption had been only 30 min before), and he wanted to straight shot it, by just mixing another 2g each in water. This concoction tasted awfully peculiar. I didn't mind it, but I didn't care for it either. (Note: after regular usage of a fair amount of Amanitas in this form, separataed by about 4 days each in concurrence with one another, it slowly started becoming more intolerable, to the point that the mere sight of a mushroom-water mix makes me sick to my stomach.)",
      "I sat down in Kyle's black leatherman, and zoned out to the music. I was a little dissapointed with the effects. I felt good, but it wasn't anything too different than a Cannabis high (which we had been consistently smoking at various times). The room was dimly lit from Kyle's kitchen table chandelier. I listened to the music, and stared intently at the visualizer on Kyle's computer. I watched the same patterns I had always seen on any given visualizer, not seeing anything unordinary or exciting.",
      "I had been staring at that uncaptivating visualizer for 20 min before I realized I was staring. I shook my head, and looked around the room.",
      "'Gasp!' ZANG! 'Whoah...'    Anybody who's tripped before, can testify that those three words are exactly what goes on the second you realize you're tripping.",
      "The room had been vitalized. Everything pulsed with its own energy and significance. Everything was...new. This lead Kyle and I to explode into a an excited frenzy of exploring his captivating apartment. I looked a roll of paper towels, with cartoonish looking cats on them. I remarked that the paper towels were 'weird,' which confused a sober member of the group. He asked me what it looked like, thinking I was seeing it change shape or something that one would expect from LSD(which I have never experienced). I replied that they look like paper towels, but they just had a 'weird' aura, like the 'same kind of weirdness surrounding hardcore computer geek.' I remarked (no offense). I'm not sure if he got what I was saying. I can remember full well the feelings the paper towels alone conveyed in me.",
      "I turned around, and faced Kyle's entertainment center, which was the anchor for his chain of christmas lights strung along the wall of this room. They appeared to be writhing like a snake. This sight was similar to optical illusions on paper: if you stared hard, it would stop, but if I just casually stared at them weakly, they appeared to writhe along the wall.",
      "I called out to Kyle to come see this. His reaction was misleading at first, as he stared at the lights encompassing the room: hm. that's great. they're moving!",
      "This startled me, that he was seeing the same thing I was. It was a weird mental experience, to know that he felt and was experiencing the same sensations I was with this drug.",
      "The rest of the night was spent appraising every object in eyesight, as everything had its own 'feeling' that it emitted. These 'feelings' weren't our run-of-the-mill emotions. I'm talking about new and uplifting, and fully unique 'feelings' were emitted from each object.",
      "I woke to Kyle getting ready for work, with Jon asleep on the floor. Apparently, I had only been asleep for 3.5 hours. When I got up and walked home, I felt at peace.",
      "Those poisonous little mushrooms had changed me. I saw the world a little differently that day, as everything seemed to work in harmony with everything. I was no longer the center of my own universe. I was no longer the main component of my own life. I seemed to play a mere roll, and the energy of the world took over, and played its part in my life concurrently with the rest of time and space.",
      "I got inside my house, dropped all my things, and began laughing hysterically. I didn't know why, and immediately afer realizing I was laughing (which seemed to eminate from nothing, and lasted a solid 2 or 3 min), I stopped abruptly. I gathered my things, and went to bed for the first time in what was at this point 67 hours. My dreams comforted me, and I continued on with my life after waking up."

I had been told that this kind of X was very stong and knowing that brought on a little apprehension but more curiosity than anything. But the thing was that that night I was short on cash, so being at a rave and all meant water cost an arm and a leg and I was dead broke after E and the door fee. This also brought on a sort of eerie feeling knowing that the only reported deaths on E were from over dehydration and heat exhaustion.",
      "I took the small red triangular shaped pill at about 9:30pm, feeling the euphoric effects about 30 minutes later. It was pretty much the same as before except I was only 5 minutes into the trip and already feeling the effects stronger that the peak of the pill I took before. What happend next is very hard to describe but I'll try my best. All of a sudden I noticed my heart was about to beat out of my chest and I found myself drenched in a hot sweat. Soon I found my mind running with intese thoughts that sent me into a panic I could feel throughout my whole body. Kind of a sharp warm feeling that wasn't pleasant at all. I thought if I stopped dancing and sat down it would go away. I was wrong. My mind was totally out of control, so I got up and headed to the bathroom to splash some water on my face. When I got up I felt a sort of extremely drunk sensation as I tried to walk (oh, and I forgot to add that during this whole time I had extreme jitters and I lost the feeling of what I was touching).",
      "But, somehow I made to the bathroom where I splashed water on my face, then I went back to sit down with my friends who had all consumed the same pill and seemed to be having a great time dancing. Soon this panic passed after lots and lots of deep breaths and self talk, and after I felt drained of all energy and plopped down next to a wall. The feelings that followed weren't exactly unpleasant, but I seemed to keep that state throughout the whole night.",
      "I think E is a great drug, but I'm afraid to do it again because of the bad effects it put me through."

About 3 hours in, I was having panic attacks so bad I swear I was going to die (as it turns out, sever paranoia and panic attacks are symptoms of a caffeine OD). I felt sick, my chest felt tight, and it seemed like it was never going to end. 5 hours in, the symptoms where still very strong, at the end of the peak. It was only at about 8 hours in when I had come down to a state of mind where I could clearly think, and I was no longer shaking. However, it took about 13-15 hours before the effects totally ceased. Needless to say, I will never be doing that again. It is not fun."

The Buddhist group I belong to were NOT happy when without too much difficulty they discovered my infatuation with the Diviners Leaf Nevertheless, I am still scheduled for further Ordination later this year. As I tirelessly explained it is my profound respect for the plant, its meditational gifts and Shamantic introspective that drove me almost weekly into her arms.",

The first 2 proving to be among the most horrific experiences of my life, the very first so outlandishly nightmarish that I still at times pause and find myself wondering how my sleeping hours are not chronically plagued with unrelenting psychotic reminisces.",

After tortured deliberation I was willing to once again throw myself at her feet in the hopes of finally having a spiritually experience- and though never expecting profound at least a moderately pleasant one. I felt from my first two voyages I had more than deserved at least that. I had more than paid my dues.",

So I chose my mothers cold, dark, stone-layered basement, creepy as hell but nonetheless an ideal place - I had spent almost every day of my late adolescence bodybuilding among my fathers scattered tools and massive workbenches so for me it was a very familiar and comfortable setting. It also served as my old music studio during the mid-late 80s where I did most of my Goth/Industrial soundwork so for all intensive purposes the place was like my second home.",
      "Reassessing my dosages from my first attempt months back, I would start with 4 droppers of Emerald Essence tincture, this time once again undiluted. Burns like a mother, but I just cannot be bothered with the hot water measuring, dual eyedroppers, etc. etc. Its all I can do to try to hold the shit in my mouth, smoke, and get the whole rest of the process somewhat accurate while all the time dealing with the ever-present extreme nervous tension. I would follow this by (hopefully) clearing an entire 0.2 gm cone of 10x in one try through my favorite ice-twist bong on top of a half-leaf of Hawaiian Premium. I knew a second attempted hit after this would be extremely doubtful, but just in case, I always had my wooden 2-chambered pipe as a backup and some extract, although what I packed here should be PLENTY and I had no real intention at the time of using anything more the first attempt out. Richard would say I was more than ready. I couldnt wait to call him when this little adventure was over as long as it went as planned.",
      "So I would have an entire morning until late afternoon totally alone in my mother's shadowy basement, where not only did she live alone, but was visiting my Aunt who lived over an hours drive away. It was 9:00am, the basement was practically soundproof  and the neighborhood quiet. All in the nearby vicinity were either at work, in school or just gone. Perfect.",
      "Lacking the luxury of Richard-The-Worriers presence with me this time out, I reached into my trusty salvia-knapsack and pull out the Home Depot bag where my new sitter lie patiently waiting: 75 feet of newly purchased 3ml.thick yellow plastic rope.",
      "I would wrap myself securely around the steel main beam in the basements center  consecutively looping the rope around twice and then tying 5 loose knots continuously until I reached the end. Id make the rope loose enough so that I could sit somewhat comfortably in a half-lotus position  even on a cement floor, but secure enough where I was going NOWHERE fast except to be able to swivel around to reach my knapsack if needed. With the poor lighting down here this tedious process would take a good 10 minutes at least to undo in a lucid state never mind in a churning, salvia mind-swirl, and that way in case I happened to completely freak out and TRIED to untie myself the experience would be over long before I managed to break free and create rambunctious havoc roaming around my mothers house. Doubtlessly totally unnecessary, as I figured I'd probably be close to comatose anyway.",
      "This time I also decided to once again wear only my black Zen robe and sit on a thick throw cushion I happened across in an upstairs bedroom folded up snug against the mainbeam. Did I actually think utilizing religious overtones and gowning up would have made a difference?",
      "Finally situated and comfortably sitting in place I went through the usual tincture-torture, bringing along my little timer to count off 4 minutes before swallowing. And so with only a 100 watt fluorescent bulb far behind me as the only external light source I hit the torch, whose dim glow dances at the walls with an almost conjuring effect, the immanent, beckoning realm at once and always frightening and exhilarating .",
      "My hand-my whole fucking arm- is quivering, and it's like this every single time with no exceptions - all week long I've anticipated the moment -then upon its arrival I open the torch and hold the flame right at the cone and I hesitate DAMN if this isn't the one drug that always scares the living shit outta me every time we meet. This is the one given that will never change.",
      "Brief visions of carneys and clowns and rusted old rides",
      "I always hated carnivals. As a child I found them somewhat foreboding, and clowns always conferred a sense of dread. Amusement parks and their ilk have a distinctive, depressive aura all their own, always seemingly aged and dirt-ridden. For me they are the landscapes of sadness and vanished reverie. Ive long associated the thought of carneys with Loss.",
      "And here I am: looking over and down at another dreaded Ferris wheel, but within the confines of a rollercoaster approaching its end accent.",
      "The coaster is packed full, my fellow passengers collectively silent and sitting stoically upright, with none of the usual hand waving or hoops of excitement. All are faceless, in that they have faces but no features whatsoever, just empty canvases of blank flesh.",
      "All are wearing the exact same fleeting, long grey gauze sheeting that rips through the air, billowing upward and back as if I'm riding the ripples of some darkened cloud on a midnight sky - and yet there is no wind or even a light breeze of any type. The air is dead. In fact there is no sound whatsoever except the creaking of the coasters wheels wheezing upward although the park below is packed full and vibrant.",
      "I look at the passenger next to me, who is in turn looking at me silently and without expression like she is expecting me to say something. I say she as it has breasts plainly visible beneath the gauze. The coaster slows at the very top, and I am now hesitant, never having enjoyed coasters all that much and - more importantly  right now I am still conscious of being under salvias influence and in turn know this will be anything but your run-of the-mill rollercoaster descent.",
      "As the coaster starts to slow I notice my feet, legs, and hands have started to liquefy into the cracked vinyl fabric of the seat. I am TURNING INTO THE COASTER and instead of briefly halting at the very top it continues upward, smoothly and completely disengaging itself from the track and rising on into space. I look around - forgetting all about salvia as this is so real and look to my partner for aid but she is silent, her attention now fully forward.",
      "I open my mouth to scream as the coaster suddenly tips and accelerates then flips straight back, completing a counterclockwise circle where I am seized fast to the seat but my mouth and lower jar are held back, elongating my eyes and face, thinning me out like stretched taffy as my whole face cant keep up with the rest of my body as it flips and plummets straight downward. From all around me there is now the muffled chorus of a thousand singing Ooohs and aahhhs. The last thing I am aware of is the Ferris wheels deep, repetitive laughter as I smash below into a thousand pieces of disembodied consciousness and all is a sheet of white.",
      "GREETINGS FROM OLD MEXICO",
      "Im staring straight into an expansive sky of white porcelain. Naked, and stumbling forward in the middle of a jungle road  deep grey piney knots of gnarled foliage to either side of me and its all so very familiar. The overgrowth so thick I couldnt venture past a foot of it without ripping myself open on bent, sharpened branches poking out like grey ribs. Its like this all over the Yucatan jungles.",
      "Then it hits me. Our last 2 summers family vacations. The road Im on heads towards the Mayan ruins of Tulum. And suddenly Im surrounded by people, thongs of people everywhere, a materialized column of thousands sauntering and stumbling forward and past me in this blistering heat with seemingly grim determination. Most are fanning themselves with what looks like large rolled up leaves.",
      "In their resolve they hardly give Mr. Naked a glance.",
      "I look around. Its gotta be at least 11:00 and I am pouring sweat but my attention is momentarily riveted to the trees on either side of me. There is a distinct sense of someone, a Presence distinct from the others, of something IN there. Something in the trees studying me, and its more than an uncomfortable feeling. What the fu..?",
      "Kids have gathered all around me  grabbing my hands and pulling me forward. Unlike many of the others theyre running all around with animated enthusiasm. A few point at my crotch and giggle. Rather than embarrassment I dont give this a second thought, my only objective trying to keep up with them but this HEAT is sapping my energy! Im exhausted like I was walking in this oven for days on end.",
      "Vamanos Papa! , two little Mexican boys laugh good naturedly.",
      "PAPA???",
      "Ven! Ven aca Hombre!",
      "Two ancient women, squat and dressed entirely in black rush up and accost me, pushing the kids aside, grabbing my arms from each side and propelling me forward with surprising strength as we are literally soaring vertically inches off the ground past the innumerable single couples, tour groups and packs of solitary native children. And there are 'Others' cartoon-like figures resembling huge, plastic parade floats hovering flaccidly or bobbing up and down, heads above the rest of this moving wall of humanity, grinning stupidly at me as I fly by. Amongst the many packs of children they remind me of dejected dolls being tossed about in the air before discarded to some dusty playrooms corner.",
      "One character with a head like a carrot and dressed in a long yellow tailcoat with an oversized bowler hat stops as I pass by, tips his hat to me while bowing from the waist to the very ground. Upon raising he replaces the hat with an exaggerated, dandied flourish and points past me, redirecting my attention to whatever the collective goal is that lies ahead.",
      "And then SHE appeared from beyond the imposingly thick tree-line. Vast and ancient, in only a tattered green-gold shawl, she is androgynous with skin glistening black as night. Arms pressed tightly to her sides her hands are empty and bent arthritically upward at the wrists, resembling long talons curling into half circles. Her hair was set straight up into a broad, twisting coiffure. And with her head thrown back she stares down over the crowed, scanning them like some inpatient Goddess. Regal and omnipotent among her minions, she looked like a midnight, polarized version of Queen Neffertiti. She was well over 8 feet tall yet so stick thin she couldnt have weighed more than 90 lbs, but this woman, this creature, could easily rend me to shreds and hand the strips back piecemeal. I must be out of my fucking mind, not being able to tear my eyes from her. To say she was a vision of abject fright would be the ultimate understatement, although she stood stock still in a totally non-threatening manner. She seemed almost bored as she perused the crowd, not bothering to give me even a cursory glance.",
      "We have reached a clearing, my two guides immaterializing from my side, which causes me to drop unceremoniously to the ground in the center of a large tree-studded clearing. If there is any further doubt as to where I am it disappears as I rise and am once again facing the pyramid ruins of Chichan-itza.",
      "Chichan-Itza...",
      "No way am I getting near that again. Never having ever suffered vertigo in my life until last summer as when I climbed to the top. I was overwhelmed by a mental terror I never dreamed experiencing. Luckily there was a fist-thick man-made rope on its eastern side for the benefit of petrified tourists like myself. I went down all 91 steps sliding on my ass and thanking Buddha for delivering me to solid ground, my bones and brain spared a likely flesh-crushing tumble down the awkward, crumbling 10 high stone steps, snowballing all that would have lain in my path.",
      "Looking around and straight ahead, I had to keep reminding myself I was on a drug. And salvia or no salvia, Chichan-itza lies before me once again. So damned real and overwhelming that after awhile reminding myself of anything was making no difference whatsoever, threatening me once again with its prehistoric, colossal height. Timeless and inviting.",
      "No fucking way.",
      "Stopping RIGHT HERE and whatever happens, happens!",
      "The crowd has now converged, and we are encircled by what must be a thousand separate black-cloaked antediluvian beings, both male and female and all chanting the same mantra that resembles the TM Om intonation but in this case sounds more like a guttural version of Weeee. Chorused in grand unison in a cadence so low it makes the very Earth rumble. If I ever witnessed the physical definition of crowd-induced Ritual, this is it.",
      "And SHE has returned, this harsh Queen oblivious somehow to all eyes but mine, and this time she stares and points directly at me, her face a mask of loath impatience. The Weees are growing in volume and now the entire crowd has joined in synch. All are standing stock-still in place as the Queen advances toward me with hardened, dour resolve, muttering something with machine-gun rapidity, her outstretched right arm rising toward the sky, toward the top of the pyramid. Her animated rant feels like a spell, becomes more guttural, from deep within until it rises to a wailed screech, and now shes no longer just pointing but jabbing, stabbing her finger simultaneously at me and the Pyramids summit while flying towards me.  I am overwhelmed, personalizing her as the embodiment of every daunting, wrathful incarnation I have ever feared.",
      "As shes almost on me all I can do is supplicate and fall to my knees in cowed dread, hoping against hope that she has some inkling of the age-old custom of Mercy. I huddled myself as best I could into a ball and covered my head exactly like some terrified child who at night thinks if they keep the blanket pulled up over their heads the Boogeyman will remain at bay. Not since my first salvia trip have I been so shitlessly petrified.",
      "MEET YOU INMOROCCO?",
      "Ah Booleh Booleh! Ah Booleh Booleh!",
      "Peeking upward She is now nowhere in sight but WHAT.",
      "This loud, piercing gibberish is accompanied by a succession of sharp, searing pains in my left ear, which feels wet and burns with heat. Looking up I find myself staring directly into the face of a butt ugly, curd-chewing camel who appraises me with a somewhat curious interest. And sitting high on the camel is what looks like a Tuareg nomad, swaddled from head to toe entirely in blue robes, with only sun-blackened forearms and creased face exposed. He peers upon my naked form, and leaning down starts furiously hitting at me with a long wooden switch on my face and head. Raising my arm against the glaring sky and frontal assault only seems to infuriate him all the more. He keeps switching at my head... looking up and struggling to escape I can only move slow-motion through deepening sand that sucks at my feet.",
      "Ah Booleh Booleh! Ah Booleh Boo!",
      "He is now screaming and I don't have time to think past 'WTF' as I notice I am directly in front of a large, dome-like structure of comparable size but looks more like a gargantuan stone egg than a Pyramid -for Chican-itza is nowhere in sight and the only people about are a small group of the bobbing, cartoon-characters from my earlier road pilgrimage (including other versions of my carrot friend in the bowler hat) that seem to be working in twos  or should I say slaving - on the Egg carrying stone blocks around its base. Theres the distinct sound of gnashing gears although there is no machinery of any type anywhere.",
      "All stop and drop their loads when they hear my Buddy-on-High screaming. Collectively they start jumping up and down, giggle and point, which only infuriates the Tuareg further who rises up to a standing position from the now bored camel and raises both arms toward the heavens and screaming I-dont-know-what before wailing on me with renewed vigor. I must have done SOMETHING to piss this guy off but what I havent a clue - but what is far worse than that is that as I go to speak it hits me that I cant remember who the hell 'I' am. Remembering Chichan-itza and The Queen I nonetheless cant connect with Jonathan. I had no name and no conception of what tripping was or what had happened to cause this, but am now only connected somehow with my being an (?American) (with no money) (and no clothes!) and no idea HOW I arrived in this increasingly unnerving situation.",
      "Asshole persists with the switch screaming this Booleh-Booleh shit and all I do is stand there like a frightened idiot as now a small cluster of about five or six other riders in turn are approaching from my left, waiving, shouting and gesturing at the infidel who upset their companion so. Not looking good at all. Having always obsessed on visiting Northern Africa, Caro, the Sphinx and great Pyramids of Giza, this was not exactly how I envisioned my longed-for pilgrimages.",
      "I feel another hot wave across my skin as I start to run toward the stone egg structure. A futile endeavor. Where the hell do I think Im going! Im looking for, what?...refuge?",
      "The other Tuaregs had met up with my tormentor and all are now playing their own desert version of Cat & Mouse, riding to either side of me while cross-crossing my path - their camels closing in as they direct my course of escape while continually kicking at me as I stumbled pointlessly forward. I have never felt such heat in my entire life, sweating so much Im sure if my luck holds out Ill melt into nothing before my tormentors grow bored and think up some new game at my expense. Each step sinking deeper into sand that looks more fluorescent than golden brown, like running in a dream where the faster you go the less headway you seem to make.",
      "The sudden absence of nomadic laughter coincides with the grounds starting to violently tremble as I fall over. The old boys behind me must have halted to observe the Eggs center - now abruptly starting to shine and throb along its vertical axis revealing itself not as a stone structure but more a pulsing, wet grey wound.",
      "Salvia",
      "Jonathan",
      "Both tying in to the now burgeoning comprehension of my coming down from salvias peak, for just as quickly as it all started everything collapsed in a sudden halt, an abrupt awakening from my self-induced transitory flight.",
      "The grey plasma-like Monolith in turn reveals itself to be in fact just the protruding stone wall of my mothers basement as the old boys behind me have indeed disappeared, replaced once again by my awe-inspiring Cancun Queen - the last thing standing directly between myself and mornings lucidity - no longer threatening but seemingly radiant with matronly understanding and a look now of empty, profound sadness. I had felt a strong presence once before, but this was the first physical manifestation of a being that seemed somehow to be the key presence in these absurd realms.",
      "And rather than relief my mind wells with emptiness finally grasping the obvious. I suddenly feel so stupid, like I should have some life-affirming question at the ready for this rapidly fading representation before me which was simply my own subconscious rendering of the human condition in the Face of the Infinite... Lady Salvia.",
      "WAIT! the scream in my head comes out as incoherent, mumbled garbage.",
      "My eyes explode with red floaters, my blood pressure must be sky high and I think Im about to pass out, so afraid that if I take the second to squeeze my eyes close for relief when I release them she will be long gone.",
      "And then worse than any faded withdrawal  she purposely just turned away, as if I was not worthy of whatever it was I was meant to confirm or understand from the very beginning.",
      "And along with her broken, ephemeral image  along with all that I had just recalled in moderately vivid detail - I knew there was so much morebut whatever these other images would have been were all fleeting at best, and I should be happy with what I had, as within 10 minutes I might not even have that.",
      "WITH REGARDS TO SECOND CHANCES",
      "Im slumped over staring into the cellar floor, robe wide open, stomach and left hand sticky with saliva and tincture slime, made worse by the fact that it is now quite cold down here, and I realize that I have drifted off either to sleep or just passed out. Two minutes? Two hours? I cant even make out the timer thats just a yard away and in my present mental state for all I know it could even be evening by now.",
      "And pain. A lot of pain and thats a first! Man do I feel like shit",
      "My left ear is burning something fierce, and reaching up my fingers come away dark and wet. I must have wrenched down hard on my two loop earrings and now theres only one, the other probably somewhere at my feet.  Nice. Good going.",
      "There are also dull tingly pains all around my upper chest and sides. Putting that plastic rope around my semi-bare midsection was a real dumbass idea as Im sure to develop a nice set of rope burns which will turn into real nice welts and I cant begin to imagine how I will somehow explain it all to my wife when she sees this mess. I must have jerked around something fierce.",
      "Im growing more and more disheartened as Im once again seemingly unable to break into anything mystical or exceptionally positive although I feel in my heart that some closing brink is so, so within reach.",
      "Brink to what? (I try not to ask myself) What the hell am I talking about?",
      "Reality check: Half naked. Filthy, pissed off and in pain.",
      "Unpleasant.",
      "Im about to call it a day, unwrap myself and leave disgusted when I turn and spy the fresh backup pipe right behind me, packed tight and ready for firing. I had to go it again AND NOW, in haste and with no breaks before I changed my mind or the habitual coward in me will out. I foolishly thought that if lucky I might possibly end up back to exactly where I left off . Before reason takes hold I put the pipe on my lap, reach over to the tincture bottle on its side and quickly squirt 2 (? 3 the bottle was near empty) droppers-full into my mouth.",
      "I squint into the bowl as I mentally with minimal success attempt to tick off 5 minutes in my head before squeezing my eyes tight against the gag reflex and swallowing the tincture at the same time clicking the torch-lighter. And the familiar arises, telling myself to exhale but the lungs arent listening until I almost choke through the exhale. And as I try to catch my breath the familiar increasingly loud ear humming and immediate sweating starts. Never in my life would I ever have believed the body could sweat in such an instantaneous manner before experiencing salvia. It is just so uncanny.",
      "I could now give a shit. This new ringing in my ears is so ever pleasant, so womblike. It lends me a feeling of such complacency that Im no longer worried as I usually get that its my blood pressure rushing to an exceedingly dangerous point.",
      "Not even considering it all strange that there was now a grotesquely fat elderly man playing a childs toy piano in the far right-hand corner by the stairwell, his obesity matched only by his excessively long, accentuated neck. I found it far stranger that there were no sounds emanating from the little piano considering that the notes were plainly visible rising from its keys.",
      "This fat Giraffe-man is singing. I guess youd call it singing but its more like a drawn out, softly pensive lament.",
      "aaahhhh Looooo Loooooaaahhhh Looooo.",
      "HEY! Yes you! Who the hell let you in here!",
      "I catch myself  maybe he is a guest who is staying over. I dont want to anger the guy or worse hurt his feelings and suddenly hate myself for swearing at him. I can be such an asshole, Damnit.",
      "HEY! Did you come for Mary? Are you a friend of my moms?",
      "I feel really bad that I keep yelling but this swooshing rush in my ears is growing louder by the minute and my long string of frustrated shouts continued unanswered and ignored. He just keeps up this weeping, wailing cry-song and weaving his head back and forth.",
      "And then THEY appeared",
      "THE SALVIA LAUNCH LIKE NO OTHER",
      "There were four of them.",
      "Aaaaaahhhh RINK! a dink a dink... a rink a dink... a dink a doooooo",
      "Ohhhh RINK!... a rink-a-dink. a dinka doooo...",
      "The facing wall came alive with an emerging, pale white spotlight illuminating a string of 'dancers' standing dead still until bursting out in unison with that ridiculous Jimmy Durant jingle. Their ludicrous choiring seemed to rise up and engulf my mind, churning my thoughts and growing so loud I threw both palms over my ears but their siren whaling only grew to a pitch so volumous I feared my head would explode.",
      "They were lined up in flawless unison, not like four dancers would line up as one in perfect sync, but more like those scissor and paper cut-out dolls kids make, all accordioned out in the exact same manner as their mirrored counterpart. They sported black-tailed dinner jackets with matching stovetop hats and white gloves and shirts with sharpened collars. Each swung walking sticks as they tapped back and forth and side to side - inching their way slowly toward my tied up prostrated form. They would have looked like four comical versions of 'Mr.Peanut' except none had features, only blackness between hat and collar, in fact anything that would have registered as human flesh took on a deeper hue than invisibility, as I could not see the cement wall behind them through there empty 'faces'.",
      "As they closed in they stopped singing and started collectively humming the same aaahhhh Loooo, aaahhhh Looooo exactly like my mothers fat guest in the corner but who was now nowhere in sight.",
      "Comical Stupid utterly Ludicrous...",
      "Words I said out loud to reassure myself were empty, for there was something malevolently unnerving about them. Their leisurely, unhurried approach promised nothing rewarding in the least. All I could think of was I had landed in the middle of some black cabaret - a burlesque act right out of a Joel-Peter Witkin photography nightmare.",
      "And then I was suddenly jarred and bounced upward right from were I was sitting, literally straight up off the whole cushion and a soft voice mellowed in my ear from the left but came across like a loud scream.",
      "HEEEYYYYY. LOOK . AT..eeeeYOOUUUU.....",
      "In the floor at my side, head thrown back and half beneath the surface with only its throat exposed lies an upper torso and two arms that lean back from the elbows in a reclining position, securing my sitting frame with two propped knees bent and supporting my body firm to its center. Materializing upward the face stretched forth and took on the hue of the concrete, as if it were emerging straight up from the grey flooring looking exactly like a face would if it were pressed flat into a stretched balloon.",
      "Rising, it was naked and nondescript, save for sagged breasts over lean, emaciated ribs and eyes that when opened stared blankly not with pupils but with darker, pooled grey centers neither benevolent nor threatening. And it shined like it was wet. A statuesque, gaunt manikin, come to life rising up from directly below the cellars surface.",
      "With neither knees nor arm movement she  this phantasm - started to 'bounce' me up and down on her lap, not violently with the intention of discharging me off and onto the floor - just a simple but steady rhythmic up and down, like a parent might 'roughly' tease and bounce a child in play.",
      "And then she reached up and around, grabbing the right side of my forehead and back of my neck and gently but with surprising force tugged downward while inching upward, her lips brushing against my left ear as I started to bend over at a physically impossible, sideward angle. In laws of normal physics my hip joints from either side should have snapped as I descended ever downward. Pulling her face up to reach my bent left ear and not externally but from the very center of my subconscious came the softest voice  so unlike the face it originated from  whisper/screaming in my ear but feeling more from my minds center:",
      "'DOOOOOONT BE AFRAID THIS WONT HURT A BIT...'",
      "Then the tap-dancers were upon me",
      "Upon me and INSIDE me, all four with their gloved hands exploring my face and hair  at first rubbing vigorously in swirling motion and then using their fingers to probe into my face, eyes, nose and mouth. The room started to vortex inward as I could no longer see clearly or in any way grasp my bearings, their voices now steadily humming louder and louder with fingers from four pairs of hands in turn vibrating inward, past my skins surface to the center of my brain, the very absence of any sense of pain creating an experience all the more horrifying.",
      "I was at the point of being totally bent sideways in half - with my head and upper body now completely encircled - forced into and through the flesh and bone of my left hip. The rink-a-dinks had desisted from my facial rape, replaced now with 'her' working my entire head ever inwards. I'd taken the street expression becoming intimate with my own ass to a whole new level. If I had previously  my first time out  experienced the depth of mental hell then this was its physical, mirror equivalent. The very cellar where I had spent over 40 years had now become my own private Hieronymus Boche World.",
      "I was gagging and gurgling, struggling to breath through my nose and all that came out was snorts. I thought my eyes were exploding and starting to run down my face unto the floor while all the time she cooed in the most soothing voice making it all the more appalling. And the very last thing I remember hearing before my entire head melted into my hip, I turned into a literal Human Doughnut, and the world went mercifully black, was her now gentile, calming, almost inaudible whisper",

      "The Butterfly counts not days but moments, and has time enough.",
      "- Zen proverb",
      "And with no memory whatsoever:",
      "Im centered in some immense antechamber, a darkened hallway where each of the walls support great, oval portraits, each with its own set of candles on either side that offer the only source of illumination. Expanding out endlessly as far as my eye could see, each portrait is identical, covered over completely in black curtains, the only sound a soft rippling, similar to a breeze passing through plastic tarpaulin.",
      "A vast museum of infinite ambiguity.",
      "The endless hall is filled with hundreds of small children quietly sitting at small kindergarten-type desks silently intent on some kind of test before them. I too am squeezed tightly into a tiny seat constructed for someone 1/3 my stature. Glancing down my entire body is enwrapped, clothed only in white sheeting. Held fast, it never crosses my mind that I should be in any way apprehensive, only that I need to get up and proceed down into that vast corridor and quickly",
      "PEPOTA!, my voice a booming echo though no one seems to notice or care, my cry only adding to the accentuated silence",
      "She was our live-in maid from very early childhood, when I lived in Northern Spain up until the age of seven. She who was as close to the family as if she was a blood relative and practically a second mother to me, someone whos loving memory hasnt passed through my mind in well over? Why would that name blurt out suddenly after all these years?",
      "With the myriad of figures surrounding me I feel utterly alone. Unable to move I dont even attempt to struggle, and just sit there in resigned loneliness and weary, fragile sadness.",

      "HOLA NINO!",
      "HOLA SENORA ROSARIA! I yell back and attempt to waive but cannot.",
      "I know this woman, who has suddenly appeared across the squared, inner courtyard and is hanging wash from her opened kitchen window. The entire apartment alcove is suddenly alive with animated conversations as more and more women have appeared, likewise hanging wash, or simply hanging out their respective windows, elbows rested on ledges in anticipation to long mid-morning bouts of gossip.",
      "I go to waive again at Rosaria, not giving where I am a second thought but can only swivel my head as my hand and arm seem fixed in a forward leaning position. I am held fast, and looking down see nothing but the courtyards three story drop.",
      "From what I could tell I was part of the window ledge, but crazy as it sounds - and completely unaware of being under a drugs influence - the memorable, nostalgic sights around me kept any and all feelings of terror and panic well at bay. For I was momentarily stunned at my minds sudden clarity to these surroundings and unable to fully believe I could actually be back where I have once again found myself in Spain.",
      "My childhood Spain as it was  over 40 years earlier.",
      "'Here you go sweetie'",

So frozen in shock and disbelief I can only observe, not daring to cry out or interrupt in any way in case this moment is broken, feeling waves of sentiment long buried in a far distant past long forgotten by years of selfish misunderstandings and veiled remorse.",
      "And then...'I' entered...",
      "I am watching an exact replica of myself at about age 5 enter the room from the corner entryway: Everything was exactly as I had known it probably 40-plus years hence! I am mesmerized. Actually WATCHING MYSELF AS A CHILD move through this slice of pre-adolescent life-at-a-glace.",
      "'Myself' moves towards my father's small table and is swept up into his arms, head buried in his shoulder. I am able to sense his lined face as it nuzzles my neck and I laugh into his collar. The look on my fathers face stops me dead. I feel so hot I could pass out. The moment is at once heart rendering and totally implausible.",
      "'I' then ran from the room, and I was tormented at my inability to follow myself and stay, mesmerized by my mother and fathers now youthful features. For all I had for memories up until this point (when I rarely cared to rouse them at all) was his pain-wracked body dying for two long months in a hospital ward, waiting in coma's embrace for the bone cancer to finally take him. I wanted to grab hold of this kid (myself!), warn him of his immanent future before it was once again too late, to make alternative decisions - to speak those words never spoken.",
      "DAMMIT I never wanted to leave. I no longer cared HOW or WHY or HOW LONG or WHAT any of this was or when I would wake up but my tenuous desperation at grasping the moment was more painful than having to suffer any past physical agony and less painful than my inability to move and participate in these evolved proceedings.",
      "DAD! MA! My call is thousands of miles away as he just went back to his paper, accompanied by my mothers hum at the dishwashing shed started. The womens voices outside made me turn and I closed my eyes, squeezing them shut so tight thinking for some reason that if I kept them closed the moment would prove eternal.",
      "Fade out...",
      "When I opened then I was in a spinning vortex of jumbled thoughts - no longer in Spain but I had no time for lament. I witnessed snippets of a history gone forever, fresh and vibrant as they ragged past me: My father golfing with me by his side -tired and uninterested yet happy just to be his son and included in his treasured pastime.",
      "My Father: valid memories started hastening by at a speed comparable to a rapidly shuffling deck of cards, so many at once and at such a rapid onslaught I couldnt even stop any longer to.",
      "'HOWS MY LITTLE MAN!'",
      "Now it was my Grandfather shouting down at me. That loud, bellowing voice behind his massive jowls broken into smiles as he patted my head so hard I saw stars. I could have cried. It was the one solid hero of my boyhood. My best friend, My 'Grampie' and before THIS were just memories of months of his Alzheimers malicious descent. 'My Little Man', his favorite pet name and one I adored. I haven't had the heart to utter those words aloud in later years as the pain was too great. Better (I thought) to let it stay buried, as what I refused to acknowledged might never come back to hurt me.",
      "Looking around and NOW I was once again sitting at some kids birthday party (?mine) at Hickory Lodge, a place and time where once there were countless adult males all around, were childhood life was for me what it is in storybooks -innocent and joyous, with no lack of affection and guidance. I am now the last immediate remaining 'elder, late 40's but with no males in my family older than myself.",
      "Fading...fading.... my ear was burning and I looked around there must be 50 people in this room all talking to me at once. Im trying to see but everything is growing hazy and my mind is unclear. I see a floor and walls and so, so many people, people who are now leaving in droves and I hear 'Chose to stay' somewhere What the fuck is that and where is Grampie. Where is Dad.",
      "'DAD!'",
      "Not me...",
      "There are 2 very small boys sitting huddled up to each other in the corner of some basement I am in, looking anxious and afraid. They dont say anything else but I can tell they want me to come with them and I feel hurt and sad and alarmed that they will now disappear for I know somehow that they are my own sons but I WANT TO STAY! I WANT WHAT HAS GONE FAR PAST. 'Grampie!!!' was all I responded, the scream in my head answered with only their hurt stares.",
      "Dad I am so sorry for not being the son I could have been. Too late. Too late. I want to stay.",
      "Fade in",
      "And OVER.",
      "I WOULD MAKE A MOST INEPT CRIMINAL",
      "Wanting nothing more than to just bolt home I spent all of maybe 30 minutes cleaning up after myself with such mechanical incompetence that I would definitely have to go over every inch of this house again early tomorrow before my mothers return. So muddled, saddened and confused I must have left enough evidence to my being here I wouldnt make it past her most superficial scrutiny. Everything seemed in place.",
      "I looked over one last time at my mothers house, the house I had grown up in off and on since birth. I thought of the many family ghosts who had so very long ago wandered its quarters  from my uncle who literally built it to the two key male influences who had lived my life, loving me irregardless and hoping to make a difference.",
      "And suddenly Im laughing my ass off, out loud and so hard I cannot stop.",
      "Peace.  And safe journeys to you all."

      "I first learned of LSA many years ago after reading articles about morning glory seeds (Ipomea species). Unfortunately, these were difficult to obtain except as chemically treated seeds and I was not interested in being poisoned for my own protection by paternalistic corporations.",
      "In the late 1970s I bought a little book called Legal Highs at a headshop and discovered Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose contained LSA. I was interested but also apprehensive about trying these. After all, LSA is a precursor to LSD and it was used ceremonially in the form ololiuqui by Native Mexicans and others from that part of the world to induce powerful visionary experiences. What if I took these seeds into my body and had a terrifying vision? Would I have to go to the hospital? Would the police be involved and then what?",
      "I decided to try the HBWR seeds anyway and purchased a little baggie with 24 seeds from the same headshop. I read the instructions and proceeded to clean the fuzzy coating off nine of the seeds using a single edge razor blade. That was tedious work but worth it to minimize potential toxicity (and I was worried about eating the poison treated morning glory seeds!). Next, I crushed 9-12 seeds with a hammer, mixed them in water and drank the whole mess. The taste was horrible like a mix of raw green peppers and coffee. The taste was so bad I wanted to vomit but held it down anyway.",
      "Within an hour I began to notice the first effects. These were changes in my vision and a warm pleasant feeling. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that my pupils were extremely dilated and the whites looked yellow but then everything had a yellowish cast. I was grinning from ear to ear. I do not remember very much of this first trip (way back in 1979) except that it was pleasant with time, space, and size distortions. There was no panic, no fear, no horrible visions, and no physical sickness. I smoked a little reefer during the night and some cigarettes. The trip lasted some eight hours. The next morning I was sleepy, probably a combination of the HBWR alkaloids and staying up until 3 in the morning.",
      "I began eating HBWR seeds fairly often over the next 20 years and never felt sick or had a bad experience. After my first experience, instead of drinking them in a glass of water I ground them to a powder in a pepper grinder and put that into gelatin capsules. \t\t\t",
      "I believe setting is important when taking psychedelics like HBWR. I always made sure that there was nothing urgent to do, that I had fasted for at least six hours (no cheeses or other aged/fermented foods or other MAO inhibitors), kept the lights low, listened to ambient types of music, had a cup of tea nearby, some high quality sticky marijuana and a few cigarettes (Camel straights). Good company was also helpful even if they were not taking HBWR."

      "Several months ago I started to smoke cannabis on a regular basis, something I had done several years before, but had to quit to save money. Anyway, one of my first times back on the pipe was actually with a Volcano Vaporizer. I had made a few new friends in a new town, and I was invited to a little smoking powwow at a guys house whose name was Mario. Now, normally I would preserve his anonymity by not providing his name, but it does come into play later.",
      "The party was a really chill sort of event. None of the people were party smokers, they were artists. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a lack of pipes, bongs, joints any of that stuff. I was thinking 'What are we to smoke with?'. Well, Mario had brought this heavy, electric cone which was a volcano vaporizer. I had never used a vaporizer, and thus didn't know anything about them. When he packed the first chamber and filled the bag, I thought that this was some kind of joke. When I took my first hit, all I could think about was a memory from when I was a kid, and I hung out in the grocery store getting stoned off the nitrous in easy cheese cans.",
      "The initial effects were odd, I wasn't really baked, but I was getting a sort of fuzzy headache. I did at least five, or six more hits before I felt baked. At this point I was questioning the credibility of the people who swore by vaporizers as the best way to smoke. I can't quite remember the total of hits I took in the end, but Mario kept filling the chamber, and I kept hitting the bag long after people dropped off. Eventually it was just Mario and me, and I noticed he looked like hell. He looked totally fried. That's when it hit me just how stoned I was. I didn't feel like I was getting high because it didn't have the usual harshness of a normal pipe, it was just like breathing air. I tried to stand up and walk to the bathroom, but I had to crawl. I was way past my comfort level, and I was far from the peak of my experience.",
      "In the bathroom I looked at my eyes, which were a pleasant shade of light pink. The red eye wasn't what made me look high though, it was my sunken eyes, and blank stare. I then did some light meditation in the bathroom (kinda strange, but the quietest part of the house). I turned my psyche into two parts, one that was on the trip and the other that was guiding my movements so I could function. When I walked out I took off my shoes and socks so I could feel the tacky shag carpet squish between my toes. Pure ecstasy. I was inspired to lay back on the carpet and take it in. As I did, a dozen little gnomes jumped out of their huts somewhere in my body and reupholstered my insides with the velvet they have on pool tables.",
      "To truely experience pleasure, one must also experience pain. I've never been much of a masochist, but I was feeling somewhat philosphical, so I put on a kettle to make some yerba mate tea. (WARNING: The following is a VERY bad idea) When the kettle started to steam, it turned first into a fire breathing dragon, and then into a Dalek from Doctor Who (I didn't actually see them, I was thinking about what the kettle looked like, and as a result I thought I saw them). I picked the kettle up by the sides, the pain was excruciating, and poured four cups of mate before I decided to put the kettle down. About two seconds afterward the pain was replaced by a rush of relief that never went away the rest of the night.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "Several minutes later I decided to go back to my dorm. Mario offered me a ride, my first instinct was to say 'No you idiot, you're high!'. Somehow I ended up in the back of his Isuzu Trooper II with one of my good friends, L. I totally forgot that she was the one who introduced me to Mario, and the reason she hasn't been mentioned up to this point is because I have no recollection of her being with me at the party. I remember the ride as the most terrifying experience of my life, not because of the drive itself, but because L kept poking me in the stomach, being a ticklish person normally, combined with the turns of the car which I perceived as violent fish tailing and swerves, it was a horrible experience. All I wanted to do was get out of the car, and at one point I tried to open the door and bail out, but being a dumb stoner I couldn't figure out the lock.",
      "When we got back to the dorm, I was almost instantly back in my room. Where I picked up a rubber frog, a mountain dew, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Anyway, L, who doesn't smoke, and doesn't know what it's like to trip out, called me and forced me to watch the movie 'Saw' with her. I had seen the film before and thought it was a little scary, and now that I was baked, I dreaded watching it. Anyway, to cut a long story short the movie felt like it took forever, and at the end I realized that the movie wasn't scary at all. After that I was sitting in L's room, and I was reading Ovid - which was actually more scary than Saw because the words were tough to read baked - when I dropped into a trance, and went catatonic for a few minutes. It was completely unexpected, and I think it might have been a result of the techno that L habitually listens to. The trance itself is completely impossible to articulate, and half forgotten because L started to shake me because she thought I had passed out. This wasn't cool, I jumped to me feet, turned around, chucked the rubber frog at her and dove out of the room. I ran down the hall laughing, I felt like I'd just dished out justice. She disturbed me when I was in one of the most awesome experiences of my life, so I punished her by throwing a rubber frog at her.",
      "At the end of the hall I sat on a bench and decided to lay on my back. A few minutes passed when an RA came by and saw me. I would normally have freaked out, but this particular RA was a notorious stoner, and I had even sold him some weed once. I was laying there looking at him, all of the bizarre cerebral things were gone. I was coming down, but still pretty stoned. I looked at him, waiting for him to speak. He then said 'Are you blazed?' to which I replied in a sarcastic tone 'Nooooo...' he asked 'Who'd you smoked with.' I told him the truth, and it couldn't have sounded more ridiculous 'Mario'. He laughed at that, he was thinking Super Mario, the iconic video game character. This threw me through a loop, I felt like a bad dog for no reason. I had actually smoked with a guy named Mario, and I could in no way express it without sounding baked. I had down right limed my own feathers to paraphrase Chaucer. I then went to bed dejected. I had no dreams, but I felt like I was in bed for forever, and that the sun had exploded or something because the night was days long.",
      "When I woke up, my hands were excruciatingly painful. I went to the doctor, and lied about what I'd done. They treated my hands of second degree burns, and I had them wrapped in bandages for the next week and a half. He said I was lucky not to get third degree burns and lose all sensation in my hands.",
      "All in all, I'd say the trip was ambiguous. Mentally it was good, but the lasting pain made it kind of not worth it. I still wouldn't trade the experience for the world. It was a valuable experience. I now know not to underestimate the vaporizer."

      "I first started using MDMA during the summer between my sophomore and junior years of high school. It started at a party were I was given a pressed pill. The feeling of warmth and empathy were amazing. Before this experience I was starting to get depressed about nothing it seemed like my life just seemed hard and terrifying. So MDMA was like a godsend a little gift pressed by god herself.",
      "I started to roll every few days that summer. I was self-medicating depression with MDMA. I didnt pay attention to the side effects but my family noticed. My mom thought I was drinking a lot because I was always tired and pissed off when sober.",
      "Lets skip forward to the summer before college. My use had escalated to the point of me rolling every day for about a year and a half I think (my memory is shot I cant remember if I ate or not or what I did a few hours earlier in any detail). During this summer I started to get chest pains. I didnt pay any attention to these pains and attributed it to smoking cigarettes. I was rolling every day this summer on about .3-.5g of MDMA powder. At the end of the summer I could barley walk up stairs with getting winded, my heart racing and nearly blacking out.",
      "I stopped rolling after an overdose the following New Years where I consumed about 1g of MDMA and a handful of various benzos and painkillers (mostly valium and oxycontin). The depression I fell into following this experience made me have uncontrollable crying fits take over me were I would lay in my bed and cry for hours on bad days. The slightest problem in my life was immense in my eyes and my only solution was to break down and cry like a child. The depression got to the point were I attempted suicide the following week (this being the weekend of my overdose I had only been sober for under seven days and the emotional pain was crippling not to mention the terrible state my organs were in I had intense chest pains, spots in my vision, severe HPPD and probable liver damage). I purchased about ten 5mg Valium, fifteen 7.5/500 Lortabs of hydrocodone and one 40mg Oxycontin oh and a bottle of Wild Turkey 101. I took all the pills at once with half the bottle of wild turkey at a friends house (he was throwing a party because he parents were out of town). I was planning on dieing alone in his garage. From what my friends tell me I collapsed before I got to his garage about 30 minutes after ingesting the pills and booze. They tell me I collapsed and vomited on myself mostly whiskey and various white and blue pill shards. They called an ambulance and my stomach was pumped. The doctors in the ER told me I was very lucky for having thrown up before they got there because had I digested all the pills fully I would have been DOA.",
      "Following this experience I am now two weeks sober and hating my life. I can barley think, my vision is terrible( I cant read the letters change color and move around, I have constant color spots in my field of vision, things in the corner of my vision move violently), not to mention the pain I fell deep in my chest and around the area of my stomach were the liver and kidneys are. I find myself looking at people on campus and feel incredible sadness at my own life for not being one of them. I feel alone most of the time even when surrounded by friends. People tell me I look better and dont look like a drug addict anymore but I feel worthless. I still find myself crying uncontrollably sometimes. But there is a small glimmer of hope after hitting rock bottom. Every sober day my mind slowly grows more normal and my memory is coming back to me. Not long term but new memories are starting to stay and the crippling emotional pain is still there but I am now in counseling and in a NA like support group. My life is still wrecked with pain both physicall and emotional my body and mind still crave the warm blanket of MDMA. But a part of me is saying that if I go back down that road it will end with more damage and finally death. I am desperately trying to remain sober. And I know my chances are getting better each day I remain sober.",
      "This isnt a warning about MDMA or drug addictions merely my story about a sad 16 year old who fell in love with getting high. And who turned into a 19 year old who fells like hes body is 80 with the mental faculties of a child. Im told the mental difficulties will improve with time and that will be my saving grace. That and the love I now feel from friends and family who Ive turned to for help. Drugs are no longer holding the leash on my emotions."

      "Last night, my friend M and I had some excess powder sitting about, and we decided to try the infamous combination of dope and coke, a.k.a. 'Speedballing'.  M and I had recently come across a source of cheap, very good quality heroin.  I hadn't done any dope in about 4 days, but I'd been doing coke most of the weekend.  At about 9:30 pm, we each insufflated one large line of cocaine, and one small line of heroin, about the size of our normal dose.  We proceeded outside to smoke cigarettes out on the bench in front of our dorm, as we normally do.  Heroin gives a warm, heavy, slightly itchy feeling of contentedness, while cocaine produces a jittery, euphoric, wide-awake high.  The combination is a mix of these two states...warm, drowsy, and content, yet somehow fully aware of what is going on and talkative and slightly jittery.",
      "We smoked cigarettes and walked around until the cocaine high wore off.  Still slightly wired at this point, however, the heroin mostly took over and I actually nodded out a couple of times.  We shot a few games of pool, and did one more line of cocaine to bring us back up.  We smoked more cigarettes, and M and I drank a beer to top things off.  After about an hour, my friend R offered to smoke a blunt of kb (cannabis) with us.  We proceeded to the usual spot, by now feeling more or less back to normal.",
      "After I took a few large hits from the blunt, 10 minutes later I had to sit down, suddenly overcome by the strength of the speedball.  My only guess is that the cannabis must have kicked in both the heroin and the cocaine all over again, and this time it was much stronger than it had been before.  It was about 1am by now, and I was able to make my way back to the dorm and up to my room.  I was feeling very ill and my heart was beating very quickly and erratically.  I sat for a while, unable to move but still very very fucked up.  I vomited a few times, and I felt better.  My heart continued to behave erratically, speeding along much faster than it should have.  Abruptly, it would slow down to somewhere near normal, but still not at a steady rhythmic pace.  It sped up and slowed down to its own accord for the next couple of hours.",
      "Physically, I was not in good shape.  I was pale and trembling, with a slight headache and cold, clammy hands.  Mentally, it was a beautiful feeling.  For a while I felt as if I was very close to dying, but at the same time I was consumed by beauty all around me.  I believed myself to be in a higher state of consciousness, at one with the universe or in sync with a unifying force, or something.  Interpret that however you want.  I slept through all of my classes the next day (today), and I've been rather 'out of it' and exhausted both physically and mentally.",
      "This experience is an unforgettable one, however it is very dangerous and I suggest that anyone planning to try this should know their reactions to both cocaine and heroin before combining the two.  Drinking any amount of alcohol with this combination was a very very stupid thing to do.  Luckily we only had one beer left to split, If I'd had more, I would've drank it, and I would probably be dead or hospitalized today.",
      "Note: I hadn't smoked cannabis for about a week prior to the experience, so that may have something to do with it's heavily magnifying effects on me."

      "Setting: Vacation hotel room with my partner. Evening after a good meal.",
      "Set: Very relaxed. We were both looking forward to an MDMA session together.",
      "6pm: we each dropped one tab of MDMA, and watched tv for about 20 minutes, waiting for the effects to come on. Not wanting to waste our precious vacation time tripping in front of the tube, we then decided to walk out to the beach and enjoy the coming on process with surf and gentle ocean breeze in the background.",
      "7pm: the MDMA hit, while sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean, talking, sharing, bonding. We don't do MDMA more than a few times a year, and had been looking forward to this trip and setting for many months, so every moment of it was enjoyed.",
      "8pm: back to the hotel room. cuddling lead to a randy mood, which was taken advantage of fully.",
      "9pm: we dropped another half an MDMA tablet, thereby extending the trip a bit",
      "11pm: I decided that I would experiment with a low dose of 2c-t-2: 8mg dissolved in water. My partner declined. The MDMA had begun to wear off, but we were still affected by it.",
      "12am: The 2c-t-2 effortlessly glided in with a mild increase in the waning euphoria and speedy feeling, and brighter colors.",
      "1am(ish): the visual cornucopia began! This was interesting, as I usually don't get significant visuals at the 8mg level. However, I had also never done this substance at the tail end of an MDMA experience, either. The visuals were mostly closed eyed, and I could definitively ignore them if I chose to. However, lying down, with eyes close, a whole world of fractal patterns opened up. Very very beautiful.",
      "I soon noticed that the swirling patterns were affected by whatever thought I had in my head, and for a while I played with altering the visual experience by holding certain thoughts. For example, the simple idea of triangles flooded my visual field with triangular prismatic rainbows... while the idea of turtles induced layers of interlocking primitive Polynesian turtle motifs morphing into complex anatomical imagery. I eventually got bored with these mind games, and just continued to let the experience unfold without interference on my part...",
      "Then, on cue, the experience took off into another direction. I was shown very interesting and complex imagery: Hindu gods and eyes of Horus patterns like peacock feathers swirling ad infinitum. My forehead felt like it was opening. When realized that I was thinking about the nature of this substance, 2c-t-2, a name suddenly popped into my head with insistence: Shiva. Flames and eyes everywhere. Wow!",
      "Throughout this experience, I felt together enough to tell my partner what was going on. At one point I got up to fill a glass of water, and noticed how clear and coordinated I was. The moment I would lie back down, however, the trip would resume. I very much enjoyed having the choice of taking breaks from it all, and I suspect that it was because I was on a low dose, a dose that somehow had been made more visually potent by the earlier MDMA trip.",
      "4am: still tripping, though things seemed to have calmed down a bit.",
      "5am: over a 20 minute period, I returned to baseline, and was able to fall asleep without any problems."

I decided to go to a friends house to trip on 120mg of Adderall. He was to load up on caffeine to stay awake, and observe my trip. I took them around 5:00pm.",

      "The first effects are just beginning to kick in. I feel the happiness that comes along with it. My mouth feels a little dry, but I dont notice it much.",
      "7:00",
      "The happiness increased, but still isnt anywhere near in full force. My typing speed and accuracy have both increased. My sense of time is just beginning to become slightly inaccurate.",
      "8:00",
      "I am feeling slightly tingly. Laughter doesnt come natural anymore, and I am able to suppress it now. I can feel vibrations and movements ripple through my body. I feel slightly light-headed, and I feel as if my skin is shrinking, and I am aware of my skin against my skull.",
      "8:15",
      "Im feeling wonderful. I feel like everyone loves me. Im so happy that I want to cry. I cant help but feel kindness and compassion towards everyone, even people I dont like. I have a slight pain in my back, but I think its because of the fact that Ive been moving around a lot. The pain is going away quickly. Even when it was there, it wasnt bad. It was hardly noticeable in fact. I feel more in tune with my body. My hands are slightly cold. They feel like machines. My typing accuracy is way up. I havent used the backspace key at all while typing this. I am developing a slight pressure in my head and left ear. Im not sure, but I think this may be the beginning of a small sinus headache. I dont think its drug related though. Off and on, a region of my head, at the top, in the middle, and slightly to the left, I feel a tingling alternating with a slight pain. My arms feel like one or two small needles are poking them. Oddly, the feeling is not unpleasant.",
      "8:30",
      "The general high is starting to subside. I can still feel it though. My face is tingling slightly. My right ear is starting to throb a little too. It feels about equivalent to an ear infection, only without the discharge and not NEAR as painful. In fact, pain really isnt so bad, and its easy to ignore. I still feel the occasional pressure near the sinus area. My stomach is slightly upset, but I barely notice it. I am still typing like mad, and accurately. The rippling is getting slightly more intense.",
      "9:00",
      "The intensity has subsided slightly, but the tingling is spreading. It keeps wavering as to its intensity. My hands are still cold, and while Im still typing faster and more accurately, Im not typing quite as fast.",
      "10:00",
      "My hearing is a bit muffled, and there is a slight echo effect, as I have had in the past. Its not at all unpleasant. Im also feeling a little hot. Im still feeling active, but I dont feel the urge to move my legs. Typing seems to calm me, because it releases my built up energy. My arms are starting to feel a little tired from all the typing. My cottonmouth is getting bad, but its not all that unpleasant. The tingling is coming back, this time in full force. The cycle continues: tingle, pressure, and then nothing.",
      "10:30",
      "My sight is starting to fade, and gets slightly blurry when I look at lights for a few seconds. Normally, it would only affect a part of my vision. Now, when I look at bright lights, it affects the whole of my vision. Its very odd. I dont notice it phase in and out, but somehow I know it does. Im getting the light-headedness again. Someone is playing music that, under normal circumstances, I would hate with a bloody passion. I dont mind it so much. Id like it, if I didnt know any better. Its five minutes later, and my vision is much better, but its still tinted orange-ish yellow. Im not sure if its the lighting, or just me. Im starting to lose my ability to discern normalcy from the extraordinary. It seems so natural. Normally, when Im active during the nighttime, I get a little warm. I feel that way now, only it seems natural, and almost preferable. Im beginning to feel a general good-naturedness towards everything. People who, under normal circumstances, I would fear, are now warm and friendly.",
      "11:00",
      "Im regaining my sense of humor slightly. I laughed (unforcefully) for the first time in quite a while. I havent laughed much all day, actually. Im feeling a little less hot than I was a half an hour ago. Im still feeling pretty restless, and now my typing has slowed. Due to my restlessness, I tend to have more errors. Every once in awhile, I still feel a wave of wonderful emotion flow over me. I still experience the same good-naturedness that Ive been experiencing for some time. This music is getting better and better, even though I know in my mind that its horrible. I feel as if I need to get up and jump up and down or something. My movements are starting to feel more fluid than usual. I feel groovy. Sometimes, I feel the urge to move my head from side to side, slowly, and Im moving it along with the rhythm of my typing. Ive been experiencing a few other unexplainable synchronicities as well. If I dont get up, I think Ill burst into flame!",
      "11:30",
      "When I put any significant weight on my legs, they almost act as if they are falling asleep. My typing speed is up a little, but my accuracy isnt up by much. Im having trouble typing this, because my leg is bouncing uncontrollably. This is the fist time that Ive been uncomfortable with any of the side-effects. I think that if I concentrate hard enough, I can make it stop. I may have to stop talking for a while. Apparently, it worked. I can control the shaking, but I have to concentrate very hard. Once it starts, its hard to stop. Im very sure that I can stop it from coming on in the first place. Im going to go crazy if I dont move soon. Its hard to type when Im so restless. My brain is going a mile a minute. My eyesight, which had gotten better, is now looking the way it did.",
      "Ive figured out that the orange and yellow tint is actually the natural colors of the light. It appears that I just seem to notice it more. My vision is still about the same as looking into a large area-encompassing light. For some reason, it seems to clear up when I look at things that appear to be at a distance, and oddly enough the same thing happens when I look at something thats moving. Moving things seem to pop out of the scenery ever so slightly. I seem to be doing all sorts of strange things with my hands when Im thinking about what to type. Ive developed some odd habits, such as running my fingers down the keyboard, and lightly tapping the keyboard with no intention of actually typing something. Its getting increasingly harder to refrain from bouncing my leg. I have to stop now, and stand up for awhile before this gets too out of hand.",
      "1:30",
      "A very annoying person has been pestering me for the past 2 hours. Thanks to this substance, Ive been able to tolerate it. I havent been able to type anything. Thankfully, nothing much has happened in the last two hours. Its been pretty much just more of the same.",
      "2:30",
      "The effects are really starting to take hold. I have slowed down significantly, and Im no longer shaking. In spite of this, I seem to be extremely cautious. Every time I see my shadow out of the corner of my eye, I jump, thinking that its a person. I looked at a window, and I saw a man peering in at me. I soon discovered that the voyeur was, in fact, my own reflection. Im not feeling nearly as much of the goodwill towards mankind kind of feelings, but Im not going to say that its entirely gone. Now I have shifted to paranoia. Im being extremely cautious in everything I do. Im even aware of the sound of my keyboard as I type. It seems loud, as if it could be heard throughout the whole house.",
      "The tingling has stopped for now. I have that headache that I felt coming on hours ago. Its not very bad, but its different from my normal sinus headaches. My eyes are just beginning to get sore from staring at the computer screen off and on for these past hours. My sense of time is more distorted than its ever been. Fifteen minutes have passed in what seemed like only one. At the same time, it feels like time is going by very slowly. I have no real comprehension of time. All that I know is numbers. I know that its 2:30 in the morning, but I dont feel that its 2:30 in the morning. My breathing seems to be rather choppy. Im not sure if it is, or if its an illusion. I have absolutely now way of telling now.",
      "3:30",
      "Im having many minor auditory hallucinations. I keep thinking that I see something out of the corner of my eye. I have to think really hard to remind myself that its just the drugs. Im going up and down constantly. Im beginning to become a little disassociated. Im having some major troubles thinking. My mind is thinking so fast, but never about what I want it to. Im having troubles finishing sentences. I have to use every ounce of strength that I possess to finish this. The paranoia is beginning to fade slightly. I feel a strong urge to move my head in a fluid, circular manner. I just made a remark about a triangle, so I am told. Im not sure its true. Im feeling the urge to move random body parts, but always in a circular manner. Im not even sure if its circular, but I can sense that there is some pattern to it. I have become happier than ever before. This is definitely the peak.",
      "4:00-4:30",
      "I was completely wrong about the peak. If this isnt it, I cant wait to see what happens next. I have lost all since of time. Im so happy that I want to cry. Ive just had a few visual hallucinations, along with the auditory. So far, Ive heard a dog howling in the night, Ive seen a pig walk through the door after snorting loudly from upstairs, and Ive heard sheep in the distance. I looked at myself in the mirror, and I saw my fathers face staring back at me. My muscular coordination is waxing and waning. I can direct my general movements, but it seems that I cant refine my movements. The fluidity is gone. I stop, and stare into space while my entire body tingles.",
      "I can no longer fully control it. I have given over to the power of suggestion. There is a slight burning in my throat. For some reason, I like it. I associate the basic outline of various objects and figures with numbers and letters. I am constantly trying to decipher these messages. They are trying to tell me something, but I just cant put my finger on it. The doorway just spelled hello. I cant help but think about everything. Memories are rushing back in waves. I recall the days events. How long has it been since I started this entry. I cannot tell. It could have been a year.",
      "5:00",
      "By now, all of the effects have subsided. I am completely exhausted, and I got to bed."

      "Shocks- I mean the most annoying, painful, debilitating experience ever. It would start at my head and shoot through my entire body and out of my fingers and toes. I told the Dr. about this multiple times and they (multiple different dr's) said that I was making this symptom up. This was by far the most lingering of the symptoms that I still feel  today after 3 years without it. THEY DO GET BETTER JUST GIVE IT TIME.",

I tried to quit at least 5 times. 3 of which I tried weaning and going to different drugs (Zoloft, Welbutrin, Devacote, Risperdal, Prozac, Seroquel all of which had their own little quirks but nothing like Effexor). None worked. The way that I finally quit was to just let my boss know that I wasnt coming in for a week and laid in bed screaming at the top of my lungs until I could move again.",
      "Cannabis helped me. It seemed to be the only thing that made it more subtle and bearable until my body could actually rid itself of this poison.",
      "It is now 2007 and I am completely free of all pharm. drugs. I smoke cannabis on a daily basis to help with the bipolar ups and downs. It keeps me at baseline far better than all of the other drugs that Dr.'s gave me. I still feel the shocks about twice a month. I have just gotten used to them now.",
      "Be careful everyone. I would never want anyone to go through anything like this because a Dr. thinks that it is what they need. Everyone is different, and I do believe that some of these drugs help some people.  Judge for yourself, do your research,  and stay as natural as possible. God gave us ways to heal ourselves naturally, and I know that I didnt pick Effexor from the ground."

I took 23g (nearly an ounce) of dried flowers, and mixed them in a food processor with a little bit of white wine. When it turned into a thick mush, I put it on a bottle, and poured the rest of the wine over. I let it stand for 24 hours, shaking often. After 24 hours, I strained it, and squeezed all the wine out of the flowers. I was left with a very nasty looking brownish wine.  I have read that the taste is rather bitter, but mine tastes quite good. It hardly tastes anything at all, actually. I used a white wine 'for beginners', with a very mild taste, so that might be why.",

      "Hello my name is Parsalus, Ive been a psyconaugt since my first Cannabis experiment back in 1999 when I was in 8th grade. My curiosity for Psychotropic drugs peaked when I first experimented with Dextromethorphan DXM in November of 2001 and from there on I experimented with multiple psychotropic drugs all the way up until 2007. Mescaline is one drug I will never forget about, it is one mean, tough, animal that you must be prepared for both mentally and physically.",
      "Sometime in June of 2006 I ordered 125grams of Peruvian Torch Cactus Incense which contained Mescaline and a few other alkaloids that wouldnt alter the effects in any odd way. The Peruvian Torch cactus has much less of the other alkaloids than the San Pedro cactus and a lot less than the Peyote cactus so this incense is the closes thing I could do to pure synthetic Mescaline which is impossible to find.",
      "I was working nightshift at McDonalds and my shift ended at 12:00AM at midnight. Approximately 2 hours before my shift ended at about 10:15PM I ingested 35 grams of the incense orally and washed it down with orange juice and stayed hydrated. I was planning on walking home. 12:00PM came around and I was finished work and I sat outside and waited for the effects to take hold. I noticed the first effects come on at 12:30AM two and a half hours after I ingested the substance, so yes Mescaline does take a while to go into affect.",
      "At 12:30 as I was sitting outside at a table in front of McDonaldss I felt what I could only describe a coming up on a nice clean roll of MDMA Ecstasy like a feeling of taking 3 beans. There was a bit more physical discomfort and this MDMA like high had a spiritual edge like Tryptamines. I started thinking about goodness, kindness, charity, and humility.",
      "I was having spiritual thoughts like I could be poor no money or nothing but it wouldnt matter because my spiritual contentment is so high that I know God will take care of me and I would just help others and that is better than any materialistic thing in the would because what I was feeling was real and it was pure and so many people are lost and dont know better. In the midst of these realizations I was rethinking my idea of walking home and this is what was going through my head. If I walk home Lucifer knows that I am enlightened and he will trick me by jumping into a police officers spirit body just so he can pull me over and harass me and say that Im on drugs so they can persecute me for these divine and pure thoughts I now understand. So I waited for a girl I knew to get out a 1:00AM and asked if her mom can give me a ride.",
      "This girl got out of work and started talking to me about her farther dying and how she misses him so much and I talked with her and tried to make her feel better about her situation, it was really odd because I was tripping. I was also seeing OEV of spider web and honeycomb like patterns forming on McDonalds tile ceilings. The girls mother came and we had a quite ride to my house where they dropped me off and this is when the real tripping began. I went inside and put on some Jim Morrison and the Doors just for the mood and I smoked 1 bowl of Cannabis and the Psychedelic Effects hit me and hit me hard, suddenly there was no more spiritual MDMA like high it completely did a 180 on me.",
      "My body load increased 10 fold to the point I didnt want to move and beautiful visuals just flooded everywhere multicolored patters just cascaded covering, morphing, changing shape and color. I closed my eyes and saw beautiful women doing James Bond introduction movie style scenes. I closed my eyes and saw pretty girls I worked with dressed up in wonderful sexy dresses just spinning, and turning. I also saw wondrous landscapes of lights, sounds, and colors forming in front of my with a lucidity I can only describe a liquid formation. I didnt however see any Aztec or Mayan type designs which I was expecting.",
      "During the peak of the trip at about around 3:00PM I couldnt move because my body felt poisoned by this crazy cactus poison but I felt like I was on Amphetamines and tripping at the same time. The visuals just kept on coming and coming to the point I wasnt even paying attention to them anymore and all my personal problems were being thrown in my face by the spirit of Mescaline that came to me in the form of a wild man who kept telling me Hehe, you kids found me, Im not mushrooms boy I am a whole nether animal not to be reckoned with and I am younger in spirit than all you kids, BOY!! As it revved up the high to visuals just flooding my everything. The spirit said to me or at least this conversation was going on in my psyche, you picked the wrong man to mess with. I am laying in bed fucking poisoned, and tripping balls, meth style but couldnt move having the spirit of Mescaline throwing all my issues like I have to get my license and to stop abusing opiates , ect in my fucking face, complete ego death I was noting and Mescaline was like my wise uncle slapping me into shape. I went through deep and difficult introspection.",
      "8:00AM in the morning Im coming down and I am shaken. I also see spiders that I normally kill and I would not kill them at all under the influence of this cactus. I had bad diarrhea because of the cactus incense and basically reflected upon the experience. I can honestly say Mescaline gives me a taste of spiritual bliss than rips me from it and makes me work for my spiritual bliss as in it kicks my ass, slaps me, beats me down, picks me up cleans me off and kicks my ass right out the door, thats the best I can describe it.",
      "I didnt sleep until the next night."

      "I had researched morning glory seeds extensively, and became very interested in taking them. After finding a legitimate shop to order from, i.e., a cultivator who did not treat their seeds with chemicals, I ordered about 500 seeds. I had decided to take them by myself, although someone I trusted was there to look out for me in case of a bad trip, etc.",
      "I counted out 250 seeds and ground them up with a coffee grinder. I did not know the best way to ingest them, so I placed the powder in a glass of water and tried to chug it down. Bad idea: the seed powder clumped at the bottom of the glass, despite mixing it around with a spoon. Well, I had to spoon out the watery mess and eat it like that. To be honest, it wasn't that bad, although my last two attempts have resulted in me vomiting from the taste.",
      "Having successfully gotten the seed powder down, I anxiously waited the onset of my trip. I tried not to move much, so I sat down in a chair for a while. The nausea was coming on, but I was fighting it. I decided to take a shower to take my mind off of getting sick. The nausea got stronger, but never to the point of vomiting. I ended up on the couch watching some television, and feeling quite disappointed. I had waited nearly two hours and nothing had happened. However, about 20 minutes later I started to notice it was hard to concentrate on the television. I couldn't follow what was happening very well, was it starting to work? I got up to go to the bathroom, and BAM, a shooting pain went through my right knee. It wore off by the time I got back from the toilet, and then it hit me, I was starting to get a very pleasant body high. My skin felt numb and warm, and I went outside to enjoy the sunset.",
      "The next two hours were spent listening to music, walking around, generally just contemplating and exploring my high. At 4 hours after ingestion, I started to get closed-eyes visuals: colorful, swirling geometric patters that seemed to play out the vibrations of my mind. This lasted for a solid 2 hours.",
      "I should mention here that my body temperature was very high. My sense of hot and cold were completely distorted, but my girlfriend could not stand to be hugged up against me for any longer than a minute, I have a theory about this I will explain later. In addition to this temperature distortion, I also felt like I had super-strength, like I could flip over a car by myself. There was something very primal about this part of the experience, like some hidden strength was unlocked and I felt completely connected with all life.",
      "After peaking, I still retained the body high for another 3 to 4 hours, with less intense closed-eye visuals. My attention span was definitely still hampered, as I tried to sit down and watch a movie and could not pay attention at all. Worth noting was that the film I was watching relied heavily on visual effects, and I felt like I could see right through the artificial aspects of the movie. It was like because of my sensitivity to light and the rapid pace of my thoughts, the effects were too slow to fool my brain.",
      "The night was wearing down, and I had not eaten anything at all since taking the seeds, probably 7-8 hours. I decided to eat a pear, and it was absolutely wonderful. I did not feel very hungry, even when I ate the pear, so I did not eat anything else. I decided to go to bed, which now I realize is not possible when taking psychedelics. I lay in bed for a while, and then the sickness returned with a vengeance. I got to the bathroom and hung out by the toilet for a while, but I did not vomit. The sickness was very intense, but I was able to get to sleep after about 2 hours of it.",
      "The next morning I had a sort of 'hangover,' my body ferociously hungry and having cold sweats. It seems my body was trying to relearn how to correctly feel the temperature, because I was wearing a sweatshirt and simultaneously sticking my head in the freezer, all in the heat of summer. I felt cold and hot all at once. Also, when I closed my eyes, I could still see traces of those lovely geometric patterns from the night before. After I ate some food, I felt much better, and spent the most of the day regaining soberness.",
      "Now on to the good stuff! Throughout the trip, I felt like every molecule in my body was brimming with life. Everything my body is made up of was a conscious being and positively alive. This made me feel extremely peaceful, and understand the cycle of life and death completely. I knew that when my body dies, all of these molecules, still containing energy and life, would simply transfer to a new place. One could compare it to a sense of reincarnation. In my own words at the time, 'I feel like the boundary between life and death has been eradicated.' I felt like I had died but came to realized it was the same as life. No words will ever be exact enough to replicate the feeling, but this is the best way to describe it.",
      "As to the feeling of super-strength, I will now explain my theory. I am not a subscriber to any religion, although I find truth and wisdom in all of them. In short, I believe in energy, specifically the internal energy we all possess known as chi, or qi. Having practiced martial arts for some time, I have developed--that is, learned how to focus--my chi over the years. Taking the morning glory seeds seemed to unleash my chi energy so that it was intensely focused for the whole trip, without having to do it consciously. It was at a level I have never experienced before. The increased body heat, the increased strength and numbness, were all comparable of what the focus of chi does. While some would explain it differently, this was my truth that I gained out of the whole experience. I believe the morning glory seeds show you the potential of yourself, and show you a higher consciousness and awareness of the universe. Actually living this potential is something, I believe, one can only reach when sober. I believe the seeds are a useful tool in showing you the path to get to that potential.",
      "This experience with morning glory was overwhelmingly positive, and I have since tried to take them 2 more times. I was not successful in keeping them down, however, and did not have nearly the experience I had the first time. In the future, I will try to perform an LSA extraction rather than ingest the seed powder. I have read this cuts down on the nausea, and also reduces the time it takes to feel the trip."

      "I've taken LSA+2C-E once before and it was a great trip, but this second trip was far more intense and infinitely more satisfying. Since LSA has such a long come-up, I dosed in the sequence shown below hoping to get the two peaks to coincide.",
      "T+0:00  5-HTP 200mg (oral),  LSA 210mg (~12.5 seeds) (oral)",
      "T+1:45  2C-E 20mg, LSA 90mg (~5 seeds)",
      "On my previous LSA+2C-E experience, I came to terms with the fact that I pursue psychedelic states hoping to achieve something spiritually fulfilling and not merely entertaining.  Though I've had many very revealing trips before, there has never been that great ecstatic and blissful moment of epiphany and understanding I have so longed after.  After this experience, I realized, perhaps the whole of my life experience, encompassing all sober and psychedelic states, may have been the Universe conspiring and preparing me for this particular inward journey-- a perfect moment in time.",
      "The night began around 8pm, when two very good friends arrived at the house, one of whom would be partaking in what I can only hope was a similar journey.  The other, my roommate, chose to remain sober on the occasion, but hopes to replicate a similar trip soon.",
      "As we waited for the first dose to begin to come on, we listened to music, sat around, and soaked in the last bit of sobriety we thought we would have over the next several hours.  To both of our surprise, the sober character of our minds remained minimally altered throughout our trip, only adding to the beauty and complexity of our experiences. ",
      "Up to the point that we took our second dosing (T+1:45), we had both failed to experience the visuals normally associated with these types of psychoactives, however, we were both in agreement that we were experiencing a strong, but not super natural, euphoria and an intense freedom of both thought and experience.  Communication among all three of us was surprisingly fluid, uninterrupted, and uninhibited.  We were also struck with those general feelings of beauty, and were basking in the intense awe that only Life inspires.",
      "Within 20 minutes of our second dosing, we noticed a very intense and speedy climb to the plateau we would soon enjoy for several hours.  The words I've found most worthy to describe this climatic plateau of my life is Spiritual Ecstasy.  I don't consider myself an overly spiritual guy, but I can think of no other words to fit the infinite ecstasy that followed.",
      "We had just gotten back from a short walk around the block where we had smoked several cigarettes while enjoying the fresh air, if you'll forgive such an obvious paradox.  While we were out in cold, my sober friend had apparently also been conspiring with the Universe to make the Perfect musical selection for our return.  We came back into the warmth to be greeted by the sonic vibrations of 'Souvlaki Space Station' by Slowdrive.  (An album and song that I now must insist you buy, borrow, or steal.)",
      "Nearly as soon as I had taken off my coat, scarf, and hat, I found my self writhing on the carpeted floor as wave after wave of ecstatic joy, love, and human experience washed over me.  With eyes open or closed, I saw the tapestries of human experience and emotion unfurl and expand over every element of my consciousness, every ugly and beautiful thing, and every perfect thing in between.  All internal resistance had been dissolved, my mind had become a superconductor, a master conduit, to all of  existence.  If I have ever lived an enlightened moment, this was surely it.",
      "This state continued for several hours before beginning to wane.  I was at a moment concerned to lose this moment of continuous beauty and perfection, but soon realized that the knowledge and memory of  it's existence alone would persist for a life time. ",
      "It is possible that this experience was unique to this  moment in space and time, but even so, I will remain forever grateful to have at once quelled the currents of life, peered across the great blue divide, and seen even a glimpse of the golden shore that one can only hope awaits us all."

      "Background:",
      "I'm sixteen years old, female, about 120lb, and hadn't had much prior experience with psychedelics. Prior to this experience I had tripped on shrooms once a few months ago, however the alleged half eighth was quite obviously shorted. Ive also tripped on salvia a few times and used to smoke a lot of weed (I dont as much anymore since that mushroom trip).",
      "My friends and I ordered the 4-HO-MiPT over the internet and it came in on a Monday. I had been planning to wait until the weekend to try it with a group of friends but ended up doing it by myself Wednesday night right after work, not preparing at all like I had planned to. Even though I knew I wasnt in an ideal state of mind to trip (Id had a bad day at work and some conflict with a friend), I wasnt worried about having a bad trip because when I tripped on mushrooms it was a positive experience and from what Id read this was a very similar chemical. Also my friends had all tripped on this the day before and liked it a lot. I took somewhere between 8 and 12 mg (there was some uncertainty because the scale I used wasnt very accurate) dissolved in a bottle of water. My stomach was still pretty full from a huge meal I ate about five hours before dosing. My intention for this trip was to get a new perspective on certain areas of my life and to try to get unstuck from a sort of dull mindset Id been in recently.",
      "9:30pm: I drank the bottle of water quickly over the course of about five minutes. I was alone in my room the whole time. After about twenty minutes I started to feel a little anxious and cold and I was shivering. I got in bed to warm up and listened to a hypnosis cd to relax. I started to relax and to see beautiful, intricate patterns when I closed my eyes.",
      "10:00pm: After about thirty minutes I was definitely tripping and I felt like I had on mushrooms. The trip was building in waves, coming on strong for a few moments and then letting up so I would forget I was tripping. It quickly got much more intense than it had been on mushrooms. At this point I wrote: Right now all systems are void. When I reach for them I find nothing. My soul is exposed. There is no limit to what I now can teach you. And then a wave would hit where the trip was so strong I physically couldnt write. When it came down again I wrote: Now I see what happened last time. Everything happens too fast to write down. Now I am just writing. Its hard to simultaneously write on the paper about how well you know the paper wI cant think anymore. I will write when I am back.",
      "Time seemed to be incredibly drawn out. I would look at the time, an eternity would go by, then I would look at it again to see that it hadnt changed. It felt like my heart was beating fast, but when I took my pulse it was only 75. I tried to take my pulse again later but it felt like my hand was melting into my neck and I couldnt distinguish my pulse from the air pulsating around me, so I dont know what it actually was. Nothing serious, I wasnt that worried about it. But it was definitely not a good idea to trip alone, especially since Id never done this before. The whole time I really wished I had someone to talk to about everything I was thinking.",
      "A lot of the insights I had about my life had to do with the way I relate to other people. I realized that I get too caught up in my own thoughts, and that reality lies in the collective human consciousness. To realize that and not have someone there to connect to was really frustrating. I wrote a note to one of my friends explaining what I was going through because it related to a conversation wed had that day. That was some relief to know that I would give her the note the next day and my message would  get across, but it was no substitute for face-to-face communication.",
      "For the first part of the trip I was listening to my ipod on shuffle, but I realized that songs with lyrics were too much for me to handle, so I put on Bach. That was a good choice--Orchestral Suite #3 in D and some other soothing orchestral pieces. The music I was listening to was pretty much what determined my emotional state throughout the trip, so switching to classical music was a major upgrade. Words freaked me out, silence was too silent, but classical was perfect.",
      "1:30am: I started to come down now, and for the next two hours I did a lot of writing and reflecting. I still had lots of sensory distortion and couldnt go to sleep yet, but my mind felt very clear. This was the best part of the trip. I was relieved to feel like I was back in my body again and felt very at peace with everything Id learned from the experience. This lasted about an hour and a half, and I fell asleep a little after 3am.",
      "Overall Id say this was a beneficial experience even though it wasnt fun the whole time. I went back and forth a lot between euphoria, fear, and intense self-analysis the whole time. This is a drug that should be treated with caution and respect, definitely not a party drug, for me anyways. Based on this experience I would highly recommend preparing mentally beforehand and being in a comfortable setting with a friend and some soft, relaxing music. Its quite a journey."

They could not find the culprit of my problems. I was having panic attacks due to post-traumatic stress disorder. I was given heavy doses of Zoloft, the Paxil, then Effexor, until I was saved by Xanax.",

I am happier than I ever was on any other drug. The feeling of warmth and happiness is a hard one to grasp in this world of evil. I have found the one light in this darkness to see through the veil. How could I ever leave this?",
      "I only can speak highly of alprazolam, but I must stress that it must be taken wisely and ALONE to appreciate what it really does, and not mixed with alcohol, or any others drugs. I have watched many people have bad reactions to these combinations. People who say they have lost memory or felt like time was stolen from them, usually are combiners who drink alcohol or mix another drug with alprazolam. I actually feel smarter and more aware of my surroundings when isolating the drug by itself.",

      "Recently, upon stumbling into the 'Ask Erowid' section, I found a question that had greatly concerned me last June up until recently.  Does LSD and/or MDMA affect an unborn fetus?",
      "I suppose this could be listed under experiences or generally anywhere the question is concerned.",
      "In my conclusion, LSD and MDMA has not harmed my son in any way.  Here is the story/description of what we discovered.",
      "We live in a mid sized city with just about nothing to do other than get drunk or experiment with friends....clubs are boring here and raves are horrible.  My no fiance and I had rolled together for our first time the first weekend of February 2000 at a house party.  We decided we wanted to the next weekend, but just the 2 of us together.  That night turned into the first night we slept together and the start of that type of relationship.  About a month later, we decided to do it again....just for the hell of it.  Time goes on.....a week or so later, more X.  It comes to the end of the month and I am informed that she has not had her period for the end of March.  We were concerned thinking she might be pregnant and halted all drug activity.  We waited 2 weeks and bought 2 different pregnancy tests....both came out negative.  We were relieved.  We go about our old ways again rolling now every weekend in April.  the way we consumed it though, 5 apiece throughout the course of the night.  2 to start, 1 hour or so later....snorted 1...and based 1 in a bong or joint etc....Come mid april, we come across some acid.  We have a night of just tripping....along with the following night.  The next weekend, we decided to candyflip.",
      "Over the next week, I decided I was going to get set up as a dealer since we could get good cid in large quantities. I started with 10 100 hit viles per week.  I always kept 1 for my personal use and sold out the remaining 9 in vile or on candy.  Every weekend for the next 6 weeks, we were doing anywhere for 10-75 hits each.  I would make 50 sweet tarts and take a fresh vile with me when we would trip.  We would start out just squeezing sweet breath into our mouths and leave hardly anything in the bottom of the tube.....as normal nights would progress, we would eat sweet-tart after sweet tart until there were only 5-10 left in the baggy....on many nights.....we would eat our usual 5 hits of x each.....and on almost every night of the activities, a quarter ounce would be reduced to a nickel.",
      "What turned us after a while:",
      "We went on a vacation to Orlando....fun for about 5 days.  On the last night there, we decided to go to Epcot while we rolled and tripped.  We at about 10 sweet tarts each and started with the usual 2 rolls each....after firework and laser shows died down, we headed back to the room to smoke and finish the rolls. We crushed up 2 of them, snorted half of one each.  We decided to go ahead and eat the other half.  Old girl was afraid though...she started to say she had not been feeling well, but decided to push on anyway.  She 'BC-powdered' the remaining half.  Immediately upon swallowing it, she vomited profusely. we had never, ever vomited on a roll or cid before.  this was our first sign of concern.",
      "On our drive back home, we didn't talk much about what happened the night before.  By the time we got back to our town...we were ready to rest.  We talked later in the evening and revealed that we were scared that she might actually be pregnant now....both of us in disbelief, but there wasn't much to it....we had the same rolls the week before....they were awesome.",
      "We tested the following saturday night. The results were positive on 2 tests.",
      "What more can we say....you think for the worst.",
      "We went to see a doctor specializing in high risk pregnancies.  The first ultrasound was done.  We had a boy....he was 13 weeks and 4 days old....active....healthy....and right on track.",
      "We decided against abortion despite all the risks.  the months that ensued were wonderful.  the due date, December 8, 2000.",
      "The night of November 26, 2000...labor begins....2 weeks early.  We had not done any recreational drug together since the first ill fated night.",
      "Labor ensued for what seemed like weeks.  Finally, at 2:30pm on November 27, 2000....we had our son, as healthy as could be.",
      "Now, he is 4 months old and 1 week....today on april 3, 2001.  He is developing at an above normal rate.  He has no health problems of any kind and he is the happiest baby we have ever seen....he can be crying for hunger, but as soon as he sees your face or hears your voice, he stops and smiles.",
      "I am NOT saying it is ok to do these activities during any stage of pregnancy.  I am merely putting out a story telling all that our son was 100% healthy.  PLEASE, don't abort any baby just because you may have rolled a couple times during the first trimester or tripped a time or two in the first few weeks.  We probably had 70 hits of X and over 300 hits of cid in a few month period and we have a perfectly normal, if not above normal, healthy beautiful son.  Also, neither of us are mentally insane from that much acid.  Neither of us have experienced a flashback either.",
      "We have rolled 3 or 4 times now that the pregnancy is over and I have tripped once.  We are much more conservative now and can appreciate life to the fullest.",

      "I've always wanted to try shrooms, so when the opportunity came up, I had to jump on it. I live in an area where it's pretty hard to get shrooms- they only come around every few months. So I bought a bunch and got together with my girlfriend and two friends. We were at my house, so the location was comfortable. I read that this was very important. I also read that a good positive attitude was important. So we all did our best to stay happy the few days before d-day.",
      "D-day came. We measured out around 1.5g for each of us. I wish I had used a better scale, because I think that I might have gotten more (like 2-2.5.)",
      "After smoking a few bowls to chill out and get the munchies, we were ready to shroom!",
      "We put them on a peanut butter sandwich with honey and chowed down. The honey was a big help. I was told that they taste and smell like shit, but this was from a person who hated NORMAL fungi. They were so dry that they didn't really smell like anything, let alone taste bad. All I knew was that the pot wanted me to eat the yummy honey and peanut butter sandwich.",
      "I've read a lot of bad things about these types of drugs, and plenty of stories (on this site even) about people going nuts from one trip. So needless to say I was DAMN nervous, despite my positive mood.",
      "It only took 20 minutes for me to start feeling it. The drapes started to flow. I pointed this out to my companions, and they just laughed. I started describing everything that was happening, and they told me to be quiet.",
      "(Note: most of this is but a very vague memory. I have trouble remembering dreams, and most of this felt like a dream.)",
      "For whatever reason, tears started to come out. Just as I was starting to peak, my friends felt their onset.",
      "I got pretty upset and my girlfriend led me to my room. I lay on the bed and started salivating on myself. I couldn't even talk -- all that would come out is moans. I remember simply wanting it all to go away.",
      "It was like each and every part of my brain was thinking in overdrive. Every aspect of life was being processed at once. I thought of myself as millions of atoms. I looked up at my clock and couldn't understand the concept of counting. Nothing made sense.. it was horrible. I called my girlfriend in and she lay down with me. She turned the lights out.",
      "Big fucking mistake. My brain was going 1000mph and demanded things to process. So what happened when we took away all the cool shit to look at?",
      "All kinds of crazy thoughts. GF summed it up when after 20 minutes she sat up and said 'I think I just went to another dimension.'",
      "After that everything was fine. We joined my friend and concluded that 'you make your own reality. we should be celebrating!'",
      "Life couldn't have been better- we all were in some sort of europhoric happy-ville. Things looked neat. I remember looking at some art book and loving it, but that's about it. The rest of what I remember is very small fragments -- My dog looking like a painting, the TV being in 3d, the walls flowing and breathing. Lots of cool visuals!",
      "But that's about it. I don't even remember having sex. :(",
      "I think the first half of my trip was bad because I was the first one in. Nobody there had ever done it before, so they really didn't know what to say to me when I was freaking out. The peak was REALLY overwhelming..information overload. I had definitely lost all control to the trip and sat in the back of the bus. 6 hours went by after my peak and I only remember maybe a collective minute of it.",
      "We DID smoke some more, though. I do remember that. I forget a lot when I'm stoned, so I'm betting that's what did it. (That's something to consider when thinking about having a first trip. I definitely recommend NOT doing any other drugs.)"

      "Though this may sound like a rediculous and iresponsible combination of substances, it was over a period of 12 hours and at a student party with friends and strangers and I have regretted it since.",
      "18:00 - Arrived at the house and rolled a (moderately sized) joint to be smoke communally between my friends and I.",
      "The high feeling that comes from this set in shortly after/during and I was still able to legibly converse with my companions.  My mood was elevated.",
      "19:00(ish) - Another Joint.",
      "The high feeling that had been had sunken into the distance and we decided to have a topup.",
      "The evening went on with one or two more, and I began drinking at around 21:00 as the music was on and people were arriving.",
      "22:00 - I began feeling very lethargic and decided that a few lines of coke would pick me up, and it did seem to counteract the down pull of the cannabis.",
      "I finished the bottle of cider and continued drinking as the night went on, and aquired a bag of base (speed? was what he refered to it as) from somone we knew.  I couldnt really taste it but remember the feeling of dabbing and swallowing it being very close to that of a very fine dust, like chalk.",
      "1:00(ish) - I could feel a very big buzz from the base and alcohol, and decided it was time to drop the first of my two pills to wake me up a bit.  I felt the familiar rush from the drug and it was disorienting but pleasant, empathising with the fast electronic music at the party and feeling a need to dance.",
      "7:00(ish) - The music was still on but the party was coming to an end, I had consumed the second of my pills at some point but there are big blank patches in my memory.  Music still felt like it was everything to me, and talking to people took on a very meaningful tone though I am not sure i could really understand alot of what was going on around me.  Sleep was the furthest thing from my mind, dispite the time.",
      "8:30 - we had aided in the evacuation of most attendees of the party and i noted having trouble with keeping still and the alcohol had mostly worn off, leaving no noticable residue of after-effects yet.  As the sun was up i noticed my vision wasnt right, i couldnt make out lighting properly as everything seemed to be too vibrant and with a darker colour than normal.  Around this time we relaxed to talk about the night and had a few more joints.  I Halucinated mildly, seeing patterns and movement (pulsating?) textures on my skin and peoples faces but i was comfortable with it and i laughed about it with people.",
      "I couldnt sleep dispite how physically tired i began feeling, the overexertion from the pills being more pronounced in my legs than anywhere else.  The lapses in my memory were making me paranoid and worried about my actions in that intoxicated state, and even after I had slept I was very irritable with a very strong comedown that lasted around two days.  My appetite had completely gone and i didnt eat the following day.",
      "Overall i had a good experience but the come down was so incredibly soul destroying I will not be doing it again, though it did give me time to think of how much damage i could be doing to myself (and more specifically, my mind) and i haven't felt the need to touch the latter three substances since.",
      "For those looking for substances to aid the party atmosphere or to highten awareness, I hope you have found this useful though I would not reccomend mixing drugs unless you really know what you are taking and have good company to watch over you.  Individually, I have found these substances to be very effective and pleasant around large groups of people and music, making the social experience very rewarding."

      "On snorting the full 160mg of K last night I got the biggest head rush of my life. With every pound of my heart I could feel blood rushing through the vessels and reaching every part of my body. My chest began to buzz, my blood seemed warm and seemed to transfer the buzz to my fingers, toes and nose.",
      "The first thing that happened was everything became pixelated, my friends faces became much more like those old computer games where the characters are made of squares. Our voices seemed to be coming out of each other we breathed in unit and spoke over each other and didn't say the same things but completely responded to each other. I felt like I was melting into the floor and this moment and my heart began to feel like it was compressing. Swallowing became such a chore, my breathing caused my heart to beat faster and I could feel every alveoli in my lungs filling with air. I thought I was going to die but my hallucinations were too strong to react to this thought. My body melted onto the floor and I tried lifting up my right hand but found that my skin had melted onto the floor and looked like stringy cheese attached to the floor.",
      "My mind felt like it was left on the blanket and everything went black, the walls of the room were no longer there, it was just me, and my 2 friends lying on a blanket in the middle of darkness. I felt then that I was falling onto my body from above slowly floating down in a circular pattern. When I landed on my body I began to shiver and my jaw wouldnt stop shaking, I seemed to shiver to the beat of the traditional Japanese music we were listening to. We had a weird dialogue were my friend said I am Mark and me and my other friend repeated the exact same thing in the exact same tone and voice but carried the --rk in Mark on for what seemed like hours. I began to feel like I was falling and was getting quite distressed, one of my friends took my hand, which seemed to stop the sensation.",
      "I whole body started to shiver and I began to feel cold. Colours were flashing around me. By this time me and my friends where comprised of just our heads, there were no noticeable body shapes. The eyes were the most striking feature of the face, they looked completely 2D i.e. both on the same side of the face. They were outlined in thick black lines and every blink seemed to change the actual colour of their eyes. The coldness began to take over and I felt like I was getting wet, I straightened my head to look up, even though my head felt like it weighed a ton and a massive wave of water washed us away. I could feel the movement caused by the wave I felt like I was moving away from where we were before it hit us. Next thing I remember we were lying on grainy gold sand and as I turned my head towards my friends they started to take on a more 2D shape and began to look like those hieroglyphs you often see in books.",
      "My friend got up and went to sit on the couch, I was not aware of the couch existing until my friend sat on it and made it light up. I began to ask where I was, my voice pounded in my head, and my mouth would move and speak the words but the time between the 2 seemed so distant. My body didn't feel like it was mine, I had to fight with it to do everything, swallowing would cause me to grab my throat and massage it to make the spit go down. I felt like I was trying to swallow my tongue. I now began to feel warm and comfortable, I kept saying come with me on a journey through time and space which is a line from one of my fave tv programs. I began to see stars and felt like I was floating in space. I invited my friends to come with me to the sun.",
      "I floated, not aware of whether my friends were there or not, towards a bright white light. As I got closer it took on more of a circular shape and the warmth was growing. I began to feel uncomfortable with the heat and began to float away saying to my friends now come with me to Jupiter. I remember passing the Earth on my trip and suddenly felt like as I moved away from the earth towards Jupiter I left tiny particles behind so by the time I reached Jupiter all that was left was my thoughts, I didnt look like me I was just a collection of thoughts.",
      "I don't really remember much after that the next thing I know Im reciting equations in a really monotone voice and the room begins to take more shape. I become aware of the music and can see notes flying from my computer to the ceiling and making the ceiling bounce like the skin of a drum. I am now aware of the lamp shade and can carry out a simple conversation in a monotone voice. My speech seemed slurred but what I was saying seemed to make sense.",
      "The ceiling kept changing shapes. My head still seemed like it was separated from my body and I tried standing up to go to toilet. Walking felt so incredibly strange I couldn't understand how I was causing my legs to move. On the come down I felt like I didn't have control over my body and felt really tired. I lay down on my side and woke up this morning feeling completely normal until I had my first spliff.",
      "I would definitely do this again. I remember feeling so scared at times because I wasnt sure what was going to happen and how long for. The whole trip lasted about 3 hours and was completely surreal. Having done it once I think I would not be so scared the next time as Id know more what to expect. The visual hallucinations seemed to occur in separate stages i.e blocky, then 2D, then out of body etc. After each hallucinatory experience I expected to come down and when I didn't I began to panic a bit but that soon disappeared and I was left calm to enjoy the experience."

      "I've been curious about herbs for the past several weeks after reading about Salvia. I ordered a bunch of different things online, including Blue or Sacred Lotus, that is, Nelumbo nucifera and NOT Blue Lily i.e. Nymphaea Caerulea, the two of which seem to get mixed up by almost every online vendor I visited.",
      "First I tried smoking Blue Lotus - I smoked about 2 grams in a water pipe and didn't feel anything that I could really distinguish from baseline. Did the same in blends with Dagga flowers and Salvia. I kept it hot and held it in for 15 to 20 seconds - nothing. So I'll wait for my extract resin to arrive and try smoking that instead to figure if I can get a buzz from Nuciferin.",
      "On another day I discovered something that I thought was remarkable. I placed a few crumbs and stems of cannabis below a small bowl full of Blue Lotus (~ 1/2 gram). The Cannabis was what a friend had left behind after rolling a joint the night before - It was the kind of thing I'd just brush into the trash. It was nothing. Maybe three small (3-4 mm) stem pieces and a few measly specks. Not even fit for a rasta mouse. I smoked the combo and felt HIGH. It was a slightly different high - I was being silly, and I experienced a heightened visual sensation and a slowing of time. There was also no paranoia.",
      "All of this is remarkable because I usually have a day's worth of pretty well established tolerance to cannabis after smoking a lot of it the night before. So it seemed to me the Lotus had some synergy with the Cannabis (given that I had smoked about as much pot as I could fit under my thumbnail), which was fortunate. Now I just need to get my hands on some more Cannabis.  ",
      "That day I placed 5 grams of dried Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera - don't forget) in a small bottle together with 2 oz of 190 proof Everclear and heated it in a pot of boiling water on the stove top for five minutes. I then let the herbal extraction sit for a full 24 hours. When shaken the extract had a milky look to it. When I let it settle I could see globules of insoluble extracted material floating around in the alcohol (like oil in water, but not exactly). I took this to mean that it was a good, strong extraction. I mixed 1 oz of this with a small glass of orange juice and drank it down a few minutes before a friend came to pick me up for a poker game. I had already eaten so my stomach was full.",
      "Within 20 minutes a feeling of calm washed over me. I remember sitting in the passenger seat very loosely, and everything seemed kind of quiet, like driving around downtown at 4 AM - the surroundings are associated with activity and general 'noise', but there is an eerie calm because no-one's around. We weren't driving downtown but that's the feeling I got - no bother from external stimulus. This is despite the fact that my notoriously longwinded friend was STILL talking. That didn't bother me either. I felt good and had a strong suspicion that it was the Lotus extract (and not the Everclear as I drank it on a full stomach).",
      "The other thing I noticed was that I 'was on'. When we arrived at the poker game we meet a large group of card players (co-workers) I didn't feel as aloof as usual. I felt good about the impression I was making. In a genuine sense - I was relaxed enough to start a conversation with anyone, or cajole the entire group and managed to hold my own. I know now, this was a result of having my mood lifted, which I attribute to the Lotus.",
      "The Lotus didn't do anything for my poker game though. I would have to say that the noticeable effects of drinking the herbal extract lasted about 90 minutes. Then I concentrated on not losing so badly.",
      "Of course I could be dead wrong - maybe the reason I felt high when I smoked Blue Lotus with weed is because I smoked it with weed, and maybe the reason I felt good after drinking an Everclear extraction was because I drank Everclear. Still, I thought I'd provide my experiences here and let you judge for yourselves. Seems there wasn't much reported on Nelumbo nucifera."

      "It didn't take long for me to find my bed. I could feel something coming on but concurrently I was relaxed and wanted to lay down. I feel asleep very shortly and awoke. I was enjoying my environment a little better and thats when I started looking at the glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. They began moving distaces of a few feet or so, moving in all directions. As hour 1 was approaching I didn't know what to expect since some of the things I saw were pretty intense for this short amount of time. Another half hour passed and I took to the outdoors. It was a cool breezy night with fast, dark moving clouds that caught my attention. I felt completely at peace with everything around me. I observed beauty in everything I saw and felt exhilerated by having the wind blow through my soul. I knew I belonged in this beauty as an intrical part of the surrounding environment. I danced with the wind, although I as a rule of thumb don't dance. I am not particularily religious but I felt God speaking to me telling me that everything was alright. I was the pupil in this mental conversation as God showed me the beauty in everything and how that was for me and everybody to experience. I wept at this beauty that now surrounded me. I wished everybody could remove themselves from the meaningless stress that they endure and join me in seeing what life was really like.",
      "As the 4th hour encroached I put a headset on. I played Hendrix and could feel electric energy shoot through my entire body on every note. The wind complemented the music, adding it's own value to this mind-blowing experience. Soon I wasn't sure if the wind was influencing the music, or the music comanding the wind...it was all so interconnected and it all moved through my body. I felt love, and grasped everything at a higher plane than I'd ever perceived on any other psychadelic experience. Even when dealing with things like death that may be scarey on acid, now it was a part of life that was beautiful in its own respect. I stayed outside all night, watching the natural splendor that surrouded me. Everything contained beauty and so watching things was to observe and feel the beauty of these objects for the first time.",
      "LSD and DXM both come to a peak when I use them but here it came in waves all night long. For a half hour I would experience intense hallucination and then 45 minutes later I would feel it again. This experience lasted 18+ hours.",
      "I did look like I was on some heavy drugs while doing this and it appeared that even the most naive person could pick up on what I was doing if I were out in public.",
      "My experience that evening has had a profound impact on me. I have retained great insight on what is really important in life and try to live my life in accordance with this. I don't think I'll ever forget what happened that evening."

      "I write this to inform you that the socalled 'elves' described by numerous DMT trippers can also play tricks on you.",
      "I'd used DMT, which I extracted myself, several times before, with varying degrees of success but all generally positive. This was my first negative experience.",
      "My girlfriend had just left and was due to return in an hour or so, I told her that i'd be doing some DMT while she was gone.",
      "So I sat on my bed, arranged some cushions and packed the pipe up. I decided that this time i'd smoke up without any music - to see if I could hear any alien music, (Im a musician, and thought that this might be valuable).",
      "As I smoked, the experience felt different. I knew it wasn't going to be too good as I smoked it up. Instead of a colorful, kalidoscopic interplay of happy elves, what I got can only be described as a self-folding freaky forest of infinity...",
      "I could see alien trees and canopy, gnarled and ominous (though i'd hesitate to say evil) and certainly freaky, but not terror inducing. Scary. unsettling.",
      "The forest folded itself over and over, in several dimensions I can't possibly describe. all the while I could hear the elves communicating to me 'were the happy little elves... happy... happy... HAPPY little elves!!!'",
      "I got the impression that they loved me, as usual, but were communicating to me that DMT wasn't a toy to be played with as I pleased. It was a useful tool, and should only be done with plenty of time to spare and a prepared setting.",
      "Later that night, we went out and had some red wine with friends, which was enjoyable. I told them about my negative elf experience, which ulthough frightening, had left me with a more accurate outlook on the DMT experience. It is a learning mechanism, not a toy...",
      "Much later that night, after the red wine, I woke up in my bed to see a wall lamp (with a sumbraero that i'd put on it) transfigured, It looked as a hideous corpse head with putrid white skin stretched over its boney face. I vomited a little in my mouth. And then, Snap. no vomit. I tried to roll left or right in an effort to make the hideous face go away... It stared at me unblinking. horrible. And then, after what felt like an age, the face was gone. I looked around for the vomit, there was none.",
      "Very odd. I rolled over and went to sleep.",
      "Later again that night, I heard the front door open. My flatmate must have returned. Then, at my bedroom door there was a knock. It was my flatmate, he poked his head in, and came into the room. 'its too late, its really late' I slurred, sleepy and still slightly drunk. 'I just need this for work' he said, proceeding to take something from my desk.",
      "In the morning, I woke up, and wondered what he had taken. I went to the toilet and found his room empty. He must have left, I thought. Later that night, he returned. I questioned him on the late night disturbance, to which he replied that he hadn't returned home yet. 'very weird' I said to him...",
      "There was also nothing valuable in the area of my desk that he apparently took something from."

      "The Year 1999 was the year of my very first 'astro-plane' LSD experience. I became what many call an 'adventurer of the unknown', a 'cliff-rider', 'ledge-walker'. I had experienced perception-shifted inducers before, in small doses, but not to this extent with LSD. Mushrooms, sure, but not with LSD.",
      "I knew this girl, who was already graduated, had a kid, but also had a nasty habit with needles. This nasty habit was so strong that it consumed her life. One night she informed me that she had received some interested LSD with pyramids on it. I, as I had been fascinated with perception shifting 'alterations' for a few years now, was enthralled to aquire these from her. When I asked what it would cost, she said 'Just come out with me tonight on this run, and you can have it for free'. Well, how was I to turn that down? A visceral, mystical experience that would be 'given' to me for a little bit of my time?",
      "Well, needless to say, where she took me was a stomach-turning affair. Lets just say that needle-fiends, or even worse, needle-fiends that peddle their wares don't make for a fun companion, even if it was for only a few hours. It was at about midnight when she finally dropped me off at home. I was very disgusted with her, but kept it to myself, after all I could relate with her (her being a human being and me understanding the lure that freedom, ease of pain and thirst for ultimate knowledge). In my pocket, four hits of LSD wrapped in tin foil. I eagerly raced to my basement bedroom and unwrapped the foil. Four, cleanly cut squares lay before me, each revealing either a full or partial dark blue/black pyramid that bore an eye in the center. Intrigued, I prepared myself for a long journey. Closing my door, getting comfortable and dimming the lights, I put on some ambient music and dosed.",
      "Amazing LSD, that is not in droplet form, takes a while to begin. At least in me it does. Of course, the initial muscle weirdness and odd taste begins almost instantly, mostly from the anticipation I believe. I laid in bed and stared up at my popcorn-like ceiling. I had four candles lit, two on the left side of my room, and two on the right side. I had Aphex Twin's 'Ambient' playing softly in the background. At this point, I would like to mention that I still lived with my parents. I was in high school after all. One of the odd things about living at home and having a deep interest in perception-altering things, is that I never knew when my parents might come to check up on me, which is what my father did.",
      "It had been about one hour since I dosed, I was starting to feel the initial effects, when my father opened my door. He wanted to see how I was, he wanted to talk. So we talked. He had no idea what was about to transpire in my bedroom. During our friendly little chat, I could feel a welling deep inside me, pulsating and dancing to the music I had playing in the background. I was staring at the ceiling as I was talking to my father, and I started to notice the odd fractal and flower petal patterns that I always see on LSD. It was beginning. My stomach got the usual 'empty' feeling I get when the experience kicks off. Its like there is a hole in me, a huge one. But not in a bad way. Maybe it was the feeling of becoming very light, of becoming light itself. This is where I faked being tired so that I could be alone. I knew that in a few minutes, I would not even be able to look into my fathers eyes, I would be in another world.",
      "My room was only lit by candlelight, and my body felt like it was racing faster than sound. The fractal patterns and flower petal shapes spilled onto my breathing walls and my swirling carpet, swaying and slithering around like snakes. I loved this part of the experience. I giggled with glee.  The candles flames danced and created the most wonderful, yet frightful shapes all over my room. I grew antsy and could not lie down any longer, I had to pace around. As I got out of my bed, I felt like I immersed myself in water, in a huge ocean. It was very thick, yet smooth. I could feel pressure on my chest, like waves crashing onto me, and my arms and legs had much difficulty moving around. My whole body tingled and pulsated. I started swaying and sort of dancing in a trance to the ambient music, which turned into shapes inside me. I must have danced like that for a long time, yet only a half an hour had passed.",
      "I then decided that I wanted the dark. I blew out the candles, which spilt wax all over the place, and basked in the oddly smelling candle smoke that seemed to fill the darkness. The stereo lights were the only source of illumination, and with it I could see the smoke, as if it was plastic, heavily moving through the air. Once I was immersed in the darkness, I was thrust into another world. A world almost like my bedroom, but vastly different. I got the urge to speak, and I spoke. But every time I said something, it echoed repeatedly, over and over again, like a cycle. I remember feeling that this was very interesting. I must have spoken every word I could muster, just so I could hear it cycle around my room. It was in this precise moment, that I realized that words have power. They are tangible and really heavy things. I watched as my words bounced off of my breathing walls. My words were never harsh, so they bounced lightly and floated through the air.",
      "At this time, the epiphanies and out-of-this-world Deja-vus began. Those realizations of the world, everything in it and my life. My choices, what I needed to do, what I needed to accomplish. Feelings, my feelings, alien feelings surged through me. Visions rattled in front of me. I lost my body and became no-thing, maybe a source of dark light. I floated around my room, which became a grid-like cube. I watched as everything in our known rational world, and everything outside of our rational world was placed somewhere on this grid. I could see it all. I danced around the planets and stars, played with every animal I had ever seen, and bathed in an endless ocean of energy that envigorated me.",
      "The next thing I remember was that I was in/on my bed. I couldn't tell because my body was gone still. Something caught my attention, the grid-like world dissolved and I saw a mirror. My bedroom mirror. In its reflection, I could see this teddy bear that a girl had given me, it danced around and spoke to itself. It even made angry, almost menacing faces/gestures at me. I got scared, which made me laugh to myself, and I stuck my tongue out at it and made raspberry sounds. Then, I got this sudden urge to push my face up against my mirror. I wanted to touch this mirror, smell it, pass through it. In its reflection I could see what looked like my bedroom, but it was somehow different. I wanted so badly to stick my arm inside the mirror, but I was taken aback by an image that began to materialize. I saw towering sky scrapers, those found in big cities, toppling, crumbling and being destroyed. I could literally see this right before me, in the mirror. I remember feeling that the world was ending. That humanity was to pay for our disgressions and our harm to all living things that we feel are 'inferior'. 'This was it' I felt. It turned around and behind me more building were crumbling, as if massive giants brought to their knees.",
      "I saw flying beings swooping down from the blackened sky, doing things I could not see, or things that were so far beyond that I had never seen them before. These were not angels, but dragon-lizard like beings. They looked at me and told me, without words, that they were ancient and far older than anything humans had ever known of. They were not dinosaurs or anything like that. I asked them where they were from, not in words, yet they would not tell me. I sensed that they were deeply linked to Earth somehow. They were not like the dragons from story books, more ancient, and more 'real'. Terrifying. I thought they wanted to hurt me and I felt massive fear. It was then that my body came back. I felt it weigh me down and slump me onto my bed. The fear welled up so great that I cowered on my bed.",
      "I noticed then that the music had changed, I could hear clanging industrial music playing, that of a Nine Inch Nails remix song. I saw the world ending to the beat of this song. Buildings turned to rubble, massive holes punched into the cities, people dying everywhere. Massive pits of dead bodies and skeletons.",
      "I could not remember what had happened after that, but my bedroom was back, and I did not feel the fear anymore. I way laying on my stomach, staring at the darkness. The images were still in my head, and I really wanted to know who those lizard-dragon type beings were and what relation they had to earth. Yet, everything dissolved and I was on a new train of feelings. I had discovered my physical body again and began exploring the sensation of my body. I rolled and squirmed around on the carpet, and played with my hands, my hair. I watched the wonderful fractal patterns dance around my room, and in my eyelids.",
      "I could tell that the LSD was taking its course. The peaks were done, all that was left was the coming down.",
      "And this is the part that I dread the most, especially with LSD that is 'dirty'. Don't get me wrong, this was great LSD, but in terms of purity, it felt like the 'bottom barrel' left-overs. Strycnine heaven! My body ached, like it had been turned inside out and back in again. My head reeled from twisting visions and flower petal designs that over took my room. This is when I glanced at my alarm clock, which I had forgotten existed (I forgot about time itself), and noticed that I would have to go to school in about 4 hours! I panicked, but then realized that I would come down before then.",
      "The last hours of my experience were of a calm and resting nature. Pretty soon I was tired, worn out, like I had experienced too much in one night. Its a usual feeling after an intense trip. Like I have traversed many worlds in the span of a moment. When the sun was shining and it was about 7am, I got ready for school and tried to eat some cereal. I stared into my bowl, watching the milk and thinking about what I had seen on my journey. I felt like I knew a forbidden secret (a feeling that is most prevalent during my perception-shifting experiences), some hidden knowledge or wisdom that the rest of the world did not. Thats when I realized that those who take perception shifters are walking the path of the shaman. It is the shamans task to explore the unknown, learn the vast secrets of the universe and bring them back to our dimension.",
      "This turned out to be my very first 'intense' LSD experience, but it would not be the most intense, or my last."

      "I just wanted to share my usage with the Herb Kratom with other users and people that are interested with the Mitragyna speciosa tree.  To date of this writing I have used Kratom approx. 200 times within the last year, and daily for the last 4 months.   ",
      "I got cancer (hodgkins) in the fall of 2003 and with chemotherapy it went away nicely and still today (2007) there has been no reoccurrence.  Unfortunately the chemo has left my body to a lot of aching and bone and muscle pain.  Also I work outside daily and walk approx. 6 miles a day so this doesnt add to my pain.",
      "Anyhow back to Kratom.  I first used it about 1 year ago to find out what its effects are due to curiosity.  Now one year later I am thanking Kratom deeply.  When one is using Kratom they are what I call 'Kratomized' lol.",
      "I make a tea out of Kratom grinding 6 grams of leaf and adding a splash of concentrated lemon juice and eight ounces of water.  I boil down to 4 ounces, strain, and drink the liquid.  Its amazing how something taken orally can create affects so quickly in the body hence within 10 minutes I feel 'all' body pain to disperse.  Kratom also has a slightly 'mood elevating' properties though I can continue to go about daily chores without any problems, ie. driving.  Lastly the third property I use Kratom for is its stimulating effects.  I used cocaine a few times when I was in my early 20s and the speedy feelings along with the mood elevating effects are very similar to using a small amount of cocaine minus the racing heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. ",
      "Also there is no 'crash' with Kratom.  Its effects last for approx. 6 hours and only very gradually diminish.  I usually drink my tea in the morning before work and its properties really help me work harder, smarter, and get my work done faster.  I also have to have a lot of bloodwork done at the Dr. office regularly.  Never have I had elevated liver or kidney levels with brings me to believe that Kratom 'doesnt' wreak havoc on the liver or kidneys (since being consumed orally I would most worry about these organs being hurt or damaged).  Ived heard that people who smoke opium or use a high dose of pharm. opiates develop a 'itch'.  I sometimes, not much anymore, get this itch from Kratom use mostly on my chest.  Actually I enjoy it and its most pleasing to have for me oddly enough. ",
      "The only downside is that sometimes Kratom can cause a slight upset stomach.  I make sure to eat a good amount (my breakfast) after Kratom ingesting and this helps %90 percent of the time.",
      "I know from reading online forums a lot of people say Kratom is addicting and no better than a Vicodin addiction.  Id have to disagree as Kratom leaves me with no withdrawals physically and as far as mentally anything that helps pain, makes me feel slightly better mentally, and gives me plenty of energy. ",
      "There are things in life, and I feel Kratom is one of them that are a sort of 'Eden' and can be used often and have continuing positive results.  My body has never developed a tolerance to Kratom ( I use 6 grams daily).  I do find though that abstaining from Kratom and then using it makes the herb work slightly better."

      "To anyone who likes to take pharms for their highs...Seroquel is not for them, lol, it'll knock them on their ass, that is, unless they like the drowsy, lightheaded-until-you-pass-out, antipsychotic that it is.",
      "Anyways, I used to have lots of problems...I was a serial monogamist, err, meaning I hooked up a lot and then dumped them shortly after getting what I wanted, which was pretty much only sex. Man I was so smooth too, lol. My parents owned a few businesses so I had plenty of cash to spend, so I could pretty much get whoever I wanted. I remember being called an 'asshole,' I guess that pretty much described me at the time.",
      "After talking to a psychiatrist about some depression I was going through she Dx'd me with a personality disorder plus major depression and we started going through all kinds of drugs trying to find the right one. After a few months we started on Seroquel, first at a low dose like the manufacturer and USP says to, and then going up to around 250-350mg a day with about 1/3 of it taken during the day and 2/3 of it at night. This drug absolutely saved my life, with all the self destructive behavior I was going through and the endless abyss of depression I had, I'd be dead by now, if not for the drug.",
      "Yeah it did kinda fuck with my head the first few weeks, but after a few months it wore off -- I took it it all the time -- and you felt pretty damned good...not in a manic way, but a good way, kinda like I was Jesus Jones...except I condemn religion in my apartment lol. But yeah, anyone out there who is really depressed like I was/am, might want to talk to their doctor about getting on Seroquel, plus an anti-depressant for good measure like effexor or duloxetene.",
      "Anyways right now, I haven't hooked up in six months or more because well really I don't feel the need to go and use someone just for a night and then ruin their feelings like I used to love doing. Plus I'm comfortable about myself enough to start taking over my families business. I'd call myself a success on Seroquel.",
      "Oh, big plus: At least for me, it seems Seroquel gives a big plus to my sex life... makes it, uh, more fun, heh. Anyways, for me.",

      " I was in my room (which was in the basement of my house) by myself listening to some Manson. I heard you could catch a 'buzz' off of inhalers. I smoked pot once and tried wall hits before but never had a powerful drug experience. I attached my arrow chamber (a tube that connects to inhaler to ensure you get all the medicine) to my inhaler and took 10-15 sprays. I then grabbed my neck with my hands to cut off the circulation and past out in front of my waterbed. I did this 2 more times, and when I woke up after passing out the 3rd time, I remember thinking, 'This isnt so bad.' I looked in the mirror on my waterbed and saw white dots fly horizontally across vision. I laughed a few times then everything seemed to go wrong.",
      " I had a huge rush fly through my body, and heart rate picked up rapidly. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were extremely red. This led me to think I was some sort of devil. I stood up quickly and my vision became very distorted and choppy. My vision became so choppy, it seemed I had a frame rate of 1 frame per 5 seconds. The next thing I remember, I was standing on the other side my waterbed freaking out. I kept leaving my body over and over. It felt like I was being ripped out of my body and thrown back in every second, but the seconds felt like a lifetime. I could here the Manson song in the background, a very repetitive song that kept chanting, 'No salvation, hah hah, no forgiveness.' Those were the only words said for several minutes, and it made me feel like my life was a broken record for eternity.",
      "Finally I stopped leaving my body and began to panic and run around my room trying to cry, but I couldnt seem to shed a tear. My nose and lungs felt like they were freezing, and I was breathing very hard but wasnt getting much oxygen. I ran to my CD player and turned it off. The music being gone felt like a relief somewhat but I was still very horrified. I sat back in my blow up chair. I could feel my heart beat very hard and it felt like I was rocking back and forth.",
      "This truly was the worst experience I have ever had. Everything I looked at would move in a circular rotation, like it was floating, even 4-5 months after the experience. Stairs I walked up would jump around left to right. I had flashbacks several times a week at first, which gradually decreased to none 1 1/2 years later. I also had severe depression and phobias such as agoraphobia and paranoia. I thought people were poisoning me and putting acid in my food. This paranoia lasted 3 years, and so did the panic attacks I had every day!!! I definitely do not recommend doing inhalants, they ruined my high school years and maybe some future years to come."

      "I was able to obtain a chuspa, 140g of dried leaves and a small ball of llipta from Peru for a relatively low price. ",
      "On the night of my initial test, I had been suffering flu-like symptoms including respiratory difficulty and an upset stomach. I had read how the coca leaf can be beneficial with both symptoms. ",
      "I made a quid of around 15-20 medium sized leaves and smeared about 1/4' round ball of llipta inside it and placed it in my cheek.  It took a minute for the leaves to rehydrate from my saliva before I slowly started chewing.  I would chew a few times then let it sit in my cheek for a minute or two until my mouth was full of an astringent and numbing saliva.  I continued this process for about an hour, swallowing a little of the juices but harboring most in my mouth and cheeks.  I've read reports that say both to swallow and not to - but I believe that swallowing some of the juices helped strengthen the effect.",
      "After the hour the leaves were mostly pulverized and I finally spit them out.  The effect that had been generated was a rather noticeable energy w/ an underlying twinge of paranoia.  For the greater part I was at ease and alert.   I did notice that it was considerably easier to breath and that my stomach was feeling better.  The effect gradually faded over the course of an hour after chewing them.",
      "The experience was not that of drugs, but of a medicinal herbal nature.  Coca leaves make an excellent and nutritious alternative to coffee whether chewed or drank in tea.  They can aid in minor illnesses such as upset stomach and work as a bronchial dilator.  I have added coca leaves to my outdoor supplies as I spend a lot of time in the mountains over 9,000ft.  They will come in handy for hiking - allowing me to breathe better in high altitude/stressful situations and to ease or prevent altitude sickness."

      "Last night was my second time trying Salvia Divinorum and I was not trying to get as high as my first time trying it, but was trying it out for medicinal use since I have had a cold lately, so I loaded up a small bowl into my 14 inch bong and cleared the bowl in 1 hit, held the hit approximately 15 seconds then coughed it out since its harder for me to hold it in while sick, this produced a ringing noise in my ears and tingling sensation in my back, after about 3 minutes I loaded another (larger) bowl into the bong and cleared it in 1 hit as well, this time I was able to count to 30 and exhale, upon exhaling the typical trip started to set in, and I had mild visuals and the gravitational effects.",
      "After about 5 minutes these subsided and I just had a euphoric feeling and realized that my nose was no longer clogged, I no longer had a headache and I did not feel like I had a fever, I actually felt quite well, better than I usually do on normal days. After about 35-40 minutes the cold symptoms gradually came back however so this does not seem like a practical remedy for symptoms unless you take it just before bed so that you can fall asleep in peace. I am contemplating mixing Salvia Divinorum with tobacco and rolling it in a cigarette for possible symptom relief without hallucinogenic results when I am at work."

      "I am not a user of these substances.  However, my partner of one year is (was) an ex-junkie.  He had been clean for the last fourteen months.  I use the term 'had' because, unfortunately, he 'used' again and it resulted in his death from an overdose, which caused a fatal brain aneurysm.  I did not know about these substances until I came to this Erowid Web Site.  I am now much more informed than ever before and can recognize many of the symptoms described by other 'users' and their experiences.  I am not telling this story to condone or dissuade anyone from living their own lives in any manner in which they choose.  I just want to share this as an example (warning) of what is possible. ",
      "My darling partner, unbeknownst to me, had earlier in the morning injected himself with approx. 50cc of Meth, (this info was verified by a friend who had been involved). Later that evening, we journeyed out of town to visit some of his friends.  I am assuming that he 'connected' while gone to the grocery store for cigarettes and when he returned, we left to go out to grab a bite to eat. While awaiting the arrival of our meal, my darling and one of his friends went into the restroom and 'fixed' approx. 30cc of Heroin. I do not know how much of this mixture was water and how much of it was Heroin...I only know that a second syringe was found containing 30cc of mixture later in his boot while we were at the ER.",
      "About 5 minutes after returning to our table in the restaurant, my honey looked at me, winked one eye, smiled and then proceeded to 'nod' out over the table.  I was panic stricken and when I raised his head up off of the table, I noticed that his lips were blue!!  I immediately wanted to call 911, but his friend refused to do so or allow me to do so.  I, in the meantime, was busy blowing breathe into my sweetheart's mouth with all of my strength, trying to get him to start breathing in a regular pattern.  I had felt for a heartbeat, and thank God he had a strong one at that point in time.  His friend then dragged my darling out into the car that we had arrived in and his friend began to vomit all over the place. ",
      "At that point, I knew something was definitely not right and begged my friends to PLEASE call an ambulance or someone.  They again refused and I know that it was because illegal drugs had been involved and they were all afraid.  For several miles while driving down the highway, I continued to check my partner's breathing and heartbeat patterns for signs of change.  We had traveled perhaps 10 miles when I noticed that his breathing had ceased and his heartbeat was very weak and erratic.  I screamed for his friends to STOP the car and that was it - I was going to call 911 whether they liked it or not!!  I kicked open the back door of the car and pulled my sweetheart out into the parking lot of a gas station (which was not an easy thing to do considering I weigh only 120lbs) and proceeded to strip off his shirt and boots so that I could begin CPR more properly. ",
      "On and off during the procedure, my partner kept vomiting and so I kept having to stop the CPR to roll him over onto his side so that the did not aspirate any of the vomitus.  It was an agonizing time while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance - I kept alternating between screaming out to God to save him and trying desperately to perform CPR correctly.  By the time they did arrive, my darling was not breathing on his own and his lips and hands were turning the most frightening color of pale blue! The trip to the hospital was sheer agony for me, knowing that things were not going very well at all in the back of that ambulance. ",
      "By the time we arrived at the ER, my darling was still not breathing on his own (btw - the paramedics had administered two doses of Narcan to reverse the 'OD' of the Heroin - always be honest with the medical personnel at this point - it could save a loved one's life) and it did not look like he was going to make it out of that ER alive!  45 minutes after arriving at the ER, the doctor had the unfortunate task of informing me that my loved one had in fact suffered a fatal brain aneurysm from the drug overdose and was too damaged to undergo any kind of corrective surgery.  In addition, after a CAT scan and MRI were performed, I was told that there was no brain activity left at all.  My darling sweetheart was transferred to a CCU bed and kept on life-support and medications throughout the night.  It was the worst experience of my life!  He had no other bodily functions except for a heartbeat.  His brain began to swell as a result of the aneurysm and body fluids began to leak out from every orifice.  It was a losing battle to keep the fluids wiped/suctioned up from his precious body. ",
      "By ten o'clock the next morning, we knew that it was time to make a decision.  One that will haunt me for the rest of my life - the love of my life, my soul mate, essentially was gone from me...only a weak heartbeat remained. The ventilators and tubes were all removed from him and I was allowed to hold him in my arms until his heart stopped beating.  I continued to hold him until his body grew cold and his face and hands turned stiff and dusky blue.  We had only begun a new life together and now he was gone, forever!!  All of our plans and dreams were gone without warning - I didn't even get a chance to tell him goodbye or that I loved him because he never regained consciousness after he first 'nodded' out at the restaurant.  It has only been two weeks since my soul mate departed this world and this is the first time I have told this story to anyone. ",
      "All I can say is PLEASE be careful if you are 'using' and think of those persons around you who love and care for you.  My darling lost his battle with addiction in the most horrible of ways...and I am left alone in the darkness without my shining light!!"

      "Hello, I am writing about an herb I discovered at a local headshop.  I have read about another herb called 'blue lotus', and I was very interested in trying it out.  To this day, as I write this, I have yet to try blue lotus, and I wanted to try a legal herb to take my mind off of marijuana and such.",
      "I can say I am quite experienced in the pot-smoking business, and am no stranger to the 'high', so when I smoke I am very responsible and still quite intelligent whereas my friends... well they were friends, just couldn't function as people normally under it.",
      "So I'd like to get to the point.  So I went to my local headshop with my dad (I'm under 18, and my dad is very cool with my potsmoking, but still sort-of discourages it) but they did not have any blue lotus there.  However, he still emerged with a bag of 'buddha's blend'.  So he bought an ounce (28 grams) for only $5.95.  Not bad!  And it came with 33 rolling papers as well.  So my dad rolls up a big beautiful joint (he was a HEAVY smoker in the 70's, and I've never seen such a marvelous joint before!) and we smoke it.  Well, the hits were quite rough.  The high did not hit me until 5-10 minutes after.  Very strange and slow onset for smoke, but when it finally hit me colors appeared... different.  Colors were not brighter or beautiful or awe-inspiring, but they were... different.  Hard to explain.  It was also, without any shadow of a doubt, a subtle body high.  I was very giggly and couldn't seem to sit still.",
      "As I say though, the high was very subtle.  But my dad kept claiming that he was 'totally fucked up'.  I found this rather strange, for I was not nearly 'tripping' as hard as he was.  It wasn't like a weed-high for him, but high enough for him to be 'fucked up'.  So I had my best friend, Allie, come over and we experimented with this herb.  We are both experienced pot-smokers.  So we loaded a large bowl in a 'water-pipe' and we ripped away.  The hits were incredibly harsh.  At first, according to her, she felt a subtle high as well, but like me her high came down in less than 30 minutes.  We reached the conclusion that if you were a pot smoker, we had an astounding tolerance to 'buddha's blend'.",
      "Another thing I'd like to point out was that I could only catch the BUZZ once a day, lasting 30-40 minutes, but no matter how much I smoked I couldn't seem to ever catch a buzz again until the next day.  The color effects and a very distinct lack of coordination strengthened with every bowl and joint- but only to a degree.  I felt pretty annoyed by this, having a 'pre-tolerance' to this stuff.  The buzz tolerance is shortlived, but builds up like a motherfucker.  I had gone through five bowls and three joints with Allie (about 10 grams) and just could not get a high.",
      "Overall, I think this is some pretty strange stuff.  It's relaxing, and for six bucks an ounce I can't say it's a substitution for Marijuana but if I am waiting on a prick-of-a-dealer, this herb will definetly help me occupy my time.  I still look forward to trying Blue Lotus, and I hear its not super or anything, that it just 'mellows you out' (according to my brother), but mellowing is just fine by me.  Afterall, I smoke weed to mellow out :)"

      "Firstly, I'd like to go over a few things about myself. I find myself as an intelligent, strong minded individual. I have been experimenting with acid recently, and love the way that I use my mind while i am on it. Up to this point, I have never had a bad experience with drugs, save getting a little paranoid after smoking. This experience was my first bad one, and I feel that it's worth it for you guys to know.",
      "This is my tale of DOB and cocaine.",
      "I had just gotten off of work. My friends had apparently gotten a hold of some AWESOME ACID. We found out 2 days later that it was actually DOB. I dropped the 2 hits of DOB and got prepared for the ride of my life.",
      "We hung out for a while, watched a skate video called 'Yeah Right!', which was actually pretty decent, and smoked a little maryjane. I only took a couple of hits, not even really enough to get a buzz. For the next few hours I kinda just walked around my backyard, waiting for the normal perception and headchange that I was used to from acid.",
      "2 1/2 to 3 hours after injesting the DOB I started to feel the effects. I had a slight euphoric feeling and everything became much more vibrant and colorful than it normally was. People seemed distant, their eyes wide and paranoid. A friend of mine, who had happened onto some free cocaine, gave me a gram and told me to have a nice night. I took 2 semi-large lines off of the top of an old television and rubbed some around the inside of my mouth.",
      "At this point I could hardly feel myself at all. I felt that I was living through my eyes only and that I was actually watching myself exist rather than existing.",
      "One of my friends began to panic about some girl that he felt very strongly for and disappeared without saying a word. Myself being a kindhearted person got very worried about him and began looking everywhere for him. I found him sitting on top of an AC unit at my neighbor's house, and talked to him for a few minutes about his problem.",
      "After talking, we went into my house and sat in the dark in a large room in the back of my house. I fell to my knees and began to pray. I felt that I had done something wrong that needed repentance, and started to freak out just a little bit. As I stared into my couch, I began to see staircases scrolling downward in the back of my couch. The entire room was lit up with a glowing blue light, even though the lights had been off for quite a long time. I began to get very paranoid, feeling that I had ruined my life and that, up to this point, I had been lying to myself about many things.",
      "I grabbed a sketchpad and began to draw. My hand was shaking violently, and I heard multiple voices in my head. As I would think, these voices would contradict me, and then each other. I tried to silence the voices and clear my mind, but there was no stopping them. I was almost positive that I had gone completely insane, and really began to freak out.",
      "I noticed at this point that my friend who was worried about his girl had left, and went outside to find him. I felt nothing in my body. My perception was strewed, and everything felt as if it were not real. My entire plane of vision tilted from left to right as I walked. I looked up at the sky and searched for some answer, but could find none.",
      "I walked back into the back, hoping that maybe my friend had gone there. Unfortunately he had not. I was really freaking out by this time, and no one could really understand that. It was at this point I realized that this couldn't have been acid. I saw patterns and visual swirls, but didn't feel a headchange or the other normal things that I feel on an acid trip.",
      "For the next 6 or 7 hours I freaked out, eventually winding up drawing again on my couch. My mom awoke and told me that I could go to sleep in her room, seeing as I had work at 5pm that day [it was around 9 or 10am at this point.] As I laid there, all I could think about was my life and the kind of person that I had become. I started crying, which I don't do very often, and could not stop. for the next 6 hours I cried, rehashing what was important to me, what I wanted to do with my life, and what I needed to be truly happy.",
      "I went and talked to my mother, who sent me into another tyrade of tears. After talking to her for a few hours, I had to go to work. I had gotten this job one day before this experience and hadn't been to sleep since the last time I had been in. Every color stood out, every direction was strewed. I couldn't think straight, but somehow I managed my way through the night.",
      "When I arrived back home after work, I felt no urge to sleep, and almost felt that I would never be able to sleep again. After an hour or two of laying down watching my friend play WoW, I drifted off into a peaceful sleep. When I awoke the next day, everything was back to normal.",
      "All I can really say about this experience is that it changed my life. After being completely insane for 2 days, it was nice to wake up from it unharmed."

      "For such a nasty, cheap street drug, heroin has held a glamour about itself, or maybe in my own mind.  My favorite singer Janis Joplin died on the stuff.  Maybe because I so idolized her, thats why I developed the rock star mentality concerning illicit substances.  Of course, I always connected Heroin with needles, so if anyone asked me to try, I was quite prudish in my decision to say no.  Very condescending, having no respect for anyone playing with this AIDS drug.  I was the D.A.R.E poster child when it came to this.  That would all change one night though.  For a drug I connected to viral and staph infections, later I would soon be begging to molest my senses.  Never in a month of decades would I have ever thought Id exchange this set of values, just to know what Joplin experienced in the last few hours of her life.  ",
      "At the time, I was a dabbler.  I had only smoked weed and snorted Cocaine.  I was green broke at best, but heroin is in a class by itself.  I heard one Junkie say, You have to need heroin.  And hes probably right.  In my experience, boys love The boy.  And this morphine bastard has a greater appeal to the opposite sex.  Being a girl, I naturally loved Coke, and stimulants.  But the picture heroin users portrayed at the house I was at the first night I tried heroin made me abandon my preconceived notions about this drug.",
      "Unlike cokeheads, there was no impatient twitching, apparent paranoia and suspicion.  I always felt uncomfortable doing cocaine with people I didnt know.  But at the heroin house, it looked like everyone had the greatest beer of their life.  So much so, I didnt think they were on anything except some really dank weed.  By all accounts, thats what I thought it was.  I inquired quite excitedly, Can I smoke some of that shit?  One Junkie, a girl and her crooked dope dealing boyfriend looked at each other lazily, in that weepy-eyed junkie nod and let out a small mutual laugh.  I was quite embarrassed, feeling condescended by the two experienced users.  I was not in the know.  I was even offended.  God, I didnt need their weed, fine.",
      "I saw my new boyfriend disappear with my fifty bucks into the bathroom.  He said we were going half in on a gram of powder.  Except Id soon find out he was cashing it all in on a few stamp bags of heroin.  Were not together today if youre curious.  Being ignorant, not understanding the junkie/bathroom connection, I was baffled when I saw the dealer escort him in and the doors close.  I didnt move as suddenly I was getting a little smart about the whole thing.  My concern was apparently showing as I stared at the black door, hearing feet shuffling around and almost mute conversation.  It looked like lazy gay sex to me, though the dealers girlfriend didnt see anything out of the ordinary.  I was frozen, and I started to remember those lifetime original movies about drug-users and their clans.  Dear God!  I didnt want to walk in and have my fears validated by the reality taking place.  I was in a junkie house!",
      "Another Junkie I had met a week prior, around the time I had met my new love, cued me in.  Hes not getting powder you know, hes robbing you!  The girl junkie and the boy junkie did that same mutual laugh.  Glad they found it funny, I didnt.  I could have cared less whose house I was in at that point.  Let them shoot me, I was pissed.  From the other side of the door, I was screaming.  You effin Junkie, Ill kill you.  The two junkies floppin on the couch could care less, finding it amusing.  The crooked dealer came out.  Its ok girl, youll get yours.  Here comes the DARE poster child, ready and poised as I was.  Oh no, I dont mess with needles.  Screw that shit!  Giving me little attention, he brought out a bag of China White, which is I guess, snort-able heroin.  You can snort this shit, you know, he said.  Oh!  Suddenly my temper was hampered by the prospects of experimenting with what had killed my favorite singer.  I had always wanted to know what this Rock Star murder weapon was like, and I had a desire to feel as good as them.",
      "Now, I should have took my friends advice, Never let a dope head cut your dope.  But in the excitement of dousing my senses with this guarded, mystical drug, I wasnt thinking about anything else, except my handy-dandy coke straw.  I switched on to a new mood like a young kid with a few dollars to spare at a Toy Store.  Yeah!  I want to try!  Cut me some of that stuff.  I was smart enough to let him know that I had never done this stuff, and my drug use to date was sporadic.  I didnt have enough tolerance to hold two beers, let alone heroin.  And either this guy was so doped he didnt know how big that line was, or he was just a smart ass.  Later I learned the latter was true.  He liked cutting huge lines for new users in the spirit of fun.  Its a wonder nobody died on his account.  In the back of my mind, I thought the line was pretty big.  But what the hell did I know about heroin.  It looked like dirty snow to me.  It had a brownish color, and the crystals, which didnt look much like crystals, seemed bigger.  Not like the fish-scale fine powdered coke I was typically getting.  It looked like a line of sand from a beach.  I shuffled around for my coke straw, while he rolled up that fifty dollar bill my boyfriend had given him moments before.  Cool!  I was itching to try. Pardon my pun, you know what I mean if youve ever tried this stuff. ",
      "Well, I snorted the line.  The effects were slow.  I sat down on the couch, impatient.  Whens it going to hit? I kept asking.  Like cocaine, I got the drip in the back of my throat what seemed like fifteen minutes afterwards.  It wasnt like the cocaine drip where it has the metallic taste, kind of bloody almost.  It was weird, like a dude shot a load off in my mouth.  It was warm like, though I cant really describe it by words, and my memories a bit fuzzy.  I didnt like it though, and that I do remember.  I kept swallowing back, like my tongue was trying to wash away the drip. ",
      "Then that heavy feeling washed over me.  Thats how I describe it, heavy.  But its pleasant.  I felt weighed down like.  Time hits a stand-still.  Every thing that mattered, my anger, my fear, my impatience, kind of just disappeared.  There was an overwhelming sense of peace and tranquility.  I felt in tune with the whole room, and on the same playing field as every junkie there.  It felt like they were all my best friends, as if I had known them all my life.  I was surprised to note that the high lasted hours.  Though it doesnt seem all that long when I start to sober up.  It probably had more to do with my zero tolerance and that gargantuan line that ass of a dealer cut.  Though I have no regrets. ",
      "For a while, I was nodding off, and insulting my boyfriend.  Im done with you, I said in a pleasant proclamation of freedom.  Thats nice, he replied, both of us on the nod.  To an outsider, they might have thought we were exchanging vows for all they knew.  Even if I was angry, everything seemed OK.  This is a cure-all for people full of piss and vinegar.  I liked this stuff, or so I thought. ",
      "Then I started to get sick.  At first I thought I wasnt going to blow chunks, but a knot was balling up in my stomach.  I felt like my intestines were swimming.  I had chili before I came.  I was trying to unlock the door to the house which had what seemed to be about four locks.  I called the dealer over.  Im going to vomit all over your place if you dont open this up.  He complied.",
      "Out in the yard, I was making a mess.  My stomach was emptying itself violently.  The dealer made me go inside to the bathroom to throw, and I wasnt going to argue.  There were floaties in the toilet, because for some reasons, junkies toilets never work.  The plumbings always backed up or some shit. Maybe they throw needles in there, I dont know.  So I was just vomiting bile into the sink, cleaning up the chunky stuff with toilet paper and throwing that into the trash.  With all the vomiting, I was starting to sober up.  Still high, and weighty, but not as high.  I swear if I weighed fifteen pounds less, Id have died.  Lucky I was 145 or so at the time.  It was going on three hours, and I was still too high to drive.  My then boyfriend, drove us home.  I was nervous.  I thought he was as high as I was, which wasnt the case since he had the tolerance of an opiate fiend.  I couldnt go home, so I crashed at his place forgetting that I had given him the shaft hours before.  I couldnt sleep even though I felt tired and weak.  He gave me a breath mint, and I vomited that up.  One tiny mint swimming in a puddle of vile.  I thought it was funny for some reason.",
      "Then the high started to leave me.  I dont know if it was power of suggestion, but he started itching himself crazily.  And I started helping him out, itching his back and beard.  Then I started getting itchy all over.  My legs, my belly, everything.  And hed itch me, Id itch him.  And we threw the covers off the bed because they were itchy.  Then I was real hot, sweating like a pig.  I knew heroin had withdrawals, but I never thought they were so apparent for a first time user.  The palms of my hands were itchy, beads of sweat rolling down my body, and my armpits.  Then I got cold, then hot, throwing the covers on and off.  That whole night, we would both wake up and go back to sleep, fighting over covers or itching ourselves.  We were loud too, so the people above us probably thought we were doing something kinky, though he, nor I, had any desire to have sex.  Even though I noticed he was really hard down there, neither of us initiated the act.  It was all heroin at that point. ",
      "The morning after, I drove home.  I felt washed out.  So I slept for sixteen hours.  He had the audacity to call me back, though I never returned the calls.  For some reason, probably due to the withdrawals, I had no desire to pursue heroin, especially not with him.  On the plus side, heroin has a lasting effect, a much longer high, mostly for those with low tolerance.  I wouldnt consider it fun, but like hard narcotics, its a feel good drug.  Theres a certain quality a bout it though you cant get from speed.  Its that opiate quality of course, and I liked the high.  Weighed against the withdrawals, which mine probably pale in comparison to hard-core junkies, I just didnt feel like trying it again.  I played around with the idea of managing it.  Due to the long-lasting effects, its incredibly cheap.  A twenty dollar line kept me high for a couple of hours.  Twenty bucks worth of coke couldnt keep me high for fifteen minutes.  Thats where heroin seems worthwhile in the face of disease and social taboos.  Im even apt to say I like the heroin crowd better than the coke tweak-geek coke crowd.  But I never stayed long enough in both groups to draw comparison and make notes.  I suppose one isnt better than the other.",
      "After trying heroin, I realize coke is pure robbery in the sense of longevity.  Then again, its like comparing apples to oranges.  Two totally different highs, and I like speed. Due to addiction and withdrawal, I cant champion it by my own experience since I dont possibly understand the whole Heroin paradigm that exists with adaptation and tolerance.  But I can see where level-headed individuals learn to balance the drug within their own life, like a pop of aspirin for a nasty headache.  I do have in some way, respect for the drug that I cant shake because I liked the peace, calm and the sedation of all my fears and anger, that coke only exasperated.  It calmed a beast within me, and I cant say coke ever did that."

      "I have had several encounters with HBWR, usually amounting to a pleasant, albeit subtle, LSD-like activation. The dosage for these experiences varies, but most often was between 15-30 seeds. I figure that those batches were pretty weak. This particular batch of seeds, however was claimed to be 'super-potent.' They were still covered with the brown fuzz, which I did my best to scrape off while trying to keep my eyes from crossing. What a pain in the rear it was, but I tried to make a meditation out of it. Next I washed them off with hot water and started to chew them very thoroughly. Eleven seeds were finished within ten minutes and washed down with a glass of water.",
      "I had eaten chicken earlier. That was a mistake, I decided as I was sweating back waves of nausea. I was certainly intoxicated. I was feeling pretty sedated lying on the cool bathroom floor, wanting to nap. But then I had to bust a gut, the pressure suddenly rising in my stomach. My mind grew chaotic, bizarre thoughts forming and unforming in a haze of nausea, where am I? Blargh. Blargh. Whew. A little more blarghing. Brown froth punctuated by bits o' chicken filled the toilet. I can see the little masticated seed husks floating in the toilet. But man do I feel on the other side of the coin! I am energized at this point. I feel as if everything has a positive blue tinge overlaying it (even the brown puke is covered by the glow). MJ smoked at this point completely wipes away lingering nausea, and boosted me to a +++. Tracers a' plenty, breathing walls, swirling eddies of psychedelic geometry.",
      "I hid in the basement and played guitar, watching the sun set through a tiny, shoe box sized window. It reminded me of a diorama. A tiny world view. I leave the spider webs in there, even though spiders freak me out. I am feeling too much empathy to squash anything right now. I have never really experienced anything I would call synesthaesia, but I swore that the sunlight falling across my face was dictating the melody I was noodling with on the guitar. I felt like a rock god, Queztoguitahro. I rode this wave length for about 7 hours, playing guitar and drums, until I was back to baseline. Drank some GBL, 4 ml mixed in juice for sleep. No hangover next day. I feel somewhat lighter, with less of a burden on my mind. Puking usually flushes out my spirit...blargh."

      "I do have ADHD, but I was diagnosed at such a late age that my parents thought that getting me any kind of medication was pointless and a waste of money because I had lived with it for so many years. I take no medications at all. I have tried everything from salvia to meth, but I prefer psychedelics over anything. Two years ago, I started high school in a very demanding prep school (I no longer go there). At that time I was a very strong athlete and had no experience or knowledge of drugs (boy has that changed). After having continuing trouble with the work load a friend, who was also having trouble, brought me some blue pills and gave them to me, and hence I discovered adderall. After taking the drug in pill form for a while, I discovered that it was much more effective to insufflate the crushed beads inside the pill. Since then I have taken the drug at least 40 times.",
      "So I was sitting around in my room with a corner bag of 40mg adderall burning a hole in my pocket so I decided to go ahead and get wired for a couple hours. I had also purchased several weeks earlier a bottle of caffeine pills because I was experimenting with diphenhydramine and kept falling asleep after about 2 hours, and with an onset of one hour that wasnt enough trip time for me. So I took one of the pills which was 200mg of caffeine and crushed and cut it evenly into the adderall. I had previously crushed and chopped the adderall but to make sure everything was nice and tiny, I mushed and crushed the pile with my Zippo several times and then began to chop everything very carefully with a new razor blade for about 10min.",
      "Through experience I have learned that it pays to make sure that everything is cut very fine. Adderall is especially hard to crush because it is many little beads. I find that by using a small Petri dish to contain the beads, because they tend to jump when you crush them, and using a beer bottle with a top on it works very well. You can also place them in a zip lock and use anything with a rounded end to mush them. Trust me, it sucks sucking something up your nose that still has a uniform shape. But in case you do I find that by putting a very small drop of water on the end of my finger and sucking it in relieves some of the pain.",
      "I had a small pile which I began to cut into roughly 3inch lines about a centimeter wide. There were 16 lines. I snorted about half of the yellow, orange'ish mixture (the orange being the adderall the caffeine was yellow). I only took half because I wanted more for later in the night. It was 11:30 on the dot.",
      "T+20min - Not really being tired before taking the mixture (Im gonna call it speed for short, BUT it is a mixture) I started noticing everything was much more intense and vivid but not in the way a psychedelic would amplify color and shape, it was more like everything became sharper and clearer. The effects started picking up about 3 min after the first line. I sometimes describe Amphetamine and speed in general as having a sneaky onset. It was not at all an 'in your face' pickup. The effects were very suttle. I couldnt sit still at all and I felt like I had to do something so I turned on my Xbox.  I was drawn into the racing game I was playing to the point where I was turning my entire body with the turn of the car. My heart rate sitting is about 65(Bpm) (beats per minute) and after checking it I was at 97(Bpm).",
      "T+1hour - I became enraged and frustrated after losing to the game and after having several cursing bouts with my T.V I decided that it was better to do something else. I turned on some chili peppers, low, and put family guy on. Then began what I call 'The popping'. Every time I take any kind of stimulate that brigs me up (meth, adderall, large volumes of caffeine) I involuntary, and usually unknowingly pop air from underneath my tongue. It makes kind of a farting sound and is very annoying because I cant stop it. Im not sure if this happens to many other people, but it will not go away. My jaw continually locks and unlocks so I get some gum to try and help it. I cant sit still and my hands are tremoring. Heart rate 109(Bpm)",
      "T+1 1/2hours - There is something definitely different about this experience than that I have had with just taking normal adderall. Generally when I take the adderall by its self I become very focused at one task at a time, but now I am very flighty with my every action. I cant decide what to do and as soon as I pick something up I move onto something else. I am able to type but I tend to double or even triple hit the keys. I had a conversation with a friend and after talking to me for about 3min asked me if I had taken something. She stated that I was talking very rapidly and when I wasnt, she noticed the popping of my tongue. After listing to myself talk, I concerned that my speech was very rapid. I was also jumping from one subject to another, paying no real attention to anything she had to say. Heart rate 102(Bpm)",
      "T+3hrs 50min - I just dosed the other half of the speed. I am having slight feelings of paranoia. I have checked my window about 5 times in the last 15 min. I keep looking out into the dark and seeing shadows moving. I know that there is nothing there but I cant shake the feeling that someone is watching me. I distract myself with more music. I had to turn on the light in my room because my eyes kept trying to re-adjust themselves every time I would look away from the computer. My eyes trying to readjust may be why I keep seeing the shadows move. This feels very similar to meth but without any hint of euphoria. Heart rate 113(Bpm)",
      "T+4hrs 20min - I had to get up and walk around because my muscles where cramping. I still feel kinda paranoid but not near as bad as I was 30 min ago. My hands are still very twitchy and kinda clammy. I am wide awake and feeling really jumpy. Every noise I hear makes me jump and immediately start looking around. My muscles in my legs and low back are kinda sore but nothing a good stretch couldnt fix. Heart rate 102(Bpm)",
      "All in all I believe adderall is a good drug but I think its practical uses, for studying and holding a longer concentration, out way its uses as a recreational drug. It is fun to an extent but it can be a very powerful tool to help get through all night projects and shit loads of homework."

      "The Introduction - January 12",
      "My interest in psychoactive (especially psychedelic) substances was sparked when a T.V. news report on the use of oxycodone among young adults when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I was instantly intrigued by the fact of altering your own mind with a chemical compound.",
      "Fast forward a few years. I am in the 7th grade, 12 years old, and I stumble upon something intriguing - Erowid. I began to quickly learn the 'truth' of these substances, and not the D.A.R.E. propaganda distributed to us in flyers at assemblies. LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline were the first few psychoactives I researched. My learning moved onto the more obscure chemicals and plants - eventually to the 'research chemicals'. My interests grew as I read the dozens and hundreds of trip reports at Erowid and the Lycaeum on psychedelics.",
      "I stumbled upon a website called Bluelight in mid-2004. While Erowid only had a limited amount of information at the time, I realized this forum community was full of people from all over the world with a common goal. I began to learn as much as I could, to educate myself, before I would be ready to begin a psychedelic experience.",
      "While my journey of education, I quickly learned that peers and parents would be of no use. Both parties had already been brainwashed by D.A.R.E. propaganda, LSD caused you to see demons 99% of the time, resulting in genocide. My peers viewed LSD as something only 'insane' people would dose themselves with (which is slightly ironic, because it [should be] quite the opposite). Marijuana began being used by the masses by late 8th, early 9th grade.",
      "Many people my age are trying to get their hands on anything they can to experience visuals. I know a few people who have spent months of their lives dedicated to dosing themselves with DXM strictly for the visuals. Don't get me wrong - I didn't think of psychedelics being a 'tool' from the start, but after my large amount of reading/research, I have realized that these substances allow people to better themselves. Psychedelics definitely have a legitimate purpose in life - whether that is with psychiatry, meditation, or simply for giving yourself the ability to 'free your mind'. It would be incredible to see decriminalization in my lifetime.",
      "My goal with psychedelics is to expand my mindset and learn the truth about society and life. I've had dreams where the 'walls of reality' break down and allow me to see things for what they are. Imagine the world being on a 2D plane - there are boundaries, truths in front of hiding lies. Then imagine that you are able to pan up away from the 2D environment, and you are now on the 3D 'zone'. You may now look at things for what they are. To my understanding, I will experience this when I take my first psychedelic journey.",
      "I have experienced lucid dreams in the past, but only on three or four occasions. Every single time was incredible - controlling my brain with ease was pleasurable and something unforgettable to me.",
      "I attend an extremely conservative all-boys boarding school. My drug history is minimal. Sporadic marijuana usage and a couple of rare cases with prescription medication (Codeine 120mg once with minimal effects, just an overall good feeling and general numbness of extremities) is all I have under my belt. I hope this will be beneficial to my first psychedelic journey. It should be well documented, and I hope to capture my emotions and ideas on paper or audio/video.",

      "The digital campus bell rang out. My clock read 9:00am.",
      "My thoughts began racing - today was the day. Just last night, my eyes scanned a bag with a quarter ounce (7 grams) of Psilocybe Cubensis. 4 mushroom heads and about two dozen stems made my mouth salivate. These 7 grams were to be split three ways, which would amount to roughly 2.33 grams for everyone. B had experience with marijuana, and a single extremely low dose (.25-.5 grams) on mushrooms. C had experienced two Salvia divinorum trips, two mushroom trips, and marijuana usage.",
      "Myself? I personally had minimal, sporadic marijuana usage (less than a dozen times). Besides lucid dreaming, I was definitely an extreme beginner to the altered states of mind. I was a little cautious of the dose I was taking. I knew I was a small guy, and I knew this wasn't a toy.",
      "[ 10:20pm - T+0:00 ]",
      "It is now 10:20AM. Two of us just finished off the mushrooms with a health drink. B is still finishing his up with difficulty.",
      "We all take a walk to pass time and discover nature until we start coming up. I feel as if my inhibitions are leaving me. By 10:50, I'm definitely feeling high. Patterns start looking suspicious as I eye them up. Back in C's room, we play some video games as the mushrooms digest in our bodies. Massive amounts of giggling begin to erupt - we are soon laughing because we are laughing.",
      "[ 11:40pm - T+1:20 ]",
      "Everything begins to become wavy. Patterns begin to shift, dots in the ceiling begin to 'dance' as I concentrate. Everyone is gathered in the long hallway when B points out something astounding. By simply looking at the carpet, it begins to grow. Up and sideways - it's as if someone is stretching and skewing the end of the carpet. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind.",
      "As I stated before, it is difficult to recall my entire psychedelic journey. People began having multiple faces - as if pictures of faces were overlaid. I began to understand influence. A non-tripping friend took on the role of an angel in my mind, while another became the devil. Yin and the yang are understood. Prejudice, politics, infinity - all is understood. The blue eyes of a friend began to radiate as if they were radioactive. Each room had a different personality.",
      "Communication is simple. Words begin losing their meaning. Why are the words becoming meaningless? We simply began communicating without words.",
      "[ 12:30 - T+2:10 ]",
      "I begin to peak. My thought patterns are as stable as an elephant on high doses of tranquilizers. Ideas are jumping left and right. Faces begin appearing. I look outside. The ends of the pine trees explode into fractal-like faces. I am beckoned to stare. Rocks turn into faces of all different nationalities. Wood grain began to flow like rivers. My carpet took on thousands of single inch faces that grew out several feet above the ground.",
      "I cannot remember correctly, but at around this time I had an incredible experience with C. Although we were not speaking, our ideas flowed - there is no doubt in my mind that body language is read easily and effectively while under the influence of mushrooms.",

      "'Faces grow out of the rainnnn, when you're strangeeeeeee.'",
      "Although it was raining, the visuals were still intense. The dirt seemed like opaque glass - the dirt was a glass barrier between two worlds. I watched faces and arms try to break through the glass from inside the earth. I explore the building. I see a person of authority and begin talking to him. The conversation lasted only seconds, but it was too incredibly intense for me. The outline of his face broke open and his face poured out. The hair on his head grew and tangled just as a tree would if a time-lapse video was being recorded over a dozen years.",
      "I walk down the hall and walk up the steps. As I stated before that every room is a completely different universe, the same is true with levels in a building. My field of vision becomes saturated with color. As I take each step up, I feel as if I am being lifted up into another dimension. I feel a sense of a 'bigger meaning' to life. Everything becomes a blur here. Intensity. Intensity. Intensity. Intensity.",
      "My hand melts into my keyboard as I attempt to login to my user account. I am greeted with my desktop, a psychedelic piece of digital art. A face blooms from it and looks at me, as if it were teaching me the meaning of life. My hands end up melting with a lot of things during my trip. It is like mushrooms allow me to 'become' an object for a temporary period of time.",
      "As I closed my eyes to find closed eye visuals, I see rows of neon, rainbow colored Atari and Nintendo logos. When I close my eyes, I see a 'digital' or 'snapshot' version of what I was seeing with my eyes open.",
      "Time flies. Literally. Every time I blink people are feet away from where they were last. I am in a trance. My memory and consciousness begin to fade. I pace my room as we play with our cell phones. I feel like I should talk to my family. No, wait, bad idea. I call several friends and explain my situation. As I breathe on objects they shrink and grow. My phone gets extremely small as I blow on it, and it feels like a child's toy.",
      "[ 12:59 - T+2:39 ]",
      "My alarm clock displays 12:59. I am laying in my bed, and C tells me that putting my face in my pillow is an incredible experience. My comforter flows over my body like a wave in the ocean. I can almost smell the ocean as I feel the movement on the back of my shirt. I am now in a void. A cave that was infinitely large and infinitely small. I understand the meaning of infinity - it is nothing and everything at the same exact time.",
      "I begin feeling unpleasant. The mushrooms are overwhelming. Too overwhelming. I check the time again. It's still 12:59.",
      "12:59.",
      "12:59.",
      "12:59. I check my clock at least one hundred times. This minute feels like an eternity. I feel sick. I hear high pitched squeals coming from my walls. The paint on my walls begin melting to reveal faces. Dozens of full sized faces stare at my frightened ego. My carpet's texture turns into faces. I'm seeing a lot of faces. Wow. Faces growing out of faces? Let's breathe.",
      "From this point on, I remember very little. I remember moments from around 1:09, 1:25, and 1:50. I am so overwhelmed. I begin to recognize my 109 pound body couldn't handle the 2.33 grams of p. cubensis as easy as the more experienced 190 pound trippers. I took too much. Let it stop. 'I will come down. I will come down.' Evidently, during this time, I wondered down to C's room and had a 'deep intellectual conversation', involving a sober friend and trying to make him play hockey with a large penguin on a rug.",
      "The fibers of reality begin to fray. My field of vision began ripping as if someone had begun tearing the 'film' from a projector. Time becomes meaningless. Perception is all that keeps my body from falling apart in the material world.",
      "[ 2:35 - T+5:20 ]",
      "I begin to become conscious. I am told by a sober friend that I freaked out for a few minutes, but it becomes apparent he over-reacted. I do not blame him for putting me in this situation, but he did not know any better. He was obviously not aware his words were scaring me as he tried to joke with me. His jokes were not funny and scared me. I am trapped. Everyone must know. I am trapped. My parents are waiting outside my room. The police are here. The police are here. I am trapped.",
      "'Am I in danger?'",
      "[ 3:00 - T+5:45 ]",
      "Alright - I admit it. I freaked out. I took too much for my first time. I am beginning to come down, but I cannot distinguish reality from fiction. I soon realize what has happened. My positive experience turned into a negative (bad trip?) experience when I let my guard down. My judgement is still extremely altered. I still feel high, and the visuals are still there if I concentrate. The faces in the pine tree, mud, and tile are still extremely apparent.",

      "I lost my interest to write a trip report - words simply don't do justice to the experience. All of my friends want to know what the experience is like. What am I going to say to them? Learn the truth. Expand your mind. Change the world. There is nothing else in this world that has such positively affected me as a person in general. I am a better person tenfold by having this experience. Although I had both positive and negative parts of my psychedelic trip, I gained such an incredible amount of knowledge.",
      "The biases of life were torn down. I was given a fresh start to the world.",
      "But the real question is: Would I do it again?",
      "And the answer is 'definitely'. Although I want to integrate this experience as greatly as possible, the experience is just so incredible, and I feel I need to revisit mushroom land in a better setting. I blame myself for the negative dip in my trip at 12:59. A boarding school where you are completely vulnerable to being caught tripping is not the best setting for a first psychedelic journey. I definitely took too much. I might have a sensitivity to psilocybin.",
      "My advice for anyone wanting to become a better person is the following. Use psychedelics. Start low. I would have rather started with 1.75 grams and worked my way up. Wait for the right time. A positive setting is the best thing. I truly understand why there is 'magic' in 'magic mushrooms'. And unless a person has experienced them, they cannot begin to even fathom the depth of this experience.",
      "Throughout my journey, I had a great time. This experience has been the single most memorable event in my life by far. I am a more balanced and understanding individual because of this. I comprehended the meaning of my life - equilibrium. Balance is everything - the yin and the yang symbolize life.",
      "Tripping was fun. I'm looking forward to doing this again in a better setting."

    "report": [
      "Last night, (the night of November 2nd, 2006) I had my first definite encounter with Salvia Divinorum (10x extract, standardized). I am going to journal the events that happened that evening as best as I humanly can. While the majority of the events in my report will be very similar to those of other experiences, I truly believe that in no way is this a guide for others to learn about what to expect. I truly believe that the experience could be heavenly divine or horrifically soul-shredding. The trip outcome could be transformed to either--without mercy--by even the most infinitesimal factor (psychologically or physiologically). So with that said, I will not attempt to preach to new users on the dangers of this substance. Rather, I will merely attempt to inform the vast public of the events that took place so that they may make their own decisions (best decision is a well informed decision). And please, if you do decide to take an inward journey with Salvia, please have a sober person watch over you (for the safety of yourself and others!). Regardless, live your life to the fullest, and may love be with you.",
      "As for a little background information (not a lot but enough to give you a foundation  to be able to better visualize the occurrences), I will start by saying that I have been an avid drug user for over 5 years now. As of late, I have been taking a zealous interest in dissociatives and hallucinogens. I have had some minor experiences with psilocybin and extensive encounters with large doses of dextromethorphan. Nevertheless, my participation in either of these two substances (or my attempt to mentally prepare myself for what may lie ahead in using this foreign drug) would not grant me the required experience to handle what Salvia had to offer.",
      "The whole process for wanting to try Salvia started roughly two years ago. At that time it was merely a legal substance which was apparently available in most local head shops. Two years then passed, however I still kept my eye on the plant. When I finally convinced myself that I had enough knowledge and willpower to attempt a drug such as this, I decided to ultimately go on with the process. I purchased one gram of 10x Salvia Divinorum extract and spent over five hours preparing myself mentally.",
      "The time appeared to be perfect, so I prepared the water bong and filled the bowl with a fair sized portion of the extract. The dimensions of the amount that I placed into the bowl would most certainly resemble that of the very tip of your pinky (perhaps the size of a raw corn kernel). I sat down on a comfortable chair while soothing background music played. The lighting was dim and my senses were invigorated. I sparked the flame and held the flame over the bowl and immediately inhaled. The smoke was not unpleasant but definitely unique. I thought to myself 'Wow, this isn't too hard, I could smoke multiple bowls of this stuff!' The bowl appeared to be finished off but nevertheless I kept the flame over the ash and continued to inhale until my lungs could not fit another second of breath. Without delay I remembered to hold in the smoke for at least 30 seconds. So I counted in my head, 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine...'",
      "But I saw something outside the window. And at this very instant I put the bong down on the window sill and peeked outside. It was raining out. And it appeared to be very dark--in fact much darker than midnight usually is (how is that possible?). My mind was confused. Not only was I trying to figure out why everything seemed so out of place but I was also wondering what happened to the smoke I just inhaled. Why didn't I exhale anything? It felt as if when I inhaled, the smoke and the air were both absorbed into my blood by my lungs. At any rate, that didn't matter to me then. But god, that rain! That dark rain!",
      "It fell right on top of me, soaking my body and clothes. This didn't frighten me in the least rather I was quite curious (It would be important to note that it was not raining, rather, there was snow on the ground). Instinctively I attempted to pull away from the window sill but my arms and legs were stuck. I was being pulled into the window sill wooden frame. The force did not appear to be pushing me or pulling me into the wall, rather I was realizing then that I was actually no longer human. I was simply the wooden frame. I felt my body and soul becoming the simplistic, wooden, and inanimate object. My god! How amazing! The rain continued to pour down on top of me, and I could see my arms and legs as if they were a piece of wood that was sitting outside under a rainstorm... the water droplets forming many beads on top of the threads of the wood. My body also started to take on more vibrant colors. Not only was I wooden, but I was painted! A vivid and palpable array of paint!",
      "While movement was not completely inhibited, I was able to move my head slightly to look outside. It was at that moment when I looked at the neighboring houses, that I saw something that I would never forget. The houses were wooden and plastic (much like I was, they also had a very human appearance) and they looked at me with a smile. The told me to look up at the sky. The dark rain fell down into my eyes but I managed to squint out the water droplets. I saw something that I will probably never be able to describe but I shall try my very best. Something was coming down upon me. This massive being or entity crept slowly down toward my house and it was very apparent that it was going to consume all of us. I asked the other beings around me, 'Why?!'",
      "They smiled back at me and spoke to me with their eyes. They told me, 'Don't you know? This is our fate and purpose in life.' I didn't believe them! I couldn't! I screamed begging for mercy but what could they do? They were trapped just like me... unable to move or run away. One girl looked at me with empathy but I knew she was unable to do anything. The entity was creeping closer, only this time I could feel it pressing me in between the windowsill and the ledge. My head was pinned. Why? It was in this moment that appeared to be most mind-blowing. I truly wish to God that I could be able to describe this petrifying experience. Why was I simply born in this world to serve such a meaningless purpose only to be 'obliterated' by this unknown force? But my questions didn't have any importance at this time. All I was concerned about was somehow trying to break from this wooden window sill. However, the reality of it was I was a piece of wood. A piece of wood has no legs or muscles. So there I was. Helpless.",
      "At last I was able to break free but I immediately fell to the floor. Soaking wet, I was laying on the floor in the fetal position crying. Will no one help me? I realized how much I had in my life. I was more than something so simple and common. I had a larger purpose to serve and I was not done serving that purpose. Looking up I had the most passionate hope to be saved and to be taken away from this anguish. The faces I saw earlier appeared above me. They looked down at me, still smiling. In harmony they all extended their arms and they lifted me up and above the misery and shadows below. They all laughed and were surprised that I was so upset (as if I was supposed to know that all of this was imminent!). I felt a huge amount of innocence and sadness as they were carrying me up and away from all of this. They sat me down gracefully on my bed, however, I did not want to lay there all wet as it was extremely uncomfortable. The beings slowly vanished through the walls like dust.",
      "It was at this moment when all of confusion started to return to order. The pressure was no longer present, and I started to realize that these beings brought me back to my bedroom. I was so incalculably relieved! Thank you god! Bless you for giving me a second chance in life. I was hot and wet still (as well as enormously out of breath!) from this whole ordeal so I instinctively took off all of my clothes and went to look for a dry set. However I was starting to quickly come back down further into reality and I started to consciously realize that I had taken Salvia and this was all a hallucination. I slipped in an out of hallucinations and realities for roughly 20 minutes after this. I looked for my apparently wet clothes and found them to be dry. I put them back on and tried to watch television and listen to familiar music to help me keep in contact with what I know was real.",
      "Like the calm after a massive storm I was feeling colossal peace and thankfulness. I rested in bed becoming one with myself and my surroundings. I have not slept that peacefully since a child. There were also very unique and pleasurable physical after-effects. They could be compared to that of a very intense (but remember, also very rare) cannabis high. A lingering feeling of being seamlessly and slowly meshed in with whatever I was in contact with. To give you a simple example, if I were to lie down on my bed afterwards, it would feel as if I was becoming one with the bed. I was merging into a simplistic--yet comfortable--form.",
      "I am writing this roughly 15 hours after the occurrence and I am in a deep and constant state of thought (peaceful, too). I still have no concrete idea on what happened or what to think of it all. Perhaps it was merely a chemical physiological episode... regardless, it was so real. I'll need time to think it all over. Will I ever do it again? I cannot say just yet. Was I regretful of the experience? I don't believe so! I was shown something so powerful and intense, yes, but I think that I was being taught. And if the purpose of the lesson was to make sure I was paying attention, well you have my undivided attention!"

      "I have been 'involved' with psychedelic plants and compounds since my early teens but never til now have bothered to experiment with Heimia Salicifolia aka 'Sun Opener'. I ordered 10 grams from a reputable source which arrived within a week.",
      "The first thing I did was rolled a gram joint to experience its effects prior to injesting the rest as a tea. Smoking the leaves gave me a mild buzz similiar to marijuana but more drowsy feeling. Music was slightly enhanced and a noticable feeling of euphoria was also experieced. As I got up for the bathroom, I noticed my balance was slightly off similiar to the result of a few beers. A darkening of surroundings is noticed while on the toilet. Effects wear off around the 3 hour mark as I began to pass out from the drowsy effect. I awoke the next morning with the worst headache I've ever had (Aspirin did nothing for it). At this point I should have taken this as a sign that perhaps I should think twice about injesting this stuff. But instead, I brushed it off as a symptom of smoking and that it could have been a combination of the change in weather pressure as well.",
      "A week later I decide to brew the tea. I boiled it in about 5 cups of water for 10 minutes on High. Then I let it steep for about 20 minutes, letting it cool down. I poured about 2.5 cups into a large pint glass and proceeded to add some cream and stevia to sweeten the taste. It took quite a bit of stevia actually, this stuff is extremely bitter but not quite as bad as Calea Zacatchichi. Next thing I sat comfortable browsing the internet drinking the tea as I would any other tea and after I had drank about half the glass, I began to notice a tensing up of all my muscles and jaw in particular. Then I noticed I was complete crouched over and about as unrelaxed as I've ever been. I wondered why and immediately stopped drinking the tea. I began to feel this tightening in my entire body, head included. At that point I knew I was having an adverse reaction. The tenseness developed more and more into a very painful sensation as if I had been beaten all over my body and was healing from bruises. I could barely walk 5 feet. When I moved I felt extreme pain and wished I had some pain killers kickin around but all I had was some lousey aspirin which I took but it seemed to do little for me. The remainder of the night was me trying to sleep it off and hopefully feel better in the morning.",
      "In the morning I woke up still in alot of bodily pain (even my balls hurt when I went to take a pee!) Then the worst part happened-I remembered people speak about this stuff as an auditory hallicinogen and decided to check if this out for myself. As a music lover, I would have loved to have listened to music during the evening if I wasn't in so much pain. But I couldn't think of anything else but how to stop the tightening adverse reaction. Anyways, I put on some music that I was very familiar with and to my utter surprise, the entire thing was pitched down exactly 1 octave. This troubled me as it had already been the next day and it didn't particularly sound great that way. It seemed to take with it the essence and I couldn't even bop my head to this. It was simply bad sounding. I wanted my audio to shift back to normal. It's still the next day so I won't know for a day or two if my hearing is permanently mangled from this stuff.",
      "I threw the remainder of the tea down the toilet and will never touch this stuff again! I hope this message saves a few people from trying this and having a similiar reaction.",

      "It started off as any normal thursday, I had recently bought a gram of some kind-bud off one of my friends in school.  Since I only had a gram I convinced myself that I should smoke it all in one night and buy some more off him tomorrow. I managed to roll two nice sized jays out of the sack.  I slipped them in my cigarette pack and waited patiently. ",
      "That night around 10:30 I smoked both of the joints in a row taking enormous mind-blowing hits off of them.  After I finished the second joint I lit up a cigarette and stood on my back porch admiring the beauty of the woods, in fall colors, behind my house.  I walked back into my house and went on my computer, I tried to manage some conversations with my friends but this was extremely difficult to accomplish. Then out of nowhere I heard a very loud and persistent humming coming from the back of my head.  After a few minutes it felt like it was pushing my head towards the computer screen, and as I got closer to the screen it felt as if the computer was trying to 'eat my face'.  It was extremely odd and felt as if a gelatinous goo was clinging to my face and pulling, but it had an electrical feel to it as it pulled me in, it's hard to explain.  While this was going on I wasn't having any fear, this feeling that the computer was eating me was quite entertaining and I let out a chuckle every once in ahwile.",
      "I decieded that I was too blown to be on my computer so I laid on my bed and stared at my shelf while laying on my side.  On my shelf I have one of those globes attached to the stand that generate electricity beams and they connect to your fingers when you touch the glass.  I stared at this object for about 5 minutes until it looked as if the black outline of the object was turning a glowing yellow.  A few more minutes passed and suddenly I was able to generate an exact copy of the outline filled in with vibrant colors directly next to it.  I was confused because I am a chronic marijuana user and have never tripped off of marijuana before. ",
      "I wanted to see how far I could go with these visual hallucinations so I decided to see if I was going to have any CEV's.  There was complete darkness for about ten seconds then suddenly a simple object appeared.  It looks like a very wide, upside-down spike, and had a rectangle coming out of the side and another spike sticking out of the box pointing towards me.  Everything was yellow except for the spike on the box which was brown with a black and white tip.  I could see the dimensions of the object very well and tried to manipulate it, but to no avail. All during this time I was having muscle spasms all over my body, which were about three times stronger than I usually have them. ",
      "I heard the Daily Show on Comedy Central come on so I sat up in my bed and started watching the TV.  Then suddenly something came over me.  The only way that I can explain this is that it felt like the top half of my vision was being blurred over my head (like my eyes were outside of my head and looking upwards, and the bottom half of my vision was trailing off to the lower-right.  It was by no means 'Scary' but it was annoying me because I couldn't see the TV.  After about 20 minutes of this going on (even while laying on my back staring at the ceiling) I eventually fell asleep and awoke the next day being somewhat groggy but happy with what I had experienced that night.  It was like a low-dose LSD or DXM trip without the sickness or the paranoia.",

      "I found out through the internet about Diphenhydramine, Meclizine, and Dimenhydrinate and their effects at high dosage.  Realizing that I had some Diphenhydramine around the house in the form of 'Tylenol Simply Sleep' pills, 25-50 mg each, I decided to give it a try.  I am a person who loves analyzing the effects of different substances when I first take them, so this was a great opportunity.  I noticed how everyone's dosage and experience was vastly different, so I decided to start at 100mg for the first dose (it was probably around 8 pm) and wait 30 minutes, while paying careful attention to how my body felt during that time. ",
      "I noticed getting more muscle fatigue and my perception of everything visual was off a little, it's hard to describe how.  I paid attention to my heart, breathing, mental capacity, anything else that I determined relevant and it was acceptable, so I smoked a bowl and took another 100mg.  I started liking the effects, I noticed my vision was getting blurry, the walls were breathing a little, and dark colors were shifting.  I sat around for a little bit more and decided to take another 100mg, making the total 300 so far.  This is when I left to go to my friend's house about 15 minutes away.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "I didn't notice anything remarkably different between 200mg and 300mg, just slightly greater effects of it all.  While at my friends house we were sitting in her car talking, listening to music, and smoking cigarettes with one of our other friends and I took another 100mg before we all smoked a bowl.  I felt great at this point. I was relaxed, and everything was kind of dreamy, but not in an uncomfortable way. ",
      "According to my friends, I was starting to make less sense.  I distinctly remember exclaiming 'My cigarette tastes like berries!' (it did, and I smoke Marlboro Menthols) and one of my friends thought that was hilarious and odd, although it didn't seem out of place to me at the time.  I chilled out a little and talked, smoked some cigs, and took another 50mg after a few bowls had been passed around, smoked a couple cigs and we went in the house.  I was waiting 15-30 minutes between each dosage.  At this time I was having a terrible time reading small text (like on small pill bottles) but I wasn't having too much trouble with computers and tv. ",
      "After a while of hanging out and feeling the pills (more dreamy feelings, nothing felt real, but I wasn't hallucinating at this point) I decided I'd better head towards my house before I got any worse off of these.  I took another 50mg (making the total 500mg -- seems to be threshold for visuals for me) and left. ",
      "As I was driving home I started to feel the effects even more and I was making an effort to pay close attention to the road and nothing else.  I had no problems 75% of the way home, even driving through city traffic for a few minutes.  Nothing felt out of the ordinary, just felt like I was high.  When I was getting pretty close to my house I looked in the road ahead of me and saw an opossum sitting on its hind legs in my lane.  It was probably larger than a desktop computer, just sitting there.  I tapped the brakes while thinking what to do (will I hit it or avoid it?), I had pretty much decided to slow down and go around it since it was sitting still.  All this took place within maybe 2 seconds and I had still been staring at it in the road ahead of me. ",
      "I looked down at my speed for a split second, looked back at the road to get a better look at this opossum, and it vanished right in front of my eyes.  That made me realize how much of an effect I had from the pills. I believe I lit a cigarette at this point to make sure I didn't zone out, 'lose time' and crash. ",
      "A little further along the road I came around a corner and saw maybe 50 feet ahead of me a black spot stretched across both lanes, probably 2 feet wide, and I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  Water?  A shadow?  Pavement patch?  Nothing at all? All the sudden my mind clicked and it became a spike strip!  Why?  Hell if I know!  By reflex and without hesitation I slammed the brakes almost to the floor and dropped from about 50mph to 15mph in a couple seconds (approaching the fastest stop possible for my heavy ass truck), lucky there was no one behind me, and I crept along until about 5 feet before I would have hit it, I realized, 'Why the hell would there be a spike strip in the middle of nowhere?' and it changed into a harmless dark spot in the road.  I let go of the brake and continued on without further incident, thinking I was stupid.  I believe it was a pavement patch after all. ",
      "I got home and went to my room and just chilled.  I looked at my poster of Tila Tequila on the wall, saw her moving her body with the music I was playing from my computer.  I was thinking how cool it would be if she walked right out of the poster. But no, it didn't happen.  I am not one to have detailed hallucinations.  I probably smoked another bowl, some cigs.  A feeling came over me (similar to the fuzzy feeling I get when I mix pot and alcohol at the right level) and generally whenever this feeling happens, if the situation permits I will lay down for a few minutes and close my eyes, a lot of times getting visual or body stimulation, or my imagination runs wild.  I was curious so I did this, and then got back up and sat at my desk.  At this point I should probably start listing what I wrote down the day after about the whole experience, and the report will continue after.",
      "2:",
      "Every time I lay down and closed my eyes, I was all of the sudden sitting in front of the computer looking at experiences online and I read them all out loud but without speaking [my mental voice was louder than ever when I attempted to use it].  Some seemed to make perfect sense in my head, some made no sense and I could tell I was only thinking of it because of being fucked up.",
      "At one point I stared at a spot on the ceiling and I was somewhere else.  Don't know [where] but somewhere.  I realized what happened and my first thought was 'shit, open your eyes!' and when I tried to open my eyes, I discovered that they were already open and I was staring at the ceiling.",
      "I would get a 'feeling' that someone was near me.  It was more of a manifestation of someone, always transparent or only a head and transparent, and always on my right side.  It wasn't something to be alarmed about to me.  Every time I spoke with someone who wasn't actually there, it was done 'telepathically', usually didn't open my mouth.  If they didn't answer I'd find myself saying something out loud, then I'd physically turn around to look at the person, and there would be no one there.  I had only perceived a person, sometimes from when I closed my eyes to look for visuals.  I would sometimes find myself speaking out loud, and not know what I was referring to.",
      "There were sudden flashes of light on the walls and ceiling.  My skull poster was wavy, moving, and unbalanced. ",
      "I swear I saw a cat jump out my window while I was smoking a cigarette.  It was white and transparent.  Then I saw it again floating in my room but only for a split second.  I felt heavy, disconnected from myself, distant, I'd even venture to say enlightened in some ways.  I just had no way to make my mouth say what I was thinking, nor could I actually stay on one train of thought for any length of time, or remember what my response was to someone by the time they stopped talking to let me answer.  I saw transparent 'things' several of which resembled spiders.  I saw one hanging from my model airplane over the bed, and I saw probably 5 or 6 at one time on the blades of the ceiling fan, transparent white slightly glowing spiders.  One of them jumped off the fan blade with a string of web behind it and dive bombed onto the floor beside my bed.  Another one right onto my chest.  That was freaky, but I didn't feel the need to check and make sure it was a hallucination, I just knew.  I kept looking, and I could see no evidence that there was actually a web of any kind, but I kept seeing the 'spider legs' on top of the fan blades.",
      "Also, I saw parts of movies in my head 'on tv.'  Not what you're thinking... these movies didn't exist, even in theory, and I didn't recognize anyone who was taking part in them.  Or as I wrote somewhere else '...movies that were never made, with people who have no names.'",
      "I felt like I couldn't move when I laid down.  Thought I smoked a bowl or two and had a good bit left over, but actually I had smoked one bowl wayyyyyy earlier, and that was the last of it.  Unless I hid the stuff, which is always a possibility.",
      "I kept tripping over shit: my chair, books, random crap in the floor or sometimes things not even in the way.",
      "Light spots, long open stretches, lights in the distance, all these made the whole environment look like it came straight out of a fairy tale or dream of some sort, like the whole reality wasn't real at all.",
      "I was seeing glitches in my vision, the only way to describe it is like the Terminator's vision or something, and the corners would glitch sometimes and move or rip.",
      "Speaking of rips, I saw little rips in the fabric of our very reality... at least thats what it looked like to me.  Tiny balls of light floating to wherever they wanted to go, then expanding ever so slightly to expose a black hole center that soon overtook the light that had been surrounding it, and turned back to darkness.  Looked like the spots were turning themselves inside out.  At the time, I referred to them in my head as rips in the space-time continuum.  I dunno, musta sounded intelligent or something. ",
      "Everything that happened felt like a dream.  I was just mentally floating and everything felt light as if it was a cartoon world but not really, everything just looked like I was seeing it for the first time right then.  Everything was suddenly interesting and cool looking, kind of like when I first started smoking pot.",
      "Kept itching, couldn't sleep.  Had to keep shifting my position or I'd get restless and have muscle cramps.  Barely slept, on and off for a couple hours.",
      "Fan blades were warping or disappearing or spinning slowly, all without actually moving.",
      "I heard voices throughout the night, and 99% of the time I couldn't tell what they were saying.  Computer speakers were seeming to buzz in a way that I've never heard before, with nothing being played over them.  Black spots in vision were common, especially when turning lights on and off.  Had a lot of trouble reading small print such as on pill bottles, looked like a line of nothing.  Had to close one eye and squint the other just to barely see it. ",
      "I noticed that I had begun to walk more hunched over, 50% of the reason was clearly that my body felt heavy from the drugs, and the other 50% is truly unknown to me.  I'm sure I *could* have stood up, especially since I knew I was doing it.. but I just wouldn't. ",
      "I constantly felt like my muscles were 'lagging' behind my brain in where to go like being drunk, except it was controllable.",

      "The above description applies to the first two times I did it.  The below experiences (maybe three separate ones?) were done close together and were coupled with sleep deprivation and taking between 800mg and 1000mg Diphenhydramine.  These were funny while I was on the stuff, but thinking about it sober, it was kind of scary. ",
      "-Constantly heard voices like they were out in the hall.  Not pleasantly unintelligible like before, it was like they were right outside my door. I guessed it was my dad and I would say 'I can't hear you' through the door and listen, and he'd say something else and I'd get mad and say again that I can't understand him, he would repeat again and I'd actually go open the door and look in the hall, only to see no one there.  Same with my mom's voice.  They had long been in bed.  At highest dose this happened maybe 10 times in a row before I realized I needed to stop getting up.  I got pretty mad about this because I couldn't distinguish what was real and what wasn't. ",

      "- I did not experience much drowsiness, and in fact I could not sleep after taking that amount.  My body was *so* tired it was just limp and cramping up waiting to go to sleep, but my mind was still going, but not making any sense.  Everything that came through my mind was just off the wall, abstract, or complete gibberish. ",
      "-I kept getting up to look for something, or go do something, and no sooner than I stand up to do it, I forgot what the hell it was.  That made me irate for a while.",
      "-At certain times I would hear music playing in my head just as clearly as if I had ear buds in listening to my mp3 player, but all my speakers were off, no radio on, nothing.  Just the computer's fan running.  Heard all the instruments and vocals, sounded just like the real thing except for when I didn't know the words and my mind made up something that sounded like it just to continue the song  thats how I found out that the music wasn't really being played, because I almost got up to check.",
      "-I thought this was a dream:  I going through my desk, don't know why, and pulled an envelope out of my drawer.  It was from a friend in another state and he had asked me to put something illegal in it and send it back to him (forget what it was, but we talked about doing it with pot seeds before).  I opened up the envelope to check if I had put something inside to send to him, dumped the contents into my hands and it was two muzzle restrictors (1/2 choke and open choke) and a tool for my pump shotgun.  Been in that envelope for years, since I got the gun.  Have no idea why I did all that... Must have hallucinated part of it then grabbed the envelope is all I can think of!  I seem to remember trying to lick it shut too... But its sitting on top of stuff in my desk drawer so I really did pick it up, usually its around the bottom.  But I cant for the life of me think why I picked it up, or why I thought my friend had sent it?  Well there it is, unlicked and still has a staple in the top flap.  I made note of the staple even in my stupor.",
      "-I could have sworn I got up and looked out the window around 6 AM (yes I was actually awake) and saw my friend's truck back out of my driveway, heard him rev it up twice, then saw him leave.  At the time, I stayed out of view and hoped that he wouldn't come back, assuming he had come to get something he forgot, and I didn't want him to know I was awake tripping because he'd probably come fuck with me.  I texted him when I was sober and asked why he was at my house at that time, and he laughed and said he was asleep then and didn't know what I was talking about. ",
      "-When trying to wake up the morning after a trip, I 'perceived' that three of my friends were in my room passing a bowl (three people that would most likely not be seen in my room, two of which I hadn't seen in a year, the other has never met those two, and I've never smoked *with* anyone here).  It was passed to me, and I reached behind me to grab it while I was laying down, and when I didn't feel it in my hand I turned my head to look at the girl passing it, and the room was dark and empty.",
      "-My mother was trying to wake me up after one of my trips, she said I was talking about things that made no sense and she thought I was on LSD (? later said I was talking the same way I did after getting my wisdom teeth out -- fucked up and disoriented) and she was about to search my room for drugs, and then she assumed I was sick with the flu.  I woke up and felt sick to my stomach, had a headache, diarrhea, fever, all the signs of a stomach bug of some kind.  I told her I thought it was caused by the sleeping pills I took (but didn't tell her I had taken over 800mg of it!).  I hadn't had this kind of feeling from the pills before, so she was able to convince me to go to the doctor, who prescribed an anti-vomiting medicine and sent me home.  I never did take it, stayed up a while then slept it off and when I woke up (9 PM the next day) I felt fine.",
      "-After one of my trips, I found two sleeping pills on the floor and two under my keyboard.  I wonder if I took more than I thought? Or less than I thought?  Also there were two bowl packs of weed already ground up under the keyboard (well, that was a pleasant surprise).  I found four more pills laying loose in my left drawer.  I thought I was keeping track of them better than that, even while tripping.",

Sounds like it came from out my window, or from the computer.  Sounded like high-pitched voice.  I honestly don't know if it was real or fake.  But I really don't care.  5:36  I just felt a larger wave -------- there it was again.  Pleasant, but kind of scary at the same time.",

I'd think I saw something sitting next to me, and just like someone else's experience said, it didn't phase me, didnt seem out of the ordinary at all while I was under the influence of this stuff, I just didn't even question it.

      "I got trapped amongst the mental health regime due to my parents demanding that I see a psych, after condemning my trying recreational drugs.  I love most dopamine, serotonin, and phenylethylamine substances.  I had stated plainly that I liked methamphetamine a bit, mushrooms alot, and when I had research chemicals sent to me (2cp and 5meo-dmt) my family all came down on me like a tonne of angry dirt.",
      "So, I have a meeting with a shrink arranged for me, and I think the mention that I used speed, pot, and what not made him think I was a candidate. He orders that I be reviewed in a mental hospital. When in hospital a few chicks came on to me, I got labelled as inappropriate by the docs, I had a few interviews the outcome of which was that I was 'grandiose and amused' which somehow in some wierd strange incomprehensible to me and judgemental way proved that I had psychosis- hence the 50mg shots in the bum and 6 month community treatment order.",
      "Now it is interesting to note they gave me a 3 months sickness claim, meaning I could have an allowance as they had deemed me unfit for work. The medication kept on coming after I was discharged, but after the 3 months I was back to independence. My beliefs had not changed a bit, I had less I wanted to share with others, I was suffering somnolence (sleeping for 12-15 hours a day), my empathy had trailed off to something vague and brittle and my desire to do anything about it was diminished moreso. I rationalised that patience is all I could rely on and the treatment order would be over soon enough.",
      "For some reason the treatment order has been renewed, and renewed, and renewed, and is imminently set to be renewed once again. I know that I have anger about this, but the risperdal ensures that my emotions are shut tight in the cardboard box so to speak, and feeds me more shredded cardboard, which leaves me morose and sullen, and a bit sick.",
      "The cost of a shot is in excess of $700. It is given fortnightly. 2 people are travelling 30 mins each way in a company car to administer it to me. Add the cost of wages and petrol. I have never paid for this. I really wonder how society is structured in that war, for instance, is so destructive yet makes big money, and in a similar fashion risperidone, which is so unpleasant and destructive to the appreciation of life, can be making money by its sheer distribution and implementation.",
      "Let me just say I think the force is a sham and the outcomes insidious. Reduction in transmitter activity is akin to brain damage. The longer I'm stuck on this hampster wheel for no other reason than that I retain the right to take recreational drugs, the more I think Im a victim of the argument of institution versus freedom. I do have a strong spiritual belief that all the bad stuff is temporary, and if I persevere in doing the right thing God will do an accounting and I will inherit what I really deserve."

      "This weekend has been the culmination of a wonderful month. A series of really great events in my life coupled with some important realizations have led me to being able to continually maintain a flow of love radiating from myself, which has spread to others around me and which has made me the happiest I've ever been for that period of this past month.",
      "I've come to realize two things lately: one, emotion depends heavily upon the physical flow of energy through your body (through your chakras to be specific), two, the flow of energy throughout your body can be altered with practice through meditation and other mental exercises. Personally I've become aware that love and joy express themselves as a warm, euphoric energy radiating outward and being released from the solar plexus and the heart. Depression and anxiety happen when this energy in the solar plexus and heart changes to become a creeping, pulsing unpleasant energy which loops around and never is released like it is when you're feeling love and euphoria (the lack of release is perhaps the reason it feels bad instead of good). The result of this is a buildup of physical anxiety and mental negativity.",
      "Of course, changing this at will is much easier said than done. I just know that this past month I've been able to consistently keep my energy flowing outward and have had probably the best month of my life. The best ways I know of to change this energy are being affected by the love coming from others (loved pets are excellent for this because they never stop expressing it to you), enjoying and/or playing excellent music, creating and/or experiencing other types of art, and passionate discussion. Also with practice, meditation can allow you to move the energy more towards positivity.",
      "So anyway, the weekend culminated in me getting engaged to my girlfriend of five years on Friday night, which was really an amazing experience. So needless to say, when we got home Saturday night I was simply ecstatic! So it only added to my excitement when I discovered a mysterious vial that had appeared in my mailbox containing 30mg of DOM HCl, one of the compounds I've always had at or near the top of my to-do list, but which I never expected to find! Given that my mental state was so excellent, I decided right there to sample it at a low-ish dose. I waited until later on at night so I could have the majority of my experience alone. I've got no problems taking most psychedelics (other than shattering doses) around my fiance, as I am totally comfortable with her, but I prefer to be alone to really explore a substance.",
      "12:55am (1-29-2007) - Ingested 7mg of DOM HCl dissolved in a solution of 2.217mL of ethanol and 4.783mL of distilled water. No perceptible taste. I held the solution sublingually for about 10 minutes before swallowing. I then went back downstairs to hang out with L (my fiance) for a while.",
      "1:55 - It's been an hour, and the effects have definitely started. It feels at this point like a very gentle amphetamine buzz, and nothing but pleasant. As a matter of fact, it has increased the euphoria emanating from my solar plexus, but has decreased the output of love, as it seems to make me a bit more analytical than I am in my sober state. Still, I feel very emotional. The only other DOX I've tried a full dose of is DOC, which I am very familiar with, and DOC seems to distance me from my emotions to a much greater degree. With DOM, at least so far, I feel exactly like myself, but like a version of myself that is mentally stimulated and beginning to see things sparkle.",
      "2:30 - Very light nausea begins, but I'm still feeling very good. Physical stimulation has increased, but it's a unique stimulation. Generally on amphetamine compounds, including DOC, I get some sweaty palms and feet and other minor signs of physical overstimulation. On amphetamine itself, I feel grossly overstimulated most of the time. This stimulation, however, is extraordinarily clean, giving me lots of energy but without any anxiety or outward signs of stimulation. I feel light and happy and curious about what's to come.",
      "3:06 - I threw up in a sudden rapid increase in nausea, feeling fine now. Very acidic stomach contents. Immediately after throwing up I got in bed to lay down with L for a while and allow the rest of this drug to come on. At this point, the effects have snuck deep into my mind. This drug is extremely clean which makes it somewhat hard to describe on the body, at least at this dose. I felt sober and lucid until all of a sudden I'd realize I was lost in fantasy with no idea what had been going on. I had no ability to focus on anything for very long without losing myself in something barely related or totally off-topic. After throwing up, the effects came on quite strongly, and I felt a sensation that most psychedelics do not cause anymore for me. it's a sensation I associate with real mental psychedelic power. It's like a repeating pattern of suddenly finding myself overwhelmed, which compels me to close my eyes and roll them back a bit, and it's almost like I phased out for a second. The sensation of euphoria from my solar plexus was extremely high, leaving me feeling really good. Waves of pleasure flowed strongly over my body. I laid in bed writhing pleasantly and drifting continually further and further into fantasy.",
      "Each time I phased back into reality from the inexplicable world of fantasy I was entering, I became aware that I was starting to drift off really far, much farther than the apparent strength of the drug should have allowed. I felt my mindstate getting deeper and deeper. Every time I closed my eyes, the darkness would begin to arrange itself, gain color, fractallize, and eventually turn into the sorroundings of an entirely different frame of reference. With eyes open, all I could see was a light sparkle and minor shifting of small patterns.",
      "At some point, I fell into a dream. It was just like falling into fantasy as I had been doing for a while as described above, except that I was aware I had actually just fallen asleep. This means my dream was lucid, something that has only happened one other time to me in my life. As I entered the dream I opened my eyes (in my dream) and my bedroom around me began to turn blue and purple. The walls began to fractallize and expand slowly outward until I was no longer in a room at all, but outside on the streets of a big city. This city looked like New York more than anything, but slightly futuristic. I had a few minutes to marvel at the landscape and the fact that I knew I was dreaming. I was tripping very hard but very easily in the dream, on DOM. The feeling of the drug was exactly the same only its intensity level was heightened hugely. The world around me was twisting apart into fractals and bright colors. Impossible events of chance were happening all around me. An air of importance hung in the air. I had a sense that what I was experiencing was being told to me by a presence which felt to me like some sort of warm and patronly figure telling a bedtime story to his grandchild. Again I must stress the incredible vividness and lucidity of this dream. I experienced each moment while realizing I was in a dream. I could see, hear, feel, and taste what was happening around me, and feel the trip very strongly.",
      "I began to notice that everyone else walking around the streets going about their day had started to notice as well. I felt as if my trip was creeping into each of them. I became aware of their alarm and some fear, and mainly a strong nervousness at the apparent falling apart of reality, which had so far not progressed far. Suddenly I became a man who was walking by.",
      "Abruptly I was no longer aware that I was a guy named Xorkoth dreaming a strangely vivid dream. I was a guy whose name I can no longer remember, and I was a businessman. My mind was preoccupied with the desire to hurry up and be on time, and make that money. I was completely consumed by it and had been for years. It was the most important part of my life. It was my life.",
      "Then I looked up when I began to feel a strange glowing in my solar plexus and an inexplicable stimulation. I noticed the world around me rippling and bending, exploding into detailed fractals. I began to feel nervous. I had tried LSD once when I was younger, I didn't like it because I felt out of control. Was I having a flashback? Quickly now, the deconstruction of the world around me progressed. I began to get more nervous - I had absolutely NO idea what was happening! I realized that everyone around me was experiencing the same thing.",
      "Suddenly, my frame of view appeared as a window on a computer would, like a maximized Internet Explorer window without the frame and controls and so forth (which is what makes it look like a window, but somehow a computer window is what I am reminded of). Everything stopped as if the computer had frozen and a window popped up that said 'critical error - the joke is up!' Then my frame of view cracked and split, revealing an impossibly detailed mass of moving fractals behind it. The world began to disappear completely. As it was doing so, I simultaneously became extremely frightened. I went through a very traumatic process where I alternated between denial and realization about what was happening. I began to slowly accept that the world was over. Awareness from beyond my ego began to slowly leak in as everything dissolved. I realized that I had been fooled this whole time, that my actual state of being was not as some silly preoccupied businessman. I hadn't felt this way since I was a child. But the intensity was so frightening and I was still halfway in my ego. The terror grew and grew until I was rocking back and forth, totally consumed by terror. This was my death, this was it, it's all over... As I faded out completely I began to hear frantic meows, and I felt a thought, at first belonging to a host of ambiguous figures from behind the scenes and then from my own mind, of amusement at some cosmic joke, which we had reached the culmination of, the punch line so to speak...",
      "4:53 - The meows continued, stronger and stronger, and I suddenly realized again that I was dreaming and that I had begun this somewhere else entirely. I began to feel a fuzziness pushing on my chest and face. In the endless field of fractals, I saw a large cat's shadow form. Then I slowly became aware of my bedroom. The walls materialized from the fractals and grew back together in proportion. I became aware that my kitty Magnolia was frantically meowing at me and pawing increasingly hard at my chest while nuzzling her head very hard into my cheek. As I woke up she was staring straight into my eyes and looked very concerned. I gathered my bearings as the fractals still playing on my newly coalesced walls faded into the substance of the walls and the room regained normality. As I emerged I felt a deep sense of awe and a nagging feeling of importance which transformed the energy of terror and the realization of mortality back into a euphoric glowing force. My cat calmed down and I got up to go sit at my computer and begin typing notes about my dream before I forgot it. My cat came in right after me and spent the rest of the night sitting on my lap being very affectionate.",
      "Surpringly, the effects of the psychedelic amphetamine seemed already much down from the peak, at just a little over T+4:00. In fact, the effects were never that strong until I laid down with my eyes closed. I still felt the euphoric stimulation and occasionally the intense eye-closing sensation described at the beginning of this report, but other than that, I felt pretty sober, definitely down. I would have preferred to have still been peaking, but I still enjoyed the rest of my night greatly. The DOM remained in my brain, helping me to enjoy some really great music and bringing me a lot of pleasure, but otherwise remaining pretty transparent.",
      "6:45 - I decided to go to bed and fell asleep pretty quickly and comfortably, which is a testament to how incredibly gentle this substance was to me. I woke up at 8:00am with L (after only about an hour of sleep) and we proceeded to have a very nice day, one which was slightly colored by the long plateau of DOM. It was a very pleasant day.",
      "I'm left wondering what the hell that dream was. It was like no other dream I've ever had. It was deep, powerful, totally lucid, and gave me a sense of light forboding. It felt important. Two days later, it's still lingering in my mind. I will hold off on speculation, and I look forward to having a full experience with DOM. Next time I will be taking 15mg, and then I should be able to see just how far this one can go.",
      "DOM seems to be a fantastic substance, transparent but very powerful at the same time. It feels very archetypal, like DOC, only more subtle and with a greater capacity for sneaking you into very far-out situations. It was very pleasurable, but during that dream the terror I felt was very real and isn't something I will soon forgot. As a person who had no experience with psychedelics (the businessman), I witnessed the breakdown of reality and the ascension out of the ego, and as we all know, that can be a terrifying experience, especially when it happens stone cold sober in the middle of the day (which was the case for the businessman I briefly was).",
      "I'm very intrigued to continue exploration with this one ..."

      "In the few years I've been exploring psychoactives, I've had a number of disparate chemical experiences. I usually do not write experience reports unless I think it was an extremely special experience for one reason or another. This is one of those, possibly my second strongest mushroom trip ever.",
      "I am a daily marijuana and tobacco smoker, and I also drink with some regularity, although not nearly as much as many of my fellow college students. Prior to this, I had been tripping once every week or two on 2C-I for about two months. Although I have lots of previous mushroom experience, I had not taken any for quite some time, except for one small dose which I'll write about below.",
      "A while before (a month or so? I don't know for certain) a friend of mine, who I had introduced to acid, asked me to get some shrooms for him. I obliged, picking up approximately 7.1g for him, myself, and possibly one or two other friends. For some reason, he asked me to hang on to them. I thought it odd, but did it anyways, tossing the bag on my glove box and forgetting about it. After being impossible to get ahold of, by friend called me up and told me he didn't want them, wanted to trade for weed instead, which set off a whole other load of bullshit that I won't get into here, but basically resulted in him not being welcome around our group of friends anymore.",
      "About a week prior to the mushroom trip, I had taken my usual 20mg of 2C-I and went tripping. At the tail end, I drank a couple of beers, and decided to pull out the shrooms. I grabbed two caps, estimated to be about a gram each, and ate them. After that I drank another couple beers. By coincidence, the university library was set on fire that night, so I went to watch the fire trucks and billowing smoke with a couple buddies. While there, I noticed a huge body load. Now, body loads on mushrooms for me are quite common. I will constantly have one of my knees give out from under me if I'm standing still, and I'll be unable to keep my balance while walking, and list slightly from side to side, almost like I'm drunk. But this was different. By the time I made it back to my dorm room, I almost couldn't move. I landed on my bed and fell asleep immediately. I chalked the physical weakness up to an odd combination of substances.",
      "So the next week (week before finals) I was bored. Everyone else was studying, but because I started at spring semester, I had a bunch of easy classes that didn't require much if any studying. Might as well shroom, I thought. Borrowing a friends scale, I measured to see how much I had left. With bag, it was 4.7g, which means I had about 3.5g of shroomage. Since I had also given a cap to my tripping partner the last week, I was left with mostly stems, some dust, and one tiny pinner shroom where the cap was still wrapped around the stem. I got some OJ, and started munching.",
      "Kinda. The smell was so bad that I couldn't bear the thought of tasting them, which is slightly unusual for me. I usually have no problems with either the smell or taste, but these smelled so much, it was unbearable. So I broke all the stems up into bite size pieces, then repeatedly filled my mouth with OJ, dropped in a piece or two, then worried them with my tongue until the fell apart enough to swallow. The first time I tried this, I almost choked on the stem section, but after that it was smooth sailing. After about half the bag, something told me to stop, so I did. I decided to eat the rest when I started feeling something. This was between about 6:30 and 6:40.",
      "At about 7:30, I smoked a bowl and decided that what I was feeling was indeed the shrooms, and not a placebo. I proceeded to eat the rest of the bag in the same fashion as above. I put on some South Park, the episode where the kids drink cough syrup and trip out. I have never been so effected by the sounds and visuals presented during the tripping segment before. Either those guys have some experience with DXM, or they did damn good research. Between 7:30 and 8:15, I felt my brain getting increasingly static filled and confusing, and at the same time, I felt physically weaker and weaker.",
      "I looked up at a lithograph my mom had done in college. Already an extremely psychedelic print, it was twisting and waving like mad. I had partially convinced myself this was going to be a light trip, even when I was feeling the effects so strongly, because the bag was mostly stems. I couldn't deny that this was going to be a mega trip any more.I decided to try and lie down. With a great deal of effort, I switched off the ceiling light, leaving only my computer screen and desk lamp on, and crawled onto my bed.",
      "In my memory, the change was sudden, but I don't know for certain if it was. I do know that the realization was sudden, things seemed clear. Simple. Fresh. Clean. My bed was made for the first time since I moved into the dorms, on a whim, and I was lying on top of the quilt with a fleece blanket covering my legs, and I felt wonderful. I am normally a tense person, muscle wise. I don't relax very well. On top of that, I have a high natural tolerance for opiates and muscle relaxers, so I have to constantly stretch and try to stay loose. But on these shrooms, I was totally relaxed, like my muscles had turned to butter. It took unbelievable effort to move any part of my body.",
      "I lay there, listening to South Park in the background, and watching the ceiling bulge and ripple, almost as if it were made of rubber and a whole bunch of dog or cat sized animals were walking on top of it, except it was much smoother. Very liquid seeming. Light geometric patterns, arcs and lines with equallly spaced hashes across them. In my mind they were measuring tics, although I don't know what they were measuring.  The tics would fly across my vision (think of the tie and the refreshments at the picnic in the beginning of A Beautiful Mind). CEV's, not something I normally get, were made of complex spinning fractals. And I felt peace.",
      "Very little emotion, just calm serenity. Contenedness. I have often though that the state of being content was much better than being happy. Happiness is temporary and relative, and is always followed by sadness or anger or despair of some form. Being content, on the other hand, does not set you up for a fall, because it does not aspire to great heights. My belief was fully reinforced by my trip.",
      "I lay in bed till about 10:45 at which point I felt strong enough to go to the bathroom and then sit back in my chair and watch more South Park. I realized the my skin felt funny, puffy and spongy, like those animals that I and maybe you got as kids, where you would put them in water, and they would grow to many times their original size. In the process, the material they were made out of would get slimy and soft, and had a very odd and unique texture. The fact that my skin now held this texture delighted me completely. I started licking and biting my skin to see how it felt. Which was weird. It's impossible for me to fully describe how it felt, but it was somewhat akin to a mild electrical shock. I smoked some more weed, and lay down again. The rest of the night was spent alternating between hits of weed, swallows of juice, these delicious cookies I bought, and the bathroom. I fell asleep around midnight and woke up the next day feeling fine.",
      "Conclusion: Wow. I had forgotten how strong mushrooms could be. I've never had mushrooms like those before though. Usually I will either be chilled out, like I'm super stoned, or hyper and weird, and often I'll switch between these states in the course of one trip. But this is the first time I felt like that, so completely serene and peaceful. If I can find more of these, I'm buying a half ounce."

    "report": [
      "I've tripped on 2C-I maybe 15 times in total. It was the first psychedelic I truly tripped off of. I had taken a small amount of mushrooms previously, but only gotten a body high. And it has remained my favorite, mostly because of its amiability to almost any situation. However, sometimes I can still be surprised by its power and intensity. This is a report of one such situation. If you're interested in a real pseudo-scientific account with all effects and times noted, this isn't it. There is lots of info on the effects of 2C-I in a quantitative sense. This is a qualitative report.",
      "I had acquired 1 gram of 2C-I from an online retailer, and bottled most of it into 20mg capsules. Unfortunately, I only had a scale with accuracy to .01 gram, with a +/- .01, so they could potentially have been as high as 30mg. I have however gotten very good at eyeballing approximate dosages, so I don't think any were off by more than a few milligrams.",
      "Anyways, I was over at my friend M's apartment, where she and her coworker J were hanging out drinking. M started telling J about my 2C-I, since she had done it previously and had loved it. J expressed an interest, but only wanted to do it if we would trip with him. Well, I was down.",
      "I pulled out my pill bottle and poured out the capsules, selecting the capsule that looked the fullest, and one from out of the middle of the pack. M wanted to snort a little bit rather than full-out trip, so I used a flathead screwdriver to pull about 5-7mg from the larger capsule, and held it up to her nose. After it disappeared into her nasal passage, I recapped the pill, gave it to J, and we each swallowed our capsule. (Me ~20mg, J ~16mg, M ~6mg)",
      "We hung out for a little bit, smoked a bowl (not J, he gets tested so he doesn't smoke anymore), then M decided she wanted to go across the courtyard to her neighbors apartment. We grabbed a bubbler and some weed and left. Her neighbor's apartment, though exactly the same style, seemed small and dirty by comparison. I did not enjoy hanging out there, though the fact that only one other person joined us in a large 'party bowl' meant I at least got high.",
      "I also started getting my first serious effects, the classic plate tectonics on the walls, groups of bumps or whatever sliding past each other as if floating on something, and a definite awareness of social situations and how ingrained peoples responses can be. After being there for maybe half an hour, I suddenly realized that B had called M a while ago and said he was coming over. I reminded M, and she bounded out the door. Turns out he was just walking up to her door, so the timing was perfect. :-)",
      "After M came back in with B, we smoked a little bit more weed and chilled. M sat down beside me and said she wasn't really feeling it, and she'd kinda like some more. I interpreted this as a request, and after mulling it over in my brain for a while, I handed her a full capsule to take. I assumed that was the end of it. Shortly afterward we went back to M's house.",
      "I crashed onto the couch, assuming this was where the trip was really gonna pick up. M grabbed beers for herself, B, and J, who had been drinking this entire time. After downing those, M jumped up, grabbed J, announced they were going for a walk, and left. This confused the fuck out of me. I could not understand her reasoning, and it pissed me off that she would exclude me. Weren't we tripping together? Wasn't the sole reason I had tripped tonight because J wanted me to trip too? WHAT THE FUCK?!?!",
      "Added to this was the fact that B, although a cool guy most of the time, is also sketchy, weird looking, weird acting, suspicious, and generally not a good trip companion. He kept asking me what I was tripping on. Not the substance, but the elements in the world, which did not to me seem like a valid question. How do I explain it? He had acquired a sketch pad and pencil from somewhere, and was drawing. I watched him for a while, but it seemed to really bug him that I was watching. Art in action, something I love even sober. So I stopped.",
      "At this point, things really got intense. I remember looking at the walls, sighing internally, and thinking '2C-I....the eternal +2' which is a dammed lie. All of a sudden, the walls started melting away, and the floor started growing up in vines along the wall.",
      "I sorta collapsed onto the floor, not all at once, but in a slow slide off the chair onto my knees, in a prayer or meditation position. I was facing the doorway to the kitchen, and one of M's cats was laying down right in the middle of the floor, perfectly framed by the doorway. All of a sudden I was filled with this great love and acceptance. I was ready for anything at that point. I could have died on the spot, and half expected to, and it would not have bugged me in the least. Anything could happen, and it would be OK. It was almost a disappointment when nothing did happen.",
      "The cat moved, and with it so did the feeling of peace. I sat there, waiting for the cat to return so I could feel peaceful again, but when the cat came back and lay down in almost the exact same position, I didn't feel anything. I concentrated, and still nothing. All of a sudden I realized that the cat had nothing to do with the way I was feeling. It was just a coincidence.",
      "I pulled myself back into my chair, and the cat came over to me. I stroked it's head, mentally telling it 'Thank you, you've reminded me that everyone is on their own trip, and that trip has very little to do with me and even less to do with mine.' I meant life trip, not drug-induced trip, although it still applies. I felt sad, but that was OK. That's just the way things are. I stood up and grabbed a glass of water, which felt wonderful to drink.",
      "About this time, M and J burst back in, full of excitement and talk about how wonderful trees are. I encouraged both of them to grab a glass of water, which prompted J to emit some sort of half gurgled rant about how everyone was too cautious, ending in some sort of comment about bloody noses that I didn't catch. I tried to calmly explain that it was just smart, especially since he'd been drinking and was probably dehydrated anyways. M backed me up, telling J that if I said he needed water, he needed water. He grumbled but complied.",
      "I started to settle back, once again anticipating the usual tripping gab session. But it was not to be. After about 15 minutes, B got up to leave, which was fine by me. But right after he left, M grabbed J and left again, this time with no explanation, while I was in the bathroom. So here I was, all alone in someone else's house, and I'm tripping balls. Not a happy situation. I can understand needing to be alone, I can understand needing to be alone with someone else, but I cannot understand leaving a third person, especially with no explanation or warning, and especially alone in a relatively unknown environment. Utterly ridiculous. I almost left right there. Luckily, they were only gone for about 10 minutes this time. Then M announced she was driving both of us home. Confused, I pointed out she was still tripping.",
      "'No I'm not.'",
      "'But you took more 2C-I. Even if you're not right now, you will be soon, and I don't want you driving drunk and tripping.'",
      "'I've only had 3 beers over the night, and I sold the capsule.'",
      "'....What?'",
      " Yeah, for $10.'",
      "'Well....can I get some of that?'",
      "'No.'",
      "And so she drove us home. Well, she drove me home. I actually think she took J back to her house to screw him, and the point of them leaving together in the first place was to make out. As I was getting out of the car, I once again make J promise to drink water. I went to my dorm and looked at the clock. Oh crap. Only about 3.5 hours had passed. I still had a full night ahead of me.",
      "I decided to best thing to do would be to just crawl into bed, hopefully fall asleep early. But all I did for the next three hours was get more and more worked up about how M had treated me. I'd had a crush on her since I met her, and I knew she liked me too, so I could just not fathom her acting the way she did. I could have used the $10, or even $5. She has a job. And I had given it to her. GIVEN it to HER. So that SHE could trip with US. Being forced to deal with situations and people I didn't want to on what was supposed to be an easy fun night really pissed me off. I could not believe her. I started coming up with all sorts of different scenarios in my head of me going to ask her for the money and her refusing, giving me license to fucking rage at her for a while, really tell the bitch off.",
      "At about T+6 or so I finally fell asleep.",
      "The next day I asked M for my money, and she gave it to me without comment. But I learned several valuable things about her that night that made me stop liking her. And I also learned that if I trip with other people, I better be damned sure about them and their commitment to me and the trip and the vibe. Also, the trip helped me come to the conclusion that you cannot really depend on anything, as much as you'd like to, and as much as maybe you'd like other people or things to depend on you. Shit happens."

      "This will be a pretty brief report, but it was abnormal and interesting so I will relay my experience nonetheless.",
      "For the sake of completion, I should mention that two days ago, I ingested a combination of 2C-T-21 and 2C-C. I don't feel this had anything to do with my experience, but I thought I'd mention it.",
      "At 7:00pm, I ingested 9 grams of kratom after not having had it for longer than usual. I took it not out of a mental craving but because minor withdrawal was starting to creep in and I'm currently weaning myself off, primarily to save money so I'm not poor for the rest of my life. Anyway, the kratom hit me much harder and with greater euphoria than it has in a long time, another perk to cutting way back. I settled down with my girlfriend to watch some TV. As it happens, I was watching a Roseanne marathon (again).",
      "At about 9:00, or T+2:00, I decided to smoke some cannabis. I had smoked it once earlier that day, around 6:30, but it had mostly worn off. The kratom was still in effect but no longer at peak. I took three vaporizer pulls as well as shared a bowl with my girlfriend, in rapid succession. Both devices had a mixture of very high quality White Widow and L.S.D. (a very good newish strain by BOG seeds) in them, and the bowl additionally had a thin layer of pure kief on top. I hit the vaporizer first, and after finishing the bowl next, I laid back and continued to watch TV.",
      "I noticed that I was becoming extremely high, moreso than usual. I find that kratom adds a very good element to marijuana. The combination of the two can be pretty psychedelic. Kratom primarily enhances the physical buzz of cannabis by making me more able to feel my field of energy. Cannabis on its own causes this effect moreso than almost anything else I've used, which is in my opinion why it is so synergistic with psychedelics and almost any other drug. It is a very physically psychedelic substance, even after I become used to it and the mental elements become routine. With kratom added, it feels as if waves of electrical energy are running up and down my body and leaping outward, forming loops which reconnect with my body elsewhere. The patterns of energy roughly form the visual of a group of closed rings of energy that sprout from my body randomly and reconnect somewhere else, surrounding me in a sort of cocoon.",
      "Anyway, I felt so good and psychedelic that I closed my eyes for a bit, as doing so, I've found, can dramatically increase the physical and mental aspects of any high by dissociating me from my surroundings and focusing me entirely upon the aspects of my high. This time was more dramatic than it has ever been without being in a partial sleep state.",
      "I quickly dissociated from where I really was. The body high grew and grew exponentially until it felt nearly salvia-like, with points of great gravity or pressure running around my body, especially my legs - down, down, down, light speed, even faster. I gradually lost awareness of the sounds of the TV and began to realize I was somewhere else. At this point I was unaware I had taken any drugs, but wide awake. I was still aware I was laying down. I began to feel a great pressure on my chest, and I began struggling to breathe. It felt like my throat was extremely narrow and I had to force air to pass through it into my lungs. I was slightly alarmed but I was able to continue breathing so I rode it out. And besides, this was my reality at the moment and I felt I had no choice.",
      "I knew I was me, but I didn't know who 'me' was other than this nexus of perceptions I was experiencing. I became aware of some sort of entity that was communicating with me. I can't remember what was being communicated anymore, although I was very aware at the time and right after I regained awareness of my surroundings. It felt very important though. We were in disagreement but the entity was clearly a figure of authority of some sort. My feeling was one of wariness and sheepish acceptance of what the entity was saying. I was not able to actually physically see anything during this experience, as I had my eyes closed, but nevertheless I was able to perceive information about where I was. I was in some sort of room, laying down on my back (in reality I was on my side). I was unable to move but was fully conscious and awake. I felt no fear but the experience was not really enjoyable either. It felt very serious and slightly alarming due to the difficulty in breathing effectively.",
      "After some communication and some other significant events that I cannot recall anymore, I felt as if I was receiving energy from somewhere. My body felt charged and was buzzing extremely strongly, to the point of producing a soundless but still very loud 'noise'. I was buzzing so hard it tickled, and at that point I became aware once again that I was laying down with my eyes closed, and that I was this guy named Xorkoth and so forth. I opened my eyes and immediately I was totally out of the state I had been in. I looked at the clock and realized I'd only been away for about a minute. Subjectively it felt longer, but only maybe about 10 minutes long, not an eternity or anything. I immediately told my girlfriend about it in more detail than I was able to here, since I had more of it in my memory then.",
      "The experience was very odd and similar to another experience I had with kratom and weed a while back, where I was repeatedly thrown into lucid dreams that were indistinguishable from reality in every way, where I was embedded 3 to 4 layers deep in those dreams. I then woke up and had sleep paralysis for several minutes where I couldn't move at all and found it very hard to breathe. This experience was similar, but it was a total removal of consensual reality into a very psychedelic state, whereas the previous experience was just like reality, only it wasn't. The difficulty breathing was identical, but it seemed to be a perceived difficulty in breathing rather than an actual one, because in both cases, the instant I snapped out, I was able to breathe normally.",
      "The speed and total removal of the state really took me by surprise. It reaffirms to me the psychedelic power of marijuana, when used properly. If one wills themselves into altered states with it, it's possible to have some pretty profound experiences with it, even when you use it every day like I do.",
      "When I get home later today I'll ask my girlfriend what I said to her about it right afterwards, and perhaps she'll be able to refresh me somewhat. If that's the case, I'll add to this.",
      "Just wanted to share because I found it interesting. Has anyone else had any experiences like this?"

    "report": [
      "I'd consider myself pretty experienced in the world of psychedelics, especially with LSD. I'd done mushrooms a couple times before, never with any problems. So on Thanksgiving my friend and I decided to get a quarter of shrooms and split it between the two of us. We ended up getting a little over a quarter, and split it between three people, the two of us ate an eighth and we gave my girlfriend at the time a couple stems & caps.",
      "I was in a great mindset all day, it had been months since I've tripped on anything and I was really looking forward to a good shroom trip--and of course, I had one. About a half hour after I ate them I started feeling really anxious and slightly disconnected from reality. My body wouldn't stop vibrating and all my limbs were going crazy (they wouldn't stop twitching). After about 10 minutes of this my girlfriend and I left go go pick something up from our friends house a block away. It was a relief to get outside, as soon as we started walking the anxiety turned into euphoria and I couldn't stop laughing. Everything looked as if it were a cartoon. The ground was wavering and trees were twisting and bending towards me. I could tell my girlfriend was  enjoying it too, because everywhere she looked she'd start cracking up.",
      "Once we got back to the house we put on the movie Tommy (the Who). I knew it was a really trippy movie and I wanted to watch it, but my mind was fixed on the wall behind the TV. The wall had so much depth and it looked fake, and from each of the four corners of the wall, going into the center, were ripples. Then they started changing colors. I remember people were trying to talk to me and I just felt that words weren't important. What was the point of talking? I just wanted to think, and watch. I felt so good, everything felt so peaceful and geometric patterns were crawling all over the walls.",
      "I zoned out like this for well over an hour, so I was about 3 hours into my trip. Then slowly I could feel myself come back to reality. I felt extremely uncomfortable, anxious, and nauseated. My mouth was really dry and heavy but drinking anything made my stomach more upset. The visuals were completely gone, no wavering effects, colors, patterns, etc. I wasn't even seeing trails anymore! But my girlfriend and my friend were both still coming up, and that's when I felt that something must be really wrong. I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, my skin was extremely pale and my pupils weren't even dilated anymore--in fact, they were smaller than they are when I'm not trippin. Then the nausea and the heaviness in my mouth got so overwhelming that I threw up. Then I threw up a couple more times and figured I'd start feeling better so I didn't tell anyone. But every 5 minutes I found myself going to the bathroom to throw up.",
      "I tried smoking weed but it just increased my anxiety. I couldn't smoke a cigarette because it made me throw up again. 4 hours of this passed and I called my mom to pick me up. While waiting for her to arrive my stomach started hurting so bad that I couldn't breathe and I had to sit on my knees with my face in the ground to help ease the pain. My mom assumed I had the stomach flu, but I knew something was wrong---I just couldn't stop throwing up even though there was nothing to throw up and my stomach felt like somebody was pushing it with a huge rock until the rock broke through everything straight through to the back. And I knew the shrooms weren't bad because for one, they looked very fresh, and also because neither of my friends got sick from them.",
      "I continued throwing up for two more hours or so, and the pain in my stomach just got worse. My mom took me to the hospital, and I had to be pushed in a wheel chair because I couldn't walk. While I was waiting to get signed in I fell forward in the wheelchair (I couldn't figure out what was going on, I just knew my stomach hurt and the only way to help it was to lean forward). They immediately took me back to a room and gave me injections of morphine and some anti-nausea medication. All my veins were collapsed from dehydration and bloodwork showed that I had unusually high levels of white blood cells (700 or so, it  should be 300). The next thing I knew I was being transported to another hospital, where I ended up staying for 5 days. I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and they are still clueless as to why I came down with it, and I assumed it was unrelated to the shrooms and never brought them up.",
      "So about two weeks after I got out, I stupidly ate more shrooms, but only about a gram and a half. They were the same ones as before, only much more blue. And then it happened again. Three hours after I ate them I started throwing up. Except this time I was outside waiting for a bus. It was snowing out and I was on the other side of town, and my car was in Parma with my sister so my mom couldn't come pick me up. So I was pretty much walking down the street throwing up and moaning from pain. I actually fell to the ground, and just like before I sat on my knees and put my face into the ice. I lay there for at least 45 minutes and then continued to walk again. I had to go to a Giant Eagle and have a cop call the rescue squad to take me to the hospital. This time my white blood cell count was at 2600 and once again I went to the hospital for almost a week. I'd really like to know why shrooms would do this to me. Everyone seems to be just as clueless as I am. But the pain the shrooms have caused me doesn't stop there.",
      "The second time being in the hospital was too much. When I tried falling asleep I heard a voice tell me to get out of the room, causing me to jump up out of bed in a state of panic like nothing I've ever felt before. My thoughts were so disconnected and I felt like I was going crazy. My heart was pounding, I was sweaty and I couldn't stop shaking. Then I started hyperventilating. I thought I was dying, I knew that I was dying. My heart was going to stop and I could feel it. And of course, this is a panic attack at its worse and it was even worse than when I had my first bad acid trip & thought I was having a heart attack.",
      "Ever since that night I get panic attacks all the time, sometimes they aren't full blown, and I'm stuck in this anxious state where I feel like I'm just going crazy and my brain won't stop talking. Often within an hour of feeling this way I go into a full-blown attack and then it eases off. I don't know if this is all from the shrooms, because while in the hospital the first time I found out I had polycystic kidney disease and the second time, when I heard the voices, they thought I had cancer (I don't). I haven't heard voices like that since but the panic just won't go away. I'm never, ever touching shrooms again--just thinking about them, they're smell and taste, it makes me sick. And they've left me in this horrible state of mind I can't seem to get out of.",
      "**Sorry if words are mispelled or whatever, I don't feel like going back through this and correcting everything."

      "Yesterday my order of 1g Methylone finally arrived. Yippy!",
      "Not having a milligram scale, I eyed out what I thought was 150-250mg and dissolved it in Powerade. Taste was nearly unnoticeable, slightly bitter but in no way foul.",
      "T+30m: Nothing yet. Mild stimulation (placebo?), excessive yawning.",
      "T+45m: Still waiting. Check email, read message from my mother. I feel the urge to communicate with someone so I call her.",
      "T+50m: As I talk to my mother waves of euphoria work their way from my neck to my feet, causing my hair to stand on end. The high feels peculiarly similar to that of cocaine (better?) but I'm not complaining. Each wave lasts 30 seconds to 1 minute, followed by an equally long period of dysphoric anxiety. Cycle repeats itself over the next 15 minutes.",
      "T+1h5m: All euphoria now. The 'wave' effect has turned into a steady peak with no feelings of anxiety. Emotional barriers lessened (non-existent?). We discuss past issues, childhood problems, current drama, conversation is flowing quite well. We discuss and work through things that I've never had the nerve to talk about before.",
      "T+1h30m: Euphoria still present, still on the phone with Mother. Short-term memory starts to fail. Much effort is needed to talk intelligibly -- I repeatedly lose my train of thought while talking, leading to akward silences. I don't want Mother to suspect I'm on drugs.",
      "T+1h45m: Wrap up conversation with Mother. Break out the Methylone for a re-dose.",
      "T+1h50m: Approximately same dosage (150-250mg) added to a cup of Powerade. I chug the solution, leaving a little in the bottom as a booster for later on.",
      "T+2h15m: Euphoria present, but starting a steady decline. Stong stimulation overpowers the euphoria. Heart rate 100+ bpm.",
      "T+2h30m: Some euphoria, mostly stimulation. In an effort to regain the wonderful feeling I had while talking to Mother, I re-dose again.",
      "T+2h35m: Add approximately 100-150mg of Methylone to remaining Powerade and take it in one gulp. Taste is not an issue.",
      "T+2h45m: Very bad jitters. Legs shaking, arms shaking, yawning continuously. There is still a certain 'euphoria'. Enough of one that constantly has me debating whether or not I should re-dose.",
      "T+3h: Spend some time browsing the net and doing miscellaneous tasks. Very, very stimulated. Much like the effect of Adderall, without the edginess.",
      "T+3h30m: Re-dose yet again. Baggy of Methylone is starting to look depleted.",
      "T+4h: I discover re-dosing replenishes euphoria for a brief period of time, but it is rapidly replaced by overwhelming stimulation. Each re-dose potentiates the stimulatory effect while degrading the euphoria.",
      "T+5h: Compulsively begin researching and reading anything that has to do with Methylone. I find a report where a user injected 1g over the period of a day. What the hell, only 1/3 of a baggy left, why not?",
      "T+5h30m: Eat a hamburger and chips. Goes down surprisingly easily considering how stimulated I am. No nausea, no unpleasant side-effects from eating. Actually quite enjoyable. Sweets seem like they'd hit the spot.",
      "T+6h: Finish eating, re-dose again. Baggy of Methylone is almost gone. I estimate there are 2-3 doses left.",
      "T+6h30m: Overstimulated. Checking my pulse every few minutes. My heart feels like it weighs 20 pounds. I feel it beating in my forehead. Nagging euphoria still present. Totally different from euphoria achieved at first dose. Comparable to methamphetamine.",
      "T+7h: Heart rate slows down a little, so I decide to re-dose. Only one dose left. This sucks!",
      "T+7h30m: Time moving very fast. It's getting late. I scramble to find some downers. There are none to be found. I've committed now I must follow through. Looks like I won't be getting any sleep tonight!",
      "T+7h45m: Empty rest of baggy (~150mg) into glass of Powerade as I've been doing all day. It's become a ritual by now. Gosh, this morning seems like so far away. This drug has a slightly psychedelic edge to it. Definite closed-eyed visuals though I don't pay much attention to them.",
      "T+8h: Not much more stimulated than I was at T+6h30m. I get one comforting wave of euphoria from the last dose, and slip back into the anxious, crackhead-like headspace I've created for myself. Is 1000mg too much?",
      "T+9h: Spent the last hour researching Methylone. Perhaps I should have done this BEFORE dosing (hint). Only a few reports of dosages higher than 500mg.",
      "T+10h: I think I've learned everything I can about Methylone. My paranoia of overdosing is replaced by restlessness as I realize even at this high a dose Methylone is relatively safe.",
      "T+10h15m: Considering going to bed, but I know I won't be able to sleep. Bleh. Already starting to feel some kind of a comedown. Perhaps it is the realization I have no more Methylone that is causing me grief.",
      "T+10h30m: Write an e-mail to Mother telling her how much I appreciated the conversation we had. Several dormant issues were worked through, and I truely feel closer to her now.",
      "T+10h40m -: I'm in a tweakers mindset. I lie down to sleep. I spend the next 7 or 8 hours rolling around in bed trying to lull myself away. At some points it felt as though I was right on the verge of sleep, but I never quite made it there. Not a surprise at all considering the dose.",
      "The next morning I noticed some marked anti-depressant qualities. I was lethargic from lack of sleep, but as the day progressed I was back in a semi-normal headspace with an extra kick of confidence to boot. Marked cockiness and sociability, even while being awake for 24+ hours.",
      "I experienced no major side effects from this large dose except a slight case of HPPD. Toward the end of the day I had opaque swirling black dots in the center of my vision in each eye. I attribute this to sitting in front of the computer for 10 hours while tripping, pupils dilated the whole time. Or possibly a side effect of sleep depravation. It's already starting to go away. No biggy.",
      "Be careful with Methylone. It's very addictive and can get the best of you if you're not careful. I'm lucky I only had 1g my first time, or I may had overdosed. Also note I took 2 10mg Prozacs and a 300mg Wellbutrin XR prior to ingesting the Methylone.",
      "It's a good drug, and legal. Can't ask for much better! Stick with small doses. Larger doses are enjoyable but lead to diminished euphoria."

      "My evening started off after a long day. I have high tollerances to almost all pharms, so even high doses have little effect on me. Please note I am including the pharms I took earlier in the day to provide setting, this report is about the codeine and clonazepam. Below is the chronology in which I dosed the pharms:",
      "1500 (3:00) 20mg Hydrocodone / 650 APAP (2 Norco 10/325)",
      " - This didn't do much for me except a little mood lift and relieve my pain",
      "1630 (4:30) 200mg Codeine Phosphate. I took this as a pick me up and an adjunct to the Norco because I recently broke my ankle two days ago.",
      "Several hours pass",
      "2200 (10:00) 10mg Alprazolam (yes, 10mg Xanax). This is WAY more than medically recommended but I have a substantial tollerance. I was looking for a come down from the day to wind down. In addition to the Alprazolam, I took 4mg Clonazepam, 100mg Oxazepam, and 20mg Diazepam.",
      "I am a medical professional and have the means in my household to estabish an IV drip of D5LR with Flumazenil (Benzodiazepine antagonist) which works on a 'dead-man's-switch.' That means if I lose consciousness and stop clamping the drip, the flumazenil begins to self administer to reverse the benzos in rapid fashion. This is still very dangerous, but safer than no safeguard at all.",
      "After becoming relaxed, I did some work on my computer for several hours until about midnight. At this time, I got the idea to give a try at insufflating Codeine and Clonazepam. I split some of my meds, and crushed them with my mortar/pestle to a fine powder. Below is the result...",
      "I decided to make two lines of both powders (12.5 codeine and 0.5 clonazepam). The first line of each I insufflated on their own. This was the first time I had ever insufflated anything, and to my surprised it didn't burn nearly as bad as expected. With the remaining two lines (one of each med) I combined them, and drew them in as a single line. The experience that followed amazed me, even given the fact I daily take upwards of 600mg codeine, 50mg hydrocodone, and 8mg xanax (or 6mg clonazepam).",
      "About 10 minutes after insufflation, I noticed a high or buzz much like that I remember when I was being sedated before dental surgery. It was very pleasant, and I felt very relaxed. The benzo (clonazepam) created a very creative and almost 'giddy' type of reaction similar to most other benzodiazepines, except this time at a much lower dose and on a much more enjoyable level (especially considering my tollerance). The codeine gave me the classic opioid rush that I expected, but oddly even though it was a very rapid onset compared to oral dosing, it was much softer (ie I didn't get an agitated or anxious buzz like I sometimes do from high doses of opioids). I suspect this was due to the concomitant administration of the benzo (clonazepam) which took the negative (bad part) of the codeine edge off, which potentiating the rest of the rush. The codeine seemed to have a similar effect on the clonazepam as well, in that my uplifted mood and energeticness that I often get after opioids prevented the clonazepam from causing any drowsiness or adverse effects.",
      "Overall the experience lasted only about 45 minutes, and the doses involved were low, but I would definately say that regardless of route of exposure, benzos plus opioids are my dual drug of choice (and I am lucky enough to have an almost unlimited supply of both from my physicians due to health issues). I feel insufflation is probably the best way to get the quickest and strongest reaction as I have described above, but as an organic chemist, I am attempting to devise a way to make many of the opioids and benzos soluble in physiological pH solution for injection, which would allow mainlining to be the optimum means of administration."

      "Approximately 10 months ago, I was prescribed Effexor XR for a sudden anxiety problem that developed seemingly overnight. I was 21 at the time. ",
      "As the months went on, my doctors continued to increase my dose from  37.5 mg to 225 mg/day.",
      "My main reason for adding this report is to describe how coming off Effexor has affected my life.",
      "After about 5 months I started to experience severe jaw pain on the left side, which over the next few weeks moved to the right side as well.  I also had night terrors nearly every night for weeks, to the point where I was afraid to sleep.",
      "At this point, and after reading several similar reports online describing similar symptoms relating to Effexor, I decided to slowly wean myself off of it.  My stomach had been upset the entire time I was on Effexor (very very badly), but even more so when I was coming off it. My doctor had warned me that if I wasn't careful coming off of it, I could end up on IV's in the hospital, unable to eat etc. She was taking Effexor as well, so I trusted her.",
      "Eventually it took me a total of probably a month and a half to get to get down to 37.5 and from there I opened up the capsules and lessened the amount each day until I was completely off it. (this was suggested by my doctor as well)",
      "Now the fun part.",
      "Ever since I came off Effexor I've experienced 'brain shivers' 'zaps' whatever you want to call them, constantly (about 15 times a minute, literally).  The feeling is similar to an electric shock that originates in the brain and quickly spreads to the outer limbs, many times it comes in threes and fours.   It also seems to make a zapping noise, or the feeling of hitting my funny bone, but in my brain.  I also lost about 15 pounds.",
      "This has continued, unrelentingly, for more than a month now.",
      "I used consider myself a relatively well adjusted person.  I had great grades, and I attend a very reputable university.  But I have never felt so disconnected from life.  Nothing that used to amuse me does anymore and I have absolutely no desire to finish school.",
      "I cry at the drop of a hat, mostly when I'm by myself.  And it takes only the slightest inconvenience to completely set me off in anger.",
      "I know exactly why it's happening, but it feels like there is nothing I can do to overcome the feelings that Effexor has left me with. ",
      "I'd also like to note an experience that happened to me when I was taking Effexor.",
      "I had some visitors for the weekend, and we decided to go out to the bars and have night on the town.  Around 10 pm, despite having company, I felt so sick that I had to leave the bar and go back to my apartment.  I had about half of my first drink before I left.",
      "From about 11pm until about 7am I vomited uncontrollably, and I couldn't understand why, because I hadn't been drinking.",
      "At about 7:30, I clued into the fact that with all of the hustle and bustle of company arriving in the morning, I'd forgotten to take my Effexor.",
      "I took a gravol to try to alleviate the nausea but quickly threw it up.  ",
      "Eventually I was able to get my Effexor pills down, and lie in bed until everything subsided. This chemical is grossly misunderstood and understudied."

    "report": [
      "I have been  kavahead, pepperhead, kavaholic, whathaveyou for over 2 years now.  I was first introduced to kava kava in a friends dorm room my freshman year in college.  Been hooked ever since.  At least once a month I drink the goo and sail off to Kiribati or Vanuatu without giving a damn anymore.  I'm a philosophy major and a fiction writer hobbyist, my writing is vastly improved by the inclusion of kava kava.  I guess my continued use makes me something of an novice expert, so let me see what I can add to the discussion here.",
      "First, let me dispell the rumours.  No, I have never hallucinated on kava.  I've had some tinnitus (ringing in the ear) and have mistaken sounds and voices, but nothing more.  No, kava will not give me an orgasm just sitting there, it will, however, amplify the effects of a real orgasm (at least in me).  It does not turn me gay, either.  Its effect is somewhat like an aphrodisiac, but don't count on putting someone in the mood with it, they're just as likely to go to sleep.  I do not feel any effects by taking drugstore capsules.  Trust me, I've downed entire bottles of [ ] brand gelcaps and nothing's happened.  I did, however, get high after blenderizing [ ] brand gelcaps in water, but the taste made it not worth it at all.*",
      "And now the health warning: There might be a chance that maybe Kava could possibly cause liver damage.  I myself have never even felt a problem. ",
      "With that in mind, let's make some Kava.  I buy 1-3 ozs of fresh dried root from any health food store or apothecary.  It's also available online.  Now get a clothespin, pair of pantyhose, a covered micro-wave safe container, a pitcher, some filtered water and a 10oz cup.  Start early in the day.  Taking Vitamin C supplements will amplify the effects.  As will human saliva for some ungodly reason, so keep yourself well hydrated in preperation.  This is also important because Kava is a diuretic like alcohol and can make you dehydrated.  If the root is not already pulverized, you can grind it in a coffee grinder for about 5-10 minutes to get it down to managable size.  You'll want the grains of powder to be about the size of Turkish coffee, if not less.  There will always be coarse bits left over, we'll remove them later. ",
      "Now put the kava mush into the microwavable safe container with enough water to completely suspend all of the particles.  mix it up with your hands (oh yeah -- wash them) to get all the caked bits to suspend.  Ttick it in the microwave untill the water boils.  Take it out and 'YICKTH! NEARCHUS, YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT I DRINK THIS, DO YOU?!'* Shut up, put the clothespin on your nose and stir the concoction with a spoon.  Let it cool.  Boil again.  Take it out, put the clothespin back on and stir.  Do this one more time, then just let it cool.  If it's solidifying into goop, add more water.  If you can't, that's okay too.  when it's cool enough to stick your fingers in, get out the (unused) pantyhose, cut off about a foot at the bottom, and stretch the open end over the mouth of the pitcher, allowing the toe to hang down into the pitcher.  Pour that vile gunk in there.  If it's moving slow, you skimped on the water, just get a spoon and scrape.  Tie up the open end of the pantyhose and add about 30-40ozs of water for every onz of kava, less if you can stand it (cackles maniacally). ",
      "Now, portion it out in 10oz cups, any more is a little too much for a drink.  Get your buddies in the room, give everyone a glass.  Clap once if you wanna follow the Polynesian ritual (why not)  And bang that mother down. This is not to be sipped. Drink it in one gulp if possible, shiver violently and immediately chase it with water (anything else will taste bad). Quit yer winin' and pour another glass.  When the root's all done, sit down in your favorite chair, curl up with your favorite lover, or assume your own favorite dreamin' position, it's departure time.  Ignore the urge to fall asleep.  You are now high on Kava, this may last for about 45mins-3hrs, depending on how much you drank.  You can plan on being slightly disoriented for the rest of the night, so DO NOT DRIVE!!!  Treat this stuff like you would alcohol. ",
      "I find this stuff tastes, smells, and feels like shit.  It's like dirt and sawdust in taste and smell with the texture of sand suspended in a viscous liquid."

When I returned about 2 hours later the water had turned bright green and had a familiar scent (i dont know what?).",
      "I then set about drinking the infusion which had a taste of pea pods (as in Pisum sativus).  I had drank half of it so I went to sit in another persons room, I thought that was a waste of time, but when I looked in the mirror my pupils had covered the coloured part of my eyes.  After seeing this I set off to the toilet as I had drank a large amount of water due to feeling dehydrated and having a very dry throat.  When I started down the hall to the toilet I could feel my self being pulled to one side and then the other so I staggered on.",
      "Having noticed that this had not been a total waste of time I finished the bottle.  All this did was increase the feelings I was already having apart from when I looked at my hands they where moving like waves and so was the floor but only when I looked at them, this continued all night until I finally fell asleep at about 4.30 am with some difficulty. The next day my eyes were still unfocused and my head felt strange. It was a very strange experiance but definitely one to be tried. But be carful with the dosage."

      "To start with, it should be mentioned that I find 4-ho-dipt to be far more similar to lsd than to psilocybin. The body feel and visual effects are similar. I found that there was a point at which the dose-effects curve changed and intensity was not effected, just duration. The mark is at about 40mg, higher than that and it just lasts longer. It seems, (at least for me) that the true promise of this substance is bringing out the magic in other substances. I had far more pleasurable effects from combinations than from iprocin alone.",
      "Dose/effects",
      "5mg- This is the level at which effects begin to manifest. I am not able to define the true character of the substance, but stimulation is felt, and laughter is more common than normal. About 3 hours to baseline",
      "8-10mg- Now I am getting into the trip a bit. Mild visuals (mainly trails) are present",
      "and pupils are about 40% dilated. The same physical effects are present, but overshadowed by the mental effects. 3-4 hours of primary effects.",
      "15mg- At this level, the full character of the material is present. Trails, and patterning with eyes open are present. Cevs are still minimal. Pupils about 75% dilated. 4-5 hours of effects",
      "20mg- The Oevs are starting to really manifest. Objects twist and morph in peripheral vision, and Cevs are mostly just dull pastel blue and green geometries. Nothing to detailed yet. Approx. 6 hour duration",
      "30mg- I am in for one hell of a ride at this point. The visual aspect becomes marked, and cevs continue to become more detailed. Oevs are similar to 500-650mcg of lsd.",
      "I will be able to actually have some control over the cev development by just thinking about something I want to see. The physical effects begin to become less pleasant at this dose. There is significant peripheral stimulation.",
      "40mg+ There is no real point in going any father than this with iprocin. It does not alter the trip, just lengthens the duration. The CNS stimulation begins to get very worrisome, and an ominous, dull headache centered near the sinus cavity and frontal lobe is present.  If I dose higher than this, I am just asking for trouble.",
      "The trip itself",
      "Iprocin has a very pleasurable, rolly body buzz. Tactile sensitivity is significantly enhanced, but this gets distracting and unpleasant at higher doses. Mentally, I found myself far more open to emotional content in things around me. TV is very unsatisfactory. I find good music to be essential for a good trip. Bad Religion and Swinging Utters are usually my 1st choices. I find myself quite horny at lower doses. Iprocin is very capable of providing good insight, but this is dose and set/setting dependant. I have to be able to sit back and focus on the trip to make the most of it. Outdoors night trips are superb. Great material for camping.",
      "Combinations",
      "15mg 4-ho-dipt + 5 mg 5-meo-dmt,",
      "The iprocin is not overwhelmed by this dose of 5-meo-dmt. The two mix into some magical, perfect lsd like buzz. After the initial 5-meo-dmt flash, the visuals remain more prominent than before it. This is one of iprocins special synergies.",
      "30mg  2c-c + 10mg 4-ho-dipt,",
      "I found 2c-c and iprocin to go together like yin/yang. The 2c-c provides a nice, calm, mellow trippy buzz, while iprocin provides the visuals and speedy edge. The visuals are marked, but less prominent than with iprocin and 2c-e  or 2c-i. Mentally, it is very euphoric, thought tangents are hard to avoid.  Watching tv is a waste as I don't understand what I'm trying to watch. Going for a hike in the local canyon is the most rewarding thing I can do on this combo.",
      "20mg 4-ho-dipt and 1.5g psilocybin mushrooms,",
      "This combo was taken in preparation for a 4th of july hike into the hills to go watch the fireworks. The substances were ingested in a chocolate concoction prior to leaving the apartment. It was about a 15 minute drive to where we hike in from, and already I was noticing effects. I felt very light on my feet, happy to be outside and far away from sober people. By the time the sun was setting, I was laying on a tarp in the grass, watching the stars shift around in an oval orbit around me. I decided to light some of my own fireworks (bad idea since I live in Colorado and there is a fireworks ban) and was having fun doing it. Roman candles do some interesting things to my vision. Next thing I know, I have a park ranger in a boat pointing his light at me and telling me not to move. Luckily, someone across the lake light off a mortar and the ranger took off, only to find me gone upon returning. That will kill your buzz quick.",
      "400mg dxm and 15mg 4-ho-dipt",
      "I am very fond of using dxm as a preload for psychedelic voyages. The problem with this combo is the significant side effects. Hyperthermia was marked. Temp peaked at 102.9 degrees. There was a vague hot feeling in the back of my skull, I recognized the feeling from a previous encounter with seritonon syndrome. That is not a good sign. The visual and mental aspects were totally overshadowed by the alarming physical effects.",
      "20mg 4-ho-dipt and 2mg alprazolam",
      "I took the cap and a Xanax xr before going fishing on an isolated local lake. The iprocin kept me awake and alert, while the xanax kept me calm and happy. The only bad part was when the Department of Wildlife ranger came to check if I had a valid fishing liscence, as the lake is popular with people lacking them due to its distance from any roads. There were no problems conversing with him and telling him what he needed to know (he was also doing a creel survey to see how many of what species of fish are being taken from the lake). The whole conversation lasted about 15 anxious minutes.",
      "Conclusion",
      "I have many fun memories of iprocin. The only truly bad one I have is from taking 10 mg for a Snoop Dog show, and having my ride arrested for smoking a joint in the venue, leaving me stranded 25 miles from home with no ride. I ended up running into a neighbor and got a lift home from him, but that is a whole other story. If you are interested in something that is very adaptable and having a short duration, it may be worth investigating."

      "On the day in question, tripping was the farthest thing from my mind. I had spent afternoon walleye fishing at a local lake, drank a few beers and smoked a joint while I was out. As the sun was beginning to set, my friend B showed up and wanted to know if I was down to trip. I was in a good mood, so I said sure and we proceeded to leave the lake and decide on the sacrament for the evening. We settled on 4-aco-dipt. I was then informed we did not have a good place to utilize that night, we thought we would have to postpone the activities for another day. That is not how it worked out though. Soon B's friend R called him up and wanted us to go party at his apartment that night. We had somewhere to go.",
      "Me and B drove over to R's apartment only to find several other people there already drinking and smoking some bowls. 3 of the 5 people that were there had to leave, so it was down to me, B, R, and R's friends X and Z.",
      "X and Z had only limited experience with psychedelics, so me and B got the job of explaining what the weird grey powder in the vial was. We told them it was an analog of psilocybin and explained how the effects differed. We chose to start X and Z on 10mg each to see how they felt about the chem without committing to a high dose. B and I, however, are very experienced with the chem in question, so we settled at 35mg each to start with and gave R 25mg as he has a lot of trip time under his belt, but not yet with ipracetyl.",
      "We proceeded to smoke a few bowls while waiting for the effects to manifest. After about 30 mins, me B and R began to have effects becoming apparent. X and Z were still not feeling anything, but they were on a low dose, so this was no big surprise.  X and Z began to drink beer at a very rapid rate, which we had already advised against, and z soon became slightly ill. When Z went to vomit, I became slightly concerned, but he came out of the bathroom feeling better and laughing hysterically. X soon began to get altered also. Once we all had effects present, we decided to smoke some more pot and see where it would take us.",
      "After the bowls, we did the dumbest thing imaginable. We went to the liquor store to go get more beer, and at the spur of the moment, we decided it would be fun to do some off roading in X's 1980 Buick. We decide to go to a local canyon and see what we could find to drive on, over or through. R began to get ill in the car and we had to stop so he could puke (he had taken down about 8 beers at this point) so we returned to his apartment.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "We got back, smoked another bowl, and we were all feeling well again. I decided to take a booster dose to extend my trip, so I took another 20mg of  4-aco-dipt. B decided to follow suit and do the same (B and I were feeling great, no nausea at all). X and Z still had a good buzz going, and decided not to supplement their doses. R opted for another 10mg. While waiting for the booster doses to take effect, I wanted to smoke some low potency (5x) salvia extract. I took the 1st hit, and it instantly increased the intensity of the trip 10x from what it was. I had massive cev's of futuristic landscapes and physically felt very 'compressed' for lack of a better term. As I slowly came out of the salvia experience, R wanted to take a hit of it. We agreed to let him, though only a small amount since he had only smoked it once before this.",
      "I loaded about 100mg of the extract and let him hit it. Immediately he began repeating 'oh, my god, holy shit' as soon as the hit was exhaled. R soon began to lose all contact with reality. He was talking about fucking trees, and the worms that inhabit and control us, and all kinds of weird shit. Luckily, he began to regain coherency rapidly.",
      "By this point, it was like 2am (about T+ 6 hours since the 1st dose) X and Z decided they were going to retire for the night and get some sleep. It was then that I made my mistake. I decided to insufflate a 5mg and take 25 more orally. 4-aco-dipt does not burn, but the drip is VILE.  I was feeling the small-insufflated dose within about 10 mins. I was then beginning to get VERY high, and the 25mg oral had yet to even kick in. It was at this point I knew it was going to get rough. R offered me some valerian and hops tea to try to take the edge off a bit. The tea tasted Terrible (I presume due to the valerian content), but I chugged it any way, as the Physical stimulation was getting uncomfortable. I was still getting higher and beginning to worry a bit. I know that worrying will only make it worse, but I took way too much of an unknown substance, so a bit of concern was to be expected. About 30 minutes after taking the last dose, I began to feel remarkably ill.",
      "I ran to the bathroom, and proceeded to violently vomit for a few minutes (the vomit tasted like bile and feet). After puking, I tried to drink some water and took an electrolyte pill to get re-hydrated. I was beginning to get ill again within a few minutes. B got out the bowl, and we smoked in hopes of settling my stomach. It failed. I was beginning to get surges (like small amounts of electric shock in my stomach) which were quite ominous.",
      "I was now beginning to get very nervous. The surges were increasing in both intensity and frequency, coinciding with my heartbeat. My pulse was 139 bpm and very hard.",
      "I was getting a headache now, and beginning to have minor leg tremors. Shit was really going downhill at this point.",
      "I was again violently nauseas, and had R bring me a bucket, as I was not particularly mobile at this point. I just dry heaved, there was very little to vomit at this point in the night. The surges were turning into more of a stabbing pain synchronous with my pulse and very frightening, and to make things worse, I was still getting alarming leg tremors also. I was beginning to show minor seizures next. My eyes were trying very hard to roll back in my head.  I was getting worse and worse tremors and pains. I am not a religious person, but for the 1st time in years, I felt the need to pray for my survival. B and R were getting noticeably concerned at the symptoms I had. I was really beginning to question the likelihood of me surviving the night. I then had what has been described as a full blown Grand Mal seizure. I lost all connection to the world.",
      "Next thing I know, I am in darkness. Nothing. Pergatory of sorts. I thought I was dead, but soon a faceless voice was telling me to fight, I could beat this. I could survive. I began to come back to reality as I am being hit with ice water to pull me from the seizure.",
      "B and R are quite happy to see me regaining consciencousness. B had his phone on and",
      "was about to dial 911. I soon had them telling me drink this water, dont stand up, stay where you are, etc as they were still concerned about me having more seizures.",
      "The tremors were still present, but the chest pain had subsided. R soon dug around and found me a cyclobenzaprine(20mg) in an attempt to stop the seizures. As we waited to see if the muscle relaxer would take effect, we smoked another bowl. I was beginning to feel a lot better by the time the pill kicked in (which was very fast due to empty stomach).",
      "B and R were very interested in trying to decipher the OBE I had experienced.  We came to the conclusion that I was hearing them and due to the disassociated state, I was unable to tell it was them. I was so happy that the nightmare was ending. I did not touch a psychedelic for 3 or 4 months after that night.",
      "I am thankful to have survived the night. After doing the math the next day, I realized I had taken 85mg of 4-aco-dipt the previous night. The dose I took was WAY too high for this substance. I have several 50mg in a cap experiences with ipracetyl, but none have shown the toxicity this one did. Before that night, I had felt no toxicity from either 4-aco-dipt or 4-ho-dipt.",
      "I flushed my remaining 4-aco-dipt, and got back to my normal life. I was weak for 3 days or so afterword, but just happy to be alive. I feel very lucky, due to the fact that I did every thing I could have wrong, but still came out of it ok. It is amazing how much a near death experience can change your outlook on life. The following week, I started preparations to start my tackle buissness. I wanted to do work I didnt loathe. Life is too short to sit at a job you cant stand every day all day. This showed me what I really wanted to be doing and I took the message to heart."

      "I have been addicted to opiate painkillers for the past year.  It is controlling my life.  I was on the Suboxone program.  For those who are unfamiliar with this program, it's supposed to be a maintenance medication to taper through opiate withdrawals.  It completely takes away withdrawals, but it's a part opiate itself, so I became addicted to that. Enough was enough, I was ready to quit for good.  Today is my 5th day clean.",
      "Yesterday, I was feeling suicidal from the excruciating anxiety that comes from opiate withdrawal.  I then talked to my aunt, who had been addicted to alcohol and morphine and quite them at the same time, she has now been clean 3 years.  But I talked to her for a while and she gave me some Neurontin, she though it would help.  Well she was right, it completely calmed my nerves and took away nearly all of the anxiety.",
      "It's working well so far, and considering it last so long it works so well.  I was able to actually get 5 solid hours of sleep, and I could've slept more but I had to wake up.  Anyone who has experience opiate withdrawals knows that sleep is hard to come by, and we take it for granted when we don't have an addiction to take care of."

      "Individual Information: I'm an 18 y/o male, about 165 lbs, I've experienced a range of drugs including mescaline, cannabis, LSA, and shrooms, but I wanted to start with a low dose because of the reported dissociative affects, and I didn't want to wake anyone with vomit noises etc.",
      "Preparation: I grabbed 3 of the yopo seeds I had and put them in the oven, they popped after maybe 5 minutes. I discarded the shell and ground up the seeds with a spoon, and mixed in some baking soda as a basifier at roughly a 2 part yopo to 1 part baking soda ratio. It would only ground so far so I put the snuff to be in the oven for 7 minutes or so to take away some of the dampness that the seeds caused. Anyway, ground it up a bit more and sift-blended it to a nice tan coloured snuff.",
      "Set and Setting: At night, everyone sleeping, on the couch in the living room, relaxed, bored, watching TV in the dark.",
      "T+0 I grab a dollar bill and insulfate a line containing half the powder (1.5 seeds) off of the coffee table in front of me. Stings like a bastard, but about half so much as kanna. Horrid tasting post nasal drip as others have rightly reported. Immediately I feel a bit more sensitive to the TV light, in the way you are at the very start of an acid trip.",
      "T+0:05 Pressure building in head, starting to feel some coming up affects like something might happen. Colours shift a bit on the television, a alight out of body where I was conscious of everything in my periphery. ",
      "T+0:15 I think another report stated that a feeling of grief came over them, the kind you feel when a loved one dies. I had this, a sort of pressure in the chest/heart area and a separate feeling of nausea. Basically I'm in unexplainable pain. A horrid state that lasted about 20 minutes that makes it quite obvious to me that I will never use DMT again, especially in high doses. The nausea I can get over, not that awful uncomfortable feeling. There is also a heavy gravity not unlike salvia.",
      "T+0:20 Starting about 5 minutes into the experience the visual and dissociative affect had been increasing. This was about the peek, very much like the pictures people draw of DMT, the body, the linear filling movements, and things would look typical 70's-ish, with the crazy colours and weird patterns also some interesting CEVS. I can see that if I took more I'd be flying through colours and my head and thoughts and shapes. Over all, not very impressive, kind of interesting, but considering the physical pain of it, it's a no brainer that this is my last time trying this.",
      "T+0:25 Starting to wind down pretty good and 20 minutes later I'm close to baseline.",
      "Summary: My conception of time was largely warped, some interesting CEVs and visuals of the 60s or 70s, the kind that are typically depicted. I prefer the mescaline or acid visuals a lot more though, they are much smoother on you.",
      "I was largely in control of my motor skills the entire time, I'd change channels on TV and think fairly logically. It's a completely different breed of psychedelic. It's nothing fun, nothing spiritual, maybe something that teaches you about yourself. Physically degrading though, uncomfortable, a feeling of being poisoned and physically drained.",
      "I'm not someone who gets overly emotional about trips, nor someone who passes them off and learns nothing. I try to be a realist about it. In my experience salvia and mescaline especially have held extremely strong spiritual connections for me. Acid and Cannabis are more recreational, but I'll learn about myself. DMT however, is a flashy jolting uncomfortable poisoning, even at such a low dose I see this.",
      "The few positives are: I feel a bit warm and nice, although slightly nauseous now that it's about 45 minutes over. A calm is over me, and throughout the 'trip' I had a sort of stillness. This is highly uncommon for me as I'm medicated for tremors and I'm a pretty shifty fellow. A connection to fellow humans that I don't usually have, it's very slight, but nice.",
      "All in all, screw this, please be smart and DOSE LOW your first time to get a taste for DMT. I cannot image the horror of physically emptiness I would've felt on a dose of 5,6, or 7 seeds.  If I want to feel empty and weak, I'll watch a loved one die, screw that sick feeling with nausea and dissociation added on just for some profound experience that doesn't exist. Spiritual drugs leave you with awe and epiphanies, not a fuzzy head from cheap visual affects. It's bearable though, and you may have to experience it for yourself. Don't be scared off from it if it's something you have to do. Not my cup of tea for sure.",

      "Our story begins around midnight, on a cool spring evening in Florida. There I sit at my computer, reading trip stories and the DXM FAQ as I drink from a 4oz bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough. The blacklight in the corner is reflecting on the screen as Enigma, 'The Screen Behind The Mirror' plays softly in the background. This is to be my first trip on DXM. Prior to this night, my only exposure to the DXM experience was a story by Jim Hogshire entitled, 'The Electric Cough Syrup Acid Test,' a throughly entertaining and hilarious account of a first-time on DXM. (Before I go further, I would like to note that I was in the beginning stages of a head cold on this night). That story, as well as the experiences of others, were enough to spark curiousity about DXM and I decided I wanted to try it for myself.",
      "Twenty or thirty minutes pass, I am finished with the entire bottle, and my roommate announces she is going to return her movies to the video store. She was originally going to take this DXM journey with me, but stomach cramps changed her mind. While she was gone, I experienced a little nausea, but not enough to worry me; I knew that I would not get sick. I somehow knew that before I took the first swallow. Nonetheless, I decided to smoke a little weed to calm my stomach discomfort, and since I wasn't really feeling anything other than a little numbness in my mouth, I figured it might jump start the effects of the DXM.",
      "After I finished smoking the bowl, I felt an urgency to brush my teeth so I ran to the bathroom, grabbed my toothbrush and started scrubbing away and by the time I was done, I was leaning my head in the sink splashing cold water on my face because my skin felt warm and a little dry. At that point, my roommate returned and I bounded down the hallway, smiling and giggling, to meet her, telling her that I was really happy she came back (I had the feeling I might want her there; An excellent prediction on my part).",
      "I don't recall at what moment I started tripping...all I know is, somehow, I had anbesol all over the parts of my mind that control my body. I was completely detached from myself, yet fully aware that I was one being. I attempted to write down what I was feeling in the journal I had thoughtfully laid out on my bed. Phrases like 'floating heat' and 'swollen numbness' found their way onto the paper, but without my consciously putting them there. I picked up the notebook, which had the texture and weight of a marshmallow, and I tried to look at what I was writing but my head did not want to face in the direction of the notebook. My arm seemed to be bent in some crazy, wavy, inhuman fashion. In fact, I discovered, any action directly involving my body was next to impossible unless I did it without thinking. I noticed a dull numbness in my mouth and tongue, but found I could speak quite normally and fluently, though perhaps a little loudly. The words sometimes came out incoherent to me and they had the tendency to bounce around in my head for a while after they had been spoken, much like an echo.",
      "I found walking, and moving in general, to be the most fascinating activity of the evening. I must have walked from my bedroom to the living room, out to the porch and back about 73 times. But walking is not exacly the verb that describes what my body was doing. Soaring or floating might better describe it, but even that fails to capture the feeling of separation I had with my body. It was more like I would move from one place or one position to another but the actual moving part seemed not to even occur. I was just there-here, here-there, standing-sitting. Much like a Bobo doll, I felt that if someone would have tried to knock me over I would have simply sprung back to a standing position with no effort at all.",
      "For much of the time I felt like I was stuck in a funhouse. Either I wouldn't feel the floor under my feet at all, or the floor seemed to be at a different height with each step. I thought I was staggering but my friend assured me I looked normal, aside from the fact that my eyes were closed all the time. Were they? I could still see my surroundings just fine. Well, fine enough to know that they appeared extremely messed up. She also said, if anything, I looked like I was 'testing out my new legs.' As I said before, I was glad my friend was there and that she was sober because I was talking non-stop. I felt the need to verbalize immediately all my new sensations and realizations. She seemed to be okay with this. She was really great. She sat with me, not just listening to me talk, but actually participating in conversations with me, even if I was not always coherent.",
      "I was excited as hell to experience music but I was sort of disappointed to find that it seemed very one-dimentional and thin...no substance at all.  But I was still getting into it. I had taken off Enigma early on and replaced it with some trance music set to repeat itself.",
      "I came to many understandings during my DXM experience. I found that there is no one 'normal' state of consciousness, but many, many different states of being. Just as there are many different layers, or planes, of reality. I was involved in more than one layer of reality at any given moment throughout the night. I also found myself with no inhibitions, wanting to say every thought that passed into my head. I can only compare this to being on ecstacy when I say things because I feel like, without even thinking about it, everything is good and 'acceptable,' only with DXM, it seems it's not a lack of inhibitions, it's a lack of identity. I changed clothes about four times. I found I was very indecisive and contradicted myself a lot. I kept feeling light and heavy, or spinning but stable. I'd want to be outside, then I'd want to be inside. But I was never uncomfortable, I just kept changing my mind. I also had no conception of opposites. I had to ask if I was talking loudly or if the music was loud because everything just seemed equal.",
      "DXM is like no other drug experience I have ever had, and I have experimented quite a bit with different types of drugs. It was on of the best trips of my life and I am going to experiment more with it."

      "Introduction",
      "I guess I will start at the beginning. I had been studying the 2c-series pretty extensively. 2c-e was the chemical that stood out from the rest of the pack. After reading every bit of info on it I could find in about a 6-month period, I decided it was time to do some bioassays, and the order was placed. From the 1st dose I took, it was apparent that 2c-e and I got along very well. In all my trials with it (at least orally), I never experienced any significant idiosyncratic effects. I was able to work up to about 50mg comfortably. The amount of information and personal content contained with this phenethylamine is astonishing.",
      "Dose/response",
      "4-5 mg is enough for me to feel threshold effects from 2c-e. I used this dose commonly to add a little magic to my trail rides. There will be minor trailing, but that is about it as far as visual effects go. A slight tingly body buzz is present. There is a notable smart drug quality to this level. Effects taper off at about T+4 hours from the 1st alert at this dose.",
      "8-10mg is where the character of 2c-e really begins to show itself. Significant trails and intensification of color are apparent. There will be minor cev patterning, but nothing spectacular or special. Marked enhancement of mood noted. 5-6 hour duration.",
      "15mg seems to be the sweet spot for easy on the body and mind, yet intense experiences.",
      "I have significant oev patterning and trails, but no real distortions, just translucent coloring over layed on the world. Cevs begin to form basic color patterns, sort of free floating patches of mostly light greens and oranges, with a bit of blue for the background. I am in for at least 7-8 hours at this dose.",
      "25mg is where one might begin to enter a total state of psychedelic bliss or terror, depending on how one reacts to 2c-e. I always got the bliss effect, though I had several trip partners who did not get so lucky. 8+-hour duration.",
      "30mg is as high as I would EVER recommend anyone trying. The world is stuck in limbo between the real world and the fantasy world. OOBEs are a common occurrence at this dose. The muscle tension gets a bit irritating at this level, but stretching is almost orgasmic. I have little to no control at this level, and ego-death is always a possibility. I am in for a full 10 hours at 30mg.",
      "40mg is fucking nuts. I did this dose 2 years in a row for the Warped Tour, and I wouldn't recomment it. Talk about total sensory overload. Thousands of drunk and rowdy strangers, mosh pits and pist off music. It doesnt get any better than that. I got in the pit for rancid the 1st year I did this and it was incredible. I lost all contact with my group, and ended up getting sprayed with a fire hose by the fire department as it was like 115 degrees on the ground and people were getting heat stroke. Luckily for me, I stayed hydrated and wore light, airy biking gear. While the 2 people I was with were being cheered on by a large crowd puking up blue Gatorade and hash browns. The following year I went to see the Transplants and was totally blown away. They are totally different live, they dont have the rap style so much as good old street punk. The crash the next day from this dose is similar to ridicules doses of mdma, so I will only do it 1x per year, and only for the warped tour (or maybe a Bad Religion show). The effects can go on well past the 12-hour mark at this dose.  When I dose any higher than this, or even this high, I am really taking my life into my own hands. The excess stimulation is nowhere as annoying as with 2c-I, but still a bitch. Moshing will rip that excess energy right out of me though.",
      "The character of the trip is highly variable as the dose increases. At lower doses it is very fun and friendly, but as I pass about 15mg, the character turns less euphoric and more neutral. This is not to say it is bad, just not particularly fun, though this is very dependant on set and setting. This is not a particularly recreational psychedelic after about 15mg.",
      "The insight I receive is based on how well I can clear my mind. If I am cluttered up mentally from what is going on around me, I will probably not get a ton from it. The insight is not forced as it is with many other psychedelics, I have to seek it out. Nausea can be present, but is also highly dependant on the dose. Never anything too bad for me. but some others got significant nausea. I find cannabis to be an absolute must for getting the most from 2c-e. It allows the trip to really take over without the ego trying to block it. Alcohol is also good on the tail end of the trip to ease both body and mind. I tend to still be pondering what I was told much of the day after a 2c-e trip.",
      "Combinations",
      "10mg 2c-e and chewed calamus throughout brings about a very clean, centered, sharp mental state. I actually like to chew it prior to and during most of my experiments. This combo is not about visuals or insight, but I find it hard to beat for my favorite outdoor activities (mountain biking, fly fishing, etc) without getting in the way of me accomplishing them. It is the perfect reality enhancer for me. There is mild psychedelia present, though it is light and transparent. A joint or bowl on this dose will make the trip much more visual, but still very comfortable.",
      "10mg 2c-e and 5 wood rose seeds brings on an intense NEED to get out of the house. It has more of a pull to be with nature than even psilocybin. I am unable to remain sedentary on this combo also. The need to move around is profound. Walking is awesome. I am lucky to live in Colorado, so I have an excess of outdoor places to trip.",
      "8mg of 2c-e and 30mg of 2c-c was surprisingly easy on the mind and body. It was if all the 2c-e did was add a visual aspect to the relaxed and friendly 2c-c buzz. I had the visual effects equivalent of approx. 350mcg of lsd, but no major body or mental effects. It was like eye candy with almost no other effects present.",
      "20mg of 2c-e and 5mg of smoked 5-meo-dmt is a very emotional and powerful experience. In this instance, the level of pressure on the body is the only real negative, other than the abject intensity of the 5-meo-dmt, but I enjoy that.  This combo was the catalyst for a major change in my life, but I wont get into the details here.",
      "30mg of 2c-e and 10mg of methadone was one of the best opiate experiences I have ever had. I tend to react pretty poorly to opiates, but there is a special synergy with 2c-e. There was significant nausea as the methadone took effect, but after some dry heaves, it remained gone for the night, though I was pretty hung over the next day. Eyes closed visual manifestations were very detailed utterly alien landscapes. It was nodding with MAJOR cevs. I felt the need to just lie back and see where it would take me.",
      "2c-e and salvia can be a very disturbing experience. Read my report Restitution for more info.",
      "15mg of 2c-e and repeated smoked methamphetamines was attempted on one occasion, long before I came to loathe meth so much. It was not a really bad or good time. I was tired from the comedown of the 2c-e, but still wired from the meth. Not recommended.",
      "25mg of 2c-e and too many (11) Jaeger-bombs will create a very flowing visual effect. Like watching water that is slowly flowing translucently laved over the entire visual field. There was no nausea noted, which really surprised me. I will get ill on 2c-e if I drink any alcohol other than Jaeger bombs or Sunshine Wheat Ale, which is marketed, by New Belgium breweries (located in my hometown, so it is everywhere.)",
      "With any dose of 2c-e I found it to be amazing when combined with N2O. It at least doubles the length of the effects, and causes a 5x increase in visual effects. Problem is, when the N2O begins to ware off, I am already cracking another one before I even realize it. I go on nitrous autopilot, so to speak. I have had nights where I have gone through literally 100 whippets in a night, I feel about 50% less intelligent the next day, but that only lasts a day.",
      "There is also an amazing synergy with 2c-e and any psilocin analogs I have tried.",
      "The effects are very similar combining it with 4-ho-dmt, 4-ho-dipt, or 4-ho-mipt.",
      "There is an insane level of visual distortion. It has literally been hard to find my way around my own apartment due to the levels of visual activity. I will post more info if and when I get to combine it with 4-ho-met or 4-ho-mpt.",
      "Dxm can also be an excellent adjunct for getting the most from a 2c-e experience.",
      "With low doses of each (8mg of 2c-e and 250mg of dxm, for example) brings on a very light, fun, party type of trip, but the character changes significantly as the dose increases. I use 8-12 mg of 2c-e for every 240 mg of dxm. With this dosing strategy, the effects of neither drug will override the other, and the most useful and pleasurable effects can be had. I have used this strategy up to 620mg of dxm and 30mg of 2c-e. I do not recommend taking the doses this high though.",
      "10mg of 2c-e and 15mg of 4-aco-dipt was the only attempt I got to make with ipracetyl and 2c-e, and I have to say it was a disappointment. There was none of the MAJOR visual distortion I had gotten from 4-ho-dipt and 2c-e. They really are 2 different drugs, despite all the similarities in 1st hand reports. I am not saying it was a bad combo, the body buzz was very nice, similar to mdma, but I just did not get what I was looking for from it.",
      "15mg of 2c-e and 175mg Phenobarbital was very lazy and not at all worth the combo. I was too lazy to really enjoy it. I fell asleep after about 2 hours from dosing the chems (cap was swallowed and the Phenobarbital was immediately administered). I won't waste my time with this combo. Same goes for benzodiazepines. I dont see any real use for downers with phens, I mainly use them with too high doses of tryptamines.",
      "If I am using diphenhydramine (benadryl, Tylenol pm, etc) to sleep after the trip subsides for the most part, 150-175mg will be able to let me sleep, but I give it an hour or so before trying to retire. I DON'T dose any higher than this. It will result in full-retrograde amnesia. With no tolerance, as few as 2-3 may be effective for sedation.  Ambien is also effective, but for 2c-e, klonapin is the best sedative for me.",
      "I have had to use ephedrine during a 2c-e trip due to issues with my asthma (I use a tea of Ma Huang or Bala root since it works faster than a pill), but it did not really effect the trip, though the level of physical stimulation did increase, but go figure. Pulse and bp did not reach any alarming levels. Sleep was attained at about 9 hours after the ma huang tea, about T+ 12hrs from the dose of 2c-e.",
      "Other modes of Administration",
      "Insufflation",
      "I realize I will probably get some do as I say, not as I do type of BS from some of you, but please learn from my mistakes. Why do something that you KNOW is stupid? First off, 2c-chems burn so bad only a masochist could enjoy it. The side effects increase far more than do the psychedelic effects. The pain that accompanies the trip is too detrimental to really get anything from it, a la yopo/cohoba snuffs. I was never able to get the same clean high from it that I did from oral dosing. It has also given me nosebleeds within 30 mins of snorting on 2 occasions. With 2c-t-7 having killed people in recent history (though I will give you that they were mainly poly drug deaths, but not all) why risk it with a chem that is so nicely active orally. It is not the same feel snorted either. It becomes too speedy and causes much more muscle tension with this m.o.a.",
      "IV: This ranks among the dumbest things I have ever done. If you have  a brain you will heed my warnings and not IV 2c-e. The pain at the injection site was unbearable. It was like what I imagine a heart attack to be. It was done on a large vein on my left bicep. The pain shooting throughout my arm and chest made me contemplate calling 911. My pulse was not beating an alarming or arrhythmic pace, so I took some klonapin and rode it out.",
      "Please be responsible (unlike me) in your trials with 2c-e. It is a very special substance. I far prefer it to even LSD. If you fuck up and die of an OD, Ethyl will be schedule 1 and rarely seen again, though it will be shortly anyway. We have a chance here, like was present in the 90s with 2c-b. The more the DEA comes across it and learns of it being represented as other drugs, the sooner all phenethylamines and tryptamines will become schedule 1. One should do their research, there is a wealth of information available, but one has to be willing to find it. If one does not have the time to learn about these chemicals and how they affect the body and mind, they have no right to be fucking with them.",
      "Addiction Potential",
      "When I came into possession of my 1st 500mg vial, I went through it in about 3 weeks. I was dosing all day, at home, at work, whatever else I was doing.  It is very malleable and fun in small doses. Nothing really bad came about from the binge, it was like every day was good, the whole time. Still, long term consistent dosing of an unknown chemical is probably not the best idea.",
      "The Title?",
      "I was out fishing with my crazy, straight edge friend G and he overheard me and my brother talking about how well Ethyl had treated us over the weekend. We were on a small amount that day too, so when he asked Who the hell is Ethyl, with a very odd, perplexed look on his face, it was about the funniest fucking thing I have ever heard.",
      "We told him she was a friends aunt in the next town over where we can stay if we are too drunk to drive home. He has not mentioned her again."

      "I would like everyone to keep in mind before reading this, that prior to experimenting with this 1/2 oz blunt between my buddy and I we were clean for roughly a month. Before we would smoke bud at least twice a day, and had been for the last 2-3 years. Despite the avid smokers we were, quitting for a month fully wasnt as hard as it seemed. We kept occupied with alchohol (which when intoxicated sometimes made it even worse not to smoke) and other minor substances. The first week of not smoking was the hardest, but when kept occupied we managed.",
      "The initial goal my buddy and I had agreed to accomplish was to see if lowering your tollerance by being clean for a month, then smoking an assload of pot would infact produce visuals and bring an intense mind altering state (which we read off a report by Terance Mckenna). So our journey began. We spent the month of not smoking by gathering up a great accumilation of different name brand buds. We were determined to find only the best to celebrate the month long 'fast'. Over the course of the 30 days we got 5 differnt strands making up the 1/2 oz: Northern lights haze, california orange, white widow, purple urple, and an unknown brand of sativa that arguably was the most visibly potent out of the bunch (white widow came in a close second). These were bomb and after gathering them the temptation not to pull of a little bud and light up would of been impossible without the support of my fellow friend who would be experiancing this with me in the end.",
      "By the end of the month, as much of a die hard stoner I may sound like, it took me multiple shots of vodka to put me to sleep out of the excitement I was going to endure. We set the date to light up on a Saturday afternoon/evening so we could have a day to prepare and make sure all the settings were perfect.",
      "Saturday Morning: 7:35AM: My friend and I wake up early to start out the most waited rolling of the joint. My friend pulled out his large blunt wraps, unflavored. He pasted 5 of them together with his saliva and promptly laid them out on the desk. Now for the good stuff. I pulled out an old shoe box from my closet containing pure enjoyment. 5 plump ziploc bags were emptied onto the table, colors ranging from deep sparkly green, to a light purple, and an almost fluorecent reddish brown. All were surpisingly still in their full bud form with a little shake at the bottoms of the bag.",
      "When all were opened and placed in the center of the desk mulitple pictures were taken and the aroma filling the air perfectly described the bud: astonishingly dank! My friend pulled out an unused coffee bean grinder and away we went. We put about half the bud in the grinder and gave it a quick three tap blend (coffee grinders are very powerful and any excess grinding pass three presses bruises the THC). We emptied the ground bud onto the wraps and procedeed with the other half. After all the bud was nicely ground up a rather large amount of THC crystals had developed on the outer edges of the blender.  Taking a piece of paper and filing it all into one mound did the job, and then we lined the whole mound of THC in the middle of the blunt, followed by the weed.",
      "My friend is a absolute pro roller and it took him but 5 minutes to roll this, followed with a cardboard clutch in the end. Our masterpiece was complete. It was buitiful, large at the end, followed by an even larger mound in the middle, slightly narrowing down to the clutch. At my friends camp house in the woods he has a movie theatre room that is blocked off completly of any windows, so no form of light can enter. A perfect room to enjoy the blunt and let the sheer blackness of the room create its visuals (if the awaited effect is true).",
      "11:45: We had only water in the morning, going against our routine coffee binges that always take place Saturday mornings. We wanted to keep our entire system clean of any other body/mind altering substances throught the day. We ate no breakfast due to the joint rolling, and had a minor lunch of blended up apples/oranges/banannas/ fresh pineapple/ and strawberries.",
      "2:00: We passed the time by planning out the night with music that must be listened to, food that must be eaten, and activities that were to take place during the high.  After holding back to eating any of our favorite foods, or even listening to any music (to hopefully somehow save up all the greatness for the high) we played multiple card games and took a refreshing walk through the woods contemplating the greatly awaited high. The feelings going through me were like counting down to going to a heaven. Not a moment passed that Saturday when I couldnt contain myself from constantly smiling and doing random outbursts of joyous laughs.",
      "4:20 (on the spot): We counted down on my digital wrist watch in his black movie room for the light of the blunt. Both using a lighter we got a nice deep cherry started. We started off by both taking huge drags and passing it, but after about what seemed to be 10 minutes of this we just took small hits. I would toke a few deep drags, then pass it to him in which he would do the same. We decided not to talk throughout the smoking process in the room to keep the meditative vibe of quiet blackness constant.  The effects hit me almost instantly after the first few pulls. A light tingly sensation throught my body signaled that I was in for an experiance. The mixture of the 5 weeds was almost overpowering at first (also for the fact that I hadent smoked in a month) and I felt very light headed the first 10 minutes. Over the period of the blunt things really got wild. I would see the cherry of the blunt as my friend smoked it and nothing but the cherry. The cherry slowly developed a faint set of eyes that I kept on focusing on, but couldnt figure out.",
      "I unconsiously kept thinking their were eyes on the blunt, but never took it into consideration. We just kept smoking. It seemed as though an hour passed, and we still had roughly half the blunt to go. My mind is racing by now. I feel relaxed to the point of not moving a muscle, but my friend and I almost created a routine motion of me take a toke, then him take a toke. Their was a point when I convinced myself that I wasnt smoking it and I thought their was a bad passage in the blunt, but then figured out I was so high that I had to take a 6 second straight drag to feel the burn, I continued taking small pulls after that trusting myself that I was pulling it each time. After what seemed to be 30 minutes later I got a little nervous of the pitch blackness. I wanted to see things, but I had to just relax and let myself attempt to find out what my initial goal was: visual hellucinations.",
      "The last half of the blunt was definetly the edge of the glass for me. When I started taking pulls it began hitting me in very defined levels (most likely due to the resinous build up near the end - very potent!) After we managed to finish the blunt the effects continued to duplicate and things were amazing in the dark. Once I actually layed back and closed my eyes I slowely  began viusalizing myself sitting in a chair going into space. I sat back and the blackness ran over my like water. I was going full force into space and stars began emerging in the blackness. It was hard to beleive myself that I wasnt just mentally making this up (beucase nothing like this has EVER happened on a marijuana high to me). My face felt cold and I knew I wasnt just trying to make this up when I sat up in my seat and felt like I was falling down in space and I could see rocks on the sides of the room going in upward motions. I quickly sat back and continued on my space journey.",
      "I began hearing deep 'whoosh' sounds that came from the back of my head, and then slowly emerged around my ears and in then continued in the distance. A very deep and very realistic floating sensation roared over me and I was 100% convinced that somehow we hottboxed the room so much that it was being lifted off the ground into space. I was very nervous becuase I knew it wouldnt be good to be lost in space, and someone was going to find the missing room and wonder where we were. When I was aware of my extreme paranoia thoughts, I fully let them go and with no doubt was lifted into a new realm. I felt like I could communicate with the nods of my head. I would see things and if I nodded my head against the head rest once I would want to continue with my space journey to find new things, but If what i saw/felt/heard was appealing to me I would nod my head twice, sometimes with a turn to the left or right (depending on certain specifics about the sense) and I would continue to venture into the the specific detail. It was almost too much at points when I would continue to see random specific details of the visuals. But I constantly assured myself it was just the high. The best way to describe the physical feeling of the high would be to relate it to getting into a hottub when its cold outside. A very strong rush of releif/ euphoria/ and warm comfort continued to strike my body. In very defined waves it would continue to set my body free from reality.  Every wave I felt I mentally came lifted into a new sense of the high, which was most amazing about the whole high/trip. It wasnt like most highs where after you smoked, the peak would be in the next 10-20 minutes, and then you would slowely go down. This was consistantly reaching higher and higher peaks bringing me deeper into almost an outside world. I came very comfortable and unverbally social with the surrounding blackness. I full frontedly forgot about my friend in the other seat, but he was definetly higher than anything comprehendable becuase throughout the experiance he would pound the backs of his feet on the recliners as though it was a way of communicating, with different strengths and motions. Once or twice I pounded my feet on the recliner back to him mirroring the rhythm he did. Hearing and feeling the pounds on the backs of my feet were literally undescribeable because It was like I was almost in a trance communicating through pounds, not even being aware of the fact that I was doing it. I set a beeper on my watch to go off at 7:00 (2 hours and 40 minutes after the first toke). When it did go off I was terribly scared thinking it was a bomb of some sort that got left in the room, but almost instantly after remembered it was just my watch.",
      "I spoke out the first words after to my friend, 'holy shit'. Not getting an immediate response I stood up and opened the door just a crack letting in minimal light and noticably cold air (the air in the room was very hot and thick.) I then threw the door open feeling like simba off the lion king when he was held in the air off the cliff. I felt so refreshed by the light and fresh air that I fell down to my knees, rolled over and began laughing past control. When my friend got up he must of not seen me and tripped over with a unusal shriek and then started laughing with me on the ground.",
      "7:15: After a period of time, we didnt get far from the room. We laid on the floor massaging the thick carpet and noticing the ununsual shapes of light and smoke billowing out of the room. We were blazed past our minds and completly forgot about our appetites (that we saved up throughout the whole day) and the activites we had planned. We would talk to each other in unusal tones, and completly change the subject every 10 seconds to something completly farfetched. Every one of my senses was very heightened.",
      "9:30 After hours of deep and very rewarding and spirtual conversation and more hallucinations (mainly minor closed eye) we began gaining back to our selves. We both remembered food after the extreme effects declined and we ate 2 boxes of Chocolate chip granola bars, 2 bags of sunchips, and plenty of costco muffins washed down with no fear energy drink.",
      "11:30 Still disorianted we were near the end of the high. We both recouped with more convorsation and then both endulged in multiple nintendo games, transitioning between halo 2 on the xbox360, and Mario party on the gamecube, then we had the best damn sleep of our lives."

      "I will not bore you with unnecesary details about my life. I have taken Cubensis 3 times prior to this experience, even higher doses, and experienced nothing like this.",
      "Yesterday (Friday Feb. 2nd, 2007), myself and my younger brother (18 years old, I am 20), decided to trip on some of our dried cubensis. We decided to increase our dosage from last time, to 2.6 grams, as these seemed to be extremely potent cubensis. We went far from humanity, out to a beautiful spot in nature, right by a river, with birds chirping and a generally pleasant environment. We took our doses at the same time, at 2:30 PM. We sat on a warm rock in the sun, and smoked some cannabis while waiting for the effects. After 15 minutes, I could feel my thought process changing, getting deeper. I felt happy, but that anxious feeling of coming up was present too.",
      "By 3:00pm, the first real effects began to kick in on both of us. We decided to walk.",
      "We walked along the path by the river, where there were no other humans. I could feel myself forgetting or losing everything in my psyche I had ever learned about social interaction and communication. Me and my brother walked along, until we came upon a beautiful tree. I touched it, and I felt so understanding of the tree. I felt sorry for it, because it could not move along with me and experience all the wonderful things to see. But we kept moving, and we would stop every couple of feet to marvel at some small rock or shrub and how beautiful it was. Every place we stopped took on a brand new feeling, that was so overwhelming and beautiful.",
      "Finally we came to a sandy spot by the water, that was in full sun. It was warm and we liked it. So we stopped here. We sat on the sand there for at least an hour, although I had no understanding of time at all. The subject of time was very confusing. I repeatedly tried to figure out what time we started tripping, and how long we had been tripping for, but found it impossible. Why should there be a beginning, and an end? that is not our natural function. We are eternal, never ending. It was at this time, sitting on that sand in the warm sun, that I entered a dream. EVERYTHING that I could perceive with my eyes, was a visual. Everything that I looked at was surrounded with black, although it is impossible to describe what I saw, It seemed to all follow a theme. What was real I could still see, but it was much more colorful and beautiful than normal. It would also warp and twirl fantastically. Plants seemed to wave at me. Everything was surrounded by a blackness, which I believed to be space.",
      "We then stood up to leave that spot and return to the car to listen to music. As we walked (it was a long way), I felt I was extremely tall, then I was getting lighter. We walked to the top of a hill, where there was a cliff, at least 40 feet high. I walked to the edge of this cliff (very dangerous looking back on it), feeling more like I was floating to it at this point more than walking, and a gust of wind shot up from the cliff when I looked down. When the wind hit me, I was flying. I remembered EVERY dream I have ever had, at the same time. and it felt exactly like I was flying. I could fly. It felt so good, the best feeling in my life. I was actually flying, and there was not a chance in hell anyone could have convinced me I was not, because I was really flying.",
      "I looked down the canyon, from where I stood, and I could see myself down by the water, playing as a kid. As a child my parents would always bring us to this spot to play, and I could remember all of those feelings as a child playing by the water. I remember how badly I would want to stay when we had to leave. And I also remembered so many dreams I had experienced, where I was in this exact spot. I believe I was in a lucid dream, while awake, I had returned to this spot that I had dreamed of so many times, in real life, and in the dream world at the same time. This was the best part of the trip. Absolutely indescribable bliss.",
      "My brother felt the same thing. We did not speak much, but we understood each other. I KNEW I did not need to speak to him, because he understood me without me needing to. I honestly don't know if we experienced some form of telepathy, but he told me afterwards that he felt the same way. We were communicating without words or on a physical level. This place had a huge significance. I felt as if leaving this spot would signify something extremely big, but I was not sure what.",
      "When we finally left, I could feel the trip change as we walked away from it. We got in the truck, and lit a cigarette. I found it amazing that I only had to take one puff of the cigarette, and instantly felt it 10x stronger than if I had smoked the whole thing when not high. We began calling them pleasure sticks, because only one puff would bring on a feeling similar to the drug MDMA. Then we loaded a bowl of ganja, and found the same to be true with it as well! one puff and I was stoned out of my mind. It was awesome! I have developed a tolerance to weed, cuz I smoke too much of it, but on shrooms, that doesn't exist. I was so blind it was like the first time I smoked weed.",
      "Then we drove to another spot[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!], where we began to come down. The come down wasn't pleasant. I realized that tripping that hard must have some repurcussions. It took over two hours for us to come down. I felt as if I was learning everything about reality again. I literally felt my conciousness COME DOWN to another level. I felt stupider, more restrained. As reality began to take over more and more, I felt so much knowledge, understanding, compassion, slipping away from me. I strongly believed, and still do, that the place where I went on these mushrooms was the place we go when we die. Our bodies die, but we just leave them, and go on to another place, another world, another body maybe. I fully understood and realized this. I also found many flaws in our society, government, etc. I could think so clearly, and understand so much, I can not even begin to describe what I learned.",
      "The reason we tripped so hard this time may be because we forgot to drink, and got dehydrated in the sun. We had bought drinks to avoid this, but carried them around with us the whole time, not really understanding why or what they were for. So we did not drink until about 7:00 pm, sitting in the car, and suddenly realized we were dehydrated, that's why we were STILL tripping. I thought I was sober, when marijuana leaves grew from the stereo and covered the entire dash. After drinking a half gallon of water (I was SO thirsty and didn't even realize that's what that feeling was) I vomited, urinated, drank the other half, and was finally sober.",
      "We got home, and it felt like it was the first time I had been there. I took a shower, and when I got out I felt so clean, fresh and new. I made decisions to change my life for the better. I realized I was doing a lot wrong. I feel that my life is forever changed, in a very positive way, by these mushrooms, and I am very grateful. I will not do shrooms again with anyone except my brother."

      "For years I have been curious of all drugs and try as many as i can find at least once, and around the end of Janruary 2001 I got my hands on 25 grams of Amanita Muscaria off of a botanical website.  To say the least it was the worst single experience of my life.",
      "My night started with me eating 10 grams of the shrooms.  I have been told this would give a medium to strong hallucinogenic trip, so I ate them with no problem with the taste and an excited feel for trying something new.  After 3 hours me and my sitter decided that it wasn't going to work, no effect had taken place and no horrible taste as we had heard came with the shroom.  We made the stupid decision to have me eat the rest in 30 minutes if it didn't set in.  Well, the time came by and I decided it was down the hatch for them, and I ate all but three of the grams that were left over, and again I waited.  Then the horror began in an odd visual, a small fire began crackling on top of the halogen lamp in my living room.",
      "At this point I got drowsy and as much as I tried to stay awake, I could not.  In a few minutes, as far as I can figure, I woke up with a sense of understanding that to the day I die I will never be able to tell with words, but the best explanation I can give is that I was traveling from different times to other different times and memories all the way to my death only to repeat the cycle when I died.  At this point I had the genius idea that I had died and my life was flashing before my eyes.  I panicked.  I stood up and ran into the middle of the living room, but could not see one part of my house any longer, it was a full blown visual hallucination.  I got close enough to the sitter and could see the slight image of his face, at this point I began uncontrollably screaming and crying, falling to the floor and the changing of visuals began again.  I couldnt grasp on to one visual and panicked yet again and tried to run anywhere to get away, but only ran full speed into a wall and collapsed.",
      "Two of the three people at my house now tried to restrain me.  The horrible visuals stopped and I relaxed thinking it was over and lay down, so confused that I had no idea that I was under the influence of a drug only that now was the peace I needed.  Unfortunately the same hallucinations started again and I somehow found my way to my room where the third person at my house was.",
      "I had not said a word in over 3 hours at this time and the people now feared that I would die under the influence of this as I had been staring, crying, and been in a vacant state as if I had given up on surviving.  I had been moved to the couch somehow and rested there, still without the reassurance of speech to my friends, but now began what I thought was a game of spitting to make the visuals stop.  And strangely it was working, and finally I was responding to their yelling at me.  Most people think this is the comedown of my trip, and if I were only that lucky, it would be, but I now began to watch my friends die before me in horrible ways such as having their necks ripped open by unseen things and people melting.  Everyone I held close now went through a sequence of death, and a normal human reaction was displayed after this: I vomited.  I would not let this vomit out of my mouth however and one of my friends had to tear my jaw open with his hands in my mouth to let it out so I didn't suffocate to death.  At this point I finally began coming down.",
      "I woke up feeling fine and didn't even fully remember the experience for the next month.  Through all my experiences with drugs, this was my worst.  I believe it as more of a poison than a drug, and I would wish this on no one, not even my worst enemies.  This was however my wake-up call to be more careful in my drug use from now on, and the true value and importance of sitters and friends."

      "This is a quick note on my first 2C-E trip, last month.",
      "I had not planned to trip at all on the night in question. I had recently come into 500mg of 2C-E from a pretty reliable supplier and had been planning to wait until it felt like the right time to use it.",
      "I finished work at 8pm and took a taxi to a nearby courier depot to pick up some whippets I ordered earlier in the week. Once I got home, I ate a pizza and took around 200mg of Methylone while listening to an aphex twin album at a decent volume. In doing so I reckon I upset everybody who lives within 200 yards of my flat! Fuckem if they can't appreciate some good noise though.",
      "After an hour or so I was beginning to get a good buzz from the methylone, and redosed with another 100mg, insufflated. I also did some nangs over this period. By about 1am most of the pronounced effects of the Methylone had faded somewhat and redosing was not really taking it much further. I was very clearheaded though, wide awake and feeling good.",
      "Around this time I took a walk to the shop and picked up some cigarettes and Orange Juice. By the time I returned I had decided to have at the 2C-E, so I took my scale and measured out 100mg or thereabouts, 100mg being the smallest measure my scale will take. I really should have dissolved this in water, but instead I eyeballed a tenth of the powder and drank what I reckon was 10-15mg of 2C-E with some orange.",
      "Then I settled down on the sofa, intermittently inhaling nangs while I posted on one of my favourite forums and half watched 'Drawn Together'. After half an hour I had almost forgotten I had taken the stuff, but after 50 minutes or so the text on a comic book sequence on tv was expanding and contracting, and the room seemed bigger than usual. I also noticed some pictures on my wall were sort of misty.",
      "Once I had those first alerts the trip came on really quickly. Open eye visuals were not too much at first, the room was lot brighter than usual and the computer screen became too much to deal with. I put on some random chill out music and lay back on the couch with my eyes closed.",
      "I could hear the music that was playing but was not really processing the sounds. Instead I was seeing these fantastic angular shapes and colours rotating and floating inside my eyelids to the tune and beat of the Aphex Twin I had been listening to earlier on. I had no real anxiety or thoughts to speak of, I just let my mind follow the lights and colours for what felt like an eternity, but was probably more like 30 minutes. Occasionally during this time I was vaguely conscious of my thighs and hips vibrating and thrashing somewhat.",
      "Later, I inhaled some more whippets and switching off the lamps moved to lie on my beanbags, just inside the window. There is a wooden slat blind on this window and green and translucent shimmers of light flitted in from between the slats. I don't remember a huge amount from the next while, but at one point I opened my eyes and there were two celtic patterns, like triangles with rounded corners rotating in opposite directions on top of each other on the ceiling above me. For some reason I found this really reassuring, and made some sort of connection between them and my heritage which made me feel really warm and this set off a very nice fantasy.",
      "Moving back to the sofa, I had at the nangs once again, and this time after a few cartridges I had this incredible sensation of electricity on the right side of my head, just behind the temple. It felt like I was projecting through the side of my head so I looked in that direction, towards the window where it was like some sort of cosmic breeze/flame had caused the top few feet of the blind to be blowing into the room with a shimmery purple/blue colour. Looking outside, everything was bright purple and pulsing energy. The room seemed to be closer to me on all sides, brighter and was humming/buzzing. For a while I felt like I was floating! It was fucking amazing.",
      "Even the air in the room, while still transparent, could be seen curving and bending into these fantastic shapes and angles.",
      "I was in heaven, past thought. I did try to post online, but it was impossible to put anything into words or thought coherently.",
      "I went to bed at some point, my memory of bed is not really there, I was restless, got up a few times to take a leak. At around 9am I was more or less down, but still awake so I dosed 2.5ml of GBL which gave me a fitful sleep until 12 or so.",
      "The next day was been pretty ropey. I had a bath, did some shopping for food and cleaned the house but only after 24 hours I feel 'normal', whatever that is.",
      "I didn't really have many meaningful insightful moments that I can recall. I made a conscious decision when I felt the first alerts to just let the drug take me and not to impose myself on it and succeeded in doing that. Maybe that's my lesson, if there is any.",
      "I am definitely going to use this again. It's one good psychedelic."

      "Wow. I finally tried Salvia divinorum for the first time. Boy was I glad I had read up on it and spent time visualizing how I wanted the experience to be. It was incredible!!!",
      "I went to a friend's place to watch hockey - the ulterior motive being for three of us to get together and give Salvia at try for the first time in a comfortable setting, with people that wouldn't be acting like jerks. I decided I would give it a go after the first period of the game. I packed the small bowl of my water pipe very tightly, with approximately a gram of salvia leaf. I had this Salvia for about 2 weeks, but I hadn't really felt ready to try it until now - I wasn't nervous at all. Without hesitating I lit the bowl with a regular lighter (keeping the flame on it) and took my first big hit, held it for 15 seconds, let it out and and then took my second hit. As I was leaning forward to place the pipe back on the table, I felt a small giggle rising out of the depths, and a bit of strange pressure on the front of my face.",
      "Well.... No one would have convinced me that a person could experience what happened next. I let out the giggle, along with all of my second hit in a messy, giant blow, as the giggle from the depths immediately turned into a 'perfect storm' of uncontrollable, loony laughter. There was also a sense of sliding forward and forward and forward, but the intensity with which the laughter came on really had me in disbelief, because just after the first giggle, but before I could even say to myself 'Is this IT?!?! Oh my God! This can't be it! WOW IT IS!' - I had lost it. The laughing grew and grew and grew. There was no going backwards, there was no calming myself, or relaxing to analyze the experience, or even catching my breath. There was only forwards and forwards with more and more intensity.",
      "I quickly let myself go and everything felt incredibly, genuinely, hysterically funny. The entire scene of me and my friends in the the living room took on a whole feeling of being in a sitcom, performing, being watched by an audience, all in my head. The cheers from the crowd at the hockey game on TV were for us! I was laughing with the crowd/audience. I was the source of the funny and I was laughing at it all. Immediately after my initial burst of laughter and obvious spiral down into a complete lack of control, my friend said, 'Come ON?!?!' in a skeptical, character-typical kind of way, which I greatly appreciated and made me laugh even more, his next words were, 'Fuc*ing RIGHT! Pack me a bowl!!!', and with my friends laughing along with me I nearly fell off my seat, again because this was the funniest damn thing I I had ever heard in my life.",
      "Everything my friends said to me, everything they did, everything I did, elicited the same kind of internal response as I would get from watching a character driven running gag, like Seinfeld, or Trailer Park Boys - a warm, driven, imaginative, familiar and satisfying sense - Kramer bursting through Jerry's door with the funniest expression ever - Ricky with his six-paper joints and reckless, self-centered interpretation of reality - except TIMES 10!!!! So there was the incredible laughter, which I was very thankful for - it was exactly what I had wanted and preconditioned myself to experience after watching about 50 YouTube videos of various degrees of Salvia trips.",
      "I also immediately noticed that my centre of balance was WAYYY off, as if my head weighed 100 lbs. I would lean a little one way and it felt like I was falling over. But I wasn't, it just felt that way. When I leaned forward I felt a huge roller coaster ride rush downward. When I put my hands over my eyes to wipe away tears from laughing I ACTUALLY SAW the roller coaster tracks and the tunnel I was riding in. I had heard many times in videos and read of people describing a tunnel - I know exactly what they were talking about. I had presence of mind enough to speak to my friends between laughing fits, but only enough to say, 'OH MY GOD', and make airplane noises, 'Vrrrrreeaaaaaoooooooohhhhmmmmmmmm-HAAHAHAHAHAHEEHEEHEEHEEHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!' with my arms stretched out - my friends were impressed.",
      "So the laughing and roller coaster lasted about four minutes. Then I snapped out of it! Still giggly, very relaxed, but completely awestruck at what I had just experienced. Before I had come back to earth my friend had already packed a bowl and lit it up, but he hadn't used the pipe right at all and just sat there telling us, 'Yeah, I feel a little strange'. But no laughter. I was really disappointed for him. My other friend tried it next and being a veteran pipe user, got the required dose for a breakthrough, but his experience also seemed to be less like a carnival ride and more like a meditation. There was no laughter, he just closed his eyes and described feeling as if he were riding on the front of a car, driving forward very fast(the same sensation as my roller coaster), and seeing a big fence along the sides of a tunnel(the same as my roller coaster tracks?!?)",
      "I waited until the second intermission of the game (45 minutes later) to do it again, and I had enough time to squeal,'It's happening again hahahahaheeeheehheee', before the ride started all over!!! Again, laughing in disbelief, and the disbelief making me laugh. This time though, I felt a little embarrassed for a few moments as it seemed like I was acting a lunatic with my laughing, and I knew my friends couldn't relate because they didn't experience the same thing. My friend said, 'You're freaking out the dog!', but rather than let that ruin my rush and turn things dark I just let myself go and laughed and laughed. The Roller coaster was even more vivid. I was in another world.",
      "This was incredible. I think it's all in the dose (of course) - I'm really excited to explore other experiences with stronger and lighter doses. I was disappointed that my friends didn't get the laughing fit - it was invigorating! The closest thing I can think of is having the most incredibly fun carnival ride. I HATE carnival rides! But I've seen people on them that laugh and laugh and laugh until they are exhausted. I imagine it's the way they've trained themselves to respond to the crazy motion and fear, and rushes, and the adrenaline boost! That's what I felt like - one of these people that enjoys the adrenaline rush from riding the craziest, highest, most jolting and life-threatening carnival ride you could imagine.",
      "It was a Super Fun Happy Slide! It helped to feel and believe that I had fully prepared myself by reading up on the drug and other people's experiences. I think I had an idea of what I could expect and that helped me to really enjoy the rush! I can't wait to get back on this ride!"

      "After running out of Klonopin which I usually use help to get to sleep, I decided to seek out natural alternatives. I had read online that combining Melatonin, vitamin B6, and Valerian would produce the most vivid of dreams.  I've been interested in dreaming for as long as I've been alive and this intrigued me.  From what I've learned, people dream every night, whether they remember it or not.",
      "Melatonin absolutely allows me to remember my dreams better than without.  The order of events, sounds, colors are completely available for recall when I awake.  I could write for a half hour about my dreams when I take melatonin before I sleep, while normally I can sometimes remember only bits and pieces. The sensations that I experience while dreaming are unlike anything I could adequately put into words. While the dreams are not what I'd call lucid dreams, they are extremely vivid, and simply different.  I experience, or remember rather, sensations that are so intense it makes dreaming a treat.",
      "As for Vitamin B6 and Valerian - while they don't seem to inhibit the effect of melatonin, they certainly aren't necessary.  I've tested that numerous times."

      "Night before New Years eve, and me and 5 friends decide to go for a nice trip.",
      "We all dropped at our friends house at about 10pm, in the middle of a party. We all dropped somewhere between 1g and 1.5g of dried mushrooms. I didn't notice anything happening by 10:30, so me and a friend decided to do everything that was left. I'm not exactly sure how much it was, but it was about the same as what I had taken at 10. By 11pm I was starting to feel the initial effects, mostly just an unexplainable feeling that something 'big' was about to happen. Like the feeling I get outside just before a huge storm. Everyone else left for a bar at about this time, leaving me and my 5 friends alone.",
      "In the next hour my storm broke. I should mention that this was only my second time trying any drug other than pot, and it was at least 2x the shrooms that I did the first time I tried them.",
      "By 12am I was well and truely tripping. It was far beyond anything I experienced my first time, nearly 9 months earlier. We (everyone on shrooms) were all sitting in a circle in my friend's living room, talking and sharing what was happening to each of us. I didn't share too much, as I was barely conscious at times. I remember listening to my friends talk about trees, colors, dogs. I kept laughing, and each time I started laughing I would stop to find myself laying on the floor with my friends lauging at me. I decided to go hide in the corner, beside a little tree that looked peaceful to me.",
      "I can't say what time it was, as I had lost all concept of it by now, but eventually we all decided to go downstairs and listen to a CD my friend had brought with some trippy music on it. We went downstairs, but most of the guys couldn't stop talking or laughing, so they abandoned the music and went up stairs. I was the last person in the room, and I remember trying to walk towards the stairs but I kept forgetting why it was I wanted to go to them. So I just stood there with my head back and my eyes closed.",
      "While I stood there, I began to notice the clouds and blobs I could see with my eyes closed begin to take on definate shapes. Colorful and intricate fractals started to appear and 'dance' to the music. I was amazed at the power of my mind to create these things that my computer struggled to produce. I watched with awe as the fractals moved and zoomed in to reveal new and wonderful shapes. I couldn't control what I was seeing, but that didn't bother me at all. About this time a few of the guys came downstairs and found me laying on the floor with my eyes closed (note that I don't actually remember how I got there). They tried to bring me upstairs, and I tried to tell them to just leave me. I couldn't talk. One or two words would come out and suddenly the sentence would change and another one or two words of a different thought would come out. I remember KNOWING that it was because I was only partially in this world and this reality. Eventually the guys just decided to leave me down there, with the music.",
      "With my eyes closed and the fractals dancing to the music, I hit what I can only describe as the peak of the experience. Suddenly the music faded away almost to infinity, until I could only barely hear it. The fractals dissapeared from my view and I was floating in an empty void. Remembering back on it, I couldn't even feel my body. I couldn't remember life, being alive, or the concept of existence. I just WAS. Presently I understood that the blackness I was 'seeing' was an empty sky. I waited for what seemed an eternity as blue and red 'stars' appeared in the blackness to keep me company. The sky filled with these stars and a blue cloudy mist that looked much like the Milky Way on a dark summer night. In an instant I could feel myself again, but not where I once remembered being. I was laying on a bed of soft grass. My arms were spread out to each side of me. Above, and around me, statues appeared. They looked like the kind of statues you would see in a church, with serene faces and hands against their chests in prayer. They were all positioned around me in a circle, and seemed to be looking down at me. Suddenly the stars in the sky exploded in showers of red and blue dots, much like fireworks do. As the exploding stars faded from existence, so did the rest of the world. I was, for the moment, back in reality staring at my friends basement ceiling.",
      "I started to get a little depressed about losing the vision I had just been treated to, so I decided to go upstairs. Everyone was watching TV, so I just layed down in front of the TV and tried to enjoy the rest of the night. I didn't have any more visions, but I kept slipping in and out of reality. I remember gasping for breath for no other reason than being able to.",
      "The rest of the night, and my trip, was extremely enjoyable. I woke up the next morning feeling great (despite sleeping on the floor) and can honestly say the experience has changed my life for the better."

    "report": [
      "I have experimented with diphenhydramine for a number of years now, and I figure that it is about time that I share my experience with the world. My usual dosage is 200mg, but I have been known to take considerably lower and considerably higher dosages for differing effects, lower for less of a crash, and higher for more of a debilitating state. And I have never taken over 14 pills, 14 only because at one point I was taking so many that I became tolerant to the effects and required such a high dose for any sort of recreational feeling.",
      "I used the drug, rather the abuse of it, to calm my mind. It is hyperactive, on a normal day I cannot seem to shut it off and this causes me to be paranoid and unstable in my thought processes. Sedatives help alleviate this and so my ride began. Now, this is not to say that everyone would have a positive relation with the drug, simply because I have certain mental oddities I do believe this is one of the only reasons why I can tolerate the drug and utilize it in such a positive fashion.",
      "My mindset that first night was wonderful. I entered the euphoric state within thirty minutes of ingestion. My muscles relaxed, the world became hollow and tolerable. my vision blurred and then my eyes dilated, I became intolerant to light and could see decently in the dark. After about an hour, my body was completely submerged in the euphoric state, pain was lessened, my heartbeat became deeper and stronger, and I experienced a dryness of my facial orifices. Typical, and usually not my concern, however it can be bothersome when my eyes become dry and sticky.",
      "Well, now to the absolute point of my tale. I became musical. Knowingly I am already quite the musical/artistic being, I have my own art gallery online and sport a knowledge of seven instruments, however like the drug suggests, in a hypnotic state one may experience an 'artistic enlightenment', which I did. And do everytime I take the drug. I picked up the flute upon my dresser, and began to indulge in playing every song on my media player playlist! What was more odd, is that I, unlike normal, could hit nearly every note of any song I had beforehand not attempted to play, easily and well. I now understand why some stage musicians delve into drug usage during and before shows.",
      "I've never experienced any amnesia from taking diphenhydramine, although I do tend to find it harder to grasp the right word in any situation now, I am wondering if this is not an after effect of prolonged use.  Also, I am beginning to think I should stop taking it altogether, due to a recent problem concerning the veins in my throat, which dilate heavily and ache everytime I decide to 'trip'.",
      "It is not wise to take these pills for the length of time I have, tripping hundreds of times due to the fact that I have taken them for the anxiety alleviation everyday, for two and a half years now. Also, it is a bit shaking when now I have to punch my chest due to the 'heart flutter' which aggravatingly flares up everytime I trip. I have also become dependent on them for sleep on workdays, I'll stay up till five in the morning on any given day, and have to trip hard in order to get any sleep. My circadian rhythm is so messed up from tripping that it doesn't know when to sleep, and when not to sleep. After a 16 hour sleep binge, I will wake up for four hours and grow weary again, falling back to sleep for another 10 or so hours.",
      "In my heyday with the pills I have taken them and been so educated with their effects and the time it takes for the hypnosis to set in that I've binged on them, gone to the store with my mother, and been although fried out of my gourd, completely cognitive and with mental understanding. However unlike the described symptoms suggest, I becme very untalkative and withdrawn noticeably, rather than social. I have also much to my embarrassment, become unbelievably 'in season', contrary to the symptom of decreased libido, described. Instead of a decreased libido, it became quite increased, perhaps that is because I am normally all but dead down there? Who knows.",
      "Also, I have gone through a rather uncaring phase where I would binge on the pills, and then synergize by consuming alcohol. Now, this was stupid I agree, but the effects? They were quite fun. Now that I think about it actually, the reason I did this is because of another horrid symptom that I experienced. The feeling of decreased temperature. I became extremely cold, now I'm cold to begin with, but see nobody should donn flannel in the summer heat of the south. You see what I'm saying?",
      "Anyhoo, being the chemist I like to think I am, to counter the effects of the feeling of frigidity which I knew wasn't really a decrease in core temperature, but the effects of the drug making my body think that I was cold, I drank liquor in the knowledge that liquor makes your body think its hotter than it really is. The result with the right amount, was a settlement to the confliction of thermal instability.",
      "I have also used these pills as a coping mechanism for certain sensory disturbances. I become easily aggravated by cacphonus auditory assaults, and with diphenhydramine in my bloodstream, this became null and void. I would take them, and the bell that bothers the heck out of me at my place of work, would no longer shake me.",
      "The positive and negative effects of the pills have pretty much balanced out, but I do believe that I have decided that should I wish to keep my life, I should stop my habitual indulgence in them. But it was a good run while it lasted."

      "Curiousity led me to try it. I had gone to the smoke shop to buy a new pipe the night before. I noticed the salvia inside the showcase, but I told myself not to buy it yet. I was hesitant because I'd heard so many stories of bad trips. I once heard of guy who saw his dead grandmother. He said that her skin fell off. I'd also heard less scary stories but still bazaar experiences nonetheless. My friend warned me about it, but the curiousity was eating away at me ever since I bought the pipe. I returned the following afternoon to buy it. One of my roommates was here when I got back. She had never heard of salvia. I explained to her what I've been told about it, and I wanted her to watch me do it in case something bad happened. I had never taken a hallucinogen before this incident, so I had no idea what to expect. I figured I would have some sort of vision or see nonexistent things. I thought I would be able to sit back and escape reality for a few minutes. I was very wrong.",
      "I packed the salvia neatly into my pipe and set it on the table. I told her that we could watch Wonder Showzen. I thought it would enhance the experience. It's pretty much the most twisted show ever created. Full of sarcasm, social commentary, and most of all cruel reality. I was quite excited to watch it during my trip. I popped in the dvd and proceeded to smoke my pipe by the balcony. I slid open the door to blow the smoke outside. I took my first hit, released, and stood still for a few seconds. I wanted to turn around to tell my roommate that salvia is bull because I didn't feel a thing. I stifled my comment and stared at the pine tree in front of me. I thought if the salvia started working its magic that the tree would turn into something crazy.",
      "I wanted to give it a chance, so I took a second hit. I don't know if I was doing it improperly because I didn't have anyone experienced to direct me. I inhaled it like weed and held it in for ten good seconds. As I exhaled I could've sworn my brain hit the back of skull. A wave rushed over my head, and I stumbled backward. I turned around and tried to look at my roommate. She was sitting on the couch, but I couldn't see her. Everything was so unclear. I tried to walk slowly. Instead I rushed to sit down in panic. She though I was faking it. I was trying not to alarm her, or what I thought was her. I was there next to her, but I was just a shell. I looked out into an unfamiliar, blurry distortion of what I thought existed. I expected to see crazy random things. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I couldn't see anything at all. It was a kaleidoscope so intricate that the pieces were not visible to the naked eye. It was as if a computer took all of its pixels and scrambled them into some random configuration.",
      "I could make out certain things through relative space. I could hear the tv loud and clear. I wanted to close the lid to the salvia before I spilled it everywhere. I completed that task. I also put the pipe back in its protector. I stuffed it in there still half full of salvia. I wasn't aware. I just didn't want to leave anything for my roommate to clean up. My roommate had gotten up, but at the time I didn't know it. She was spraying the room to get rid of the smell. I had no idea that she had done that until after the trip.",
      "I saw her eyes focused on me. She was standing up next to the couch. She asked if I wanted to be taken to the doctor. She turned into a giant spinning blur. It was like an excellerated version of the Disneyland tea cups. She wouldn't stay still. I could only see her eyes. She told me that I stared at her blankly. I blurted out 'no'. It was all that I could gather enough thought to say. She asked me a question. I don't what she asked me, but I thought she kept repeating it. I couldn't understand what I was being asked. I know that I tried to tell her - You keep asking me the same question over and over, but I can't understand it right now. It didn't come out right. My motor skills were shot. Panicking that she was going to try to take me outside (shudder), I slammed my hand on the couch and yelled - NO! Sit down.",
      "I could see the tv screen come in and out of focus. I saw the little boy punching the meat at the butcher's shop. That wasn't a hallucination, that was really the show. It scared me even though I had seen the episode more than once. I stood up in a frenzy looking around. I thought my bed would fix it. I felt worse when I stood. It felt like the sudden falling sensation that causes me to gasp and my head to jolt right as I'm about to fall asleep sometimes. It was worse than that. The sensation was neverending in addition to being amplified ten fold. I told her I was going to my room in an akward way. I wanted to say bed, but the word was nonexistent in my new vocabulary.",
      "As I entered the room my b/f called me. I heard my phone in my purse. I ran over to it. I couldn't find it. I threw my keys out. I was panting. I soon realized that I was suffocating. I didn't want to talk, but he would get mad if I ignored the call. I finally found the the phone and answered it. I don't know how I managed this, but I climbed into my loft bed with the phone in my hand. I can barely do that when I'm sober. I flopped onto my stomach. I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating that he called me or if it was real. I tried to seem as normal as possible because I knew he wouldn't approve of what I was doing. I could barely hear his voice. I told him I was lying down. I asked if I could call him back later and hung up.",
      "The bed didn't fix me. I was uncomfortable. I'm normally a cold person. I always have chills, but I was boiling. I was suffocating and on fire. I heard the phrase - STAB YOU, STAB YOU, STAB YOU! on Wonder Showzen. My roommate was still watching it in the other room. That was last thing I need to hear. I started writhing on my bed. I decided it would be better to get up. I literally leaped out of the bed to the floor. Keep in mind that my bed is practically next to the ceiling. I pretty much jumped seven feet off of my bed with distorted perception and no sense of my surroundings. Luckily I wasn't injured. I didn't even feel it. I rushed into the room where my roommate was watching the show. I yelled at her to turn it off. I didn't mean it to sound rude. I couldn't get anything out but the simplest of commands. It was like I had become temporarily retarded. I didn't want to hear the show because it was scaring me. Then I got an idea.",
      "I would feel better if I emersed myself in water. I fumbled around to the bathroom. After I finally got the hang of the light switch I forgot why I was in there. I turned it off and ran out. I'm glad I didn't do what I intended to do. I was going to try to take a cold shower. Nevermind that I was wearing a shirt, a sweater, a belt, jeans, and red leather shoes. I went over to my roommate's room to try to apologize. The words wouldn't come out right, but I think I got the idea across. That falling thing wouldn't stop as long as I was standing. I told her that I was going to my room. I meant to say bed, but of course everything I said sounded like gibberish anyway. I ran back to my room and turned the light off. I ripped off my pants like I was in the NBA. Then I whipped off my belt, threw off my sweater, and kicked off my shoes.",
      "I can't sleep with doors open. I tried to close my closet. It wouldn't close. I jumped up and down trying to force it. I was losing it. Then I realized that one of my shoes was lodged between the doors. I removed it and slammed the doors in fury. I began to climb up to bed. I went to pull the sheet back but ended up ripping up the sheet that covers the mattress too. I flipped out. Bunched up sheets and ruffled covers are one of my HUGE pet peeves. I yanked the sheet down into submission. It was going to be tucked around the mattress if it was the last thing I would ever accomplish. After my epic battle versus the sheet I crawled into bed and covered my head. I rolled back and forth trying to rid myself of this intensity. It lasted almost twenty minutes total. I kept thinking 'Why do people do this to themselves? Will it ever end?' That was the moment I realized that I had actually done something to cause this mindless, panicked state. I didn't realize I had been on salvia. I instantly felt better in ten minutes.",
      "This trip made me appreciate life. I have never in my life been so panicked and scared. I had never felt so close to death. I thought I was stuck that way. I've read and heard about many people's experiences with salvia, but I've never heard anything like what happened to me. That's some powerful shit. I had never imagined that anything could ever feel like that. It was a feeling that I can't put into words. It was a terrible and tragic new dimension full of vague figures and failed communication. I do not recommend that to anyone. I don't know if I would ever do that again. That shit should be illegal."

      "So last night I went to a rave. I can honestly say that I've never been so euphoric, nor excited in my whole life. The amazing this is, I didn't consume any illicit things until AFTER the rave. The whole time I was there at the rave, I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I am to live in the world I do, to know the people I know, and to think the way that I think. It's truly given me some major leeway with my plans for the rest of my life, because I feel like I understand the true emotions I once held far and away. But the rave was only the beginning for what my friend and I had in our near futures.",
      "After leaving Cece at 12 (I wish I coulda stayed), we were outside and my friend was having trouble opening his car door. I mentioned that I was a little bit frustrated we didn't find ANY substance at the rave, and at almost that instant, the girl (I think Ashley was her name) that I didn't know came up to me and offered a bit of speed, 30 mg. Naturally, I was hesitant at first to try the drug, but I was not going to leave that night without some sort of substance to explore my own mind with. So I bought my capsule, and my friend and I went home in his BMW going upwards of 120 mph listening to hardcore techno only to find his mother still awake. We had planned to leave back to the rave after she'd seen we were home and she'd fallen asleep.",
      "She didn't fall asleep....ever. But it's neither here nor there, it's not important.",
      "Anyway, we got home and put on Infected Mushroom (techno) and I went into his bathroom to take my speed. Pop, in my mouth. Easy. Twenty minutes pass, I feel nothing.",
      "Thirty minutes are now past, I still feel not a shred of anything.",
      "Now I'm sitting here upstairs with my friend talking about how fun the night was, and in one large sweeping feeling throughout my head, I feel suddenly euphoric and had an overall feeling of extreme well-being. The things we talked about ranged from girlfriends, to the human psyche, even to the way government is lying to us (Theory). I can honestly say I've never felt so amazingly happy than I did during those twenty minutes upstairs. It was during this twenty minutes in which I felt mentally invincible. I could tell my friend anything.",
      "I told him my story of the rave, in which he was very interested it seemed, and moderately impressed by. Now I'm at the end of my story, I can barely keep up with my thoughts, words come out slurred and jumbled. My brain is a frenzy of light and color that I can't explain with any other phrase than 'Brilliant Fuzziness'. It's at this time when my friend and I give up on going back to the rave, because his mother inevitably won't sleep and will therefore catch us sneaking back out.",
      "We go downstairs to listen to more music, and watch the iTunes visualizer (Very VERY trippy). I feel fuzzy and warm inside, I feel completely content with my situation, I feel invincible. Words, phrases, stories start spilling out of me, all of which Darin (My friend) is completely interested and helpful with. I tell him again how seriously euphoric I am, and he says he understands. An hour passes, and my mind races relentlessly from one topic to the next, going off on tangents, and occasionally, completely malfunctioning because of an overload of information.",
      "I tell Darin the story of how I met Caity, and our relationship. I tell Darin the story of how I really never was happy until now. I tell Darin that he is the best person I'd ever met, I feel like unraveling an entire chain of events and actions that have taken place, just to prove this fact that yes, he is an amazing person.",
      "Around 3:30, my mind is simply too packed full of both useful and useless information, so I take a break from my constant ramblings. Darin begins to speak. I understand perfectly what he's saying, I can keep up with his train of thought, everything around me is finally in focus, and I see and embrace the truth in my life, rather than always running away from it.",
      "Now it's 4:30. I begin to feel myself drift away into a positive state of sleep, but I'm woken up (willingly) by Darin to continue our conversation. It's during this time that I decide to finally stand up and walk around a bit. What was I thinking, it was fading? The head rush I get pushes the trip back into motion and I'm off in a rambling of words once again, Darin listening and discussing all the while. The stories I've already told spill out once again, I feel complete.",
      "Now we've gotten to the point where we literally have nothing more to talk about, because we had spend five straight hours continuously talking about everything. Again I feel the positive sleepy feeling, and this time I'm forced to give in to it, being immediately enveloped in a relentless frenzy of colorful dreams. As soon as I lay my head to sleep, I awake from the insane hallucinations being played over and over again like a projector on my eyelids.",
      "It's the morning. The dreams I had been having recreated themselves in my conscious vision. I feel afraid, but not in danger. I rouse myself from the sleeping bag I'm encased in, and a feeling of total relaxation and contentment surrounds me. This is the end of my journey. I'm a changed person. I feel...different. I have feelings of trust, feelings of love, feelings of admiration toward certain people in my life now, but it seems futile to let most of these people know about these feelings, because they're not ready to understand what they feel about themselves yet."

Some were eaten, some were given away, I ended up with about 15g of them left in the bag. I ate 7.5g one weekend, had a really intense, but great trip. Three weeks later, I ate the last 7.5g. To say I was unprepared is a mild understatement.",
      "I had not eaten in a little over 24 hours. I consumed all the mushrooms and threw away the bit of 'shroom dust' that remained in the bag.",
      "T+0:00: Mushrooms eaten.",
      "T+0:15: First alert. I turn off all the lights, computer monitor, sit on the sofa, and prepare a 4-cartridge balloon of nitrous. As I prepare it, in the dark, I seem to be enveloped in a large hollow sphere which had tribal symbols swirling all over the inside of it in glow-in-the-dark color, and is closing in on me slowly as I prepare it. When I put the balloon to my lips, the symbols/sphere rush inside of me. I am wearing clothes at this time.",
      "T+0:30??: I am no longer wearing clothes. The lights are on. Why am I in the bathroom? More importantly, what's that sound? Suddenly, the memory floods back, sort of. I was laying on the couch, laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing... and then I had to poop, so I went to the bathroom, still laughing maniacally. This wasn't just a chuckle laugh, or a belly laugh. This was the 'I'm totally batshit insane and I don't care who knows about it' laugh. I walk out to my computer through doors whose frames are swirling about in mischievious ways.",
      "T+0:45: I only know this time because I looked at my chat logs, which show what time I dosed and was talking at (since I said it in there). My chat logs show me TALKING IN CAPS SAYING HOW I WISH EVERYONE COULD FEEL LIKE THIS with a lot of repeat letters. I remember not watching the keyboard because my face was down on the desk. I wanted to chew on something, so I just started chewing. It felt really good, so I got down and started chewing on the desk. I told everyone in chat about how awesome that felt and how satisfying it was to be 'eating the world'.",
      "Suddenly, a revelation struck me. What I was feeling at that time, this absolutely indescribable feeling of what I can only call 'CONTINUITY', was that I was riding the crest, that I was having all the fun in the entire universe, that the reason that there was so much suffering in the world, was because I was having all the fun. I started to feel really bad about the fact that I was just sitting there when I was having all the fun in the universe, instead of actually doing something fun, so I jumped up and down and ran around my crappy apartment until I got tired and laid on the ground. Through this entire experience I was chewing happily on whatever was in my mouth.",
      "Some time passed. I went to get up, and I couldn't move. The only way I could move was by chewing, eating. I had to swallow some stuff too. I was perceiving in 2 dimensions. This was very remarkable to me, and I wanted to share it with the world via my computer. So, I start chewing my way over there, along my floor, to the corner, where a little bit of the world leaked out of my mouth, up the wall, over the underside of the desk, and up.. ahh, there's my goal. I turn on the computer monitor, and realize my mouth is full. I should do something about it, and I figured that since the stuff inside my mouth was the same stuff as on the outside of my mouth, I would just exhale or whatever, right? I'm not sure if I've been clear on this, but all boundaries between myself and the rest of the universe had been crushed. So, I get rid of the stuff that's in my mouth, and then there's blood all over my monitor and desk.",
      "Wait, WHAT?",
      "So, there's blood all over my monitor and desk. At this point, I realize that it is coming from my mouth, and that wasn't the universe I had been chewing on. It was my cheeks. Or maybe they're the same thing, really. I get some paper towels and clean up the worst of the mess. At least now I can see what's on my screen without there being lots of blood in the way. The dirty paper towels are shoved down the garbage disposal. (I find those the next morning.)",
      "I stared at the time on the computer for about 5 minutes, perceptively. I knew that I wanted to know how much time had passed since I ate the mushrooms, and I could read the numbers on the screen... I could tell you the name of the symbol, but I could not tell you what time it was. I was rather freaked out, both by the blood and by my nonchalance in the experience. I mean, my cheeks didn't even hurt, how could they be gushing blood like this? At this point, I decided that I was immortal and went into the bathroom and started licking the electrical socket in there. A few seconds into this routine and it occurs to me that if this doesn't kill me, it will probably hurt a lot and be very unexpected, so I decided to do something much less unexpected... which brings me to the part where I beat the hell out of myself with a 4'x4'x3' post. I had a large number of bruises, cuts, and splinters when I got tired of this and started really coming down 45 minutes later.",
      "I smoked some pot after that and started to relax and think everything was okay. An hour or so later, I got tired, and went to bed.",
      "Now, I've discussed what I did to some extent, but I didn't really express what I was going through, or feeling in that time. A lot of that is because it doesn't bear being put into language very well, but I'm going to do my best:",
      "CONCLUSION",
      "==========",
      "Throughout this entire trip, I felt this endless momentum rushing through me, and I tried to focus on it at different times through the trip. What I perceived from the momentum is that it is not a single unit of momentum rushing at insane speeds, but the combined momentum of countless tiny little pulses. Each pulse would start out as near to nothing as it can get, and it would build and build and build to a shouting climax, after which it would ebb and recede away.",
      "That same sort of arc is the life cycle of every single thing in the universe, including the universe itself. It grows, and grows, and it may change in time, but then it starts to get old, and ebb away, and grow less and less, until it forms back into that whence it came, nothing. It is a natural phenomenon, and both to be parted from (birth) and reunited with (death) the perception of this universal particulate momentum is a joyous event.",
      "I cannot overstate how important of a discovery this was for me. I see reflections of that insight in almost everything I do on a daily basis now. I see it in the world power cycle of the United States, I see it in the birth of a child, I see it in a growing corporation, as well as in dying ones.",
      "We are all transversing the same wave in the universe, but we are all at different points on the wave, and thus seem incomprehensible to one another. We have laughing fits when we trip because everything is really so ridiculously simple that we don't understand then why we don't understand when we're sober.",
      "It's taken me a long time to organize this enough to write it, and some details have probably been forgotten since the experience, in August of '06.",
      "Oh... I almost completely forgot to mention the aftermath. Turns out I chewed my way about 2/3 of the way through the insides of my cheeks. Couldn't eat solid food for about a week and a half, and had to rinse my mouth with peroxide every hour or two or it would start burning like hell. The cuts, bruises, splinters, etc. all healed up fine by themselves. IMO, that wasn't stupid shit I did because I was tripping... I look at it as the price I had to pay to receive that insight. Worth every single peroxide rinse."

      "I ground 18 grams of Mimosa Hostilis root bark and 6 grams of Peganum Harmala separately in a coffee grinder. I then blended five lemons and added the pulpy solution to a stainless steel pot. I added the ground Mimosa Hostilis to the solution and began the boiling process. I lightly boiled the mixture for twenty minutes and then strained it through a t-shirt. I repeated the process two more times, each time collecting the liquid in the same container. After the third extraction I discarded the depleted Mimosa material and returned the cumulative collected liquid to the pot and boiled it down to a small, drinkable amount of liquid.",
      "I set up my trip area with blankets and pillows on the floor, some plants, including a small tree and a large selection of didgeridoo and tribal drumbeats music. I turned off the lights and lit candles. My girlfriend and I prepared the pre-ground Peganum Harmala into two equal piles of three grams, added each pile to a glass of water respectively and consumed. Fifteen minutes later, I ingested the equivalent of nine grams of Mimosa Hostilis in my prepared tea form and my girlfriend consumed approximately six grams. I immediately felt I had to vomit, which is unlike me, as I have a stomach of steel.   ",
      "We lay down on the blankets on the floor and relaxed as we waited for the effects to kick in. About 20 minutes later I began to feel brief, intense waves of psychedelic activity come over me. Poignant words like Love, God and Christ overwhelmed me as I shuddered at their outstanding profundity. At this point, I would momentarily lose sight of myself and ever so briefly lose my grip on reality. I began to think that maybe I had gotten in way over my head and that this could be a life changing experience. I remembered what it feels like to trip hard and although not at this point yet, lose complete touch with reality. I had a complete mental block. I couldnt remember why I had done the Ayahuasca.",
      "The effects elevated. The tree I had put in my room earlier was now methodically moving its branches, paralleled only by one prior mushroom experience, where I witnessed an identical display of trees showcasing their celestial dancing abilities. I could feel the tree using its strange energy to pull me, almost invite me to enter the DMT universe. At this point, the intoxication was strong and borderline frightening. I hesitated and closed my eyes, only to be greeted by intense, vivid closed-eye visuals of fierce animals with gnarly expressions, mostly big cats. One tiger-like cat with bright, almost electric purple tentacular rays of brilliant energy emanating from its body really stood out in my mind. I began telling myself, its okay, you can control this, you are in control, I turned to my girlfriend and told her not to panic, that everything would be over eventually, but to my surprise she was not experiencing the Ayahuasca to nearly the same degree as I was.",
      "A brief vision of an Amazonian shaman with a jaguar-tooth necklace helped me keep a grip on what sanity I had left. I said to myself, this is what the shaman sees, you are the shaman, you are the ayahuasca. Between the severe nausea, the closed eye visuals of fierce, scary, out of this world big cats and the tree formally inviting me into a universe of potentially endless possibilities, I did what had to be done - I turned over and purged my guts out!",
      "The purging lessened the intensity of my experience, but only enough to allow me to cope with my altered state of consciousness. I felt like my sense of self was being systematically broken down. We turned on some music and I laid back and closed my eyes. I took flight, not in a literal sense, but viewing Ayahuasca visions with my eyes closed is like being airborne somehow, like I am floating through other dimensions. I saw many fierce animals, including big cats, snakes and even for a brief moment, a Native American serpent.",
      "The music started to brilliantly influence my experience. I could feel the didgeridoo throughout my body, I moved to the beat. The frightening imagery ceased, and I was all of a sudden, floating in a magnificent room made of solid gold, overlaid with intricate, mosaic design. In the middle of the room, suspended majestically in thin air, was a giant statue of Buddha. I was overtaken by euphoria. The only word to describe this state was - bliss. Then, as quickly as it began, I was sucked in to the next scene, again seeing images of fierce gnarly big cats and some red and black snakes. Throughout this experience I must have used the phrase Oh my God! about fifty times to describe my state of mind, although it did absolutely no justice to describe the truly revolutionary thoughts and mind-blowing imagery I was experiencing. My mental block was lifted, now I remembered why I had done the Ayahuasca in the first place. Next stop on my cosmic journey was a bright white, infinitely serene celestial paradise I called bliss. I imagined what it would be like to spend the rest of eternity in bliss and it sent waves of giddy euphoria through me.",
      "I was really having some extraordinary, existential thoughts like, what is the nature of reality. We know as human beings that matter is made of particles, which are constantly moving and not solid. Using this principle, we know that objects we see and feel are solid, for example a wall, theoretically cant be, thus proving that the human brain creates a projection of reality that is not congruent with science. This proves that the human brain projects an image of reality that is not entirely real at all. With this said, the tree, which is now moving right before my eyes, could in all actuality be moving like this all of the time, yet my normal conscious brains projection of so called reality, doesnt allow me to see this phenomena. Reality is only a projection of the normal conscious brain, but in no way reflects what is really happening all around us.",
      "With my eyes closed again, I had a vision of overlooking a beautiful gorge with waterfalls on both sides, absolutely brilliant. I believe, had I not purged, the visions would have been so strong they could be conceived as real.",
      "I noticed at this point, that my thoughts had become so deep and complex, that I was arguing with myself. I would start a thought and then interject and begin rambling another opposing thought. It was as if different parts of my brain were in the middle of a heated discussion. My next major break-through thought was actually the answer to all of lifes problems. I remember it clear as day. The Ayahuasca had given me the secret to life and it is so simple. The answer to everything is - love. I realized for the first time in my life that love is the answer to everything and this filled me with immense joy and elation. I became giddy at the idea.",
      "The closest thing I can equate Ayahuasca to is death. During the experience I learned that the physical body is just a shell and Ayahuasca allows one to free themselves from the restrictions of the physical body and sense of self and venture into what I believe could be what the afterlife is like, if the two are not actually one in the same. One taps into something that is literally, larger than life. It encompasses all life, as we know it. It is like an infinite entity, a collective consciousness that is one. It is what life as we know it stems from, our origin the Earths origin. This entitative consciousness, whatever it may be, the Afterlife, the Logos, God, an alternate dimension, may be hard for just anyone to comprehend, but when you get there, it is like you are home. You dont wonder what you are doing there, or how you got there, it is like you are back in the womb with complete recollection. Ayahuasca taught me that there is no such thing as the self, the self is merely an illusion. Everything is one in the same and this thing called life is an intermission between birth and death. Birth is the acquisition of your physical body and death is where your physical body ceases to exist, it is where your soul or consciousness returns to this magnificent entity, similar, if not identical to Ayahuasca.",
      "The music was creating cultural imagery in my head that was most appealing. I wondered how Ayahuasca, and other entheogenic substances, seemed to be engrained with specific human culture. For example, Ayahuasca seems to carry with it images of jungle animals. Is this a product of suggestion? Does researching the cultural use of these substances before trying them influence your experience? Or do these substances create un-biased jungle imagery in anyones mind, regardless of cultural background, or knowledge of the origins of this Amazonian drink? These are certainly the mysteries of Ayahuasca and other entheogenic substances for that matter.",
      "With my eyes closed I saw vivid images of another world. A black salamander with pink splotches and a black frog with blue spots sat atop a vibrantly colored leaf in what seemed like an alternate reality that could be existing congruently with ours. These were no ordinary amphibians, they seemed to be from a very different, alternate reality or other dimension.",
      "The effects of the Ayahuasca quickly tapered off and left me in a state of cosmic awe. After some hasty contemplation I consumed my girlfriends leftover mimosa tea (approx. 3 grams)",
      "Ten to fifteen minutes later the effects began, starting with the now familiar nausea. I stared intently at the tree, which had been symbolic of the entire experience. I was convinced that the DMT spirits had used the tree to communicate with me. They were using the tree as a vessel with which to communicate an invitation into their universe. Again, the tree began methodically moving its branches, using its energy to invite me in the DMT dimension. Seconds later, an entity appeared, vividly, stable and unflinching. My jaw dropped! I turned to my girlfriend and said  Oh my God! I am seeing aliens! The entity looked almost identical to the stereotypical archetype of an alien, large cranium tapering down to a pointy yet rounded chin, only this alien was translucent. Its color was a transparent, yet vibrant, electric alien blue. At first, I was quite frightened and thrown awry. However, my interest in the creature far outweighed my fear, so I sucked it up and just stared in awe at this seemingly real tree entity. I stared at it and it stared at me. At one point, I believed I was possibly staring at myself in an alternate universe. Sort of like staring into an alien mirror and instead of seeing my reflection, having my identical alien self, stare back at me from an alternate reality.",
      "I was sober enough to be describing this to my girlfriend real-time, yet inebriated to the point that this so called hallucination seemed completely genuine. This experience went far beyond a subtle hallucination. It seemed real and shattered any pre-conceptions I held about the nature of reality  truly a mind-bending experience. ",
      "I am quite amazed at the amount of clear, concise, useful information I have recalled from this Ayahuasca session. It was really an amazing mystical experience and I feel that I am taking a great deal from it. I have been thinking about the experience since I had it around one week ago. I still feel very alive. Ayahuasca has lifted me from my boring, mundane pre-conceptions of life and allowed me to see that there is more to life than meets the eye. It has opened the doors of perception. To have a good experience with Ayahuasca, one must do one's research and put a great deal of time and effort in to preparation. This can be a very powerful substance and very frightening, although I did not experience this to its full capacity. Treat Ayahuasca with respect as with any entheogen and you, too, may get to ride the celestial highway.",
      "Peace."

      "Ever since I smoked my first joint, I've always been very interested in drugs.  One thing resulted in another, and ultimately I had tried pot, shrooms, salvia, ecstasy, oxycodone, nitrous, dexedrine, and had combined many of the above.  One day a good friend of mine happened to come into the possession of some crystal meth, and being the person I am, I told him I was very interested in trying it with him.",
      "My friend had smoked it a few times before, and he demonstrated the appropriate method for heating the crystal to the point where it released smoke and inhaling it.  He took a big hit, heated it for me and passed it my way.  After a few big hits, I felt the amphetamine rush many people describe as being the beauty of meth.  The best way I can describe the rush is an intense adrenaline rush, but feeling very euphoric to take the edge off of it.  My heart started beating quickly, and I felt so alive.  Everything felt crisp, any sleepiness I had was gone, and I felt fairly euphoric.  After the euphoria faded, I was left feeling energetic, and everything felt unusually crisp.  The energy was nice, and I could see it being useful if I had to stay up, but it wasn't anything special.  Though it was much clearer than the kind of energy I get from caffeine, and less edgy.  The rush was very nice, but when it boiled down to it, it was just a powerful adrenaline rush.",
      "The experience was nice, but it was not something that I feel any urge to repeat.  The energy was nice, but it isn't worth the health risks, or the potential for addiction.  The rush was definitely a beautiful thing, but when all is said and done, it wasn't all that much better than some of the powerful rushes I have experienced already in my life that have been completely unrelated to drugs.  When all is said and done, it's just adrenaline."

I have only eaten mushrooms 4 times, all in the past month.  I have eaten various doses of them, from a little over three grams, to less than to grams.  I have eaten them in various settings, from a concert, to a home, to a small apartment. The particular experience I would like to talk about was at a friend's home. We had blacklights on, and The Doors, the greatful dead, and some drum and bass house music is what we choose to listen to.  Two out of four people present ate mushrooms.  We had a good time.",

      "I experience terrible headaches of the migraine sort.  The only type of headache i have ever had are migraines.  I often pop my neck and back to relieve tension.  I find when i am on mushrooms that i am very easily able to pop my neck several times in each direction without any pain at all.  I'm not really sure this has much to do with anything, but I figure for research purposes, anything helps.  I will definitely keep track of my frequency of headaches since i have used mushrooms.",
      "I have found the last two times that i have used mushrooms (less than 2 grams of penis envy mushrooms) that i have had an eye opening spiritual experience.  I discovered a lot about myself, and I learned a lot about the world around me this past weekend.  To me, using psychoactives is a very rich spiritual journey.  I have had scary trips too, but in the balance of the universe, there is no positive without negative.  I want anyone who reads  this to be very careful and extremely responsible when using drugs of any kind, Take care of yourselves, and thank whatever God you pray to for these wonderful gifts he/she has given us.

      "I, when the coast was clear, took down all 3 pills (on an empty stomach) at a water fountain.  I proceeded to my first class mildly nauseous.  After about 30 minutes, I began to feel very lightheaded and nervous.  My surroundings seemed surreal...I almost felt as if 'I' was floating aimlessly in and out of my own body.  Concentration was impossible and I began rocking back and forth in my chair.  Shortly thereafter, I found my arms tightly pulled in front of my body and I was pinching my skin, completely disassociated from my entire situation.",
      "My pulse had quickened, and it was weak.  I became pale (as was recounted to me by fellow students).  I asked to go to the nurse, now becoming fearful of my own state.  When asked questions, it took me a very long time to answer (although it felt like a heartbeat to me) and it was hard to sift out unrelated thoughts.  I tried to avoid any incriminating evidence about my friend, who would readily be in trouble should they find out about the source of the pills i had taken.  I was severely nauseous now, in a cold sweat, and shaking.  I was sent to lie down and encouraged to sip on some orange juice, which proved completely useless and ineffective.",
      "I was kept in the nurse's office for about 3 hours, during which I mumbled to myself and had difficulty understanding my condition because of the hyperspeed state my thinking was in.  I was thoroughly convinced that I was going to die.  After this, I was interrogated by our principal.  I, due to a weakened state of mind, blurted out something about my friend.  We were both assigned a special 'drug' seminar.  In the end there were no repercussions as a result of my mistake, but I now have a heightened caffeine sensitivity.",
      "In the long run, the entire event was pointless because all that this dosage caused me was severe panic and fear.  There was definitely a 'high' of some sort, but not a favorable one."

    "report": [
      "I had been reading up on various RC's for a long time now, and at the end I decided that 2CE was the one I wanted to give a spin. From what I had read, it was one of the more 'difficult' of the 2Cs - but also highly regarded, and some even claiming it had the depth/intensity of LSD.",
      "After many months of waiting, my 2CE arrived, and then I had to wait for my scale to get in as I did not want to be eyeballing the substance.",
      "Initially, I was planning on tripping on the Friday, but events of the day didn't have me getting in from class until nearly 10pm, my friend was going to trip with me - but decided not to at the last minute, and I figured - its late, I'm getting tired, and if I take it now - I'll be up all night and be worried about keeping my friend awake, so decided to post-pone it until Saturday.",
      "At around 4:45, I measured out approx ~14mg of 2CE. My scale, I've decided - is not very accurate and it was a bit of a pain to work with. I mixed it in with some juice and down the hatch it went - no taste to note of.",
      "I finished watching The Prestige with my BF - he had decided to remain the 'sober sitter' for the evening. The movie was kind of boring and wasn't really into it, but still gave me something to distract myself while waiting for the come up. I wasn't sure if it was just excitement / placebo, but started to notice initial effects fairly quickly - but nothing overwhelming.",
      "As the 2CE started to kick in, I started to get a vague sensation of having 'a flue', mixed with typical come-up feelings of LSD for me. By around 6:00-6:30pm, I was feeling a bit burpy / gassy / nauseous, but not enough to make me feel bad or like I wanted to throw up. I did have a few thoughts of 'what the fuck am I doing to myself? Putting unknown chemicals into me to make me trip' and started to ponder on my drug-using habits a bit and the 'why am I so into this? Kind of things'",
      "At around 6:30, I decide to hop into the bath-tub, the nausea was starting to go away and I could still feel things rising a little bit more - but starting to taper off. I drew a hot bath, threw on some music and turned off the lights.",
      "The isolation and relaxation helped kick the trip into gear a bit more. I was finding it hard to find music I wanted to listen to. With Acid/Shrooms - pretty much anything sounds great, on 2CE - it seemed to be a little less forgiving I found myself going to stuff with more Rhythm/Melodies and 'flowing' sounds - the jarring mix/cuts/beats of some of the music I have didn't fit well with it. But, with the music that 2CE did work with - it worked with really well.",
      "I was not getting too much in terms of OEVs, but the CEVs were rather nice - saturated, not very neon, they had more of a geometric/fractal feel to them and didn't burst into full-on surreal scenes like what can happen with LSD. In the bath, I felt lazy, relaxed and had surges of erotic sensations - touch felt nice, and I just spent quite awhile swaying back and forth in the tub getting into the music. The peak had hit - and had put me into a nice place. Not as intense as LSD, but enjoyable.",
      "The mental aspects of 2CE were pretty interesting - I almost felt sober, but still in a bit of a psychedelic mind space. My mind could easily wander, but never felt as manic as LSD, or as thought-looped as mushrooms. I could bring issues to the surface of my thoughts, look at them, examine them, but not be involved with them. The best way I can describe it is as 'emotional detachment from logical problems in my life'",
      "I got out of the bath after awhile, and threw on a few layers of clothes and headed outside for a walk. I didn't walk for too long as it was damn cold outside, even when I had on flannel PJs under my jeans, 2 sweaters and a jacket, but it was still refreshing, and got myself lost in my music for a bit.",
      "Getting back in from the walk, I ask my BF to put on Drawing Restraint 9. The first 15 mins of this movie are BRILLIANT -- it was so cool to watch it, it was a visual treat for the eyes, and the rhythm of the soundtrack was stellar. Too bad that once the intro credits are done the movie loses steam and just ends up being 'bjork being weird' - I watched another hour of the movie then got bored of it just ended up throwing on some music for abit and laying on my couch relaxing.",
      "One thing I noticed during the trip, is now and then I would feel 'chalky' like I was just coming down from K. There was a bit of a dissociative feeling, which is why I think I could get that 'emotional detachment' at times - it reminded me of when I mixed LSD+K.",
      "Typically on LSD, I can have a hard time dealing with 'sarcasm' and end up taking things personally if they were meant to be just joking around. But, toss a bit of K into the mix - and I can take things better and joke around with it instead of getting caught up in the 'are they insulting me?!' type loop, and 2CE kind of reminded me of that feeling - that 'just whatever' and not getting all emotional over everything.",
      "All in all, by around 11pm or so I had felt 'pretty much' down - watched some peewee's playhouse, an episode of wonder shozen, then was in bed by around 1:30am or so - slept easily and fairly well, woke up feeling pretty much normal. No hangover, but also no feeling of being 'refreshed' like I do after a hefty LSD trip.",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed the trip and as a '1st dose' - seemed to be right on the mark. Nice to get my feet wet, not over-whelming at all, felt fairly easy to cope with. I'm curious to try for a higher dose next time.",
      "Some of the downsides I'd say though would be.",
      "- Feeling of unease during the come up, and some negative thoughts",
      "- Now and then, it'd feel like my head was 'clogged' - like a night after doing too much K",
      "- A bit of tension in the chest - but this could be a result of smoking weed. I've found weed + LSD, while it can up the intensity of the trip, makes my chest area feel a bit tight and can really feel it in my lungs",
      "- Duration seemed a bit short, this could just be a result of the dose. But, dosed at around 4:45, was not until about 6:30-7:00pm that I had 'broken through' the physical un-ease and got to enjoying the trip, and then it felt like that by about 11pm, I was pretty much down -- there were still some lingering effects / minor visuals / etc, but it felt more like after-glow residuals effects and not really 'tripping'",
      "Then again, the shorter duration can make it more appealing in some ways - as you may not want the long haul of an acid trip for every trip you do. But, I think I'm the only person in my circle of friends who wishes that LSD could last a few hours longer  Everyone else seems to complain that LSD lasts too long."

      "The setting is my dorm room. Its Friday evening. The door is locked to prevent any unnecessary intrusions, the lights are off. I have prepared a small crash pad, a doubled over blanket and pillow, on which Ill lie for the majority of my trip. In the background theres some generic trance mix playing. The window is slightly open for ventilation, as the room has a fire alarm wired to a central system, and Im sure that this going off would make for a very bad experience. Ive done Salvia Divinorum a couple times before, and its always been enjoyable, but Ive always felt that there was more to experience, and have chosen tonight to see if I can change that. Ive never had a sitter, which probably isnt the smartest thing, but Ive prepared the room to minimize the possibility of harming myself, and I feel comfortable with what Ive done. Ive packed a bowl of 20x non-standardized extract, acquired from an online supplier.",
      "Very quickly after the hit was taken, maybe 25-45 seconds, I can start to feel it. I position myself on the blanket. As I lay down, everything seems to be composed of flashing, bluish geometric shapes. Im not sure if my eyes are closed or open, but the room as it was no longer exists. My thoughts seem to repeat themselves over and over, I keep telling myself to let them know that Ive made it back. In the back of my mind there seems to still be a shred of conscious reason, but for the most part Im floating through the geometric madness playing out across my field of vision. My mind doesnt seem to be working the same as it did before. As I recover a bit, I realize that Im pressing my head against the pillow, and the back of my head is beginning to tingle. I raise my hand and it startles me. It takes a while for me to realize that it is my own. Slowly, as if it were my first time, I stand up, stumble over to my dresser, and turn on the lights.",
      "For some reason or another, I pack another bowl of the extract, fumble with the lighter, and take another hit. The harsh smoke, combined with my semi-conscious condition and trembling hands causes me to spill the contents of the bowl mid toke, and I begin coughing vehemently. Again, I collapse on the mat, but I dont reach the same peak, probably due to the bad tokage, just a rush of tingles throughout my body, and a melting sensation, what Ive identified to be the most common factors throughout my experiences with the substance. Im afraid for awhile. What if the people next door come over? What if someone saw me through the window? A car slowly drives down the alley outside, and I become terrified, before slowly calming myself down. I resolutely stand up, steady myself, and pack a third bowl, determined to reach a greater peak.",
      "My hands trembling, I set the pipe down. I was standing up, staring at the visualization on the media player on my computer. A tendril of drool runs down my lip, and I lie down, right before losing all semblance of consciousness. Im traveling through a geometric void. Echoing in my mind is an incomprehensible word. Although it is meaningless, and in retrospect I realize Ive never heard it before, at the time it seemed both familiar and commonplace. I then discover that I am not myself, but looking at my soul from a vantage point outside of anything Ive experienced before. I was contemplating switching to another form or myself, or another representation of self, I guess is the best way to describe it. It was clear at the time, however now it seems pretty cryptic. All of this was very visual, taking place in some removed, vast space, although everything seemed to be composed of intricate, grey, fractal patterns. After this, the experience seemed to climax, although I dont remember what happened then, aside from the pulsing repetition of the same unintelligible word. I think it was yeltres or something to that effect.",
      "As I returned to my body, which seemed to take hours (although clich, the perceived time distortion was this prevalent), I began thinking of my family and my friends with excitement. I couldnt wait to tell them about my profound discovery. Soon I realized that I couldnt tell them about it (theyre all unaware of my explorations with ethnogens, and wouldnt take it well), which frustrated me, but didnt detract much from the overall sense of euphoria that had possessed me. The repeating word seemed to take on a different form, and soon I realized it was actually the underlying rhythm of the track that was playing.",
      "By this point, I was able to stand, and paced about the room in excitement. Colors were more vibrant than usual, and moments seemed to congeal, as if each one were a painting, and I was viewing them as a series, like a slideshow. My hands had trails behind them when they moved. I enjoyed this for a while, still reveling in the euphoria left over from my trance-like state. Eventually I returned to baseline, aside from a subtle afterglow. I wouldnt hesitate to repeat the experience, especially after preparing my mindset and surroundings further to optimize it, and perhaps somewhere where I dont have to worry about smoke detectors or other people intruding. Definitely the most powerful psychedelic experience Ive had to date."

There's also a subtle feeling of being 'on my game,' i.e. increased sharpness/ adaptability. In general I feel like I can take on a lot more.",
      "I'm also finding that I can recall memories from my childhood with disturbing accuracies, down to small details, though I'm not sure if this can be attributed to the gingko. This continues on in my sleep, where I've been having vivid dreams about my childhood house, childhood friends etc. which is definitely not normal for me. I hardly dream at all, and usually can't remember my dreams."

It didn't even make me sleepy, and the bottle indicated 1 pill would be enough.  I did some research and found that when in high doses (> 1 gram) there is some mild narcotic activity.",
      "T+00:05",
      "I fasted for 6 hours and thought about how many I should take.  I decided to take all the rest (26) as it seemed like a relatively safe drug.  It has a really bitter, almost phlegmy taste.  I managed to get down all 26 without vomiting.",

Lying in bed was very comfortable, when I got up to get a glass of water, I felt like I wasn't really walking, like I was still in the same place.  It was a vaguely disconnected feeling, but nowhere near intense.  I also realized I was breathing slower than usual. When I finally feel asleep, I have very vivid, realistic dreams.  Kava + Valerian was a very subtle combination, almost unnoticable.  It wasn't worth paying for, but it's still an interesting experience."

      "Then again, I suppose everyone has their hobbies.  Some work on their cars, some follow sports, I like to see things and feel good.",
      "I don't condone intra-veinous drug use.  I believe that after the first real IV hit of a drug, one can begin to develop an affection for the needle.  After I injected OxyContin for the first time, I began dabbling with injecting every drug I could (with proper research beforehand, of course).  Pushing chemicals directly into my bloodstream is completely different than any other method of drug administration.  What makes it that way is simple:  the head rush.  A head rush is a damn hard thing to ignore, and once I experienced it, it was very, very hard to forget.  It lingers in the back of my head, even while I may be happily sedated on other drugs, I know that I've found the best of the best, and I feel like I'm wasting my time and money on anything else.  And thats how the slippery slope starts.",
      "On to my first IV experience....",
      "My friend and ex-heroin addict, A., picked up two OC's from Rochester, not far from my CNY town.  I had expressed interest in shooting up to him previously, and he ran me through the basics.  I agreed to shooting with him, as he had recently procured a clean 10-pack of 100-unit insulin single-use needles.",
      "He warned me that a whole 80mg dose of OxyContin could be dangerous to some first time shooters, so I told him about a time 6 months earlier when I had insuffulated 60mg of OC and drank a fifth of rum, and the worst that happened was vomiting.  Besides, I was gung-ho about it at the time.  I wanted my first hit to be memorable, I had no fucking idea.",
      "He broke my 80mg tablet of Oxy into 4 similar pieces and placed them into a spoon.  He then pulled 85 units of clean water into my syringe, and squirted it onto the pill.  Next, he cooked the pill with a Bic until there was some bubbling and a faint trace of steam above the mix.  In one motion, he crushed the cooked pill with the back of the plunger, and it squished down into the mix.  Last, he placed a tic-tac sized cotton piece in the spoon, and drew up roughly 70 units of liquid oxycodone into the syringe.",
      "I tied my right arm off with my belt, pulled it tight with my teeth, and let him spot the vein.  He inserted the needle head, pulled back blood to indicate a clean vein hit, and pushed the plunger down as I let loose the tie.",
      "INSTANTLY, I felt my first real head rush, and let me tell you, it was insane.  All at once, the tension in my body released, and I fell back onto a pillow, and stared at the ceiling, enjoying the incredible wave of warmth that surrounded my being.  It was as if God himself reached through the clouds and granted me total bliss, without any responsibilities or worries.  The world was suddenly right, and all of the suffering of humans no longer mattered.  I distinctly remember it as the most euphoric moment of my life.",
      "The Initial head rush stayed with me for about a half hour, followed by the easiest, most settling opiate high I have ever known.  Small things like smoking a cigarette, or taking a sip of hot coffee would intensify the euphoria.  Even vomiting (which I did on 3 occasions that night) brought the head rush feeling back for a little while.  I was laughing hysterically the whole time I was throwing up.  While music was enjoyable, I remember not really caring about my surroundings.  I could shoot OC and heroin in a completely dark and empty room and still have a blast. ",
      "That is actually the testament to the true power of shooting up drugs like OxyCodone and Heroin, the pleasure from the high is so intense that addicts are able to accept the fact that their lives are shit, that they may lose everything in the end, and not care.  They accept their lives no matter how ridiculous the circumstance, and just keep pushing and pushing to stash more, because the high is literally that good.",
      "That was my first experience with shooting up, in October of 2006. ",
      "Since then, I have put Cocaine, Morphine, MDMA, Methamphetamine, and Heroin into my arm.  I have even shot whiskey and sometimes warm water just for the act of using the needle. ",
      "I spent my student loans and scholarships real quick.  Then I dropped out.  Then I sold everything.  First to go was the iPod my dad bought me for Christmas.  Then my Xbox, games, movies, and even my baseball card collection.  Then I started stealing.  I'm still stealing.  My arms are sore and they look like shit.  I'm in the kind of weird junkie phase right now that would prompt me to write this, and think the last 5 months over.",

      "Up until experimenting with Salvia I was not a drug user at all on any regular basis.  No tobacco smoking, only the occasional beer and nothing else aside from over the counter antihistamines and pain killers.  About the best feeling I ever got from drugs was morphine during a hospital visit.  But that was because I was in genuine pain.  Although it felt incredibly warm and relaxing, like being back in the womb (I imagined), I had no desire to take it recreationally in the future.  Philosophically I am very much opposed to drugs being illegal.  That power junkies and control freaks would sanction what other people do with their own minds and bodies seems to me a gross hypocrisy.  However, I was still working from the perspectice that drugs were a risky thing that one should generally avoid if possible.  But not having taken drugs myself I felt it was important to see things from the drug user's perspective.  But where should I start?",
      "After reading about Salvia it sounded like something to try.  I am not a party person and something that allegedly lended itself to a quiet evening seemed right up my alley.  The other factor is the legality.  I would rather have tried marijuana first.  Even though it's absurd that any plant be illegal the fact remains that some are and the cops don't care about my personal political views when they're slamming me to the ground and handcuffing me.  So with salvia I could actually buy the stuff online and not worry about the State.  But the real reason is that despite the commonly held belief that drugs are everywhere and that pot is easier to get than alcohol for teenagers, I quite frankly haven't the first clue about where to get pot.  I'm 33 years old fer cryin' out loud, am I supposed to go hang around high school kids and ask to score some weed?  Are there shady characters walking the streets to get it from?  I haven't a clue.  Call me a backwoods bumpkin, but in my town the source for marijuana just wasn't clearly evident to me.",
      "I watched some videos online about Salvia, namely the Sacred Weeds BBC show.  This was excellent.  Instead of the usual image of drug users as a bunch of college-age goofballs acting crazy this was a bunch of stuffy scientist types in some posh English country manor waxing ponderously about drugs.  Much more my speed!  See, not everyone who does drugs needs to be an empty-headed frat boy moron!  It was possible that earnest, intelligent folk were also part of the picture.  This was the type of approach I was looking for.",
      "Eager to give this stuff a try I got all the equipment you need for smoking it and purchased some plain, un-enhanced leaves for starters.  The most objectionable thing was inhaling smoke.  My little sissy-boy, pink, non-smoker lungs just weren't used to this at all!  But I sucked it in as best I could.  Practice makes perfect, right?  The effects I would describe as dizziness and disorientation.  But where are my hallucinations?  Where is the profound connection with the 'spirit world'?  Where is the uncontrollable giggling and euphoria?  Where's the goddamn visual patterns and traffic reflectors!? Did I do this wrong?  Did I get bad stuff?  I felt completely disappointed.  At no time did I leave my physical body and go off on psychedelic trip.  No visual distortion whatsoever.  I was just really dizzy and out of it for awhile and then I went to sleep.",
      "So then I bought some 6x stuff.  Same deal there, except the effects seemed to last longer.  I would say that it felt like my body was being twisted like a large screw, but I hate to even say that because when someone else reads that it comes off as more impressive than it really is.  Who knows, maybe I have completely cocked this up.  Maybe my inability to keep a lungful of smoke in for more than 2 seconds is the problem.  I tried chewing some of the leaves but the taste is very bitter and awful.  What does a guy have to do to see one lousy hallucination around here?  I have tried it about four times in total and not felt any of the things I've read about or watched regarding salvia.  Not so much as a single laugh escaped my lips.",
      "The realization I came to is that the drug experience is only as good as the person taking it.  One has to have this fancy stuff in one's mind before going in.  My problem was that I expected drugs alone to provide the profound experience so many others had described.  Maybe it just doesn't work that way.  I must be too objectively minded for this to affect me in a positive way.  It also made me even more convinced that drug illegality is a pointless thing.  I can't imagine why salvia would be made illegal.  It seems that this drug at least, has no power to take control over a mind and offer otherworldly experiences, much less make the body do nasty, property-rights-violating things that might be grounds for illegality.  I doubt such a substance exists."

    "report": [
      "Background: I am 22 years old and experienced with LSD and Psilocybin Shrooms (More than 7 trips, less than 12. Can't really remember specifics, one acid trip 5 hits strong). I bought some salvia 20x extract (1g) and had smoked a little bit a few times before. Just enough to get some crazy visuals (open or closed eye) and some weird time distortions, but nothing earth shattering. I had started to lose respect for psychedelics/hallcuinogens because it had been a while since my last voyage into lala land and I had forgotten what it was like to be humbled. Anyway, one night I decided to take my vial, a bong, and a butane lighter/torch over to a friends apartment (in the same complex as me). There were about 5 or 6 good buddies there, and we took turns taking salvia hits. Well, I went last (being the provider for everyone else). Here's what happened, in 3 phases.",
      "Phase 1) Directly after I took the hit I realized that I had taken a much larger dose than I had ever before. As I started exhaling I could feel the physical effects kick in. I could also feel my mind start accelerating at warp speed. Suddenly, everything was black. The entire room around me had collapsed onto me and myself and all objects and people in the room were all one, but we were not a consciousness. More or less, I was perceiving the end of my universe, in which all atomic molecules had been infinitely compressed into one point, much like the universe is said to have been before the big bang. I was myself, and yet I was everything else in the universe also. Slowly I started to see again.",
      "Phase 2) As I regained my sight, I realized/percieved that I was laying down on a couch (though I wasn't actually lying down, because there was a friend sitting on either side of me). From my perspective, the couch looked like a piano and the 3 pair of legs on it resembled keys with the lines from the cushion segments and space between the people seated on the couch looking like the sharps/flats (the black keys). The world had a muddy orange tint to it that at the time I somehow associated with the original Super Mario Brothers NES game. My visual lucidity was coming back, and now I started to hear voices of the people in the room. I couldn't understand what language they were speaking, but I knew what they were saying: I was dead. I tried to lean forward and communicate, but I found myself paralyzed. I tried a second time and succeeded, but I had completely forgotten about the capability for speech. This is not to say that I forgot how to speak, but I had forgotten that verbal communication was even possible for humans to perform at all.",
      "I fell backward into the couch in dismay. My mind was screaming 'I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'm moving! I'm breathing. Please...don't let me be dead...' I felt the physical effects of the salvia, which for me is tingling all over my body which feels like little ant bites. All of a sudden, a more pressing issue hit my consciousness. Not only was I dead, but my crotch was on fire because I had dropped the bong and lighter onto my lap and I was burning. I leaned forward and looked, but I could not find the bong or the lighter. I looked on the floor near my feet, thinking I had dropped and broken it. I still could not see it. Falling back into the couch, I realized once again that I was on fire because I had dropped the bong onto my lap. Still, there was no bong. The friend who's apartment I was in leaned in real close to me and asked: 'What are you looking for?' It was the first sentence I had heard thus far that I actually understood as English. I widened my eyes and fell back into the couch, intimidated by his use of communications, and for some reason utterly confused as to why he was talking to me considering I was dead according to them.",
      "At this point I seemed a little more in control, but I closed my eyes and I realized that my whole body was not tingling because I was on fire, but because I was God's right arm, and it had fallen asleep. I opened my eyes and started to cackle maniacally internally. After a couple more minutes of looking around in utter confusion, I regained most of my lucidity. My friend had brought me a glass of ice water and asked me if I wanted to go outside. I did.",
      "Phase 3) I layed into a hammock that he had outside his apartment and we started to talk about my experience. As I recalled the events to him, I began to cry. I realized at this point that it was the scariest thing that had happened to me since one dream I had when I was a teenager (I dreamt that I was falling off a cliff, but instead of waking up right before the impact, I hit the rocky bottom and everything went instantaneously black. The dream still didn't end. I continued to dream the blackness without conscious thought but a sense of time for about 3-4 minutes. Then I woke up). While I was swinging in the hammock, I realized that I was having open eye visuals very similar to a level 3 experience on LSD. These continued for about 20-25 minutes after I went outside. I continued to cry, because I had never been so scared.",
      "All in all, Phase I and II happened over the course of about 10 minutes. I couldn't find the bong because as soon as I took the hit, my friend took it away from me but I didn't know it. The bong had been sitting on the table some 8 inches in front of my legs the entire time. I am very thankful for my friend, of whom I have the utmost respect for. I am also very thankful for salvia. I haven't smoked any since then, which was several months back, even though I still have about 6/10ths of a gram left. Without salvia, I may have lost my respect for hallucinogens and had to be taught the hard way (say over the course of a 12 hour acid trip). I'd much rather have 10 minutes of terror and a long time of reflection than have an entire trip of terror which could possibly ruin hallucinogens forever.",
      "Moral: If I am going to put a chemical into my blood and ultimately into my brain, respect it. Drugs can show me a great time, but they can also show me very ugly things that I may not want to see, but are forced to."

Theyll know what to do if something goes awry. I mean, Hell, theyre the ones that taught me how to do this junk in the first place.",
      "Dude, you good? Bills chuckling, looking over at me through bleary, weaving eyes. I nod, unable to speak. My eyes roll back in my head for a moment, and through the buzz of supersonics raging through my head, I hear Joe chuckle in that labored, breathy laugh I know oh so well.",
      "I fall. Not far, but I know Ive just lost control of my body functions for the next few minutes. I hit the carpet with a thud. Nothing to do right now except shake and orgasm. But this time, this time its different. Something subtle isnt right. I feel it creeping through me, a spoon-warmed heat-seeking missile about to hit my heart and disperse into a million million shards of ecstasy. Its like that every time, and it doesnt matter what any one tells me, theres no way I can capture it in words. This time though, this time, theres something extra along for the ride, something evil, something new.",
      "Bill laughs, a cigarette bouncing in his lips as he says something to Joe. I cant hear what it was, but theyre both looking at me, giggling. Sounds not working right now. The ability to hear should have come back by now. Im deaf, and I think Im starting to go blind, but I cant formulate the words. Im still orgasming, still exploding like fireworks throughout every inch of my body, still raging with fueled fires I have no way of extinguishing except by waiting for the fuels to burn strong, hard, bright and then out.",
      "My hearts doing something. I can feel it skipping. My skin is starting to crawl, but Im still blinding. Somewhere in the distance, I can hear Joe and Bill talking.",
      "Is he OK?",
      "I start to sweat. Ive been sweating all night, that part is normal. This new sweat is nothing like Ive ever felt. My whole body is wringing itself clear of moisture. I know whats happening now. I feel another pop. Im crystallizing inside, I can feel the crusty exterior of a hard candy shell about my person, and I realize I cant move. I open my mouth and cry out, not in ecstasy, but in sheer fear of the reality that has hit me.",
      "I think I just ODd. Im scared, but Ive got to remain calm. Ive got to keep my wits about me. Joe and Bill will take care of this, I know it. They wouldnt just leave me to die here in the corner of this shitty little one bedroom apartment in Kansas City. Theyll get me somewhere. I roll my eyes up at Bill, whos now standing over me.",
      "Fuck, hes blankin out, I catch, as Bill grabs at my eyeball and peers in.",
      "I cant hear Joe, but hes jumping around and moving about frenetically. The coke will do that to him after a while. All he can do is shake and move. Joes saying something, but I dont know. Bills nodding agreeably, and all I can do is watch whats happening from a seat way in the back of the movie theater of my mind. Ive lost control of my other body functions, and am just a guest in a dying shell.",
      "From the echoes of distance and time I hear the word hospital and I know Ill be alright. Bill rocks my head back, and I watch from my seat in the dark theater as he puts a pill in my mouth and rubs my throat until the involuntary action of swallowing is induced. He reaches down and pulls the needle out of my arm, recaps it, and throws it away. I watch from the darkness as my body is hoisted over Bills shoulder. Joes in a craze, ranting and raving about something, and the words cant go to jail ring out into the theater. I sense bounding, which I recognize as steps. Im in the back seat of a car, and its rattling down the highway. The lights of the city ripple past my vision. Theyre taking me to the hospital. I just have to hang on for a little longer.",
      "The city lights go dark, and my fear is amplified by my confusion. My head rolls up on the door handle, and I can see stars through a clear, city lamp-less night. Something else is starting to wave over me in billow rolls of grogginess. Something eerily peaceful. I think back to what we had that night. Joe scored the coke, and Bill brought the heroin, and my",
      "My creeping fear was starting to gallop as I realize what Bill had given to me. I had brought the Ambien for sleep after the nights festivities. I wanted to cry out, but a squeak was all that I could manage. Ambien was the most powerful pharmaceutical sleep-aid on the market. In a few minutes, I wouldnt be awake, and would be unable to awake for the next 8 hours.  It was a drug so powerful, once it hit, I wouldnt care about anything but sleeping.",
      "The car stopped. The doors opened. I could feel pressure at my legs and my arms. I was going cold. I could feel the heat leaving me through the steam of my chest in the cold of the winter night. Joe and Bill stood over me, talking. There was something digging into the back of me. They had placed me on a concrete bench of some sort, and were looking over me, talking and rubbing their hands together in the cold.",
      "Hospital? I said. ",
      "Through the theater, I heard Yeah, Mike, yeah. I felt the wave of sleep coming over me. I couldnt hold my eyes open any longer. I slipped slowly away. There was a sensation of falling a great distance. An explosion of cold forced my eyes open one last time. Cold water was everywhere, pulling me, turning my hard candy shell, cracking it in pieces. At this point, I really didnt care. I was just so tired.",
      "I closed my eyes and let the darkness take over."

      "I had heard that dramamine was an interesting and cheap way to hallucinate. After reading all of the stories on the site I decided to also try this over the counter pill. I smoke a lot of pot and drink a couple times a week, but that is the extent of my experience. With this in mind I decided to eat 6 of the pills. I chose the original formula and made sure I was well hydrated and ate a good meal beforehand. My friend and I both took 6 of the pills and since I knew that people tended to sometimes freak out on the dramamine we also had a friend there who was sober. I am not the type of person to take unnecessary risks.",
      "Approximately 40 minutes after taking them I felt a strong sensation of tingling in my limbs and my speech was slurred. It was neither pleasant or unpleasant, just weird. I sat down to watch television and that was when the drug became unpleasant. I felt strong waves of the drug come through my body and then suddenly I would feel sober. It was extremly difficult to walk and I managed to drop the one beer I drank all over my lap. After this my skin was very itchy and I had repeated sensations of bugs biting my feet. My scalp and face were also itchy.",
      " Talking was difficult because I felt like I was making sense, but my roommates would just laugh at me. They said I was 'speaking drammamine.' It is also important to note that although my roommate was sitting next to me, I could also hear him in the next room talking. Very strange.",
      " The reason I regretted taking the pills was the next day. I felt as if I had gotten the worst nights sleep ever. I had twitches all day and my scalp still itches. Loud music was unbearable and I felt nauseous and crabby all day. I am just glad I only took 6 pills and can only imagine what the hangover must have been for the people who took anything more than 10.  Just watch out for the fucking godawful hangover."

      "Yesterday was the last day of my vacation from work.  I had been planning on going snowboarding, but the weather on the mountain was terrible, so I decided to brew a pot of mushroom yerba mate instead.  I crushed up what looked like a little less than 1/4 oz. of shrooms into the filter of my teapot on top of some yerba mate, then added lemon juice to the bottom of the pot, poured hot water in and let it steep for about 45 minutes.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It tastes really good, and you dont have to swallow all of that indigestible fibrous material.  Ive done mushrooms dozens of times, and have eaten an entire 1/4 oz in the past.  I drank the entire pot within about a 10 minute period. ",
      "The psilocybin began to take effect within about 20 minutes, beginning with a sense of breathlessness, the familiar body buzz, and then increasing intensity of colors.  Soon after, I began to experience more intense visuals, with paisley and fractal patterns appearing in the carpet and the appearance of things (plants, paintings, etc) moving.  My stomach began to feel very uncomfortable due to the high volume of fluid in it, so I decided to sit and meditate while the water passed.  While doing so, my mind began to race.  I was starting to get very high, with incredibly intricate and vivid patterns appearing behind my eyelids when I closed them.  I began to fear how much higher I might get as the psilocybin contained in the water in my stomach was absorbed into my system, but was able to easily put that fear aside.  My thoughts raced around for a while, and I felt much better after having peed a couple of times. ",
      "After I released all that water, I felt very light.  I decided to brush my teeth, and found myself dancing around the lower level of my house while doing so.  After that I looked out the window.  The trees and other plants appeared vibrantly alive, and the clouds swirled and danced before me.  I had my face pressed against the window, simultaneously enjoying the sights, and the sounds of my fingers tapping arhythmically against the glass.  I then went upstairs and began dancing around, my body feeling increasingly fluid and light, and in sync with the rhythms of the world around me.  I was simply enjoying the music being made by the house- the sounds of air in the ducts, water flowing through its pipes, the compressor of the refrigerator all in perfect harmony.  I thought briefly about putting a CD on, and then decided instead to make my own, so I ran downstairs to grab my didgeridoo.",
      "I lay on my back in the couch in my living room and began to play.  I started out with a low hum, and worked up into a steady rhythm.  I soon worked myself up in to a frenzied state.  What came through me can best be described as a grand opus to the pure joy of existence.  It felt as if God itself was pouring through my being and pulling with it all my emotional, sexual, physical and spiritual energies through the instrument.  I could see the path of all the energies of my life- emerging through my mothers womb, traveling the path of my 27 years of life, all emerging in that one glorious period of musical creation.  With my eyes closed, I could see intricate patterns dancing to my music.  My mother was upstairs taking a bath as I was playing.  I hoped at the time she could hear me, but I really didnt care if I was my own audience.  The word awakening occurred to me as I was playing, which is what I decided to title the piece.",
      "After I was through playing, I just sat and stared out the window in a state of shock over what had come through me.  I had experienced a glimpse of pure unadulterated devine power.  I felt that my ego kept getting caught up in that power, and I needed to repeatedly let those thoughts go.  My thoughts began to take off in odd directions.  I began to think of my friend who is recovering from a bad gunshot wound.  Though shes recovering remarkably, and facing her challenge with more courage than I believe Ive ever witnessed, I became filled with sadness in thinking about her.  My thoughts wandered some more in fairly random directions for a while, and then my mom came downstairs.",
      "I asked her if she could hear what I had played when she was in the bath, and she said she could a little bit.  I asked if she minded if I played some more, and she said she did not.  So, I played some more, pouring the sadness I was feeling, as well as the joy and other simultaneous emotions I was feeling into the music.  After playing for a while longer, I felt the desire to build within me to share the music coming through me.  So, I strapped my didge on my back, hopped on my bike and headed for Drake Park, near downtown Bend.  At this point I had come down quite a bit from my peak, but was still experiencing some visual intensity, as well as the emotional and physical energy granted by the mushrooms.",
      "Once I got to the park, I spent over an hour and a half playing for the grass and the trees and the geese and the ducks and the sky and the occasional humans and dogs passing by, which brought me great joy.  I hope it brought joy to the other beings in the park.",
      "I feel so blessed to have had that experience.  First, because I made a quantum leap in my ability to play the didgeridoo.  Second, because I have gained the ability to express myself through music, something Ive never known before, as well as a desire to share it with the world.  Im excited to see what comes of that."

      "It all started when me and my friend (ill call him A) went on a random trip to burlington VT. We went in search of cannabis but instead we came to someone who told us he had 'foxie'. I have heard of this drug before and have always been skeptical of trying it but have always wanted to. I am a very experienced tripper and i would suggest that - at least 10 mg or up - anyone who tries this should also be experienced. Me and my friend got back home and we were very excited about this as we have heard so much about it. I went online to find out the best way to take this drug, and i came upon a post of someone shooting it. As sketchy as it sounds, and yes it sounded very sketchy to me, the report was too good to pass up. The following is my experience with 5-MeO-DiPT.",
      "0:00 - Me and A went to the mall thinking it would be fun to walk around. We shot 5 mg each in the parking lot and proceeded to the macy's entrance.",
      "0:05 - The effects immedietly kick in and the second we walk into macy's we are forced to turn around because the effects are so intense. I see colors, and the most noticable thing was the sound. A lady next to me was talking to somebody else and all i heard was 'waa-a-wa-wawa' me and my friend looked at each other and started dying with laughter because we had both experienced the same thing.",
      "0:15 - driving home from the mall was a very intense - yet fun but not reccomended - experience.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
      "0:30 - we arrived at A's house and decided to do a second 5 mg shot. Immedietly after i had a very intense rush of feeling and colors and it lasted for about 30 min before i went into a trip similar to LSD.",
      "1:00 - i feel now as if i am on MDMA, LSD, and cocaine, i feel great. i am tripping exceptionally hard but at the same time i have a clear head and i can think straight.",
      "2:00 - i now have alot less visuals but i feel as if im on ecstacy and this lasts for a few hours before the effects wear off.",
      "In conclusion, although i have never tried it any other way, as sketchy as it sounds i really enjoyed shooting this drug."

      "I no longer use nitrous, but when I did it was for four enthusiastic months.  I was in my mid twenties and teaching at a university, and I realized how incongruous and potentially retarded such dabbling could be.  Nonetheless, beercans and vaporized weed had become routine, and I wanted something accessible, intense, and cognitively interesting.  Psychedelics were difficult to come by, so nitrous chargers seemed like a good fix.  I preferred huffing them in a balloon (inhaling, exhaling back into the balloon, then inhaling again, recycling like this 5-6 times, or until it was enough) although I also used a pressurized canister intended for making whipped cream and/or sparkling drinks (if you use soda chargers, CO2). ",
      "The effects are well noted, though Ill offer a sketch of its more notable aspects: reverberations that slowly become tactile lead to a paradoxical sense that my body is pulsing organically while numb.  With eyes closed, a singular clarity relieves all pain, anxiety, or confusion even as I am in the midst of an utterly dis-associative state.  Moments of profound insight, though later unusable or un-recallable, often accompany a sense of synchronicity (dj vu, or alreadiness): as though Ive finally recovered a memory that has eluded me forever, yet all along that memory was simply the experience itself, now, in the present, memory and anticipation fused into a recursive continuum (if you wanna hear me get fancy).  Also, I definitely concur with the reported phenomenon of nitrous ghosts: frequently, the bodily and temporal disorganization was such that I would find myself as though in another room with other people, often unidentified.  I would come out of the experience with my eyes still closed, and upon opening them I would be shocked to find myself where really I was and that I was alone.  If friends actually were present, they often reported that I would be gesturing toward non-existent people while in the middle of the experience, and that they thought I was losing it altogether until they had the same encounters while on nitrous.",
      "Ultimately, other than the way in which it focuses me on utterly impossible modes of time, coincidence, and memory, nitrous can be very boring.  However, it is deeply, deeply relaxing, and without the negative experiences Im about to relate, I would probably still occasionally use it instead of alcohol.  ",
      "What went wrong for me was simple: foolhardiness.  I thought, Fuck it.  I can do this stuff and still think.  Lets see how far it can go.  Well, Not far, was the resounding answer.  On appx. 10 occassions, I would use 12 chargers.  On 5 occassions I used a box.  These nights were somewhat closely strung together and eventually it all culminated in a night of 2.5 boxes (I wrote a previous report called My Tinnitus which Ill be updating in what follows).  Ive never talked to someone whos done this amount, although Im sure there are many.  The things is, I need to be able to rely on my brain all the time, and if you know anyone whos done such an amount to cap off a week long binge, chances are they were less than eloquent about it.  Fortunately, Id read enough to know that taking in enough air while using a balloon is important, although not enough to keep oxygen levels stellar ",
      "To the point: tinnitus developed, which I thought was fucked up.  Then, after two weeks of ear-ringing, I went swimming, the pressure clogged my ears, and I found out that earwax build-up was to blame.  An easy cure, and so maybe tinnitus was a mere coincidence.  However, it may have had something to do with the nitrous use since huffing with a balloon leads to frequent, intense changes of pressure in the ear canal and that can promote wax build up.  Therefore, if youve done nitrous and have tinnitus, just plain get your ears cleaned by a doctor.  It helps a lot.  The safety of home cleaning kits is suspect, but Im sure they work too as long as you know what youre doing. ",
      "However, that was just a prelude.  After the wax episode, I called it quits with nitrous.  The minor scare of permanent damage made me cautious.  But then, I began to notice slight numbness in my extremities and an insane twitchiness and tremor, especially while falling asleep (FAR more pronounced than that jerking feeling you get as you doze off: the myoclonic jerk, as its knowna good band name perhaps).  It wasnt enough to derail my life, but it bothered me and seemed unhealthy and, more than that, reinforced an ugly idea that Ive struggled with before: that somehow, the damage Id done was irreparable and that, in being foolish, I deserved it.  That idea seemed so juvenile and puritanical that I was pissed for even entertaining it.  Still, I worried, blamed the nitrous, and decided to go after some B12.",
      "A short bit of reading let me realize that normal vitamins just werent going to cut it, and that what the nitrous had done (if the nitrous truly was to blame) was sort of short circuit the whole system by which B12 gets absorbed and used.  I suspect that I would need something like a B12 shot to reboot my system.  Still, lining up a shot with a doctor seemed tricky, so when I fond out sublingual B12 tablets (dissolved under your tongue) had been developed, I went for it.  The results were immediate and surprising (and certainly suspect as placebo effects).  Nonetheless, nitrous use, abuse, and recovery is a murky, superstitious area, and the fact that this worked at all was a blessing.  My twitching and numbness went away, and eventually I felt great.",
      "Im done with the gas."

      "Now the mindset. I have abstained from alcohol and ALL drugs for four months prior to this experience, and also quit smoking two months prior. In the four months leading up this I began exercising six days a weeks and have gotten in really good shape physically, mentally and spiritually. I run four days a week, lift weights three days a week, and do Yoga and Meditate everyday.",
      "Let me also say that my favorite feeling from my drug history has been either on opiates or MDMA, and I enjoyed them both a little too much in the past. I try to stay clear of them now except for special occasions.",
      "Now onto the experience. I've done Kratom several times before, but this time was special, I fasted for 18 hours prior, my last meal was around 9PM the previous evening. The day of, I went for a 2 1/2 mile run followed by yoga and meditation. I thought around 3PM would be a good time to ingest the Kratom.",

      "4:45 ~ Listening to music sounds like a really good idea right now. I put on a live Jerry Garcia Band disc from 77' and just lay on my bed really enjoying the moment.",
      "6:15 ~ Starting to feel back to normal, I still very happy though.",
      "Overall this experience was incredibly satisfying. What made it really magical was the fasting and the aerobic exercise, and the fact that this was the first time in four months I put anything psychoactive into my system."

I'm not sure of the purity of the material, so I.M. administration seems like not such a great idea ... What is a guy to do? well....",
      "One thursday while sitting around with A, having smoked some DMT earlier in the evening, we found ourselves wanting a little pick me to go dancing at some strange club downtown. I thought about what I could have lying about. my mood for the night was ok - a longtime friend passed away that day, but I try not to mourn those passed and realized a zany adventure is exactly the sort of thing he would have liked. how about some 2-cb? I suggest. I had two doses left, and it seemed like a good occasion, so we got down to it. After scraping it all up, about 40mg of material sat in a lump on the mirror. 'How you wanna do this?' I asked. 'Snort it?' A shook her head vigorously then produced an insulin needle, sans point. 'Ahhh,' I saw where this was going immediately. I got a sharp, removed the point. we inserted 60 units of water and the mass of 2-cb into a container, and after it was dissolved drew it up. 'Ok, here we go' I hadn't tried this method of administration yet and wasn't quite convinced. A went to the bathroom, came back. I went to the bathroom.",

      "at this point I lose all track of the timing of the night, but the roller coaster stopped going up and my body load levelled off really nicely by 10:15. after that, we ended up getting in a car with a designated driver who took us to a crazy downtown club with walls that changed colors and beds to sit on. It was pretty much the perfect environment for a 2-cb experience, all the people looked quite lovely. several more bowls of weed throughout the experience kept things on the warm and fuzzy body high side. I didn't do much dancing, but I watched silly hippies and suddenly it was 2Am, so we went home. I slept well, and felt fabulous the next day.",
      "Altogether, I feel the anal administration method is superior both to insufflation or oral administration. The effects come on in a strong, but not stupifying (a la insufflation) arch, and the duration lasts as long as an oral dose. The best of both worlds, though most people might want to scale down their amount as a 20mg anal dose felt more like a 30 - 35mg oral dose."

      "The first time I did 2c-i was mixing it in a shot glass of water and drinking it. I then went with some friends for what would turn out to be one of the most memorable days of my life. A true plus 4 experience.",
      "At first we just hung out at my friends house and listened to music, I did not notice any effects yet really. We decided to walk to a fast-food place and get something to eat, and on the way there is when I noticed the changes first. Cartooning is the word I use for it. Everything still has the basic shape and form as it would in an unaltered state of consciousness, but it seems as if someone has replaced the color scheme of reality with a color scheme of a 90's cartoon. This cartooning is pleasant to me, and I figure that the entire trip will be mostly visual alterations. Boy was I wrong!",
      "Anyways I ate the food we ordered inside the restaurant but then I got nervous that people could tell I was high so I left and my friends came with me. Walking back to my friends house everything was majorly cartooning and I started to get the first bit nervous that maybe this trip might have more left to it. We got back to my friends house and the music was turned on, the music blew me away! I had heard this song before but never had it sounded near as wonderful as this! Music really sounded infinitely better!",
      "The mental part of the trip really started to set in now. My friends decided to play some video games on the television, but I just laid down and watched. Mentally it was indescribable but I will do my best to try and explain. My parents had divorced and my dad was going out with a girlfriend who later became his wife. When I was in a normal state this didn't bother me, but now that I was high I was realizing just how much it mattered to me. I was having revelations left and right about all the aspects of my life and what I had to do to make things right again. The revelations focused on my family life but they covered pretty much every part of my life, switching from topic to topic in literal bursts of revelations, not aided by myself focusing on a specific topic but switching randomly back and forth between this and that in such a rapid and clear fashion that I got mentally dizzy from it. It was as if someone had taken a firework show, made it into a mental object, and set it off in my head. One moment a burst of revelation would set in about one aspect of my life and the next moment, just as the first revelation bloomed into full beauty and started to fade, a second one would blast off overshadowing the beauty and purity of the first but being itself beautiful and pure. This went on for what seemed like an eternity but I can not even guess at how long it lasted for.",
      "As the 'mental fireworks' started to not be as intense I suddenly got a strong urge to communicate. I informed my friend that I needed to hold his cell phone and he was nice enough to let me. Just holding the cell phone and knowing that I could be connected to anyone else in the entire world with a cell phone gave me an overwhelming feeling of belonging to the human race. I was a mere individual, but I was part of and could communicate with the entire group of individuals that had cell phones if I wanted to, and this meant I was more than an individual I was part of an enormous group of people. The theme of interconnection between me and the world lasted for a good part of the trip, when my friend tried to take his phone back I begged him to let me keep it for the night and he reluctantly agreed to.",
      "After my friends stopped playing video games we went back downstairs to my friends bedroom and the music was still fascinating to me. I got the urge to learn about peoples history and be told stories about them so I could figure out how all of our individual paths crossed in the universe.... forming a sort of three dimensional network where each line in the object represented an individuals path and it was interwoven into it...crossing paths with everyone else that formed the object.",
      "I asked questions about my friends older brother who had been sort of an idle to me in the past but who was unfortunately locked up in a rehabilitation center. My friend gave me a breif description of his brothers life and although I am sure it was a very basic description I felt as if I had total insight into his life. I felt a wave of empathy for him and everything he had been through. True empathy at that, I honestly felt his pain and shared his joy, based only on a short biography that his brother rattled off in a matter of minutes.",
      "Anyways I started to feel sort of sick and went to the bathroom. I locked the door and sat on the toilet with my head in my hands trying to comprehend what was happening to me. I looked at the patterning on the walls and it was rapidly moving and transforming into symbols which I imagined was an ancient Indian language for some reason. I realized that I had been too preoccupied with what was inside my head to realize that the visuals were intense!",
      "Thankfully I did not vomit and left the bathroom. My friends had called up some girls while I was in the bathroom and we were going to go to a movie together in about an hour. We decided to go to my other friends house so he could shower and get ready.",
      "My second friends dad and step mom speak Spanish with each other and I kept hearing them. It was freaking me out that they were communicating and I was unable to understand them. The feeling of not being able to fully communicate, to not be able to fully connect with these people in the same house as me filled me with sadness. I went to another room so I couldn't hear them anymore, and immediately cheered up.",
      "My friends kept talking and I was hardly listening, but I did hear them talk about one of the girls that was picking us up (I at the time did not know who they were talking about). They mentioned she was beautiful and how much everyone wanted to get with her, but that she would never have sex with anyone so it was a waste of time.",
      "The girls picked us up shortly after this. We had driven for about ten minutes when introductions were made. Upon being introduced to the girl they were talking about, I asked (In my intoxicated state) if this was the girl that everyone wanted to get with but who wouldn't have sex with anyone? After an initial grunt of shock we rode the rest of the way in silence. I got elbowed rather hard in the side several times however.",
      "Anyways we got to the theatre and watched some movie, I was paying more attention to the way the light reflected off the droplets of water inside my straw than the actual movie. My high quickly wore off and by the end of the movie I was near baseline, and utterly exhausted."

Blocks of hash sitting on a table waiting to be eaten or smoked. A bottle of jagermeister in my hand and countless women surrounding me. I was in my happy place. Not just imagining it...I was in it. All the bad things I had heard about getting morphine were eliminated. I cant recall it completely but I was then put to sleep but I remained in my happy place. When I awoke it was a feeling of drunkness. Extreme drunkness. I am not an abuser of any narcotics but whenever I need surgery i ask for morphine. I also do not condone the use of heroin or any other injected drug for I think they are worse but it seems morphine is not the worst on that list."

      "I first became acquainted with this drug after a visit to the doctor complaining of chronic back pain. I know how ridiculously hard it is to get any opiate from American doctors so I expected some naproxen or ibuprofen. He gave me tramadol instead and I thought it was just some generic celebrex. When I learned it was a synthetic opioid I was pretty excited, I should admit I have a bit of an addiction to Vicodin.",
      "I got home and after some research decided on 100mg. The effects took very long to come on, nearly an hour. I would have to describe the most overwhelming feeling of this drug as warm and tingly. Unfortunately I experienced no euphoria as with traditional opioids, however it wasn't an unpleasant feeling, just not a 'high' like I'm used to.",
      "I will say that it lasts a heck of long time, 8-10 hours, and is very great at reducing withdrawal symptoms from opioids like vicodin, etc. That is the only reason I keep it on hand. It's similar to methadone, in that it provides a numbing long lasting opiate feeling that hides the nasty withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, as I found out later, tramadol has some withdrawal syptoms of it's own, but I found them to be much more manageable than the restlessness, anxiety and fatigue from vicodin withdrawal."

      "I have written trip reports using another name, but this will be my first report that makes use of the Tryphen name. This trip report is more of a summary of my experiences with 2c-t-2 than a trip report per se. Anyways, I like to start trip reports by mentioning a little bit about myself. I am a male and weigh approximately one hundred and sixty pounds. I have extensive experience with drugs, especially psychedelics. I have used over ten active research chemicals and also several stimulants, narcotics, and ethnobotanicals. The total amount of active substances I have used for the purpose of getting high is somewhere around twenty-two. Not much compared to some people, but enough to allow me to make comparisons with 2c-t-2 in an objective fashion (at least in as objective a fashion as can be done when comparing psychedelics).",
      "The first time I used 2c-t-2 I was fourteen years old. Since this time I have used 2c-t-2 countless times, using batches from several different sources. I would estimate I have gone through approximately 5 grams of 2c-t-2 in the past four years, but this is just an estimate as it may have be off in either direction by a gram or so. I have taken 2c-t-2 orally, nasally, by smoking it and by injecting it. I will write briefly about the effects of 2c-t-2 in general, and then I will write about how the various methods of administration and various dosages affect the experience.",
      "The effects of 2c-t-2 seem to be fairly heavily influenced by dosage, I notice a sort of plateau system as with DXM but not as well defined.  Effects at lower dosage include a general feeling of peace similar to euphoria but not really the same. Euphoria is a word I use to describe extreme pleasure, the peace I get from 2c-t-2 is more relaxed than extreme.  I also notice a mild increase in color brightness and definition, mild tracers and the impression that patterns are shifting or changing the direction they point. At lower doses I dont notice many negative effects, but sometimes will get slight nausea, muscle tension (including jaw clenching) or an uncomfortable body load.",
      "At medium doses it is pretty much the same effects as at lower dosages but more defined and with a bit of a twist. Feeling of peace bordering on what I can only describe as a light Euphoria (although saying you can have light euphoria is sort of contradictory to my above definition of Euphoria as being extreme pleasure, I can not think of a better way to describe it).  Colors are much brighter and more defined, tracers are stronger and patterns morph and shift much more. Sparkles and sometimes a shooting star type phenomenon sometimes occur in thin air (similar to the fractals of 4-aco-dmt but very different at the same time).  I notice some time dilation at this point, but nothing near the amount it is on 2c-e.  I also notice a change in depth perception that is very pleasant to me. I normally dont notice space between myself and an object as existing as something on its own, I usually just notice the items in the line of sight in front of me and how far away they are. On 2c-t-2 I am more aware that the empty space separating me from the objects in front of me is an object on its own. Objects farther away seem to have more detail than they usually will, and my vision seems to focus on a larger area.  Really hard to describe in detail but 2c-t-2 creates a very unique visual atmosphere that I have never experienced off any other drug.",
      "2c-t-2 tends to increase aesthetic appreciation in all doses. At lower doses this is mostly due to the color enhancement, but in medium doses it is an effect of its own, enhanced by color intensification but not dependent on it. I see all things as very beautiful, especially nature related objects. Trees in particular seem breath taking. At higher doses the effect is about the same as it is in medium doses, but I will talk about 2c-t-2 in higher doses later on.",
      "Medium doses of 2c-t-2 also tend to create a feeling of trust. I have on occasion said things to people while under the influence of 2c-t-2 that I would have never told them otherwise.  It opens me up emotionally and simultaneously lowers my social inhibitions, similar to alcohol but with out the dissociative / clouded head effects alcohol seems to have. This can be utilized as a benefit when working through things with people, but it can also be bad if you end up saying something to someone that you dont want to. It is an effect that is not really present in lower dosages but becomes most realized in medium doses.",
      "Music appreciation also starts to become more apparent in medium doses. It is not a very strong effect as compared to some drugs, but it is most definitely real. In lower doses 2c-t-2 tends to not have a huge deal of effect on music (although maybe it has some slight change in the way music is perceived), but at medium doses the effects become much more apparent. 2c-t-2 seems to be more focused on making visual stimuli seem beautiful than it is on making music more beautiful. It is more of a bonus effect than something to concentrate on, at least in my opinion.",
      "Although the positive effects of 2c-t-2 become more defined at medium doses, so do the negative effects. The first time I took 2c-t-2 my only prior drug experiences had been dextromethorphan and marijuana, and the first part of the trip was very nauseating on the border of painful in my subjective opinion of the time (Of course I was comparing it to DXM and weed so had I taken it later in my chemical using career it would probably have been a different conclusion). For some reason the come up was only like this for me the first time I used it, but I still feel the need to include this. Many people have reported that 2c-t-2 has a very heavy body load but in my experiences (minus the first time) it is not really that bad, especially compared to other drugs (higher doses of 2c-e make me just as sick feeling, 5-meo-dipts come down is just as bad as 2c-t-2s for me, 5-meo-amt is by far the more unpleasant experience as far as body load goes).",
      "The negative effects I do notice consist of nausea and intestinal disturbances (gas usually) and muscle tension for the most part. I get tremors in my legs often that are fairly annoying but not painful. The body load is not always pleasant and can get to be pretty annoying, but it isnt as horrible for me as it is for some people. The negative effects at a medium dose are much less than they are at higher doses, but I will get to that in a bit.",
      "At higher doses (for me I consider ~40 + to be a high dose orally) 2c-t-2 seems to take on a very different personality. It is without a doubt disassociating (for me anyways) at higher doses reminding me vaguely of a psychedelic version of DXM. I become fairly cold and this often frightens me adding an edge of fear to the trip. I also become very sloth like and dont feel like moving much, I often will just lie in my bed with a blanket covering me and my eyes closed, usually questioning why the fuck I would choose to do this to myself. The come up is very disturbing, I often get nausea (fairly bad nausea actually), intestinal disturbances (gas mostly) tremors, muscle tension, an uncomfortable body load, feeling of being very cold, paranoia and confusion. One time when I took a higher dose of 2c-t-2 I kept coughing up very thick phlegm and was having what seemed to be difficulty breathing (possibly psychosomatic?), but it is worth noting I had just gotten over bronchitis (although the 2c-t-2 seemed to revive it and also make it worse for the duration that I was under the influence of it.) I have since done some research on 2c-t-2 and found a reference to a study done on 2c-t-2 in rats that shows it may perturb the immune system. This was found on a government website however and they are known to be liars. If anyone is interested in reading this report do a Google search for 2c-t-2 perturb immune and it should not be hard to find the website it is hosted on, I would give the link but am unreasonably paranoid. Needless to say, the negative effects of higher doses of 2c-t-2 are much worse than the negative effects are at low and medium doses.",
      "I have had very dissociative effects at higher doses. I have had the impression that I was on a space ship inside of my body, for example. A friend of mine has had a very similar experience off a high dose of 2c-t-2, he was in a car (not driving) and kept thinking he was on a spaceship. Knowing this may have had a large impact on my similar spacecraft experience. The dissociative effects are not exactly comparable to DXM but the best way I can describe them to someone that has never used 2c-t-2 is Sort of like DXM with a psychedelic twist, but at the same time not. Very shitty definition but it is hard to describe some of the effects of psychedelic drugs, especially when they go beyond color intensification and tracers.",
      "The dissociative stage of high dose 2c-t-2 seems to last for a while and then fall down over a period of time into effects more similar to what one would imagine a high dose of 2c-t-2 to be like. Good color intensification, more attention paid to details, modified depth perception, complex patterns rising out of no where, patterns morphing and twisting, very strong tracers, more noticeable increase in music appreciation but not significantly more than a medium dose, time dilation is increased as far as positive effects go. Negatives are, Nausea (although not as bad as during the come up of a high dose trip), muscle tension and slight exhaustion, tremors, uncomfortable body feelings, intestinal disturbances (gas usually), possibly still a bit of a cold feeling. I also notice memory loss from what happened at the dissociative stage, for example I once came back to my bathroom to find I had sprayed shaving cream all over the place while in the dissociative stage and taking a hot shower.  I only had a vague recollection of actually doing this, I imagine I may have forgotten other things also.",
      "Ok now that we have the general effects out of the way I will briefly mention how the various methods of administration change the trip. These wont be in as much detail as the above descriptions are, but will still give a general feeling.",
      "Orally 2c-t-2 takes longer to set in than any of the other methods, I have heard reports that it sometimes takes up to two hours but for me it is more like one hour give or take a few units of time (I never really timed it but this seems more close to correct than two hours does for me anyways). The come up is smoother than the other methods, but it produces much more nausea. Effects last longest this way, and the trip really seems to have less of a speedy push and more focused on smooth visuals.",
      "Insufflated 2c-t-2 comes on almost instantly for me, and I have never seen it take longer than about a minute for someone to start coming up. It Peaks fully in about ten minutes give or take a bit. Snorted 2c-t-2 *fucking* hurts (pardon the language =P). It burns very bad and the drip is horrible, similar taste to the smell of fertilizer in my opinion.  The trip lasts for a shorter duration and has a much more speedy push to it in general, much more stimulating effects. Seems to me as if it is a good deal less visual for some reason (perhaps the smaller doses dont fully allow for as much of a visual disturbance) but much more of a stimulating trip. Seems as if muscle tremors and tension may increase slightly as compared to the oral method, but the nausea is a good deal less (especially at first). At least in general.",
      "I.V. Injection of 2c-t-2 is very similar to snorting it. I have only done this a few times and each time I did it was on the same day. I was very disappointed actually, I had read a wonderful trip report regarding injected 2c-t-2 and was hoping my trip would be similar. It was not at all similar even though I injected it a few times with in the same day. It was a lot like snorting it but with out the burn and drip. It was a bit different than a regular snorting trip, but only in small ways. It seemed to be even less visual than snorted 2c-t-2 (again leading me to think this is because of the smaller doses) but was more stimulating than oral (pretty close to snorting). I think that shooting 2c-t-2 is pretty pointless the only real benefit I had was that it didnt burn my nose, besides that it was pretty much the same as snorting with a bit less visuals. I dont remember my doses, but it should have been enough. And if you ever shoot up 2c-t-2, I suggest that you start VERY low just in case, as I have read trip reports where people had very incredible experiences. Maybe I we (my friend is the one that actually injected me) did something wrong, I have never been shot up with anything else before. Worth noting is that the next day I had a large bruise on my arm, but this may be due to a physical altercation I had gotten in and not the 2c-t-2 itself.",
      "Smoking 2c-t-2 I used as more of a booster where I would smoke it after snorting it. I have smoked it with out snorting it before however, and it gives minimal effects, although noticeable. When smoked alone 2c-t-2 gave me some color intensification, some tracers a bit of a relaxed stimulation (hard to explain and could have been a placebo effect?) and that was about it. When I smoked after snorting it seemed to help make the trip a bit more visual. I have heard reports that smoking 2c-t-2 could cause cancer and have read one chemists reasoning behind this, but I think his logic was flawed. I am not a chemist though, nor a doctor, nor do I have any experience with cancer causing substances (other than consuming them when I smoke). Although I think his reasoning was not entirely solid it was enough to make me decide that I will not be smoking 2c-t-2 anymore. The possibility of greatly increasing my chances of cancer more than I already do by smoking organic material is not worth the weak effects that 2c-t-2 gives me when smoked.",
      "Well I hope this little report helps someone out. Remember that everyone has a different body and that some of the effects I get you may not and you may get some effects I do not get. One of my friends gets aural hallucinations from 2c-t-2, something that I have gotten to a degree but with no where near the frequency and intensity that he does. Different people are affected differently, some people get very bad body loads others get not hardly any. 2c-t-2 really seems to have different effects for different users more so than most other phenethylamines do.",
      "This is by no means a full account of 2c-t-2. If I was to write every detail I know about the effects of 2c-t-2 or I was to document my entire knowledge of this drug and my experiences with it and people that use it, I would be able to write a book. This is all just a general analyses of 2c-t-2, worth reading but not the sole authority. Always read as many reports as you can before you trip, negative positive and summary alike.",
      "I have been involved in the research chemical scene for four years and it has done wonderful things for me and my life. I honestly believe that these chemicals can help just about anyone, (or at least offer entertainment to just about anyone, if that is what they seek), but if not respected they can have dire consequences. Please respect all chemicals you consume and be safe!",
      "One last note: Try taking it on an empty stomach and after having used the bathroom, it really seems to help for me.",
      "Best wishes to all and thanks to everyone that has helped me and supported me and been my friends."
