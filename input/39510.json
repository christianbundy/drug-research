 "report": "<p>A friend and I both had a 1/2 eighth of shrooms and while he isnt on any medications, I take 20mg Lexapro and 25mg Topomax (a mood stablizer) daily. Although I did trip and it was pretty intense, his trip was much more intense than mine. The trip lasted as long as a regular shroom trip (about 6 hours). My vision was normal the entire time and I was totally aware the entire trip. The friend I tripped with experienced visual effects and kept losing his awareness of our surroundings. My friends who also tripped ate the same amount or less and all experienced much more intense trips. All of them are more experienced shroomers but none of them are on SSRIs or mood stablizers so I think that the medication did affect my trip.</p>"
