 "report": "<p>I have been taking alprazolam (Xanax) for about 3 years now.  I take 2mg three times a day, and now that dose just keeps me from going into withdrawals.  I don't get much of a benzo high from 2mg anymore.  I've been trying to ween off of it entirely, but lowering doses just don't seem to work.  I can't sleep if I don't take it regularly.</p><p>I recently was prescribed pregabalin (Lyrica) for nerve pain, 150mg twice a day.  The first day I took it, I remember feeling giddy and talkative and high spirited.  I did some research and saw that it was an anticonvulsant that works on GABA similarly to benzodiazapines.  With this I started lowering my alprazolam dose.  Now I can just take 2mg a day instead of 6mg and I won't feel the withdrawals.  It's only been 2 weeks and I went down 4mg in alprazolam easily, which would have taken me two months according to most tapering charts.  Now I only hope I'm not switching one withdrawal to another.</p>"
