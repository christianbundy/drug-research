 "report": "<p>I cannot smoke any substances, so decided to try to make a topical medical marijuana preparation. I stirred a handful of mixed bud into two thirds of a jar of Nivea Cream (using a fork and the opaque blue jar). </p><p>A small dab rubbed into my sprained ankle gives a localized slightly numb sensation. The systemic effects are subtle and mild.</p><p>I am very satisfied with this lightly analgesic and relaxing preparation. It's just enough to take the edge off.</p><p>Warning: users may smell like a barnyard, with floral overtones.</p>"
