 "report": "<p>I started on 5mg per night to help me sleep. It had no noticable effect.</p><p>They upped the dose to 7.5mg, the only effect I felt was a slight strange feeling in my eyes. </p><p>I'm yet to try 10mg but I was told that psychiratrists sometimes start people on 10mg who have poor mental health. My mental health is mild, I suffer from mild schizophernia.</p>"
