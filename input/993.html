First I appologize for not being able to be particularly scientific here.  You see, it's been a sort of harrowing ride.  I only hope that the editors that be will overlook my lack of science and tell my story just the same, as I think it may benefit some (feel free to edit if that gets my story out there).<br><br>
I started GBL because I needed sleep.  I was up commuting and working 16 hours a day.  When I finally got home, I could not wind down.  I started drinking Jack Daniels and Coke - about 2 to 3 drinks, before bed.  This was ok, but even then I would have the shakes the next morning.  I searched the internet, and found a product called Renewtrient - GBL - 1.82g per oz..  I thought, 'Wow!, this stuff is awesome.'  I thought I'd been reborn.  Sleep was no longer a problem.  I was estatic.<br><br>
Over the next 3 months, I graduated from Renewtrient to a stronger product - one containing 2.25g GBL/oz..  I started taking it in the car on my commutes - it took the stress out my 100 mile drive and my 20 mile sub-way ride.  I took it at work.<br><br>
I graduated from the 2.25g/oz. to a product containing 3g GBL/oz.  I was hooked.  If I stopped getting my regular 15 to 25 grams of GBL per day I was in deep trouble.  When the effects wore off, I became like an advanced Parkinson's Disease patient.  I had much *less* than no fine motor control.  I was like an animation that skipped 4 or 5 pictures between movements (this is, unfortunately, no exageration).  If I smoked a cigarette - a dopamine stimulate - I could hardly walk.<br><br>
I know now, that my problems were caused by the heavy build up of dopamine that results from taking too much GBL - you sleep so deeply that the normal re-charge of dopamine is exaggerated beyond your body's ability to cope.  And I firmly believe that this is, in the pathetic words of who ever that infamous happy home-maker is (who's name I can't, at the moment remember), 'a good thing.'  But I just wish there would have been some sort of warning about this aspect.  I guess I shouldn't be too upset over it though - phenalalanine, the over-the-counter supplement, comes with no more warning than a suggested daily dosage.<br><br>
Bottom line is, this stuff is great (GBL).  But if you take it, take the recommended dosage seriously - 5 days on, 2 days off at (and here's the kicker, depending on your constitution) 1.82g/oz. of the active ingredient, GBL.  And get some exercise!<br><br>
I have not had any GBL in about 3 months (can't afford it), and I'm still feeling the effects - intense neck tension (dopaminergic stimulation in the basal ganglia) and mild Parkinson's like symptons (too little dopaminergic stimulation in the frontal lobe) after smoking a cigarette (some may crticize this article by noting that dopamine stimulation should curb Parkinson's symptoms.  However, in human biological systems, 'too much of a good thing' often leads to the oposite of that which it's indicated for).<br><br>
Thanks for listening.  Hope I help.<!-- End Body -->
