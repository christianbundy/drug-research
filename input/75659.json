 "report": "<p>I decided to try salvia tea. I put 1g of 5x extract to boiling water kept it boiling for 10 minutes. I made up 2 cups. I gave one to my brother and drank one by myself. I was very bitter, so I put some honey into it.</p><p>After few minutes I felt somehow relaxed and clean-minded. After about 10 next minutes I begin to feel a bit sleepy. But this was weak and could possibly be even produced with placebo effect.</p><p>I expected it to be much stronger.</p>"
