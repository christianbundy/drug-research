After my past experiences with so many visual, emotional and potentially spiritual psychedelics, I thought DiPT should be a little bit different. I had the opportunity to test the prototypical audio hallucinogen Di-isopropyl-tryptamine, which has been both complimented and criticized for its novel and unique nature. I had been forewarned in many trip reports that this substance can be stronger and longer lasting than Tihkal would indicate so I started with a very cautious dose of 15mg.  The powder was dissolved in a small amount of water and drank in two mini-doses spaced about 45 minutes apart. I drank two thirds of the water around 11:30AM, felt out the initial physical effects, and finished my dose at 12:15. This was done to hopefully reduce nausea. I will consider 11:30AM my T-Time since that is when the drug first entered my system.<br><br>
The first reactions were physical. Even by T+0:30 when the dose was only partially finished, I could feel energy coursing through my body. It gave me a slightly spaced out and disoriented feeling, with flutters in my stomach hinting at digestive disruption. I thought I could feel energy transferring from my torso up to my head, as with other tryptamines, but flowing away from both my eyes and my inner mind, in favor of my ears. I feel tingling in my ears mixed with a slight sense of uneasiness.  All discomfort settled down and remained within safe and reasonable levels, though, and I finished my dose at the planned time. <br><br>
At T+1h, the first audio distortions were detected. They initially consisted of sounds being alternately either fuzzier and more faded, or clearer and fuller sounding than normal. I was unable to define the exact difference, but something was changing. <br><br>
By T+1:20h, the full effects had developed. There was, in fact, a deepening effect, semi-randomly imposed on certain cross-sections of the sound spectrum. Most people's voices sounded dramatically deepened, but if the tone of their voice was outside a certain 'deepening range' it didn't have the expected distortion. In some cases high pitched sounds seemed to jump out with new depth and dimension, though they were emphasized more rarely than the lower pitches. <br><br>
By this point, I had a bizarre feeling in my ears. It felt as if energy had moved into my ears, melted my inner ear material, and my inner ear had then hardened again, recast into a new shape. I know that DiPTs action is on particular subsections of the brain and not the ears, but it certainly feels as though it is effecting the ears directly. <br><br>
With regards to music, DiPT is generally considered a musical de-harmonizer. And it does indeed make most orchestrated music sound more dissonant. But what of music which is dissonant or simple in structure to begin with? I found a symphony orchestra performance on YouTube. Predictably enough, it sounded like nobody had practiced and the conductor was drunk and insane. Everyone with an instrument seemed to be playing their own music at their own pace, with no concern for harmony. Only by reading the videos comments from other viewers could I confirm that it was, in fact, a highly trained professional orchestra. <br><br>
Then I looked up videos of non-harmonic and minimalist music. Such as experimental industrial music from the early 80s. Death metal headbangers. Gangsta-rappers shouting about gats over booming basslines. DiPT cannot de-harmonize these because there is not enough order to begin with. They sound the same as normal, but with thickened, echoing bass areas that blend together into a continuous stream. I will not attempt to describe what the Ghost Face Killah's voice sounds like in DiPT space but it made me laugh outrageously. <br><br>
There was an uncomfortable buzz in my body accompanying the first audio effects, and the more distorted audio I heard the more uncomfortable I seemed to feel. I found turning off my music and going into a quiet area from time to time refreshing. I felt mildly nauseous, but didn't need to vomit. Cannabis helped with the nausea quite a bit. I sometimes felt oddly stimulated and confused and would wander around in search of something new to do. I was in a state where I became disoriented easily, but could function normally if needed. <br><br>
At T+1:55h, I officially noticed the voice I was speaking with was no longer my own! I found it amusingly odd to speak to myself in a new voice. I drank lots of water to help keep my body going and settle my stomach, and trips to the bathroom became breaks from the world of sound. Spending a few minutes alone in my quiet bathroom was soothing to my mind until I flushed the toilet! The deep tone and reverberating sound of the toilet flushing resulted in radical distortion every time, and a very clear reminder of my altered state. The phone ringing was even worse. <br><br>
At T+3:15h I headed outside. The outdoors felt wonderful and it was no problem navigating and blending in with other people. Unfortunately due to the day I had picked many stores were closed down and the world seemed a bit empty. <br><br>
Around T+4:15h I noted that the novelty of the effects had worn off and ceased to be entertaining. The effects, however, were still going strong.  <br><br>
By T+5h, I was still playing music, but more to track the gradual decline of the effects than to actually listen to the distorted music. <br><br>
Around T+5:30h my girlfriend got home from work (it was my day off but not hers) and said 'hello' to me in a voice that was not her own. I started playing World of Warcraft, largely just as an excuse to keep to myself for a couple hours until the effects returned to normality. I had a low attention span at this point but no noticeable cognitive impairment. <br><br>
By T+8h, the effects finally seemed to have tapered mostly off. My inner ear seemed to be returning to it's normal shape and function. It's hard to tell exactly when the effects of DiPT end, but it should be safe to say my 15mg dose was active for at least eight hours. Aside from the audio hallucinations, there were no visual effects at this dose and almost no emotional impact. I slept well after the experience. The next morning I was slightly dizzy and exhausted for the first several hours of my day, which may have been an after-effect of the DiPT. I was fairly sure audio had returned to normal by the next day but couldnt be 100% certain.<br><br>
I think this has been an excellent introduction to a most unusual and different hallucinogenic drug. I agree with many of the previous trip reports: Although it is only an audio hallucinogen, this is a powerful audio hallucinogen. It can easily last a great length of time and I'm quite glad I started with a small dose. Will I explore this substance further? Probably. But I suspect there will be nausea and discomfort involved in higher doses. I will treat this compound with respect and caution, and take it out again sometime in the future, on a rainy day, when I'm in the mood for something different.<!-- End Body -->
