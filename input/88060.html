Just thought I would lay my expereince out for those who are curious about this substance.  I am a psychonaut.<br><br>
Over the past week I have used 100 mg of this substance.  Came as 1 g bag, pure white soapy like powder.  I put some in water to test solubility, immediately dissapeared.  Weighed 20 mg put in water, drank it.  <br><br>
One hour later felt very good and very focused, the effect did not last long.  3 hours after dose felt rather anxious, rather trapped, I went to a hockey game and drank some beer, that made me feel better.  <br><br>
Woke up and gave some to a friend, same dose, 20 mg, I insufflated 15 mg.  I felt less of a comedown on this experience but same high.  My friend said he did not feel anything.  <br><br>
Smoked 5 mg, insufflated 10 mg, then smoked 5 mg, the high is not pronounced.  When I'm chasing some sort of euphoria I always get myself into trouble before I find it.  I have not experienced paranoia or dramatic comedown, but have felt some uncomfortability.  <br><br>
Gave 20 mg insufflated to two friends while drinking alcohol, each said they only felt stimulated.  Basically I don't want to take more of a dose chasing a good high from this chem.  <br><br>
I feel vasoconstriction throughout each experience, immediately when smoking it.  I do not find it moorish or fiendish as some do.  I find a constriction in my head too like a lack of oxygen for lack of a better description.  I find this to be a stimulant and not much more.<!-- End Body -->
