I went through a stage a while back where for breakfast, lunch, and dinner I either ingested pills or put them up my nose.  One of my personal favorites is a little orange pill called Topamax.  A friend of mine takes these for her bi-polar disorder, but feeds her extras to me.  The high lasts a very long time for 2 pills, for up to 3 days in some people.  It lasts for me for 2 days, and the high comes in 3 stages;<br><br>
*The first stage I feel stupid as hell.  I tried writing a check for my mother my first time, and it took me 10 minutes to get the pen moving to write out the word 'three'.  I find that my eyes cross sometimes when I start feeling really stupid.  This stage is a pretty speedy stage.<br><br>
*This is the dopey stage, I lay around and get VERY confused VERY easily.  Sometimes I panic about things, like waking up and finding that my pillow is too thin, or if someone says the word 'spider' I can't stop screaming.  Also, if I try to tell a story, I probably won't be able to get the words out of my mouth.<br><br>
*I never really remember this stage, I basically feel stoned towards the end of the topamax high.  But I feel good through the whole high.<br><br>
A little tip for all the pill-snorters out there, DO NOT SNORT TOPAMAX!!!! It feels like shit, you'll regret it.  However, it fucks you up pretty good.<br><br>
Drinking on Topamax is fun, just as long as I'm careful and don't drink too much.  Smoking on it is fine, smoking with anything is good for me.  But I try not to mix too many other drugs (expecially hallucinagens) w/Topamax, it's really easy to bug out because I are so easily confused.<!-- End Body -->
