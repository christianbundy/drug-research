 "report": "<p>This is for anyone who is recovering from addiction and thinking of using GHB...Don't.  Because GBH at it's recommended dosage and ever so slightly above produces an effect somewhere between alcohol and drugs, I became completely addicted to it and spent six months trapped in a cycle of abuse.  I had found an easy source on the internet for the Lactone which it is made from and eventually found myself taking straight Lactone because it was easier and stronger.  At the time, I was recovering from alcohol and it was a perfect replacement for the euphoria I get from a shot or five of whiskey.  Next thing I knew, I was so completely addicted to GBL that I would go into sociopathic fits if I went more than two hours without a dose.  I lost my friends, my band, my job and almost lost my beautiful family and home.  </p><p>I became a mental cripple and had compouded my pre-existing depression and attention-defecit problems with what my shrink described as a 'major anxiety disorder brought on by the abuse of a CNS depressant'.  In two separate incidences I was taken to the hospital and then the county mental institution because of overdoses, and it took me two weeks of supervision and the will power of a super human to kick the shit.  Stay away from GHB.  It feels good, but is it worth the risk of addiction?</p>"
