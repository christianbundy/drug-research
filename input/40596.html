Well, I´m 26 and a proud psychonaut or drugs devotee since I tried pot eight years ago. I´m a rare instance of oral marijuana dependent, severely. I would like to be high all the time, being high on cannabis is the most healthy state of mind in my opinion and experience, in most instances. I don´t smoke denicotinezed tobacco from the damned United States (first producer of cigarettes, that is of cancer, in the world). And I don´t like true Cuban cigars either. I´ve just graduated as a doctor (general physician) in 133% the time it was supposed to take for rat racers. Mine is the best university by far in my proud Latin American country.<br><br>
So, to the point: today on morning I went to the hill behind my town where I used to go as a boy, to light a joint (exceptionally) and wander around among the tropical biodiversity. I discovered the Ipomoeas on some coffee trees and itabos (as we call them). Their flowers were blue, I´ve already researched on them and had localized some specimens near home but hadn´t yet collected any seeds from them. This time I finally discovered the seed pods and managed to collect around 300 black seeds clearly corresponding to the ones Hoffmann (in LSD my problem child) says aztecs called black badoh.<br><br>
I got home, counted and grounded one hundred of them, finely, in my coffee grinder. Took them with water. A fraction of the resulting dust (which adhered to the plastic of the grinder cap) had that disgusting fleshy, taste I´d already noted in the young (still chewable) seeds and in the flowers themselves. The rest of the seeds were actually edible with mild to moderate disgust, at least for me, accustomed to eating the Indian hemp right from the bag, chewing it thoroughly then adding some fat or oil to enhance bioavability of THC.<br><br>
About two hours later, I felt clearly high on marijuana and decided it was because I´d smoked half joint one hour ago, afraid of the nausea described in some reports of morning glory tripping. I got no nausea, but profuse diarrhea, without abdominal pain. The diarrhea resembled that of cholera (of secretory mechanism, not painful, and so loose from the stimulated colonic mucosal cells as to resemble rice water). But, in general, the mechanism is probably osmotic because the number of depositions was rather small (3 to 4) and I retained much continence (I could make it to the toilet and slept without leaking). I ate lunch without much trouble, and then decided to try doubling the dose. So I repeated the procedure with two hundred seeds.<br><br>
I was awarded with continuing diarrhea, which seems to had cleaned my colon thoroughly by now 23:00 hours, when it subsides. Still no psychotropicity from the product, even though the slight electrolitic imbalance from the diarrhea makes me feel kind of clean inside. In the end, I got the experience of a purge, so appreciated by old medicine men and women in this country (and many others I guess) as therapeutic because it washed the dirty gut from all its filth, presumably endotoxic. By now I feel kind of clean inside, and lighter, the natural drug having freed me of a not so terrible, yet constant, burden: that of all the shit that we literally carry on, every day, in the bag of our intestines. <br><br>
In that aspect I could review this experience as a somatic equivalent of that of a good, chemically pure, judiciously low dose of the unsurpassed medicine, the diethylamide of lisergic acid. I had located a source of a not psychotropic, neither somadelic (as the sports 'doping' drugs should be called) agent, and actual somatropic experience, producing unusual movements of that organ we usually dismiss: the bowel.<!-- End Body -->
