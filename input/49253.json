 "report": "<p>Subject is a healthy male, no meds taken for more than 3 weeks</p><p>T+0:00 Ingestion of 10mgs 2C-B-Fly (powder solved in Water). BP 134/76 mmHg, HF 76 bpm.</p><p>T+0:11 I´ve got some tingling sensations in my feet. Is this already the onset? No, they vanish after approx. 1 minute</p><p>T+0:24 I´m at threshold. Skin-sensations all over my body. Within the next 8 minutes I rise to a good ++. BP 137/77 mmHg, HF 81 bpm.</p><p>T+0:32 Colours are enhanced, not the same way as with 2C-E (which makes me see more colours), all colours seem brighter, even dark colours seem to glow a little. No change in the other senses. Communication with my sitter is no problem. BP 148/82 mmHg, HF 90 bpm.</p><p>T+0:37 I´m going down a little, only a weak ++ any more. I´m a little irritated, was this all?</p><p>T+0:44 Down to a good +. Colours are still brighter, but not so much as 10 mins. before. I´m waiting, what´s to come next? Got some leg tremor. Still no communication problem.</p><p>T+1:02 No change yet. Still a good +. The leg tremor is almost gone, but now I have a little headache. BP 133/71 mmHg, HF 77 bpm.</p><p>T+1:23 Still at +. The leg tremor came back, the headache is still there. This stuff is starting to bore me. I try to listen to music: not bad but also not satisfying. I turn on the TV  same effect.</p><p>T+1:51 The stuff is still working, but no new effects. I´m so bored! I feel the energy to do a lot of things, but nothing seems to satisfy me. BP 138/79 mmHg, HF 82 bpm.</p><p>T+3:43 No changes so far. I don´t like this stuff (at least not at this dose), I wait for something to happen, and I have the feeling that something could happen, but nothing happens! I´m already thinking of combining it with some other substance at this point, but I want to explore this compound until the end. BP 132/70 mmHg, HF 69 bpm.</p><p>T+4:02 Now I´m coming down, slowly but unmistakeable. BP 128/71 mmHg, HF 77 bpm.</p><p>T+5:13 I´m definitely out!</p><p>Summary and conclusions:</p><p>I must admit, that I´ve expected much more! Even without having found a single trip report about 2C-B-Fly, I thought, that this stuff would provide much more. Comparing it with 2C-B, 10mgs are much stronger there, I don´t feel that the extra furanyl rings of the fly make the molecule more potent. I´m definitely going to explore this substance further, but in higher doses (or maybe in combination with other RCs). Next time maybe 15mgs.</p>"
