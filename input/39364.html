I have been an avid weed smoker for the last six years, and in the last two years I have only taken a 1 month break and a few 3-4 day breaks here and there.  My friend had told me about 5-HTP before, and I had seen it mentioned in much literature as well.  Seeing as it was finals week at college, I was seeking some sort of aid to help me focus on studying (and to not want to smoke herb so much... heh).  I did NOT want to use ritalin/aderall as I am generally against it.  So first day of the week, I got up early and decided to go buy some 5-HTP and do some studying.  I had a small breakfast around 10:00AM, including 2 cups of Oolong Tea, and at this time I ingested 2 x 50mg 5-HTP.  Then I went to the library and studied...<br><br>
11:30AM - T+1:30 - What I noticed at this time was that I was very motivated to do the work.  Reading was easy, my mind was focused and I was not worried about how much work I had to do or how much time I had to do it.  Time almost passed faster. At first I thought, maybe it's just the caffeine, but there was definitely a clarity of thought not present before.<br><br>
1:00PM - T+3:00 - After working for 2 hours, I let myself have a small smoking break.  I didn't want to ruin being in the 'work zone' so I packed only a medium sized bowl of some commercial level chronic.  It was strange... I seemed to notice some effects that I hadn't noticed in a long time, like an extra vibrance to music and excessive mood enhancement.  I decided to smoke a little bit more, and I was blown away!  It almost felt like my tolerance had been reduced, yet it wasn't.<br><br>
5:00PM - T+7:00 - Even after coming down from the the high, I could still be focused on the work.  Also, the clarity of thought is amazing.  It is like a cloud has been lifted off my head: the last few years of smoking a lot and not taking many breaks has generally made me feel less alert.  The 5-HTP seemed to take it away.  The kind of intuitive thinking I gained from smoking a lot also seemed to go well with this new ability to focus... schoolwork/studying seemed to go extra easily.<br><br>
I have used 5-HTP almost daily since this experience and have continued to feel this clarity of thought which was long missing.  I suggested it to several stoner friends whom I gave samples to... they noticed similar effects to a more or less degree.  One of them now takes it regularly.  I would recommend it to any heavy stoner as part of a healthy diet in order to maintain adequate serotonin levels in the brain.<!-- End Body -->
