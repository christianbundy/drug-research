One hit of marijuana. This is my current dose. In the past (6 years ago) I would smoke quite copiously. Now one or two lungs of the stuff is most effective. I have always maintained marijuana is/can be one of the more potent and challenging drugs.<br><br>
The effects seem to take about 15 minutes to come on and last 2.5-3+ hours, and they are varied: Visually most everything becomes potentially fascinating, thoughts race. At some point in the trip I usually experience vague audio paranoid hallucinations in distant speech. People saying things intimately related to what I am doing, which vanish when I 'tune in' on a snippet of the conversation. Physically I feel my dexterity is mildly impaired, I get thirsty for water, I like to brush my teeth. I may relax, but am often made anxious, akin to the 'butterflies in the stomach'. This spurs me to creative endeavors, exercise, or sex, my favorite three  ways of eliminating stress. <br><br>
This restless motivation is the primary reward for me, and is an effect I believe diminishes with habitual use, though in the past to combat 'stoner burn out' I have found a cocktail of choline, l-glutamine, and cranberry juice (called fiery wine) to be most helpful. I used liquid forms of both from twin labs in teaspoon quantity 1500-2000+ milligrams of each, and cranberry juice to mask the 'unusual' salty sweet tastes. Spiking this drink with ephedra extract gave it a mild amphetamine effect, superior to caffeine. <br><br>
Marijuana lifts my spirits. It feels like a strong medicine which is relatively benign. I believe it is a true entheogen. <br><br>
I have written a poem to help with audio schizophrenia.<br><br>
FOR THE NERVOUS SET<br><br>
Imaginary audiences,<br>
Behind our backs.<br>
We pay them to much mind.<br><br><br>
Sincerely-<br>
