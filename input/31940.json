 "report": "</p>\nI live in california, the state leading the charge against tobacco.  It's odd that in a place known for people doing their own thing, that a powerful group is trying to hassle others.  Anyway, i've been a cigarette smoker for 25 years.  When the anti-cigarette gang started ramming their agenda down our throats, I started to experiment with other forms of tobacco, just to piss them off.  </p><p>Well, there were other reasons too. My best discovery was the cigar.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  I've tried those gas station cigars in the past, and nearly became sick.  But a fine cigar is a whole other story.  The taste is a hell of a lot better than a cigarette.  Cigarettes taste like garbage to me now.  And, the effect is different.  A cigarette delivers a quick hit of nicotine.  Once I get my fix, smoking loses its pleasure.  I just finish the cigarette because I already lit it.  Cigars deliver nicotine slowly.  It takes half an hour to get the nicotine fix.  With each puff during that time, I enjoy getting just a little bit more nicotine, until eventually I am satisfied.  I would love to get one of ahnold's special gubinatorial cigars :)</p>"
