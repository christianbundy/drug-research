I had a terrible experience by mixing diphenhydramine and ultrcet one evening which almost culminated ina trip to the hospital.<br><br>
I had been using actiq all day, my drug of choice and when I ran out I realized I had a few ultracet's laying around. At about 8 p.m. I dropped the two ultracets and half an hour later decided to go to bed. Since I have a large tolerance to deppressant drugs I took four sleep eze -d tabs which is equal to 200 mg. of diphenyhdramine, my usual dose for insomnia. Approximately ten minutes after taking the antihistamines I knew I was in trouble. It started with a vague sense of paranoia, which I unsucessfully tried to shake off. I turned the lights out and tried to go to sleep but the combination of drugs actually left me highly stimulated. Soon my heart was racing. I could actually see my chest beating. I woke my wife, who was not too pleased after I admitted what I had done and she helped me get dressed to go to the emergency room since I was sure I was going to have a heart attack. I forced myself to vomit but didn't see any pills fragments, by this time it had been a good hour since I had ingested the diphenyhdramine. <br><br>
After I puked I started to feel a little better and slowly my racing heart returned to normal. The whole incident probably lasted 2 hours but was the most frightening incident of my life.<!-- End Body -->
