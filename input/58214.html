This particular combination is a first experience for me. I have a little previous experience with Yerba Mate but Ginkgo Biloba is the first time.<br><br>
I swallowed the Ginkgo Biloba capsules and they took about an hour to kick in. I felt this clarity and like a state of interior purity. The mind was calm and focused. I could feel a warmth all over the skin as the circulation was stimulated towards the periferic regions and the brain.<br><br>
After some time I took 3 cups of Mate tea with honey (about 1 liter of tea). Mate introduced a second sensation of well being, pleasure and exhilaration. Combined with the enhanced mental acuity of the Ginkgo pills they tend to be like a mild cannabis stoning, yet extremely pleasant and most of all, obtained with items from the shop in the corner of my street and very inexpensive.<br><br>
Ginkgo enhances not only the mental clarity and power of concentration, but also the senses. More than any other sense, my sense of taste was almost as enhanced as when I eat while high on cannabis! Also the sense of hearing is superbly enhanced and my trance music seems 2-3 times better.<br><br>
No bad effects so far, I am 10 hours into the experience and I have taken another dose already to prolong the sensations.<br><br>
P.S. Also seems to be an excellent aphrodisiac.<!-- End Body -->
