I had just finished the MCAT and was in need of some experimenting. I was greeted by two bottles of champaign outside of the test and in short order was rather wasted. The second bottle was finished (with a little help from friends) around 5:15pm. Drinking continued over dinner and until around 8pm.<br><br>
I then ran into a friend who had wanted to try kratom, as I had just ordered some online, and we had been waiting to try it.<br><br>
I put 1g 'super resin extract' and 2g '2X leaf extract' into 300mL of water and a splash of lemon juice (for good measure, I hear its always better to make things like this acidic) in a double boiler and cooked it until the resin extract disolved, it took some crushing under a spoon.<br><br>
I filtered the concoction with a coffee filter, added some honey for flavor, and went off to find my friend.<br><br>
He had started drinking and didn't want to take it after drinking (he didn't tell me why, but I knew that drinking all of this would be a high dose, I believe that this is a lot more dangerous than how it turned out, everyone's body is different).<br><br>
I ended up drinking almost all of it (not wanting to waste my tea). It didn't taste very bad at all, just like some shitty cheap tea, not too bitter.<br><br>
The onset began before I finished drinking it (it took me about 15 minutes to finish). I had continued to drink through all of this, and continued to after the trip began.<br><br>
3 dimentions seemed clearer, my hand would glow as I waved it in front of me. I also felt very clear-headed and could very much hold a conversation, probably better than I could sober. I felt very awake as well. I was very interested in conversations with people, and ended up talking until 3am with a friend about everything.<br><br>
Sleep was uncomfortable, but I woke up without any sort of hangover (even from the drinking).<br><br>
After talking with people about this experience, I realize that it was probably dangerous to try this with alcohol, and I probably wouldn't again as I don't know how strong the resin extract was. I had a very good time and have bought more from the same place, but will not mix it with alcohol again.<!-- End Body -->
