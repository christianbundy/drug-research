 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI procured a 16-ounce bag of Damiana from a local herbal-occult store and discussed the issue of damiana's reputation as an aphrodisiac with a friend. She agreed that it was an interesting idea, and found listings for its uses for nerves and tension, thought it would be a good idea to mix the damiana with cannabis in equal parts, smoke it, observe and compare effects upon perception and sensation.\r\nIn a softly-lit laboratory, with throw pillows and trip hop we blended the herbs. We chopped and mixed half a gram of each: the damiana and some good crippy and plugged it in a bowl. Smoked it. Right away (2 minutes) we tasted the light syrupy aftertaste, much like chamomile, and felt the usual effects of the THC. \r\nAfter 5 minutes we began feeling a slight tingle in the extremities, pins and needles, etc., and her nipples popped. At 10min our skin felt cold and somewhat numb. My privates got kinda twitchy and I was pleasantly amused. At 15min we hit a mildly state of sensory flux. My depth perception and equilibrium were affected by this point. She reported numbness throughout the limbs. \r\nAt 20min we felt stoned, there was some interesting speech-cognitive deviation from our typical pass-the-bowl pattern. I felt speedy as if we had dropped LSD. At 30min the bitter note in the taste of the damiana became very pronounced. At 40min, random hedonistic phenomena manifested in lieu of munchies.\r\nWhat we concluded is that the mix had effects beyond the range of a typical bowl. We felt physiological changes, colder, tingly, numb, speedy, a tightening in the bowels. Time seemed to fly by, and we did not get munchies. Our balance was off, but the funk was on, and a groove was beheld by all. We rated this mix as PROFESSIONALS ONLY with a difficulty of 80%,  B+.\n\n\n"
