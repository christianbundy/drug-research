 "report": "</p>\nThe other day a friend of mine acquired some 4-Acetoxy-DET and 3 of my friends and I decided to give it a try one night. Our friend recommended that we each take 40mg for our first try with this chemical. This seemed a bit high for a first time according to the Erowid dosage chart but we were all up for it, and our supplier said that he did 120mg a few nights ago and felt great. We did not have a scale on hand so we emptied the contents of a bag which was said to contain 150mg onto a piece of paper , divided it into 4 lines which looked equal and put the powder into 4 gelcaps. </p><p>About 30-40 mins after ingestion I began to feel the effects of the drug beginning. There was a medium body high present and mood was elevated. Music was very enjoyable - it sounded full and engulfing. Thoughts were very detailed and easy to explain. There were some visual effects but they were quite mild.. things moved around a bit but they didnt distort or morph or become very intense at all. These effects lasted the duration of the trip, which was about 3 hours. </p><p>Smoking pot enhanced the effects of this drug.. everytime I took a hit off the bowl I felt my body lift and it made the body high fairly strong.</p><p>If we decide to experiment with this chemical again it will be a dose of 80mg... we are all fairly experianced drug users and were hoping for an intense experience. However , a lower dose of this chemical may be ideal for a person seeking a fun new drug to experiment with. </p><p>I'd also like to note that I experianced no negative effects from this chemical at all.</p>"
