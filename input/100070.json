 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm currently in the midst of that nasty come up. 200mg ingested via a capsule.<br>At the 1.5 hours mark.<br>EDIT: Adding Stuff<br>Now it's 0:48am GMT. Guys and gals: it's just like shrooms. I get that nauseated feeling (every time) and then I'm going to want to spit spit spit... And then I get that violent retch, for me, always about an hour and a half to two hours afterward. Immediately after that retch, (to steal from another guy's post from some other article) 'the buzz finds the groove.'<br>And now it has. And the nausea fades, and as it does the nystagmus begins. The jaw movement. The tongue lashing. lol<br>__________________________________________<br>2:36 GMT. Bluelight server was busy for the last hour or so... so I am cutting and pasting from the word processor I was typing all of my thoughts into. Is it strange that I relate the bluelight server's being 'busy' for the last hour and a half to 'coming up<br>___________________________________________<br>EDIT: Adding Stuff<br>Now it's 1:02 GMT. Before I forget, I want to point out that through the entire come up, there is this bile that builds in the back of my mouth, near the throat. It must be cleared. Also, I find that I cannot stand light, and even the brightness of the computer monitor before me is quite aggravating.<br>For whatever reason, I notice a unique body odor after using this chemical. I think it's from my body forcing out toxins (mostly acids). I think I may jump in the shower for a second time. Especially since it marks exactly 2 hours since I swallowed the capsule.<br>1:44 GMT.<br>The bath was therapeutic. Warm water. No soap. Gently treat the body's largest organ to a very neutral and relaxing tonic.<br>Then laying on the bed, face down. Breathing deep. Imagining a gentle massage. Letting everything go. Breathe in. Breathe out. Healthy. Got the crazy tracers going on and the rainbow diffusion off of bright objects.<br>I have never used DMT, but from the experience reports, this stage of the 6-APB trip I call the 'DMT stage.' Visuals are pronounced. Eyes want to close, really, maybe to get away from the visuals? My demeanor is much like our friend Tryptamine Bunny always advises: 'let go and simply experience.'<br>I think that if I were in the massage industry, I would market serotonin & dopamine massage.<br>I should note that as of yet, I have hardly noticed any sexual stimulation at all. Bloodflow is amazing right now, too.<br>1:57 GMT.<br>So calm a sense of peace. Imagined someone running their fingers gently across the skin on my face, combing through my hair. (OH boy, yellow really stands out right now.)<br>Satriani's 'Echo' is playing, and I can't think of a more beautiful song to exemplify how I am feeling right now. Or maybe it's the song that is making me feel this way?<br>(The bluelight server is busy all this time, so I've been editing this using a notepad.)<br>OK now it's time for visualizations on media player to go along with the music.<br>2:06 GMT.<br>Now I'm getting sexually stimulated. And right with that notion, I realize that I'm starting to sweat, and that it is hard for me to follow the words that I am currently typing.<br>2:21 GMT.<br>Extrasensory on sound, extrasensory on touch. Extrasensory on light, too, as I pointed out earlier. I wonder how taste is affected? I don't feel like eating anything though. My jaw, when in that middle state of being relaxed and tensed, wants to quiver--but now that I am thinking about it, it has stopped completely.<br>I wonder what my body temp is. Feels like it must be high high high. My thermometer must be broken. Reading 94.1 F at the left ear canal, and the right canal won't read at all.<br>Interestingly enough, my right eye is dilated to infinitum, my left looks pretty normal. Well it did. Now it's dilated like crazy. <br>oh my God. here's what it comes down to: we're all running around, sweating, dancing, reading, testing, resting, fuzzy and sharp, and my urine glows with yellow B-vitamin goodness. and Attention!! there is work to be done!<br>Edit: Adding More<br>3:06 GMT.<br>Music's ended. Silence. No visualizations. Just the sound of the computer's cooling fans whizzing away, and the sound of terrible wind in my ears. I am absolutely spaced out. I'm on the other side, but having passed through, I am changed. Everything imploded then exploded and like a teardrop in reverse.<br>I was really cold, so I had turned up the thermostat, and turned on the furnace. But, only a few minutes later, and I'm sweating again.<br>Adding more....<br>3:38 GMT. Yeah so it's only been like twenty minutes since I last wrote this stuff, and I'm in a totally different headspace now than I was a minute ago.<br>OK, here's why:<br>Ten minutes ago I smoked some marijuana mixed with 5-meo-dalt. It brought me to attention, albeit I'm kind of, at least physically, wonked out. Mentally, I feel sharp. So long as I can keep a connection between my mind and my fingers, then communication will continue. Soon enough, all that remains is the sound of an echo, a decay, that never really ever stops.<br>3:58:11 GMT. I've been thinking about that, and I swear that I typed that yesterday. OK, this is a fantastic combination. My face is locked in a half-snarl half-smile, but inside I'm as cheerful as a leprechaun in the land of one million rainbows, and to think that I invented all of it. Even you.\n\n\n"
