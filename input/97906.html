Over the years I have tried many drugs, some known, and some unknown (due to getting ripped off by asshole dealers). These would include marijuana, LSD, MDMA, Spice, 2-CB, Cocaine, Poppers, Oxy, xanax, Aderall, Ketamine, RC sold as LSD, Seroquel, and I'm sure I have forgotten some but this report is about Butylone.<br><br>
So a 'friend' bought a large quantity of what he believed to be MDMA, approx. 2oz of the stuff. It was mostly small, shard like, clear crystals that turned into white powder when crushed up. He went to a small festival nearby to push it as MDMA. The heads there knew what was up and tested the substance with one of those DanceSafe test kits. They came to the conclusion that it was Butylone or bk-MDBD. One of the people that went with him was selling it for him almost got jumped because of this so they left early. <br><br>
A couple days ago my brother purchased 1g and was told it was MDMA even though my 'friend' knew what it was. So, we orally took about 100mg and had band practice. It had that nasty bitter taste somewhat like MDMA and dilated our pupils, musical appreciation was increased, and a slight increase of feelings of affection towards those I already love (not universal). I had a feeling something was up because I didn't get the increased tactile sensations and when I woke up in the morning I felt perfectly fine. No feelings of depression or anything. But this didn't stop me from trying it again.<br><br>
The next day I orally took another 100mg while hanging out with some friends at around 10:30pm. I left after about 45 min of taking the first 100mg and that's when it really started kicking in. As I walked towards the door my vision was kind of hazy and bright like when the brightness is turned up on a dark video. I went to hang out with the 'friend' that had sold us this substance. <br><br>
I took another 150-200mg and smoked a good amount of marijuana. This was the point that my 'friend' told me that what I took was not MDMA.  We rode around for a while in another friends car that had also just taken about 200mg and went to my 'friend's' house to just chill, smoke some more, and enjoy the high. This high was the most sociable high I have ever experienced. I am normally a very shy and quiet person that just listens 80 percent of the time. This night I talked so much my throat hurt the next day. Also I noticed I could be more open and honest and speak everything that was on my mind. <br><br>
Both times I smoked marijuana while on the drug so I do not know what it is like alone. It was also an extremely speedy high but I had no problem at all sitting in the backseat of a cramped 944 Porsche for about 5 hours (lost track of time). At the peak we were a bit shaky and teeth grinding was somewhat noticeable, not as intense as MDMA though. I noticed my heart was beating pretty fast.  Also I was a bit scatter brained and kept telling stories then going to a different one then back to the one I left off. Some stories I wouldn't finish and it was extremely hard to focus on doing a simple math problem with a calculator on my phone. My mouth got very, very dry and when I drank water it went right through me. <br><br>
About 4.5 - 5 hours (3:00-3:30am) into the high I noticed a hard crash. It was very sudden. One second I was talking my mouth off and then the next silence. As we were coming down my friend and 'friend' were talking still and we had the music playing in the car. We were at my 'friend's' house parked in the drive way and this is where it got scary for a second. I looked over to the driver side window and must have been hallucinating because I saw a dark figure standing outside the door. I thought I heard who I thought was my 'friend's' dad banging on the roof and calling my 'friend's' name. I then said 'oh shit, your dad, your dad.' It took a minute and they shut the music off and turned the lights off in the car. I then saw what I thought was a small pale blue light ahead in the distance flicker as if someone had walked in front of it. I looked again and there was no light. My 'friend' opened the door and called out for his dad, but nothing. He was never there because he definitely would have said something and would not have come out at 3:30 in the morning. <br><br>
We left about an hour after this happened and I went home and tried to sleep. I couldn't fall asleep till about 6:30-7:00am and had to get up every 15-20min to urinate and get a drink of water. The whole next day I was exhausted and just felt really off, almost like I was still a little high but not really depressed like a MDMA hangover. I just felt more drained and somewhat irritable, probably from lack of sleep.<br><br>
I wouldn't do this drug again because I don't like the fact that almost nothing is known about it and it's a research chemical. This is the only reason I am writing this report.  I probably would not have taken this if I knew it was not MDMA so I guess you, the reader, benefit from this. Learn from others mistakes; only take drugs that you are completely sure of the identity.  There are way too many greedy people that dont care about anything but money, watch out and protect your self, even from friends.  A Marquis reagent or similar tests are the only way to be sure.<!-- End Body -->
