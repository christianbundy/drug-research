One day on a fine Monday afternoon I decided to do something that would give me a good trip. So I took the only two substances I had on me, which was Cannabis and Tylenol 3 pills. I've taken many Codeine before but my tolerance to it is decently low, so it takes anywhere to 2-4 pills to get things started for me. I did my research and searched up other reports on Codeine and Cannabis mixes, reading good things about it. Since it was my first time doing it (The cannabis and Codeine mix) I decided to take only 2 Codeine. So from here on I'll break it down into time intervals. This is separated in about 5 parts:<br><br>
1.PILLS<br>
2.SMOKING<br>
3.THE EUPHORIA AND SLIGHT HALLUCINATIONS <br>
4.HANGOVER<br>
5.CONCLUSION<br><br>
1.PILLS<br><br>
Setting: My house, alone, good weather outside, in an all around good mood yet some what lazy and tired, and feeling positive about doing this.<br><br>
Time: 2:45 PM: I go into my bathroom and swallowed 2 Codeine with water at the same time. Since I didn't want any bad taste and to do any work I just swallowed them. About 5 minutes later I start getting a nervous/anticipation feeling in my stomach area. <br><br>
3:15 pm: I'm still waiting for the pills to kick in, they usually take about 30 mins to an hour to kick in. Still having that nervous feeling in my stomach.<br><br>
3:45 pm: I start feeling disoriented and numb all over, it is as if my body warms up and numbs itself. It gets slightly harder to walk because of me being disoriented. I just started peaking on the Codeine. So right when I start peaking I decide to leave my house to go smoke at a local park.<br><br>
2.SMOKING<br><br>
Setting: At a chill spot by a park, a nice hidden place with trees and nature everywhere, feeling disoriented, euphoric, clumsy, numb, and over all good. <br><br>
4:00 pm: I start smoking a decently big bowl of Cannabis out of a pipe. The weed was decently potent. It took me longer then normal to smoke up the bowl because I was constantly distracted by staring off into the light blue sky. And around 4:25 pm I get done smoking. <br><br>
4:40 pm: I start getting higher and higher off the bowl I smoked. Then BAM! It hits me, the Codeine and the THC hitting me and working together. I felt very lazy to get up out of my spot at the park because it was very very comfortable. And it felt very very good. Constant euphoric waves hit me one by one. I close my eyes and I feel as if 100's of waves are just hitting me. I feel numb all over. It felt like smoking a bowl of Cannabis but a hell of a lot better feeling. <br><br>
3.THE EUPHORIA AND SLIGHT HALLUCINATIONS <br><br>
5:00 pm: Back at my house, and the waves are keeping up constantly. Feeling very euphoric so I put on my ipod and start listening. I was listening to various genres of music like hard core screamo (Devil wears Prada, Dance Gavin Dance, Saosin) to gangster rap (Eazy E, Immortal Technique, Wu Tang Clan) to chill indie music (Circa Survive, Brand New, Gym Class Heroes). It seemed as if the songs were having a stronger meaning to them and I felt a great emotion overcome me when I heard a good song. I find myself bopping my head and some what dancing to the beat of the music. Right now I am feeling great. <br><br>
5:30 pm: Decide to hop into my bed, I find a very comfortable postition, I can barely move from this position, as if I am glued to it. I am feeling amazing right about now. I am staring off to my walls in my room, and the color of my wall (dark camel color) start to became lighter and lighter. The ridges from the plaster seem just to melt off, making the walls appear very smooth. It seems as if I can't close my eyes. It's like I am mesmerized. Then I start seeing faint outlines of objects that weren't there, such as a faint outline of a demon looking thing. Now I am slightly paranoid from this slight hallucination, but I wanted more of it. So I am just staring off even more into the walls and I start seeing a blue laser dot drifted across my view. It's going in crazy circles, then slightly fades away. Next a red dot appears and does the same exact thing. This happens for a good 15-25 minutes. <br><br>
5:55 pm: I am still staring off into the walls yet my eyes start  becoming tired. Its like I am passing out, my eyes start closing very slowly until they close completely. Only a few minutes later  I am sleeping like a log. <br><br>
4.THE HANGOVER<br><br>
8:00 pm: I wake up right when I'm calming down from everything and  god damn my head hurts pretty bad. It feels like a hangover from a hardcore night of drinking. My body is weak, I'm fatigued, headache, some what sick to my stomach. I've taking 2 Codeine by it self and felt perfectly fine after, and I've toked a bowl and felt perfectly fine after as well, so it had to be the doing of both things combined that created this hangover. So through out the whole day I felt like crap. <br><br>
10:00 pm: Still feeling like crap, I ate a little bit, and drank some water, then just crashed after that.<br><br>
5.CONCLUSION<br><br>
So after all this I believe that it wasn't all that bad. The trip was amazing yet the hangover was pretty bad. They balance each other out. But overall I think its because of my lack of tolerance to mixing drugs, which being the reason of the hang over. So far I am still pondering if I am ever going to do it again.<!-- End Body -->
