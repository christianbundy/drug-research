First of all: I'm Italian, so if you find some errors, feel free to blame the Italian school system (and to fix them if you're editing this).<br><br>
I was with some friends at another friend's house this august; around  23:30 I snorted the 25mgs in two little stripes; my sister took 30mgs because she had tripped with Hollandia truffles and AMT two days prior, so we were expecting a body resistance; we then went downstairs and set-up the bong with ice, lemon slices, active carbons in the filter, and it's bubbler. In about ten minutes I started feeling excited, and I wanted to go out and settle in the garden. We sat in circle; with luck, I had the one reclining chair, which was pretty comfortable. I took the first bong hit, exhaled, and waited for my lungs to stop being such paining assholes, while I watched the bong and two joints doing the merry-go-round.<br><br>
I relaxed myself and leaned back onto the chair, breathing calmly and being happy, as the joints were approaching, then I looked up at the leaves of a tree illuminated from beneath by a lamp, and noticed that they were starting to light up in cyan, magenta, purple and a very pixel-like green.<br><br>
The remembrances after that point are a little blurry: we smoked like rappers, and I literally went in orbit: I left my body twitching with an orgasmic pleasure on the chair, and went flying through the Solar System, feeling my own, my friend's, and everyone on the planet's energy, the soul of the Earth, and that of the Space itself. I went in and out from my body several times, sometimes hearing distantly the voices of the ones around me. I remember a puritan friend of my guest's girlfriend telling that she had never seen anything like that, that I seemed like someone who's been injecting something in vein, for I was smiling, my back arched back, my brain crossed with flashes of light an electricity in correspondence of the body's energy meridians. I then proceeded seeing my body from outside with a third eye, colours streaming in every direction inside me. When I emerged again to reality, I was in the lotus position: legs crossed, straight back, hands onto my legs, thumbs and middle fingers gently touching and streaming energy to my body and brain. My friends also passed the bong to me, helping me taking hits that rocketed me three or four times to the 'Iperuranio' (WordReference suggests me 'Supercelestial': I'm referring to Platone's literary artifact of a world made from the concept of things themselves.) <br>
Sadly, my buddy's parents were at home, and paranoid as they are, if they woke up, they would have turned on the alarm, and we would have been taped. So we got back inside.<br><br>
In the kitchen, I was perfectly aware, standing, and rushing with energy. It's been more interesting than I would have imagined: I was feeling the room containing the people-us- inside of it, as it was THE KITCHEN in the mind of the architect which designed it, and those who lived in the house.  It was a feeling of stubbornness and need for control, somehow, though it wasn't coming from inside me, but the room itself. I was thinking and walking and watching and listening to my friends, as I saw them like in a videogame, with no air surrounding them.<br><br>
Then the bad vibes begun: two of my friends had a long distance relationship, and he had to leave the day after. Long story short: they wanted to have some time alone (and you know what I mean), though they felt that it would have been rude to ask for that. I felt it in the air, like a radiation, or the infamous 'vibrations' the '70ies hippies talked about. I told them that it was no trouble to take some time alone, and they immediately went downstairs.<br><br>
I was over the climax of the trip, and a couple of hours had passed by then, though my mind was still running like a well-oiled supercar engine between ours and other planes of reality, and I was starting to feel the desire for human interaction, though my friends were pretty cooked and tired, so they weren't in the perfect state of mind to set a trip for me. Instead, we moved into the garden again and sat to a table and talked about what came to our mind. I was still very sensitive to everybody's morale and feelings, and started talking about personal matters, although diverting the topic as immediately started to emerge repressed bad feelings. We lingered there for a while, then we went to lay down and watch some kids' retarded television, and doing some random zapping until we fell asleep.<br><br>
I really liked the experience, even if some elements could have been given us better vibes, thereby a better evening, and I will experiment again with this substance.<!-- End Body -->
