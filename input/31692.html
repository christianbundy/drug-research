I have used DXM before but only around 500 mg at the most. It all began at my friend D's house. We smoked a few bowls of cronic, and enjoyed our buzz. I remembered that I bought these coricidin Pills from my friend Smiles. I had about 50 of them. I gave 25 to me and 25 to my friend. I downed the first 12, and we turned on Cheech and Chong: Up In Smoke. I began to feel the normal effects; Drunkness, Wavy Vision when I move my head back and forth, a warm feeling, a pleasent buzz. I began rising and rising until I was at my plateau on 360 MG. I felt so great, I began to wonder about life and its mysteries.<br><br>
After about an hour I downed another 12 (360 MG More). I swear it only took about 20 min. when I started feeling it come on. I just kept rising and flying. I felt so good, when I found myself in my bathroom. I thought it was a celestial magnificence in paradise. A Heaven I can call home. Everything was so beautiful. I saw vivid colors, and lights seemed to shine more. I thought of a god, and how much he loves me. I closed my eyes and saw god, he was wearing a light purple robe with angels around him, playin trumpets. He reached out his hand, and I opened my eyes, feeling an intense happiness, that actually felt like I was on MDMA! I never have felt an intense happiness that great on dxm until now! I started coming down but it was still simply amazing! I tripped out all day, listening to techno music, preferabaly DJ Mystik, who's the greatest. It finally wore all off and I smoked a few bowls, then went to bed. <br><br>
I awoke the next day, feeling proud of myself and this world. I felt like a million bucks. I talked to my friend N asking about his trip and he said he only took 4 more pills after the 12, so he said he remembered me bowing down in the bathroom saying something about Paper Towels, strangely enough I don't remember anything about paper towels, haha. Cause of that trip, I feel less depressed and my life is great.<!-- End Body -->
