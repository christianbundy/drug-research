 "report": "<p>I tried Soma/carisoprodol as a sleep-aid initially after researching here, and found that I agree with the assessments that it is similar to being sloppy-drunk body-wise (and speech-wise!) however my thinking remained crystal clear, even if I could not express my thoughts very well in a verbal or written manner, and I shook like a leaf.</p><p>It does help sleep in these moderate doses, but does not last long at all.  In fact, I recommend if you take enough to get dizzy, don't try to do anything EXCEPT sleep, because you won't be able to.</p><p>I attempted to go downstairs and make a cup of coffee to try to liven myself up, but that proved to be a mistake.  I had to completely support myself on the bannister going down the stairs, then the wall, the countertop, and FORGET about carrying a cup of coffee - half of it ended up on the floor because I was shaking so uncontrollably.  When I tried to stand without support by my arms, I fell BAM on the kitchen floor, nice big bruise on my hip now!  Luckily I did not have the cup of coffee in my hand when I fell.</p><p>I can't call this experience enjoyable, but it was amusing.</p>"
