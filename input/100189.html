Having tried a wide range of drugs, being familiar with cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis from my late teenage years, I believe I am entitled to make a rational claim that, in moderation, use of such drugs is relatively safe. However, having tried this ketamine substitute on more than one occasion, I believe it is toxic, and incredibly dangerous. I will go ahead to describe the first time I tried it. <br><br>
It was a day in my penultimate semester at university, where the workload was high and when a night getting intoxicated was well deserved. It was a Thursday and I was heading back to my hometown the next day so when I got a call from my friend while I was studying in the library, asking if I wanted any ketamine I wasnt reluctant to say yes. <br><br>
I arrived back to my house in the evening, my front room full with not just my housemates but other friends willing to partake in a session (ketamine had been notoriously difficult to get hold of up until this point). My housemate had brought loads of it and was dishing it out. I put in my twenty pounds and got a generous gram, expecting to have a night on a drug I had always thought was a lot of fun Little did I know the madness that was about to unfold. <br><br>
Now the powder we all received from the dealer was not crystal-like as ketamine should be but fine  just like cocaine. A lot of the people in the room had already begun and seemed to be under the influence of the drug. I remember one friend in particular had a cartoonish face which I found incredibly peculiar. His pupils seemed larger that usual and his grin was strange. It was not your typical ket face as some like to call it. <br><br>
I started insufflating keys of the powder to begin with. We sat around the cramped living room, talking with music playing in the background. Some were already hit by the drug, others not. It took a long time for it to kick in and I remember thinking that this was particularly strange. At this point, my friend whose speech was coming out garbled, asked me if we could go upstairs and chill in my top floor room. Him and another guy came upstairs and we sat talking, surfing the Internet and listening to music. It was then that I started to feel the effects, which were, more or less, just like ketamine. <br><br>
The rest of the night is blurry but there are bits I can piece together. And I can recall the order somewhat. I guess thats the horror of mexy. From what I could next recollect, me and my other housemates and our visiting friends, walked around the house, going from room to room, babbling gibberish. I remember one housemate, came into my room to talk about an argument we had had earlier. Our speech was ridiculously slurred, as if we were drunk and we came to a mutual agreement to ignore our petulant incongruity. Anyone watching would have probably thought we were severely disabled. Because, similar to ketamine, methoxetamine makes you act in a shambolic, uncoordinated way. It is much more physically intense though. There were times when I was on the floor, talking shit. The best way to describe it is that your environment turns sideways. But it just got more and more intense, even after I had stopped consuming it. There was no tail-off after an hour like there should have been and it was only until the morning that I came to my senses. <br><br>
Regarding the mental side of the experience, it is very difficult to convey. I would say it is like ketamine but messier and you have a lot less control. The dissociative side is very similar but probably more intense. The world seemed plastic, unreal, a toy void. The house became a computer generated game zone, more intense visually and difficult to recognise and comprehend. Of course, when large amounts of K are consumed this can also be experienced. But not to the same intensity and duration. <br><br>
I remember going down to my housemates room and I then seemed to believe that I was actually in a rave. We had thrown huge house parties in the past and because of the small increase of people in the house on this particular night, I thought this was again one of those celebrated nights. I remember sitting on the stairs talking to a friend and reality was so, so distant at this point is almost resembled a k-hole. We talked about how we should meet up in the future and do more drugs together. The talk was of course garbled and we confirmed how strange the conversation was the next time we met. But it seemed that time would jolt or skip. One minute I would be in one place, the next in a completely different situation talking to someone else. It would take a while for the new environment to compute, but I would slowly adjust to my new settings. <br><br>
The disturbing thing about mexy is how long it lasts. I went to bed and then the hallucinations and real disconnection from reality begun. I believed there to be people in the room with me and I didnt sleep at all. It seemed to be a half-sleep/waking dream. The next day I had to go to a friends birthday and I remember lying in bed wondering how I would get there. At one point I was weighing up whether it would be best to fly there. These bizarre delusions were more intense than what is experienced when insufflating ketamine. They lasted pretty much the entire time I was lying in bed, which was probably about 6-7 hours. <br><br>
At one point during the night, in between my drift offs and surreal, half conscious state, I had to get up to urinate. At this point, reality was extremely distorted. I walked to the toilet and when looking in the mirror I remember not feeling male. My reflection was slightly feminine and my ego at this point was not wholly intact. I was massively confused and not sure about my surroundings, which seemed to be computer-like, cubic and overly abstract. This was different to other substances I had taken though it wasnt particularly frightening. I returned to bed and fell into my half-slumber. <br><br>
When I awoke in the morning I got up and my coordination was still somewhat impaired. This is when I could finally make a rational conclusion that it was definitely not ketamine and something far more powerful. My other housemate agreed and was himself feeling shaky. I headed to the station and got the train home feeling bright and positive. Almost like the following day after I had first taken MDMA. <br>
After this time me and my friends took methoxetamine on a few more occasions. But it wasnt long before we made a pact to all throw away our individual supplies together. We had agreed that it was in fact dangerous. The following times I had taken it had caused me  and others  to feel odd, be violently sick and even experience a depressive mood the next day. I had witnessed people be so out of control on the substance they didnt even realise where they were. Which is why I will conclude that it is not a safe substance. Try, if you will out of curiosity, but be warned: re-dosing excessively is often inevitable and can have shocking consequences. From an experienced K-user, mexy is nowhere as fun or as safe.<!-- End Body -->
