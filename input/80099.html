I was having a lonely depressing night so I took four .25 halcions. Then finally my neighbor wanted to chill.  I felt very benzo'd on the way to his house. Then we got a bottle of jack (all of that I didn't remember).  Me and his continued to drink my memory of that is shady from the first shot, but after the bottle was gone, I remember trying to gather my  stuff.  I was falling all over the place with a memory that was blacking out. I asked to spend the night I was so tired and had no coordination.  I can't remember walking home but I did succesfully. The halcion killed my memory and made me very loopy despite my very high benzo tolerence. Halcion should only be used for sleep I never took outside my house again.  It's very strong short acting benzo use as prescribed.<!-- End Body -->
