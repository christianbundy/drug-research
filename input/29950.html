A few years ago I was prescribed Welbutrin for depression.  Apparently I developed psychotic tendencies which could be attributed to the Welbutrin, so my psychiatrist prescribed for me Risperdol, an anti-psychotic.  Why he didn't just take me off Welbutrin and prescribe another anti-depressant is beyond me.  <br><br>
One night I dropped four hits of LSD and proceeded to have a very intense trip.  About 5 or 6 hours later it was time for me to take my usual dose of Risperdol.  I was still tripping very hard, and was not expecting to come down for another 6 hours, but surprisingly enough, I was completely down within half an hour.  I should have realized that this was going to happen as Risperdol is in the same class as Thorazine which is used to end bad trips in the hospital.  <br><br>
Some interesting side notes about Risperdol.  In short, I hated this drug.  It made me feel disconnected from the world.  I'm usually a person with very intense emotions, but Risperdol seemed to suck all of it away from me.  I didn't seem to care about anything.  I enjoyed spending my time watching tv, and settled into a mundane existence.  After taking the drug for some time I began periodically skipping doses.  This was very pleasurable as I would begin to FEEL again, and my emotions were intensified by the previous numbness that seemed to envelope me.  Overall I think Risperdol did more damage than good.  Luckily enough, I have been free of all prescription drugs for over three years, and even stopped using psychedelics because I felt that I wasn't in the right state to use them and realized that I had begun to abuse them.  It is only recently that I've felt confident enough to be able to use psychedelics in moderation and gain the best from them.<!-- End Body -->
