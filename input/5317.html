First, to give you a little background on myself; I am currently 16 years old. I have been experimenting with drugs for about 3 years. Started with marijuana (which has evolved into 3-4 times per week usage), a brief stint with any kind of painkillers/downers (Perkaset, vicodin), then in High School I was introduced to both LSD and Ecstasy. I had done E twice and LSDonce (both on their own) before the combination I'm about to explain to you.<br><br>
I had recieved the two hits a LSD from a close female friend who got them at a rave she had gone to. Ironically another friend also attended a rave, and had one E tab left, that she gave to me at the same time. So I took this as a sign (since i had always wanted to candy-flip), and decided to do both on a Friday night. <br><br>
I now look back on it as a bad decision, but I candy-flipped while going out with 3 of my male friends (I am a male, but am quite feminine) none of which had any acid or E experiences. <br><br>
I dropped one hit of the lsd at one friends house. We were waiting for our other friend with an automobile to arrive.  It had been about 20-25 minutes since the ingestion, and my surroundings became extremely vivid, and everything became sharper. <br><br>
But once we got in the car and headed off, I dropped the other hit, and was bombarded with questions. I attempted to explain what I was feeling, but from what my friends told me, I wasn't making much sense. Driving in the dark was amazing. The road, and the scenery I could make out, dissolved into one big fantastic blur. Then the yellow lines on the road suddenly stuck out, and started dancing. Visually it was absolutely amazing. By now I was tripping pretty hard, and in trying to communicate, I was spitting out words that didn't make much sense. All of my friends thought this was amazingly funny, and laughed histerically. This brought a cloud of self-conciousness around me, and I stopped talking all together. Then my friends kept trying to scare me by yelling, and lighting a lighter by my foot.<br><br>
I was glad when we reached our destination, a Fred Meyer's where we were meeting a friend who was going to streak that night. It had been about 2 hours since my first acid hit, so I swallowed down the E-bomb. The inside of the store changed into a new and wierd world. During the 30 minutes we were inside, a figure (cleary an elf), continued to follow me. The 'elf' was nither threatening or comforting, just there. I was still unable to communicate, and still being made fun of. After constantly being made fun of for about 15 minutes, and seriously told my friends to stop it, I was getting scared. Even though they had never experienced it, they seemed to understand, and just became quiet. As they were waiting in line to pay, one of them set me up on a mechanical Donald Duck. As Donald swayed back in forth, I began to feel the E's physical sensation, and my body melted into a steady rythm, which I kept going even after the ride had stopped. <br><br>
By now the E's empathy, and social understanding kicked in. It was at this time people started emmitting, or vibrating colors. While strangers appeared alien, and no particular color, my friends distinctly gave off 'color vibrations'. Of my three amigos, two glowed in black, while the third was a mellow yellow. Searching the vast cosmos of my brain to understand why, I realized that black symbolized cruelty and a bad attitude. While the yellow symbolized the third friends, sort of neutral actions towards me. <br><br>
We then hooked up with are 'naturalist' friend. Ironically the streaker's girlfriend was the person who gave me the acid. Both my E and LSD experiences had taken place with her, and I was overjoyed when I found out she had accompanyed her boyfriend. As soon as she was informed I was candyflipping, she came over to me, and asked me what I was feeling, as she rubbed hands. She immediatly vibrated red and was warm to the touch. <br><br>
It was too early to streak, so they decided to go to a Burger King, and kill an hour. By now my mind was just totally blown, and I went along for the ride. I escaped from the 'bad vibe' car, and rode in the back seat with my wonderful female friend. The physical sensations of the E were pretty intense, and she rubbed my hand, and stroked my skin. I then realized how cold I had been all night, and her warm touch was much welcome. <br><br>
The hour we spent at Burger King was undescribable. Both substances seemed to be peaking, beautifully at the same time. I sat by my 'red' friend, and she continued to play with my sensitive skin. My whole body vibrated wonderful physical sensations, and colors swirled around the air. I sat in blissful silence for I don't know how long, with a smile imprinted on my face. Remembering they brought a video camera along, somebody broght it in. I was extremely fascinated by the camera. The lcd screen seemed like portal to a new world filled with vibrant colors. I would suggest a camera as a 'toy' for anyone candy-flipping.<br><br>
What happened next I can't really recall. The guy streaked, and I was waiting in the 'get away vehicle'. When it finally hit me what was going on, I couldn't stop laughing. The guy ran out of the store, hopped in the car, and we sped off. While it was a blur, I found it histerical. The two vehicles got seperated during the indecent exposure, and it took what seemed like an eternity to meet back up with the other car, and more importantly my female friend. <br><br>
When we finally did reunite, I had been clenching my jaw, so it was sore and I was thirsty. So with my friends in toe, I bravely walked into a Safeway. The bright white floors immediately took the shape of clouds. The other customers, and the loud speaker, talked in a unusually language made up of blips, bleeps, and echoes. I floated across the clouds, purchased my water and candy, and we all headed out to the parking lot. It was getting late, and everybody was talking about going home. While I was planning on spending the night at the driver's house, his parents were going to be home, and he was still 'black'. As luck would have it my female friend's parents were out of town, so I ended up crashing at her place. <br><br>
By the time we arrived at her house it was 1:30am, but she stayed up and comforted me during the beginning of my comedown, but eventually she fell asleep. She was a wonderful host as usual, and provided me with a big comforter, and soft pillows. After she entered the dream world, I relished in my soft bedding. I layed back and 'melted' into the comforter and pillows. I ended up not sleeping but maybe an hour that night. I passed time by meditating, and reflecting on my reality prior to this chemically-induced change in my surroundings. I also discovered a collection of 'Dr. Suess' books and slowly read all 15 of them.<br><br>
The greatest thing I got from this experience was a renouned appreciation for my close friend. That night, and since then I have noticed all the wonderful things she does for me. I took about 2 hours telling her this the next day, and since then we have a 'undescribably loving' relationship.  <br><br>
I hope you found my description of the most wonderful feeling, somewhat entertaining. But at the least I hope you will learn from my mistakes, and candy-flip (even LSD, or E by respective selfs) with a close friend, who is both understanding and has your same outlook on life.<!-- End Body -->
