 "report": "<p>Set: Just woke up from 6 hours of sleep.</p><p>Setting: Friday Afternoon, around my college town.</p><p>Previous Experiences: Cannabis, 6-APB, MDMA, 4-AcO-DMT, 2C-E, 2C-T-2, 25C-NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe, Mushrooms, DMT, Amphetamine, 2C-I, 5-MeO-MiPT.</p><p>Parts of this is going to be excerpts of my notes I was taking as the effects were coming on, which I will denote below. Most of the first three hours is written in a present tense.</p><p>I prepared approximately 500 micrograms per blotter, by dissolving 8mg in 91% Isopropyl alcohol, and adding this to a sheet of 16 blotters.</p><p>---Active, in-the-moment notes begin here---</p><p>[0:00] - I take one tab and hold it under my tongue for 30 minutes. I did not swallow my spit.</p><p>[0:30] - First effects begin to be felt. Mild buzz and slight alteration of perception is noticed.</p><p>[1:00] - A very warm body buzz begins to take over, and I feel very pleasant. Still no fractaline patterns, but colors are more vibrant. I cannot shake this blotter taste out of my mouth, and I spat it out 30 minutes ago. Typing is fairly difficult for me to do at this point. I feel energized, though. If I took too much at this point, it doesn't appear to be threatening at all. Music sounds quite different at this point, and time seems to have slowed down. +</p><p>[1:15] - I realize this stuff is very fun. It was a little uneasy coming on, but no nausea to speak of. It seems as though I am getting pretty close to the peak. It makes dancing very easy. There seems to be an aphrodisiac component to this compound as well, and it is quite tactile. There are a few patterns in my couch that I am now aware of. ++</p><p>[1:30] - It would seem that I have hit a plateau, and everything seems to be very fluid and fun. Music is absolutely delightful. I FEEL the songs. For some reason, I cannot feel as my fingers type over these keys. It all is very fluid and stream-lined and nice. Very rolly. ++</p><p>---End Active Recording---</p><p>I went out for a walk during this time to go meet with a friend at the library, and I listened to music along the way. I soon became totally immersed in the song I was listening to, and decided to prolong my walk to the library by stopping off at the campus bookstore first to get something to drink. Along this walk, I began to have some fairly trippy thoughts. They consisted of: if other people could tell I was tripping; how fast I was walking compared to other people; if I was breathing loudly (I had my headphones in), etc. </p><p>Finally, I get to the book store (but not before noticing the shininess of the tiles in the student center), and pick up a green tea. After all of this, I had noticed about 10 minutes had passed, and figured I should probably get to the library and meet up with my friend. ++ to the occasional +++</p><p>---More Active Recording---</p><p>[2:30] - Has this only really been about 2 and a half hours? Holy hell. I could have sworn it has been longer. Music is definitely enhanced. This is also extremely tactile, and whether I didn't absorb all of the stuff or not doesn't really matter. About an hour ago, I was debating whether or not I should take a second tab, and I decided against it. At this dose, the visuals are there, but they are mild. I suspect had I taken 1000 micrograms, I would be getting some visuals. As it stands, though, this is not bad stuff at all. I believe I am now at the plateau, and have been for about 30 to 45 minutes. ++</p><p>---End active recording---</p><p>3:00 - Around this time, I decided to analyze the compound for its artistic abilities. I sketched for about an hour, almost non-stop, but it didn't have quite the creative flow that 2c-t-2 had. I found myself thinking about the music a lot, and really getting into it. This compound does wonders for music like I've never experienced. I look at my hands and notice the color and tone on them looks good. The red and gold tones in skin really stood out. I do not believe I would be having any adverse reactions to the compound at this point. +++</p><p>3:30 - 7:30 - The majority of this period is a blur. I accompany my friend while he runs some errands, and we smoke many bowls of weed during this time. Around 5:00, the bowls of weed stopped bringing out the character of the compound. I believe this is when the effects of the compound were beginning their slow tapering off. Around 5:30 is when I verified that they were beginning their very slow, long departure. (initially varied at +++ and ++, but slowly tapered down to ++ and +).</p><p>8:30 - They are still on their way out. I am anywhere between a ++ and + at this point. I can still feel music at this point, and these feelings are still quite reminiscent of the feelings I had earlier on this compound. Though nowhere near the strength, I still clearly remember the feelings.</p><p>9:45  There are a couple elements of it all sticking around, lingering, reminding me its not quite over. It is certainly long-acting, but overall gentle and anti-anxiety.</p><p>Around 14:00 I was able to sleep.</p><p>Mind: 6/10</p><p>The principle flavors I noted with this compound was that it had synesthetic qualities between sound and tactile sensations, and to a lesser extent colors and tactile sensations.</p><p>I found that the enhancements to music and tactile senses were signature to this compound. Musically, I could hear every note plucked, and even 8 hours in, could still truly groove and truly appreciate music. Tactilely, there wasn't as much going on at about 8 hours in, but it dominated the first part of the trip. I felt as though my hand was melting into the computer mouse at many points. Things felt energetic, but fluid.</p><p>At this dose, visually, there wasn't much going on, though colors contrasted, patterns emerged slightly (but not nearly to the extent of 2C-E), and textures shimmered more. I did not see a single fractaline pattern, but I did get mild tracers. The colors of red and yellow really enhanced, and had royal feeling to them. </p><p>My sense of taste was enhanced as well, but I didn't explore it too heavily. It doesn't really have the creative vibe I got from 2C-T-2.</p><p>There was a little anxiety on the come-up, but nothing too much. It was mildly introspective, but not overly so. It was nowhere NEAR 2C-E's in-your-face introspection, but it felt like more than sober introspection. The time dilation on this compound was quite significant. I would estimate that things felt about 25% slower.</p><p>Body: 4/10</p><p>There was very little body load, and no nausea with this compound. Walking was not too much trouble, and my motor coordination was intact. I found that the effects intensified if I stood up quickly. Again, the tactile senses were really what made this compound fly. I wasn't too sensitive to temperature changes. It was a very rolling feeling, and it felt pretty groovy.</p><p>Thoughts: 3/10</p><p>I would have a few insights here and there, and my appreciation for humor was heightened, but they stayed relatively normal. At moments, I would wonder if other people could tell I was tripping, but then I realized that people here barely notice those around them.</p><p>Possible Uses:</p><p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</p><p>Depression</p><p>Anxiety</p><p>A potential aphrodisiac</p><p>Overall Commentaries:</p><p>This compound is an amazingly beautiful compound. There are many faces to it, and many angles. It's certainly a complex one. The best word I could use to describe it, at its very core, is 'groovy.' Groovy in the way that it enhances music, to the point where you can just jive and groove along to just about any song. Groovy in the way you can feel the notes, colors, sounds, and tones of the song, both on an intellectual level and a tactile level - my body buzzing to the sounds of synthesizers was amazing. Groovy in the way that it enhances your mood, and gives you a general rolling, good-vibes feeling. All of this combined makes me think itd be very good for music festivals, dance parties, etc.</p><p>Although I have never tried 2C-B, I can guess what it'd feel like based on the analogy between 2C-I and 25I-NBOMe. This stuff is closest to MDMA, LSD, and the generic 2C rushy, speedy, buzzy feeling. It feels a lot like what I've heard LSD described as, and has a general psychedelia feeling to it. Almost feels tryptamine-like in a way, but not overtly so. Perhaps if I ever found 2C-B, I could analyze them back to back to see what the difference is. Until then, I can only guess that it feels very similar to this. This felt royally unique.</p>"
