It may have been the second day in a row that I confronted one of the Mall preachers at a University. Three cops jumped me. I passed out in their grip and hit my head hard on the concrete. I remember thinking, 'This is bliss.' I saw the circling, cartoonish stars above my head. Then surged off into the galaxy toward the light. I heard someone in the crowd say, 'you didn't have to do that to her.' At which point I hovered above the crowd and asked myself, 'what condition is the body in?' I could see/tell that my body was still in good condition and then suddenly quickened to my feet.<br><br>
The cops took me away but let me go. The next day an outraged student was gathering signatures looking for witnesses but I told him not to bother 'I forgive them (the cops).' This was dumb, I could have easily sued the cops for several thousand dollars, which $$$ I could have used.  Also, the next day, I was under my car looking at something. There was a soft spot on my head, which on the hard concrete caused the OBE to reoccur but I relieved the pressure and stopped the experience from happening again.<!-- End Body -->
