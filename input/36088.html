Mindset and Setting:<br>
I was at a friends house with three of my good friends.  The room was well lighted.  We were all in fairly relaxed and somewhat talkative moods.  I was sitting comfortably on a sofa.  I had tried salvia about 4 times before.  I should also mention that I am a very rational person who tends to be skeptical of reports of paranormal activity.  This makes my trip all the more strange.  <br><br>
The Experience:<br>
I smoked two fairly large bowls of the salvia through a bong.  I felt the effects as I was smoking the second bowl.  The effects were actually not any different from the previous 4 times I had used salvia, but this was the first time I was able to actually put my finger on the strange sensations running through my mind.  <br><br>
I had a strong sense that everything going on inside of me and in the room I was in was being controlled by masses of energy floating through the room.  I could sense the shapes and locations of the energy in the room.  I also both physically felt the masses of energy as they flowed through me, a sort of powerful but painless electrical field, and saw how the manifested themselves in me and in the world around me.  Its manifestations varied.  An example:  At one point, I knew a wall of energy was approaching me.  My friend made a joke, and just as the energy passed through me I laughed hysterically at the joke.  I felt that I was no longer controlling my actions; it seemed that the energy was controlling my actions and that I was simply experiencing them.  Because I could sense the energy flowing in the room in very definite shapes, I had a strong sense that I could foresee the future.  Though I question that sense, I am intrigued by the fact that my actions were fairly logical and normal despite the fact that I seemed to have no true control over them.  <br><br>
The trip lasted for about five minutes.  I had no visual or auditory hallucinations; I simply had the distinctly altered reality I have described.  As the trip faded, so did my sixth sense of the energies.  Another interesting aspect of the trip was that the reality I was in felt entirely normal.  Thus, I was not at all scared or disturbed.  I think that this sense of feeling normal is why I had so much trouble describing my previous four experiences.  In each of those experiences, I couldnt figure out what about the reality was any different than my normal reality.  I have felt this same sense of an altered but seemingly normal reality before when taking mushrooms.  <br><br>
It is strange to me that every time I have done salvia my reality has shifted to such a specific bizarre reality.<!-- End Body -->
