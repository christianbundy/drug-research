Two friends and I each had 4 drops from an eye dropper, taken orally. Each of us had very similar effects, wait times, come down times, etc etc. <br><br>
took about 2 hours to reach pretty much full effect, could definitely feel it after an hour or so though. <br><br>
felt very 'giddy?' for the entire time, uncontrollable laughing, constantly smiling. the jaw ached a bit after. <br><br>
felt a lot of tension, but not in a bad way, just, tension, shroom-like tension. <br><br>
very very good closed eye visuals, intense color, shapes, etc. <br>
a lot of time perception is lost, especially when youre having fun with the CEV's<br><br>
not a whole lot of open eye visuals, but some. for instance, watching movies, characters faces would stretch, cool shit like that. Colors, and color schemes were very noticable, and quite pleasant. some other open eye visuals involved patterns, and many things with visible texture, making a waving type motion. ( hit up the iTunes visualizer and some bassnectar )<br><br>
from the time we took it to the time we felt nothing at all, about 9 hours went by.  <br><br>
no side effects whatsoever. just kinda exhausting from all the tension and laughing and whatever else.<!-- End Body -->
