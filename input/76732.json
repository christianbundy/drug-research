 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI submit this just because searching the web for information about how to care stomach pain caused by abusive usage of ketamine is hard to find...<br>For myself and friends who are very very very very big users of ketamine the only things that can help stopping those stomach pain and urinary problems are:<br>- Drinking a lot of water to prevent dehydration and help urinary problems<br>- Hot baths for stomach pain can help<br>- Drinking hot water with sugar or with a little bit of baking soda<br>- Dycholium 300mg pills (Pills sold in drugstore) they really help me when this horrible stomach pain is coming. I'll take 1 or 2 and then 10-15 minutes after the pain is gone. Not working for everybody.<br>I wish this can help somebody somewhere because this kind of pain is really not fun and I know what I'm talking about....<br>[Reported Dose:\tDaily abusive usage for about 2-3 years]\n\n\n"
