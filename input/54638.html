A few weeks ago, my room-mate showed me some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds he had purchased over the internet. I knew little about them besides the fact that they were similar to LSD with fewer visuals, which I thought meant less powerful. We soaked them overnight, then peeled of the coating, ate them, and drank the liquid.<br><br>
Me and my friend took the LSA at around 9 - 9:30. I start to feel a bit sick almost immediately. We had just eaten a hearty supper earlier, something we had been advised against. I could have booted then, but was curious as to what I had in store. I decided to check online again, and noticed that some people had very bad experiences. I started to get worried, and a bit sick, and a half hour in decided to abort. I ran to the toilet and threw up.<br><br>
A thing to note about this stuff is that it kept coming in waves. Good waves and bad waves. Me and the OP were usually not quite in sync throughout the night. I seemed to have gone through the trip faster than him, hitting the various 'stages' before he did. And boy, were the stages different.<br><br>
At this point I was feeling pretty wierd. I felt like I was full of some sort of energy force that was weighing me down. We listened to his 'Loveline' archives. We were laughing loud. Eventually we decided we were ready for a bowl. Not too much had happened so far, but I felt very drunk. We smoked, and I left the room to play 'Shadow of the Colossus'. I was at a point just before the final boss. I picked up the controller and the most amazing thing happened. I entered the videogame.<br><br>
I bullsh*t thee not. Me and Wander became one and the same. His world felt like the world around me. Like I was in a dream. Like I was there. And when I saw that final collossus, A hundred story fire-eyed black stone devil, I was floored. I can't believe I was able to play as well as I was, but I wasn't doing too well. 'There are awesome things in this world' I thought to myself as I dodged fireballs, but soon realized there was no way I could beat him in the state I was in. I got up from the game and left my room.<br><br>
Things were now very, very amiss. I was now travelling through time, through my own memories. Like rapidly changing channels I relived random parts of my past, as though I was there. I was walking and dreaming at the same time. The walls cycled textures, reality was on the fritz. I stumbled into the hallway, thinking 'I'm having a dream.' I saw myself stumble over. At this point, I knew I was insane. A lunatic. My thoughts flew at random. I felt good- great. Amazing. In fact, I was experiencing what heaven must be like. And therefore, I knew heaven existed, because I was there. And of course, like Dante, I realized there was also a hell to explore. Would I be heading there as well that night?<br><br>
It wouldn't be long. I had to get out of the hallway before I got in trouble. I thought: 'There's no place like home' as I tried to force myself back into reality. I returned to my bed to lie down, and contemplated the rapidly exploding universe. Then a thought hit me: My friend was in the next room and he was probably tripping even harder than me! I quickly went to check on him and found him battling a thought loop. Him: Were fighiting to keep our memories. But we arent going to remember this. Every thought is fighting to be remembered. But were stuck here forever! We have to record this<br><br>
I assured him I would remember everything, but he was in a loop and I wasnt getting in. Our minds were as schizophrenics now, flipping from topic to topic, flying from past to present like our brains were spinning. Our style of banter was not unlike the dialog in Fear and Loathing. He said something about levels. Everything was levels. I noted that Paul McCartney said the same thing the first time he tripped.<br><br>
We were walking into walls. Lucidity came and went. I went to lie down in my bathtub. And this where my hellish, introspective nightmare began. I have no idea how long I lay in that tub. The neurons in my brain did things they never did before, and I wasnt liking it. I felt sick, drunk, and scared. What is existence? Am I just a malfunctioning brain in bathtub?<br><br>
By 4 AM, I was finally ready to pass out. My friend had commandeered my bed due to the presence of an air conditioner, so we traded beds for a while, and I contemplated his giant wall mural. We eventually traded back and I fell asleep, while he continued to trip.<br><br>
I was sober in the morning, but somehow he was still in deep brain-sh*t. He was having trouble breathing, and we decided he should get checked out at the hospital. Fortunately he recovered. But we learned our lesson:<br><br>
LSA is a hell of a f**king drug. If you want to get your brain scrambled for ~$5 a hit, by all means, head on over to the internet and pick up some Woodrose seeds. But this isnt Acid Lite. It was the most powerful thing Ive ever tried and made 2C-E (which Ive tried before) feel like near-beer. And as the my friend could tell you, it can screw you sideways.<!-- End Body -->
