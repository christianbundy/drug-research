 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't going to be a detailed report of my first jump with the substance, but rather a short summary, as I didn't find the experience to be too memorable or really worth too much mention.\r\nDose : 125mg dissolved in cranberry juice\r\nThe taste was kind of putrid, but manageable and thankfully it had no aftertaste.\r\nThe comeup seemed kind of familiar- the elevated hear rate, the anxiety, the slowly shifting perceptions of reality etc... though it was never overpowering or troubling.\r\nThe high itself was pretty relaxed, like a low dose of poppy tea. I sensed no real tactile or auditory enhancements. Just in an altered and relaxed headspace. Mouth was dry throughout and was very bored for the duration, though there never came a time when I wished it would just go away.\r\nIt seems like a pleasant way to spend an evening indoors if I just want to be at peace and relax, but I don't see any other uses for it, and at its price, I may as well just smoke some cannabis.\r\nOverall I give it a 4/10. Will try a higher dose in the future.\r\nIt also should be be noted that I had dosed 15mg of Mirtazapine the night before to go to sleep and was still experiencing the sluggish hangover that comes with it.\n\n\n"
