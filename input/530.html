A friend and I decided to spend a saturday afternoon tripping, as usual. We already had some cannabis and salvia, but decided now would be a good time to try 2C-B, the queen of the psychedelic amphetamines which we had heard so much about. Our dealer said that he had some extremely potent pills, so we purchased one pill between us and had half each. We sat in my room and took the 2C-B orally, then rolled up a fat one with some skunk. I put EP7 by Autechre on the stereo. After we had finished the spliff the 2CB started to take hold. We felt something happening to ourselves, but it didn't feel like anything we were used to. I thought it would feel a bit like E when coming up, but it didn't and I started to worry that the pill might have been spiked with something other than 2CB. First I thought it was acid, the most likely contender as far as pill spiking goes. Then I thought, it must be ketamine or PCP because I couldn't feel my arms and legs getting longer like with acid. <br><br>
After voicing my worries to my friend (who will be known only as Mr.X) I began to get even more worried. Mr.X started saying how warm and snuggly he felt, and I thought that the pill might have been spiked with smack. But then, it all became clear. If it was smack then I wouldn't have cared what was in it, and it certainly wasn't any other drug I had tried, so it must be 2CB. When I had the thought 'This is 2CB, this is really good' it was like I was standing on a beach and a huge wave of orgasmic pleasure hit me like a wall. I was lying on my bed panting, moaning and rubbing my hands over my whole body uncontrollably. I couldn't believe how intense it was. It made cocain look like speed. <br><br>
Then after a few minutes of bliss we calmed down. I felt extremely focused. I knew exactly what reality was, there was no confusion over what was real and what wasn't. I went to the bathroom to get some water and saw some sober flatmates on the way. I spoke to them coherently and felt completely in control of what I was saying. No ecstasy rants. When I came back to the room we decided to let the effects settle in for half an hour. Then we smoked another spliff and got the salvia out. <br><br>
I knew that doing bongs of salvia was going to be cool because I had done salvia and E before, and that was mind blowing. This was going to be REALLY good. After the second bong of salvia I got up and sat in my blow-up chair. I felt like I was on a magic carpet flying into infinity. But it wasn't like doing lots of salvia, because I could see my room as it really was, as well as seeing a horizon which I was flying towards. After the first two minutes of the salvia rush I focused my attention on a large psychedelic poster on my wall. The poster is trippy enough as it is, but the salvia and 2CB added a whole new dimention to it, literally. It looked like it was moving around in 3 dimentions. It kept dividing up into layers which moved foward and backward. As well as this, the pattern on the picture looked like lots of strange animals and humans joined together, and flowing through one another. <br><br>
After the salvia wore off we explored the effects of the 2CB. I found 'concentration' is very important to the experience. For a start it makes you feel very concentrated on whatever you are doing. But if you actually try to concentrate on something as hard as you can, that is when the interesting things happen. Just by concentrating on a thought about how good someting is, the 2CB fills every part of your being with wave after wave of pleasure far more intense than a sober orgasm. But you can control it at will. You switch it on and off just by willing. If you concentrate on something external to yourself then you can take pleasure in this too. You can stare at something and see it getting more and more beautiful, as the 2CB changes its colour and projects geometric shapes onto it. Music sounds like it was supposed to. Social interaction on 2CB is also very enjoyable, but you don't feel like you love everyone as with E. <br><br>
On the whole, I found 2C-B a very versatile and rewarding drug. The best thing about it is that you have so much control over the effects. You can't switch it off completely, but you can easily remember what reality is. The salvia did add a very interesting aspect to the trip. But personally I think that salvia is best taken on it's own, preferable chewed, at least 3 days after taking any other drug, especially cannabis. I may well go without cannabis for a week and then try chewing 10 fresh leaves whilst on 2CB. It's a shame that GOd didn't make salvia and cannabis more compatible.<!-- End Body -->
