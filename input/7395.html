Like curtains of raindrops falling down<br>
Each glittering jewel a twinkling sound<br>
your love sweeps upon me<br>
within me<br>
without<br>
A breath of deadly beauty<br>
And conciousness therein<br>
You glitter and shine<br>
And turn inside out<br>
these selves that are calling my soul to come out<br>
A sweet breath is blowing my soul into fire<br>
My body is dying so that I might go higher<br>
Into the void I now burst anew<br>
The celestial creatures a blessing bestow<br>
On my selfless dying and comedy show<br>
The same experience a friend once had<br>
to wander through the heavens<br>
to experience the riddle of the universe<br>
to remember what you forgot<br>
to know who you are<br>
to know you've come so far<br>
to know your soul's evolution is infinite<br>
to be ordered to say your piece of the puzzle<br>
that is the fathomless mystery <br>
that is the universe within us<br>
to feel divine love ravage our body<br>
and turn every cell inside out<br>
to feel your bones ache<br>
and know that one day your body will die<br>
to know what will be left behind<br>
to go beyond the door<br>
that is guarded by the image of our self<br>
to sacrifice this image so we may be born anew<br>
well my friend said he did not know what to do <br>
when he came back and had to talk to me and you<br>
but he was very humble that friend of mine<br>
who had sacrificed his body<br>
to witness the mysteries of time<br>
just imagine<br>
just imagine being a limitless being<br>
constantly imaging itself<br>
constantly getting to know itself<br>
constantly making love to itself<br>
constantly suprised<br>
and constantly being alarmed by itself<br>
constantly enchanted by itself<br>
constantly dying and constantly being born<br>
constantly mended and constantly torn<br>
constantly crying<br>
and constantly laughing at us<br>
the myriad lifeforms that inhabit it<br>
that are it<br>
that are its eyes and ears<br>
And after all this I hear an angel's astonished shout<br>
does it really fucking matter<br>
who we think we are<br>
does it really fucking matter if the Jones have a bigger car<br>
does it really fucking matter <br>
if someone beats you up<br>
does it really fucking matter<br>
if you live in a rubbish bin<br>
when such truly timeless beauty<br>
can be found within<!-- End Body -->
