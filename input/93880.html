4-HO-MET was my first research chemical experience. I'd been interested in trying it for quite some time, having read many experience reports, and I knew it would likely be a very mellow, calm trip. So when a good friend of mine offered to sell me some of his stash as a favor, I gladly accepted. <br><br>
I am B; my friend, who also dosed with me, is D. I had convinced D to try the metocin with me earlier in the day; for the few hours before we dosed, we were relaxing at a friend's apartment, slowly enjoying some cannabis. Earlier in the day, I had been in a very bad mood due to realizing that I had been scammed in a purchase of some piracetam over the internet; however, my negative mindset had passed by this time. <br><br>
(Please keep in mind that this report was written after the fact, and my memory is a little hazy. The times are approximate.)<br><br>
7:00: We dose. There is that sense of anxiety that I always get when trying something new. I open my bottle (clearly labeled 'drugs') and remove two 10mg capsules from the bag of pills inside. I turn to face D and recite the little rhyme I always recite before ingesting psychedelics; 'Through the lips, past the gums, watch out stomach, here it comes.' D looks at me after swallowing his capsule. 'B, you're a bad influence on me.' I smile. I know we're going to have ourselves some fun tonight. <br><br>
Shortly thereafter, we leave the friend's apartment and make our way to a fort in the nearby woods which our group of friends likes to frequent. The fort is calm, relaxed, and always friendly; I have tripped there previously several times, but never on this substance. A friend messages me about how she lost her purse.<br><br>
7:45: The effects of the 4-HO-MET have just barely started to kick in (I think the comeon was delayed because of the capsules that we dosed with). We decide to dose some more, so we go to another friend's room to weigh out and split my last remaining 4-HO-MET capsule, adding an extra 5mg to each of our total doses. This dose is done sublingually at about 8:15. We stay there for a bit and allow the effects to slowly increase, relaxing on the floor. We listen to some electronic music.<br><br>
8:30: The first dose has probably completely reached peak by now. I am getting visual effects extremely similar to psilocin. Rainbow-y patterns appear on the friend's walls. The body load from this drug is also very qualitatively similar to psilocin, but not as heavy; it's actually rather light and enjoyable , whereas I sometimes find the mushroom body load unpleasant. We hear news of an Occupy protest happening at the student services building of my college; we decide to stop by there to see what's going on. I text my friend who lost her purse (let's call her K) to meet us there, as I want to cheer her up.<br><br>
By this point, I realize that perhaps 10mg would have been a perfectly acceptable dose, but the metocin's mental effects are very light. I am not scared or overwhelmed; I am still able to think rationally and seem to have full control of my mental capacities. At this point, the effects of the metocin seem to only be sensory; it has little effect on my mindset, unlike LSD or psilocybin, which tend to send my mind reeling into other worlds. <br><br>
8:45: The walk in the dark was fun and refreshing; it's a nice night, warmer than it has been at this hour for quite some time. We arrive at the scene of the protest to find very little going on; the few dozen protesters seem to be waiting around to get arrested. As we both had backpacks and brains full of illegal and questionably legal chemicals, we decide to leave immediately. I text K to walk back to my room instead, as that's where we decide to go. From the student services building, we take a shortcut through a ravine, which despite the darkness making it hard to find footing, was quite fun. The visuals I'm getting make it somewhat hard to focus my eyes on things in the dark. <br><br>
9:30: We arrive at my room, and proceed to lie around and listen to some music and stare at the ceiling. Eventually, K shows up, and after a few minutes we tell her we are tripping, and what we're tripping on. It's interesting to note that if we had not brought it up, I don't believe K would ever have known that we were on anything more than a little cannabis that night. Though I wouldn't trust myself to drive on any substance (except perhaps weed), I have far more control than any other psychedelic I have done. I would not be afraid of dealing with police on 4-HO-MET - or at least not any more afraid than normal - should the situation come to that. <br><br>
We enjoy the music for a little while, but as the metocin has less noticeable effects on headspace, there were no incredible delusions as one might expect on other drugs  just a nice relaxed intoxication. I felt snazzy.<br><br>
10:30: We've all gotten restless, and decide to go have a smoke at a friend's apartment (we met up with quite a few people that night, now that I think about it). When we get there, I realize that his bong is extremely similar to one that I broke a few weeks ago; this fills me with elation. It was like seeing the twin brother of my dearly departed friend. We smoke and relax at his house for several hours; I notice that I have a tendency to hold the bong and talk for quite some time, which I never do while sober. That happens four or five times throughout the course of the night, but nobody is upset about it. <br><br>
1:00: I've mostly come down. We all decide to go our separate ways and settle down for the evening; I can't get to sleep until four or five in the morning. I know that people say that the trip often doesn't really end until one sleeps, but I've never noticed that as strongly as with metocin. I finally drift away to sleep, and wake up the next morning without any hangover. I feel great. <br><br>
The comedown for me was slightly longer than 4-6 hours, which was what initially propelled me to write this report. 4-HO-MET is an extremely mellow and relaxed psychedelic, and it's easy to see why so many people on the internet call it their favorite; it is light and easy on the mind, and still quite enjoyable. This is a psychedelic that I would choose to do in a social setting or a concert, even though recently I've been trying to trip solo or in small groups (2-4 people) more often. <br><br>
All in all, it was a great night.<!-- End Body -->
