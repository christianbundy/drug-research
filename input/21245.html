It was a Monday, no school that day but I had to go the next day. I wanted to have a quick smoke to relax me so I could get a good night's sleep. I rolled up a towel and stuffed it under the door, lit an incense stick, and loaded 3 roaches into my homemade wood pipe. I smoked the bowl pretty fast, and the resinated weed was pretty potent<br><br>
I then lied down and put on my current favorite CD; By The Way by Red Hot Chili Peppers. I was getting some trippy vibes as the cd played...when it got to track 4, 'dosed', my high was definately peakng. I closed my eyes and saw the most amazing thing in my life...<br><br>
I was a baby, escaping from the womb. I didn't know it as it happened, but I was sliding out, being born into a busy world of bright lights, loud noises...I then realized what had just happened, and I saw all of my life, everything between the moment I was born and this second laying on my bed, flash by in a fraction of a second.<br><br>
The intensity of the experience hit me like a truck. All of a sudden I felt amazing emotions all at the same time...I began to laugh, and cry at the same time at the beauty of it. The intense feeling lasted a few minutes; my mind was just racing with thoughts. I then realized something: the fast-motion version of my life I just saw WAS my whole life; it happened in a snap, just like that, that was it. I never lived before the second I was that tiny baby being born, that was the begining of it all, and time just seemed to stop into slow motion where it was...<br><br>
Its hard to explain the feeling I had. It was so intense. I was positive that I had not lived before that moment; I was sure that what I saw, in a fraction of a second, was my life. my birthdays, the day I learned to surf, the first time I was introduced to the magical world of ganja, it was all there. and then it just stopped, and there I was, I had only lived for a fraction of a second<br><br>
Relative to how long the earth...the universe...everything has existed, it really was a fraction of a second. That is where the amazing intensity came from.<br><br>
I cried for a second, then just layed in bed, thinking about it for a long while.<!-- End Body -->
