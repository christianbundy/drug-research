Datura can only be described as a poison. The delirium it creates almost qualifies as a near death experience. Yeah, I see some amazing stuff, but it turns me into a raving lunatic. All perception of reality is destroyed, leaving me in a world where fantasy is indistinguishable from fact. Here is my walk through the valley of the dead. Here is my inferno.<br><br>
It was a warm summer night in Austin Texas, and the city was full of vibrant life and unseen possibilities. My friends and I were having a laid back party. They were sipping cold keystone light and smoking on some mary jane, but I was out for bigger and better things. You see, I am somewhat of a hallucinogenic connoisseur and am always on the search for a good free trip. It just so happened that I had seen a nice big flowering patch of Jimson Weed that was just down the block. So I jogged down there with a friend and quickly harvested an acceptable amount with my pocket knife. <br><br>
When we got back to the house I went straight for the kitchen. Having done this little procedure before, I quickly cut open the seed pods and removed all the seeds. After discarding the outside skin, I chopped up the leaves and flowers into small pieces and added them to the seeds. I then boiled three cups of water and mixed the jimson weed in. I let it boil for about 30 minutes, until the water was reddish brown and tasted horribly bitter. To improve the taste I had brought this strange kind of blueberry herbal tea my Mom buys. It worked beautifully and the concoction tasted awesome. <br><br>
I knew that with the amount of seeds I had used that I wouldn't need more than a cup to get the desired affect. However, I was high and it tasted good so I ended up drinking two cups. Oops. Now, normally I am very cool headed when it comes to doing drugs. Substances that make some people freak out merely arouse my curiosity. But this situation was quite different. I was well aware that under normal circumstances datura takes several hours to begin its black magic. Naturally it bothered me when the drug began to take effect 5 minutes after I finished my second cup. <br><br>
My mouth became extremely dry and I lost my balance as if I was drunk. My throat got so dry that it was hard to breath and I found myself sitting on the bathroom floor gasping for breath. An older friend of mine whose judgment I trusted told me I had taken to much and could die from doing that. So it was that I decided to contact my parents and go to the hospital.<br><br>
So far I had seen no visuals, but after I reached the emergency room they began to come on intensely. It began in the waiting room. I was sitting down watching some people across the room when the walls around me seemed to expand, and the room became much larger. The woman sitting close to me appeared much farther away. While I was pondering this development, a man in a white suit came and led me and my parents to a curtained in hospital bed, where he had me lie down. Supposedly, they had to inject charcoal into me as a counteraction of the drug, and I was required to lie still while they did this. Little did they know I was in another world.<br><br>
All at once the room around me faded, and I was driving in my car-my Mom later described seeing my hands snap up as if to grab a steering wheel. I saw a street with weird houses that were stretched up towards the sky like some invisible vacuum was sucking them upwards. I could hear my mom talking to me from my passenger seat but when I looked over the seat was empty. I heard strange voices calling to me from far away. Then suddenly it was all gone, and I was in the hospital room once again. Just as I was beginning to return to reality I noticed mounds of 3 foot long neon green glowing worms squirming violently on the ceiling. <br><br>
I stared up in amazement and awe, finally peeling my eyes away just as some strange man in tights and puffy medieval attire stepped into view. Pure insanity. I began to drift through different visions and scenarios, some far to obscene to retell. I explored different horrific worlds, conversing with deceased companions and unholy ghosts. No meaning and no explanation, save that reality and imagination entwined with one another to produce on inexplicable dream. A dark and lucid dream that had to be experienced but will never reoccur.<br><br>
I woke up the next day a sane individual once again, fully aware that I had just lived through the most insidiously powerful hallucinogen that nature provides. These fantastically complex nightmares are meant for one time and one time only. Im glad I did it, but I'd be a fool to do it again.<!-- End Body -->
