 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nBackground:<br>I am 16 the only drugs Ive tried other then this is cannabis frequently for the last while and alcohol once, t3's orally for awhile (ran out) and I tried taking nutmeg orally. Got about 2 spoon full down then the next one I spit up to no effect.<br>Earlier this day:<br>I haven't eaten since about 6 1/2 hours ago so I have empty stomach, I smoked cannabis bout 7 1/2 hours ago (should be back at baseline). Thats the last of my cannabis. I am really bored and I don't like being sober and read both good and bad reports smoking it so if I don't have to taste it decided Id try it.<br>Bowl Size: <br>width and length = 1 inch<br>depth = 1 cm<br>Timeline:<br>t+0:00<br>I smoked my first bowl, nutmeg is really flammable. When I lit it it stayed lit the whole time, I had to put it out with bottom of lighter. I took quite a few hits, couldn't keep up with the burning but got quite a bit. Also I agree with the statement of it being heavy smoke, I didn't find it harsh on the throat like cannabis the first time but more harsh directly on the lungs. Burns my nostrils when exhaling through nose.<br>t+0:01<br>It really stinks just like nutmeg so I wet my pipe. Gonna let it dry but needed stink out. Had a drink of water.<br>t+0:02<br>No effects noticed except slight light headedness. Gonna smoke another bowl.<br>t+0:03<br>Smoked second bowl doesn't get any easier on the throat really, didn't burn as easily, because I washed it but it did burn but no less harsh but a bit of chunks of nutmeg washed into my mouth while inhaling (ew!)<br>t+0:05<br>Mild marijuana like high, spacey mainly. I ate a banana, hungry but not from nutmeg just from not eating for awhile.<br>t+0:15<br>No more effects, want better so I did another half of bowl.<br>t+0:40<br>No more effects again the same, did another full bowl, decided thats the last if it doesn't work with 3.5 bowls it's not worth it.<br>t+1:20<br>Went for a walk to avoid parents, felt a little nauseas but thats gone.<br>t+1:50<br>I feel like Im back at baseline.<br>Good Parts:<br>mild high<br>Bad parts:<br>harsh smoke<br>nauseas (not too bad)<br>heavy smell<br>bit of bad taste<br>short high<br>need to smoke too much for effects\n\n\n"
