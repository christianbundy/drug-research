 "report": "<p>The times that I present in this trip report are merely approximations as I experienced extreme time dilation and was unable to look at the time most of the night. Some of the times have been parsed from logs of IRC rooms I was on at the time. It is important to note that during this experience, I was at home while both of my parents are asleep. I have tripped in this situation numerous times with no problems but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone as it can result in a bad trip.</p><p>It had been nearly two weeks since my last trip which was on 2c-b, so I decided to finally test the AL-LAD that I had lying around. I made the decision to dose 300ug believing my experience with psychedelics would allow me to deal with such a dose; I was wrong.</p><p>At approximately 9pm, I dosed by putting two 150ug tabs in my gums and waited for it to hit while chatting on IRC. After about 30mins, I decided to swallow the tabs due to some reports that the bio-availability of AL-LAD was less with buccal administration. At T+45min, I started to feel the first alerts. This included a subtle body high, slight breathing walls, and an energetic joyous mood.</p><p>As the trip became more and more intense, I continued to enjoy it. From about T+1.5 to T+2.5 I was in a splendid place mentally and physically. I spent my time on IRC while listening to music and rubbing moisturizer on my bare feet which felt simply orgasmic. If I remember correctly, at around 11pm I opened the window in my room and started smoking a bowl of some medical grade cannabis straight from Colorado. I rarely smoke anymore, so my tolerance was nonexistent. After two to four hits I was quite high from the weed and absentmindedly put the pipe down.</p><p>Shortly after, I believe I went to go lay down on my bed while listening to music play from my laptop which was hooked up to my television. This provided a large screen for the screensaver to play on for my enjoyment. With the lights off, I began to recess deeper and deeper into my own mind. The lines between what were OEVs and CEVs were blurred to where eventually I wasnt even in reality anymore. I soon found myself in a world consisting of only color and light. I had no body to speak of I was simply in existence in this new place. I distinctly remember feeling at one with the entire universe during the part of the trip. What I was seeing was reminiscent of an Alex Gray painting, but not as detailed and of course it was constantly moving. This was something I had never experienced on any drug before but I was intrigued that my brain could produce such a state. As I floated around this strange place taking in all its wonder, I believe I came into contact with some sort of entity. Perhaps it was just my imagination but I have no idea. If I remember correctly, we communicated something but I cant remember what it was. I dont feel like this encounter lasted very long. After the voyage out of reality, I slipped back into the environment of my room. I was able to achieve this state one or two more times before moving on with the night. I assume this is what ego death is</p><p>Im not sure why, but at some point I began to feel a very negative energy start to surround me and force me lower and lower. It was as if a giant ball was closing in on me in a sinister manner. I felt as if I had to struggle to remain in a positive mood. I tried changing my setting by changing the lighting and moving to different areas of my room. Eventually, I decided to go take a shower to relax and calm down. This strategy worked for 15-20 minutes but I started getting bad vibes again so I had to change my setting. For maybe the next 30min to an hour I went back and forth trying to get to a happy place by changing where I was, the music I was listening to and the lighting. None of this worked for very long. It is unclear when, but at some point when I became more familiar with what I was feeling, I decided to smoke the rest of the bowl that I had started earlier.</p><p>The body load of the AL-LAD started to kick in after I finished the bowl, I believe. I ended up throwing up 3 times. It was at this point that I started having extreme paranoid delusions. I was under the impression that something I had eaten not related to the drug had given me food poisoning. This made me concerned for my health and made me feel like I needed an ambulance to take me to the hospital. I had it made up in my mind that I was going to wake my parents up and tell them I had food poisoning. But, I had a problem  I had just smoked a bowl of pot in my room and didnt want them to find out. I hurriedly tried to collect all of the evidence and put it in my backpack and get it out of the way. It is important to note that at this time the visuals were so intense that I was almost practically blind. I raced around my room collecting the things I thought were important to hide making a huge mess in the process.</p><p>Eventually, my stomach quieted down and I decided it wouldnt be a good idea to wake my parents up. For some reason I convinced myself that I had woke them up from all of the noise I was making so I felt like I had to get rid of the evidence of me doing drugs. So, out the window I went with my back pack full of weed, a scale, my pipe, wallet, keys, and other random things I felt I needed. In addition to believing that my parents were trying to catch me, I also felt like the police were onto me, even though didnt have any real reason to think that. It got so bad that at several points it literally felt as if I had multiple cops standing right over me with their guns in my face. Needless to say, my heart was beating out of my chest. My plan as far as I can tell was to stash all of my stuff in my car so that I didnt have to worry about my parents finding it in my room when they inevitably caught me that night.</p><p>I made it to my car with my bag but I couldnt find my keys, so I left my bag on top of my car while I went to climb back through my window to look for my keys in my room. As I searched around inside, I think I started to come down from the high somewhat which made me chill out. At one point I remembered I hadnt taken any of my medication that day so I basically took one of every pill that I had. This included 100mg of Sertraline, 2.5-7.5mg of Melatonin, an antibiotic, 25-50mg of DPH and an antacid tablet for my stomach. Eventually I calmed down enough to venture out into the living room to see if anything was happening, which of course, nothing was. An hour or two later by about 3:30am I was calm enough to try to go to sleep. The DPH and melatonin kicked in and made it very hard to resist falling asleep. Before I drifted off, I managed to set up an alarm to go off on my computer for 5:30am so I could wake up before my parents and sort out all the shit that happened. I would have used my cell phone, but I lost it while going through the window at some point.</p><p>At 6:30am I was woken up by my mom coming into my room and saying she needed to speak to me. The alarm I set earlier had failed to wake me up. I got up and went into the living room to see the contents of my backpack lying on the table. In my delirious state I had either forgotten or just been too tired to go get it from on top of my car. They found it while walking the dog in the morning.</p><p>Overall, its hard to say if this was a negative or positive experience. On one hand I tripped harder than I ever have before and achieved what I believe to be ego loss for the first time which I have been seeking for some time. While on the other hand I got caught by my parents and had a night of crazy paranoia filled delusions. The next time I trip I will make sure to have a benzodiazepine on hand to help calm me down in case things get too intense. I certainly wont be doing 300ug of AL-LAD anytime soon. In my opinion, this chemical is much more potent than LSD. I have taken 330ug doses of LSD twice and found it very easy to handle each time.</p>"
