 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAs of this trip, I am 19 years old, 192 lbs and have experimented with this substance (nbome) over 10 times in the past and have had largely positive experiences with it. My last experience was six days prior to this one.\r\nThis time, in the beginning like my previous experiences was very deep and entertaining. However, roughly 4 hours into the trip I proceeded to smoke around a gram of weed with no tolerance and soon my trip became very confusing and unlike any other I've had before.\r\nI have used cannabis and nbome together in the past, and they usually don't conflict too badly, although I typically begin to smoke towards the end at the 7 hour mark.\r\nI would have documented the the experience prior to the cannabis, however the time dilation as well as shock of the event has made me largely forget it as well as a huge portion of the trip which I am still in the process of remembering.\r\nWhat I do have, however is a log I managed to type up while lost in that unforgiving state of mind which to me appears to be a log of my thoughts during my time. It's presented here in it's raw unedited form.\r\nNothing makes sense anymore...\r\nIs this hell?\r\nAsperigantz?\r\nWhen logic is no more...\r\nHorror, fear, lots of it...\r\nA world of Nostalgia and childhood worlds...\r\nNothing makes sense... none of it. I've snapped.\r\nThere is no such concept as the ego.\r\nIt is a fabrication.\r\nReality does not make sense, therefore it does not exist.\r\nAsperigantz? What is that?\r\nThis place. It's so familiar, like i've seen this place before.\r\nThis alien world where nothing simply happens to make sense.\r\nHaven't I been here before? What, a thought loop.\r\nOh, so this is a thought loop.\r\nFuck, I haven't broken out of it like I normally do.\r\nWait a minute, what is a thought loop?\r\nI feel that's asperigentz... what ... is asperigentz?\r\nIt strikes fear in me.. and remembrance... nostalgia as well...\r\nas if this fear is the same as when I was born when nothing made sense... as a baby.\r\nSo, does that mean reality is hell?\r\nI don't think so. Although I don't feel as if I am.\r\nHow long have I seen hell? This is terrible. It's all encompassing...\r\nThis other being... my other self is tormenting me.\r\nWhy does all that does exist that makes sense, not make sense?\r\nIt all feels so fake...\r\nBut it all feels so real...\r\nAs if the reality I used to know was just an illusion from the very beginning.\r\nMy other ego is tormenting me, insanity is my world now.\r\nI feel as though we are coming together now.\r\nCommunion maybe?\r\nReality is coming, Nostalgia still present.\r\nWhy is it that words are no longer sufficient to express my situation,\r\nHave I seen the devil?\r\nNothing seems good.\r\nPleasant even.\r\nMy sense of reality is gone. Apparently this world of insanity is asperigentz.\r\nEverything looks weirder and weirder.\r\nWhy do I know this place?\r\nI've been here before... forever...\r\nThis state of mind... i've left it... and thought it forgotten.\r\nThis is the same state of mind as when my dad died.\r\nNothing simply made sense anymore.\r\nWow, how raw... this feeling... of bitterness...\r\nI thought i've left behind this beast a long time ago...\r\nThis forgotten child... a former me... who no longer wished to be\r\nEvery moment I am replaced... every moment i am gone...\r\nI do not exist...\r\nAt least for not more than a moment.\r\nAsperigentz.\r\nThis is a fear that resides in me. A world that I remember.\r\nI feel as though I could cry, but bear no tears to weep from.\r\nWhen someone close to you dies, and a huge reality hole opens up.\r\nHow do you fix that? But before that, what is this reality I remember?\r\nI've seen it time and time again and I cannot figure out why?\r\nSexual excitement brings union, what, love, marriage?\r\nIt brings order.\r\nI cannot believe I have lost my sanity,\r\nWhat is this place? What can I... where I used to be...?\r\nI've lived this reality for a long time... it's the reality you enter...\r\nwhen you sleep...\r\nThat horrible reality.\r\nTime has become my greatest executioner...\r\nAeons of Insanity... seconds of Reality...\r\nI want it to end.\r\nBut I don't.\r\nWhen will the sun rise?\r\nWhen it rises, everything will be alright again?\r\nWhy is that?\r\nWith the sun comes sleep.\r\nThe children must stop laughing.\r\nThey're always laughing.\r\nBut they're not real.\r\nThe laugh isn't real.\r\nIt's not real isn't it?\r\nThe walls of Reality, where are you?\r\nI have died and been born upon it to witness it a thousand times.\r\nAsperigantz why do you torment me...?\r\nSanity no longer ceases to be, allow me to cease to be.\r\nI can do everything except die.\r\nI know how to do everything except die.\r\nBut if I die, i'll come back to this place again.\r\nThey're stairs... a sense of space?\r\nI'm not the one in charge.\r\nEveryone else is?\r\nIt feels like an old house...\r\nLost and exploring in a place I never knew, forever, endless...\r\nMusic founds all my logic...\r\nMaybe... music...\r\nWhy is that beings with no groundings in reality make the most sense...\r\nI understand it...\r\nI just don't care...'\r\nI miss her.\r\nAsperigentz, please leave me.\n\n\n"
