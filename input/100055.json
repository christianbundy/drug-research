 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nGrew plants from clones, very easy under florescent light. \r\nCut leaves off during cloning process of all sizes and age and dried them stem removed under newsprint for a few days then added dried leaves into a plastic bag of which I crumbled.\r\nThe powdered leaf was added to a bong with a large chamber and icy cold water, the bowl was stuffed to the rim with salvia. The first hit was subtle in change but the second deep hit was enormous in change of perception. \r\nMy body wanted to flow with some kind of energy playing with light and colour with my eyes closed. I felt a flowing energy that made me focus. A shamans tool. Still deciphering the experience, but will do it again\n\n\n"
