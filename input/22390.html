I attempted to weigh out 40mg of 2CC, but frankly my scale is not sufficiently accurate below 100mg, so in the end I decided to eye ball my dose by laying out 100mg and dividing it into slightly uneven halves, and I placed the smaller 1/2 into a shot glass with some orange juice.<br><br>
Just over an hour prior to this I had eaten a small banana, and drank some ginger tea (though I anticipated no nausea, I was being cautious).<br><br>
I downed the shot, it's taste was not good, but was quickly washed away with more juice. My mind set at this time was dare I say normal, basically happy but not especially so, some minor concern over a possible change of job, but no major issues on my mind.<br><br>
I was surprised to feel 1st alerts within 20mins of ingestion.<br><br>
Over the next 25-30mins the effects grew steadily and I began to get some very feint CEVs, and a slight difference in my vision, but neither substantial.<br><br>
As the experience proceeded it was pleasant, calm, and comfortable, with no bad feelings and no trace of nausea. But that was it, nice but certainly mild. Indeed, approx 2 hours after ingestion I decided there was no reason not to return a missed call from a potential employer.<br><br>
I found it to be like 2Ci without much euphoria and 2CT2 without much of a sensual element.<br><br>
I would say that it overall lacked intensity and maybe was a little too subtle for my tastes. I wasn't disappointed because I wasn't expecting much. For me next time I use this will be in combination with other things, as in itself it seemed to lack impact. That said I think it would be a good for people who have little or no experience with psychedelics (or phenethlyamines etc) as an easy intro into the possibilities, a stroll through the potential, rather than sprinting headlong into the more challenging substances.<!-- End Body -->
