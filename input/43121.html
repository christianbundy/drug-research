Okay, so I have been smoking pot since high school, 10th grade actually.  I'm an honors student, in sports, etc., made it to college and have done well.  I wanted to trip in high school but never did.  I promised my best friend from school, Amber that I would trip with her first.  Well, college came, and with that came the availability to get good mushrooms.  Amber, Me, and her boyfriend bought 3.5 eighths of the stuff.  Then she brought some Ak-47 pot as a special treat.  The week of the trip I was doing well, nothing went wrong, and I was totally psyched to do them.  Then, the day came.  It was perfect, I was at my apartment with my bestfriend and my girlfriend was gone for the weekend.<br><br>
We started off with some chill music, Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix.  I was totally happy and after eating a few put on all the black lights and smoked a joint.  I felt good.  Then, we decided to watch some comedy.  It was hilarious and became more so as the shrooms kicked in.  After watching comedy for a bit we put on more music and cranked up my black lights.  My friends left the room for a second.  That's the first mistake they made.  I was starting to trip hard but was unaware of it and decided to take more mushrooms.  Then they came back and gave me some more.  So after just under an hour I had taken an 1/8 on an empty stomach and had smoked a fat joint of ak-47.  <br><br>
At the end of the hour I was tripping hard and blown, but having fun.  Then we decided to eat a mushroom pizza.  Bad idea.  It was okay at first but then mixed with a drink made me start feeling really sick, not to mention I was tripping my balls of now because of the extra mushrooms I had put on the pizza.  We talked for awhile and shared the experience.  Then it went down hill.  I started getting sick and that's what turned me out.  My friends didn't inform me that I would feel quezy.  Soon this turned into all out stomach upset which sent me into a bad trip.  I though I was gonna throw up and die b/c I had eaten too many. This got me confused and feeling bad, which further magnified the problem.<br><br>
Then I flipped out.  All reality went to shit. My friends were far off, I didn't know them, etc.  I then decided to rip the couch up and go to bed.  Of course you can't sleep on mushrooms, but I didn't know that.  Then I started to talk about calling the cops.  My friends got the bright idea to leave and lock me in the house, thinking that I would be safe and that I would calm down b/c no one was around and it was a less confusing enviroment.  Big mistake.  I called some people and asked what to do, then it all became clear.  I talked to the people on the phone and they weren't actually there (they were) but I thought I was just going crazy.<br><br>
Then I talked to God.  That didn't help because I realized that all my friends were out to get me and lead me on the path to hell.  This made me fucking insane, and I did the only thing I knew other than call the cops.  I called my parents.  Once on the phone I cried and cried.  I'm a grown college male, I don't typically cry.  I balled.  They realized I was fucked and told me not to drive and to stay where I was.  I did.  My mom kept me on the phone and prayed with me, which calmed me down, and her voice soothed me.<br><br>
After and hour they arrived.  I opened the door hearing the special knock that they had to do before I would let them in.  I hugged my dad and lost it.  I snoted and cried all over.  Then I chilled and they made me take a shower.  After that I got in my dad's truck and he drove me home and talked to me and suddenly I realized what had happened.  I was straight now and on the way home.  Not cool.  I talked to him about it and then got to my house and went to bed.  After that I woke up believing I had talked to Jesus.  After people conviced me otherwise I finally calmed and about two days later I was over the experience.  Now, my friends say the mushrooms were wicked strong.  They left and slept in there car a few seconds from the my apt.  <br><br>
Since then I took them 2 times and slowly did it by eating just a few, then uping it the next time.  Also, I made sure I was in a more friendly enviroment for the next time and kept the idea in my head that it was a false reality.  This lead to 2 awesome experiences.<!-- End Body -->
