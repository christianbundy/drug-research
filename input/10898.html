I took this drug for the second time. The first time I took it, I took about 12-15mgs and had a very pleasant trip.  My auditory awareness was increased significantly both times.  I don't personally recommend taking more than 20 mgs, unless you are ready for an intense, long trip.<br><br>
My trip the second time was very intense. I took a 25mg oral dose.  I was casually dating this girl and we decided to take it together because of the sensational tactile qualities of my first trip.  I told her about my first trip and she was interested.  She had taken acid and ecstasy a number of times and was curious about exploring a 'new' psychedelic drug.<br><br>
She snorted a 12-mg dose.  About an hour into it she started wigging out, at least thats what it appeared to me at the time (I was tripping my balls off).  We separated because I couldnt handle being around her any more.  I think she went and spent the rest of the night in the corner of a dark room.  Four other people tripped with us, all on various dose sizes.  My friend who tried it the first time with me also took a 25mg dose.  We stuck together because we were both having a difficult time talking to anyone else.<br><br>
We all went for a walk in the forest.  I ended up climbing a pretty substantial redwood tree. That part of the trip was very intense.  My motor skills werent too badly impaired.  I felt like a bird in the tree, which was an interesting experience.  About this time (about an hour after taking the dose) I started getting auditory hallucinations.  I could hear very small people laughing all around me.  It was like a crowd following me. Then, if any sounds were present, I could see them.  I hallucinated cartoon laser sounds and saw bursts of red, yellow and white light.<br><br>
After about two hours, we all decided to go back to the apartments and went our separate ways.  I felt like I was coming down at this point, but still had a pretty intense stomach/body trip.  The whole time I felt like I had butterflies in my stomach.  When I got back to the apartment, my friend put on some music.  I recommend this to anyone whos interested in experimenting with this drug.  The auditory/visual combo was very interesting.  I decided to go in the other room and play my bass guitar.  I started messing around with it, slapping, etc.  I found this groove in my head and started slapping it like I have never been able to before.  When I started this I started getting white flashes of light.  The faster and fatter I played, the brighter the flashes.<br><br>
I kept doing this until I peaked and had an orgasm-like experience and 'whited-out.'  I fell back onto the bed and laid there for a little.  It was the most intense body sensation I had ever had on any psychedelic.  I guess it was comparable to ecstasy.  We smoked a lot of weed and listened to music the rest of the trip as far as I can remember.  I was kind of fried after the 'white-out.'  Surprisingly enough, I was able to kind of remember the rhythm I was playing on the bass after the trip.  It stayed with me, which was a very nice surprise. (I wasn't sure if I hallucinated everything, including actually playing bass that well.)<br><br>
I would compare this trip's intensity as far as hallucinations to about 5 hits of good acid, or a little over an eighth of good mushrooms.<!-- End Body -->
