Okay, so this was my first time partaking in any other kind of drug besides pot.  So I really did not know what to expect, but I was excited.  SO my friends and I had gotten together every week for four weeks now, and so we decided to try 4 Ho-DiPT.  At around 3:00 we took them.  I took 20 mg while the others split two amongst the three of themselves. <br><br>
At around 3:45, I was beginning to feel it.  I started to feel really hyper and just wanted to move around and do things all at the same time.  I jumped on the trampoline for a few minutes, and finally sat down.  I was feely really jittery.  When I sat down, my friends began to feel theirs too.  I figured that I would have the biggest trip because 1) I took the most, 2) I weigh the least, 3) one person has done it before and 4) another threw up at about 3:40.  <br><br>
At about 4:00 they were getting sensoral effects like the walls are breathing and they could hear them.  Also at this time, I felt absolutely nothing.  I felt it for 15 minutes and it was gone.  <br><br>
At 4:30 I was still feeling nothing, hoping that it was going to hit me soon.  At this time everyone else felt nice enough to have some cannabis.  After about two bowls, I was still feeling nothing at all.  They had felt the cannibis in addition to the 4-HO-DiPT.  <br><br>
By 9:00 it was time to go inside, and one of them was still feeling it.  So much that she could not coherently speak with her girlfriend.  <br><br>
From 10 until 12 we decided to finish the rest of our cannabis.  I had not felt anything from 4:00 on.  <br><br>
All in all, this experience was very unsettling seeing as how we can still not figure out why I did not experience.<!-- End Body -->
