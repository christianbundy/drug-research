I decided to do it at the house party as I often find that chaotic situations can be nice and intense and provide a lot to mess with your head/challenge your mind. Only thing that concerned me was any nausea which is why I did the 100mg in 2 lines. It turned out to be a good idea since it wasn't the nicest thing in the world to snort. Didn't burn too bad but had a very strong chemically taste, akin to 2CE, which shot to the back of my throat and made me gag. Anyways after 5mins when I started to come up I did the other line.</p><p>T + 5mins (after 2nd line) - Starting to come up quite strongly like a very rapid shroom come up. Things begin to cartoon, contrast and focus shift and colours brighten along with some strong waves rippling through my body.</p><p>T+10mins - These waves become very strong but in a really good way, intense rushes of pleasure swimming through my nervous system and setting my brain ablaze with euphoria and beauty</p><p>T+15mins - Am now definitely peaking where I remain for a good 60mins. DMT type fractals burst over everything however I could still see fine and recognise people. The waves passing through and out of my body through my brain are absolutely amazing like mini vaped DMT rushes every second, which I found myself getting lost in. If I get to try this again it will definitely be in a more serene and calm setting probably by myself to get totally absorbed with this really beautiful body high. However since I am at a party I stumble round loving life but slightly struggling to convey my intense state of happiness and apparently just looked totally out of it. Whether people realised or not I was on top of the world.</p><p>I was still able to hold conversations, having one very interesting discussion about 'Hollow Earth Theory' (look it up really trippy and interesting topic) anyways interspersed with that were intense fits of giggles and moments where all words escaped me.</p><p>The closed eye patterning was much like a weak DMT hit, lots of beautiful colours and fractals but nothing of great substance. Open eyed it definitely had a shroomy look to it with spatial distortion and faces becoming somewhat unreal/other worldly. Everything looked beautiful although there were no crazy shroom induced entities or LSD parralel dimesions opening though. I am sure the visual would have been much more encompassing and involving in a solo setting. This peak lasted for around 45-60mins.</p><p>T+60mins: Peak definitely passed but strong effects remain for a further 30-60mins.</p><p>Afterwards I had a lovely afterglow very much like with DMT but much longer. No introspection, no paranoia, just felt on top of the world. I didn't sleep at all that night though I did do a couple of lines of good coke and ethylphenidate and before long the whole party was passed out except me. Luckily there was a ton of alcohol left over, I had my awesome after glow and was blasting through the second book in the 3rd part of the Game Of Thrones so I was happy as Larry. Even with little sleep, a huge alcohol induced hangover and a monster journey home the afterglow was present for maybe even 24hours after dosing. I did however feel super haggard at work the next day and the after glow had long subsided.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>It's a very, very worthwhile substance and easily better than the other trypts that are still legal (at least in the UK) i.e. AMT, 5-MeO-AMT (shudder) and 5-MeO-DALT. Better than a lot the banned ones to which easily chose it over most of the 2Cx (excluding 2C-T-7 which is still one of my favourite phens) 100mg would be too intense for a lot of people especially at a house party so 50-70mg is probably a better starting dose for most. Though at least it has a short duration if it does end up being too intense. Did have a bit of similarity to my 50mg TMA-2 trip and in a way wish I had done it in the same way - wrapped up in bed with some great music.</p><p>I would LOVE to try it again though would want to try it orally for a longer duration and hopefully more spiritual/mentally challenging trip - I reckon 250mg oral what be just the ticket for a much more useful duration, which will be the dose I go for when I get the chance.</p><p>No nausea, no paranoia, no comedown just lovely afterglow, strong body high but in a super nice way, great visuals - easily a strong 8/10 - seems that the king of legal (for now in the UK at least) trypts has arrived.  I have since tried DALT one of the only other legal tryptamines but the 4-Acetoxy version is far better.</p>"
