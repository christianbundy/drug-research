 "report": "<p>I was recently admitted to the ER after having planned tripping one last time on DXM and then mid trip committing suicide. To cut the story short I did ingest the DXM, I obviously never made it to the suicide part. I had not used any substances for over two months prior to this experience.</p><p>I had been tripping for roughly four hours (7 hours after ingestion) upon being admitted to the ER where I was urine tested. My UA came back positive for both PCP and Opiates. I thought I would pass this information on to let everyone know that it is possible to test false positive for PCP and/or Opiates shortly after ingesting DXM.</p>"
