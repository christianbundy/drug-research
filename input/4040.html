I started using LSD in 1991.  My friends and I took lots of trips.  After a year, we were doing it like every four days.  It seemed to us the amount of time it took for our resistance to die down.  It was always a joke that too much was never enough.  We would buy whole sheets and go through it in a month or so (three people).  I had many, many good trips.  It seems it is all a state of mind when tripping.  We were very experienced and could control it.  We knew what to do when someone started to loose it; and we would bring them back to earth.<br><br>
Then one day, I decided fuck it this was it.  I was gonna go hardcore.  I dropped 12 hits at once.  We took amino acids and drank orange juice to pump us up.  I hadn't dropped in about 3 months so I, essentially, had no resistance in my system anymore. It was usual, everything was going good.  And then BAM, I could feel it wave after wave getting stronger.  I lost it.  The worst mistake was to get scared.  I was frightened bad.  I was screaming for them to take me to the hospital.  I couldn't take it.  It was extremely intense and I was there but no one was in control.  I never left my body (though I wish I could have).  <br><br>
We got our other friend who was fine to help me.  They took me somewhere else.  I lost consciousness somewhere in there.  At least mentally (though my friends would disagree).  For ten hours I was climbing around, shaking, babbling, screaming, and informing them I was dead or dying.  I finally came to my senses though not down after that.  I think out of pure exhaustion.  I can't describe what it is like to peak for ten hours nor would I try to.<br><br>
It took me another 36 hours to come down enough to pass as a normal functioning human being.  I pretty much just passed out and woke up a little bit better.  It sucks to wake all messed up.  Whenever we were tired of tripping we needed to sleep.  This was the cure.  We would wake up and wed be all right again.  Well not this time.  My friends made me stick it out, but because I couldn't drive my ass to the hospital nor to the end of the driveway.<br><br>
It took a week before I felt good again.  After that day I took a half a dose (imagine what an idiot).  It got almost as intense as that day.  It lasted like 8 to 10 hours like normal though.  <br><br>
It now has been over 5 years, and I don't think I will ever get better.  I can't even go to a movie theater anymore because when I get up and leave I flip out from sitting in the dark staring at the screen.  I can't quit smoking because I get stressed out and start flipping.  I don't know how long I can take this crap.  It sucks, sucks, sucks.<br><br>
I have taken college psych twice and they say I should seek out a psychatrist and get meds to control it.  I don't have serious flashbacks I just get panicked and start flipping.  Imagine just flipping out after five years for no apparent reason.  It scares the shit out of me.<br><br>
I know someday I will end up in the hospital emergency room screaming for thorazine or valium.  They won't take me serious and I will have to hurt someone.<br><br>
I also tell myself it will be better to die then go through that again because I have been to hell and I am not going back.  The real heaven or hell has to be better than that.<br><br>
I am a father now and how am I going to explain to my son that I screwed myself up beyond repair.<!-- End Body -->
