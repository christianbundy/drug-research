Background:<br>
I am 16 the only drugs Ive tried other then this is cannabis frequently for the last while and alcohol once, t3's orally for awhile (ran out) and I tried taking nutmeg orally. Got about 2 spoon full down then the next one I spit up to no effect.<br><br>
Earlier this day:<br>
I haven't eaten since about 6 1/2 hours ago so I have empty stomach, I smoked cannabis bout 7 1/2 hours ago (should be back at baseline). Thats the last of my cannabis. I am really bored and I don't like being sober and read both good and bad reports smoking it so if I don't have to taste it decided Id try it.<br><br>
Bowl Size: <br>
width and length = 1 inch<br>
depth = 1 cm<br><br>
Timeline:<br><br>
t+0:00<br>
I smoked my first bowl, nutmeg is really flammable. When I lit it it stayed lit the whole time, I had to put it out with bottom of lighter. I took quite a few hits, couldn't keep up with the burning but got quite a bit. Also I agree with the statement of it being heavy smoke, I didn't find it harsh on the throat like cannabis the first time but more harsh directly on the lungs. Burns my nostrils when exhaling through nose.<br><br>
t+0:01<br>
It really stinks just like nutmeg so I wet my pipe. Gonna let it dry but needed stink out. Had a drink of water.<br><br>
t+0:02<br>
No effects noticed except slight light headedness. Gonna smoke another bowl.<br><br>
t+0:03<br>
Smoked second bowl doesn't get any easier on the throat really, didn't burn as easily, because I washed it but it did burn but no less harsh but a bit of chunks of nutmeg washed into my mouth while inhaling (ew!)<br><br>
t+0:05<br>
Mild marijuana like high, spacey mainly. I ate a banana, hungry but not from nutmeg just from not eating for awhile.<br><br>
t+0:15<br>
No more effects, want better so I did another half of bowl.<br><br>
t+0:40<br>
No more effects again the same, did another full bowl, decided thats the last if it doesn't work with 3.5 bowls it's not worth it.<br><br>
t+1:20<br>
Went for a walk to avoid parents, felt a little nauseas but thats gone.<br><br>
t+1:50<br>
I feel like Im back at baseline.<br><br>
Good Parts:<br>
mild high<br><br>
Bad parts:<br>
harsh smoke<br>
nauseas (not too bad)<br>
heavy smell<br>
bit of bad taste<br>
short high<br>
need to smoke too much for effects<!-- End Body -->
