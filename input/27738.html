Recently I've experimenting with various recipes and preparations of kava to see which one is the most effective. I'm an extremely experienced drug user and I know when a substance has a real effect on my mind and body versus a placebo effect. I've been using Twinlabs Alvita brand kava tea bags, so the potency is defintely not the same as fresh root, but today I tried a slight variation of Murple's kava brew recipe and finally experienced some 'above threshold' effects.<br><br>
In the short time between school and work today I decided I needed to chill out a bit, so I went home and broke out the kava. I tore open eight teabags and emptied their contents into a medium saucepan along with 1 cup water and 1/2 cup 2% milk. Then I heated the mixture on the stove for 6 minutes, stirring constantly. (note: heat on low or medium, do not let the mixture boil.) I then took it off the stove and poured it through a fine strainer into a large mug, squeezing the excess liquid out of the root muck. I added honey until it was tolerable to drink and gulped it down on my way to work, a gas station about 15 minutes away from my house.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> <br><br>
About ten minutes into the car ride I noticed that I was driving faster than usual (obviously not a good idea to drive on this stuff) and was feeling generally carefree. I finished my mug and by the time I arrived at work I had a slight 'buzz' going. It's not a buzz in the alcohol or pot sense, but more like maybe .25mg of xanax with less drowsiness. Three of the six hours of my shift flew by, and I felt upbeat, calm, and outgoing without the kava having much of an effect on my memory, alertness, or coordination. By the fourth hour I was back to normal, no noticeable after effects at all.<br><br>
This is definitely a recipe that I will use in the future when I need to chill out without getting messed up. It's perfect for high-stress situations in which I still need to be able to focus.<!-- End Body -->
