 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n4:20 Ingested four darvocets, which have 100 mg of propxyphene and 325 mg of acetaminophen per pill. This is my first time experiencing with Darvocets, so I was going to start with 4 only, but figured what the hell and at\r\n4:30 took my fifth. \r\n5:00 no notable symptoms, really. Chatting on the internet.\r\n5:20 definitely starting to feel it. Warm sensation throughout my entire body, very very pleasant. Flushed face. Light headed. Itchy, but it feels nice to scratch. \r\n5:30 Noticing a bitter, metallic taste in my mouth. Drank some orange juice. The taste is still there. Not too unpleasant. I can't really smell anything...\r\n5:48 tried to eat something, but nausea is kicking in. Drank water.\r\n6:00 I am very content with just sitting on my bed, doing nothing. Life feels good. I keep nodding my head and smiling. It just feels good to be alive. I have no desire for more pills right now. Peaking. \r\n7:00 Still feeling dizzy, warm. I am typically a very anxious person, but on these guys, I don't feel restless at all, or fidgety. My problems seem easy to face, and I can truly relax for the first time in a long time. \r\n8:00 Peaceful, everything is at peace. Not as intense anymore, but still strong effects. \r\nOver all, great experience, looking forward to doing it again\n\n\n"
