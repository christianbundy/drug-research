I was sleeping and having a dream of my 4th Grade class (the one I currently attended). Nothing unusual was happening, the teacher was instructing the kids and we were all gathered around her on the carpet. Somehow I realized it was a dream and became fully lucid. I felt trapped (as I always do when realizing Im lucid) and tried to wake myself up. <br><br>
As my fear intensified, vines and roots began to engulf the classroom in my dream. My wake up attempts failed and I wanted to go to my parents room so they could wake me up. (Note: as for my field of vision, I'm still in my vine engulfed classroom. <br><br>
I will all my strength and energy into moving my physical body in order to go to my parents room. Lifting my arms was incredibly hard and took a lot of effort -- my arms like concrete. I actually managed to get up and walk about 4 feet to the mirror located above my dresser. (note: field of vision is still of viney classroom, though it becomes more vague and eventually becomes epileptic flashes of bright colours and pictures). My vision eventually focuses into a new scene: I'm standing in front of the mirror, but my head is that of an iguanas. I then wake up and I'm standing up in front of the mirror but my angle is off to the left about 40 degrees.<br><br>
I dont know what this is called (if anything), since it dont fit the category of a lucid dream or an out of body experience.<!-- End Body -->
