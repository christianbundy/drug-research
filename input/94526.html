This chemical has great potential, and is a new favorite of mine. Very experienced with psychedelics/ empathogens/ stimulants, and decided I would give this a try.<br><br>
50mg Zoloft is taken daily, but I will touch more on this because I feel the SSRI may have negated some of the euphoric effects. It was still a very beneficial experience.<br><br>
Total time (come up to comedown): roughly 5-6 hours, simply body/ slight mind stimulation for the last couple of hours.<br><br>
0:00 - Stuck my finger into the bag of the 4FA and took about 3 licks (roughly 80mg), first reaction. WOW, what an awful taste! Reminds me of eating an acidic/ sour powder of some sorts, I recommend NOT insufflating this substance.<br><br>
0:25 - Stimulation and slight euphoria start to kick in, wow this is shaping up to be a great evening!<br><br>
0:45 - Full effects have set in, very euphoric (lasting about 2-4 hours). Body feels weightless, endless energy, lights/ colors and music are GREATLY enhanced. Mind is flying with  various thoughts, ended up sitting down and simply writing in a journal for a couple of hours. My ideas seemed to piece themselves together, and create conclusions to different issues I have been encountering.<br><br>
1:30 - Still feeling great, very sociable and talkative. ALOT of energy.<br>
3:00 - Euphoria seems to be weening off a little bit, but definitely still apparent. <br>
4:00 - Very little euphoria if any at all at this point, but still just loving life. <br>
5:00 - Pure body stimulation at this point, the energy that I had hours prior are starting to come to a close.<br>
6:00 - Very tired at this point, still feeling body stimulation. But was able to fall asleep shortly after this point.<br><br>
Overall reaction to this chemical: <br>
Really can't beat it.<br>
It's fairly easy to obtain from various online vendors, and has great effects [for an empathogen lover].<!-- End Body -->
