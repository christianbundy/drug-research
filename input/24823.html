My first, and last, experiment with morning glory took place over a year ago.  Acid was dry, and shrooms were way out of season, plus I was pretty broke.  But I was bored and I had this overwhelming urge to trip.  Morning glory was something I had read about on Erowid but I hadn't considered trying it until that day.  That little voice in my head was telling me it was a bad idea but I told it to shut up.  Looking back, I should have taken my own advice.<br>
I went to the store and bought some packets of Heavenly Blue.  After reading sn FAQ and dosage guide, I proceeded to wash the seeds and eat them.  For a 'normal dose' I considered three to six grams of seeds.  I took five grams, three and a half packets of seeds. <br><br>
The seeds started to kick in after about thirty minutes.  After smoking a couple bowls I was definitely tripping and enjoying it.  I had no idea of the ride I was in for.  Another thirty minutes passed and I was tripping harder than ever before in my life and it was still getting more intense.  I was also by myself.  Being alone was starting to suck because I was getting kind of freaked.  Luckily I have a cool neighbor and I decided it was time to pay him a visit.  He knew I was tripping right away.  I said I was on acid, I thought he'd make fun of me for tripping on a bunch of seeds.  I remember we were talking and I was playing with a slinky, going on and on about how cool it was.  It did help having someone else around but I was still getting more and more fucked up by the minute.  This is when the paranoia set in.  My mind was racing with all sorts of wierd paranoid thoughts.  Chris asked if I was ok.  I said I was, but what I wanted to say was 'what if I'm not ok?'  I didn't want him to know I was freaking out so I smoked a cigarette on the back porch.  The round table I was sitting kept changing shape.<br><br>
I decided to go back home because I could tell I was wierding Chris out.  So there I was, by myself again.  I put some music on hoping it would chill me out.  By this time the effects had started to  peak.  The music sounded wierd.  Every note was bending in a really trippy way.  Even though I was in my own house I felt like I had never been there before because everything looked unfamiliar.  My vision took on a fish-eye lens quality.  Everything looked warped, bent, and otherwise distorted.  The paranoia was the worst.  I started to think I took too much.  Laying on my bed, I was almost unable to move.  It felt like I was melting into the bed and my foot looked like it was melting into the wall.  I really didn't like the way I was tripping.<br><br>
I thought maybe if I ate something it would bring me down some.  Getting up off the bed was a challenge.  My limbs felt so heavy I could barely lift them.  On the way to the kitchen I noticed the Christmas tree.  It melted away into the background.  My mom was in the kitchen.  I tried to act as sober as possible as I stuck a plate of food into the microwave.  It was really difficult to walk straight because the ground was like jello and my legs felt really heavy.  I tried to eat but I realized I wasn't even hungry and everything tasted like cardboard anyways. <br><br>
I laid on my bed for what seemed like an eternity just trying to occupy myself.  I drew some pictures and tried to watch tv but I ended up just staring at the clock.  My concept of time was fucked.  Time was going in super slow motion.  I wondered if the minute on the clock would ever change just waiting and wondering when I would start to come down.<br>
As if I wasn't having a difficult enough time just trying to maintain my sanity I started to feel really sick from the seeds.  I had intense stomach cramps like nothing I've ever felt before.  My poor belly felt like it was about to explode.  I  was in so much pain I was crying.  It felt like I was dying or being poisoned, and that's the absolute truth.  I wouldn't wish that feeling on my worst enemy.  I went in the bathroom and tried to make myself puke.  I threw up a little bit and it hurt.  Puking didn't make my stomach feel much better though.  I just laid in bed for hours waiting for the pain to go away.  I thought I must have taken too much and wondered if I was going to die.<br><br>
I was coming down from the trip but still seeing crazy visuals.  I looked at my pillow and I saw a whole city on it.  I closed my eyes and saw an elaborate image which kept unfolding and growing and changing and I heard the song 'castles in the sand' playing in my head.  By that time I was feeling a little better and I was glad that I wasn't dying after all.<br>
I fell asleep still tripping.<br><br>
Overall, this experience is something I don't ever want to repeat.   The seeds made me experience extreme paranoia and caused me to get sick.  I think from now on I'll just stick to shrooms and acid.<!-- End Body -->
