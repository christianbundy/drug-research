Before I go into last night's event, let me say that my first Salvia experience was a total failure. After 5 big joints and nothing, I resolved at the fact that I was insensitive to Salvinorin. It was an easy decision as I easily develop immunity to most drugs after just a few uses. Cannabis no longer effects me. It never really did. OTC drugs such as antibiotics have to be taken in huge doses, or even mixed with other drugs to work. But after my second and third tries, I began to realize that I wasn't insensitive to Salvinorin, and that I may even be sensitive to it!<br><br>
And when my water bong came in the mail yesterday, I was determined to try again that night. When night finally came, I began to have second thoughts. It was almost midnight when I was bathed and ready. I had work the next morning and I didn't want any strange after-effects to jeopardize my ability to function at work. I know it was an excuse. I couldn't help it, I was cautious. Not scare, mind. I wasn't quite ready. So, instead of giving Lady Salvia another shot, I picked up my tiny bag of Leonotis leonurus flowers (no stems, leaves, or pods, just flower petals). I'd ordered my Salvia stash from a well-known online vendor about a month earlier and a bag of 1g Ll flowers came with it as a free gift. <br><br>
I packed and smoked 2 bowls of Ll flowers, about 0.25g altogether. The smoke wasn't hot (water bong!), but it was harsh. I'd read on here a report saying how Ll flowers are quite mellow compared to leaves. But if this was mellow, I couldn't imagine how harsh leaves would be. Anyway, after 2 bowls, I still didn't feel anything. Perhaps just a mildest of the mild buzzes. That was when I decided that I needed something stronger, that I needed a real buzz. That was when I went into my bedroom and grabbed the bag of Salvia leaves. <br><br>
I gingerly packed a large bowl of Salvia, about 0.5g of dried leaves, lit the top and sucked. One hit, held for around 15 seconds. There...my eyes were getting fuzzy. Flame over bowl and sucked a second time, held for 10..12...13...oh god. My eyes were failing to focus. Another picture was threatening to overcome my vision, something you see at the end of a film -- black screen with white dots. I carefully put down my bong on the couch next to me and closed my eyes, trying to relax. Somewhere in the background, a radio was on. Someone was talking. But in that moment, just before I could even exhale my last hit, my ears caught the sound from that radio and my head was repeating the last 3 syllables over and over. <br><br>
My eyes popped open and I tried to regain control. I wasn't ready! I was sitting on a bamboo couch in front of my bedroom (open windows, ventilated and all, where I can smoke freely), with only a fan to cool me. A jar of herb extraction sat on the hotplate (lowest heat), evaporating its alcohol content. I wasn't in a state to trip/travel. I was full of concern for my surrounding. What if I unconciously tipped over my bong and broke it? What if I overheated my extraction? What if I slid off the uncomfortable bamboo couch and hurt myself? While all these thoughts were going through my head, in what seemed like just seconds, my eyes were seeing a tunnel-like portal. It wasn't intense. I only need another huge hit. One more hit and I would be gone. <br><br>
Just then, I found myself picking up my bong and replacing it on the table where it would be safe. I found myself getting up, swaying like a zombie, and walking over to turn off the hotplate. I found myself stalking toward the light switch and flicking it off. I found myself opening my bedroom door and sprawling on my bed. And I closed my eyes. Now I was ready. I was carefree, even though I was still pretty much sweating like a pig in my air-conditioned room. I kept thinking 'now, now, take me with you'. But I was already coming down from it. I lay there for a minute or two and got up, walked out the room and flicked on the light in my smoking area, and I looked around. I was coming down, alright. <br><br>
I sat down on the bamboo couch and lit a cigarette. I felt I'd rejected her. Lady Salvia, that is. She WAS about to take me somewhere and I'd rejected her. I knew if I'd smoked more hits, there would be no rejecting anything. But as it was, I could've let myself go. Instead, I chose to regain what little control I had left and took care of necessary things. Call me paranoid. I am. I'm always worrying about making sure the lights are off, the appliances are safely tugged away.<br><br>
And the thing is, I wasn't counting on Salvia to do much with one bowl. I just wanted a buzz. Damn, I didn't even finish the bowl. I only took 2 hits of 1x dried leaves. Perhaps it was the Ll flowers that did the trick. I had no idea Ll could strengthen the effect of Salvia. <br><br>
I probably won't try Salvia again until next time I'm on vacation. I'm planning to go to Koh Chang next month. There, I would be safe in the confines of a luxurious hotel room, with no care of the heat, the lights, the appliances. There, I could let myself go.<br><br>
Who knows? I might try again tonight. Lady Salvia can be quite an addictive presence, even to someone who only saw just a glimse of her.<!-- End Body -->
