I had a very vague plan that I was going to be doing some sort of drug this evening, however I was not aware of what it was going to be. I took this substance with two other people at some point late at night. I consider myself to be partially experienced in psychedelic substances. I have done 5MeO-AMT , DPT, and LSD, on a few occasions. <br><br>
However, I was having trouble swallowing this capsule, so I just broke it open and ate the powder, which tasted absolutely terrible. Also, it was the first thing I had eaten in practically 6 hours. I started noticing effects probably about 20 or 30 minutes after ingestion. The first effect I noticed was the regular weird body feeling associated with psychedelics. Except it was different this time. Usually I think that the body feeling is very euphoric and nice feeling but with this drug it was very, very violent. <br><br>
I could not stop shaking no matter how hard I tried. Eventually I could not handle the room I was in because the other two people were laughing and blasting techno music. This was all too much on the senses, so I went into the bathroom with a portable CD player and some Pink Floyd. At this point, probably about 40 minutes after ingestion I felt extremely terrible nausea. This lasted for something like 10 minutes and then I was back to the ridiculously uncomfortable body feeling. <br><br>
After about an hour the visuals started coming. They were not too overwhelming. The typical patterning and shifting of things was occurring as well as some mellow closed-eye patterns, however, these visuals could be almost turned off if I wanted, which really wasn't that great because I enjoy the visual aspect of drugs a lot. For the next two hours I sat in the bathroom, in complete isolation, listening to music and watching things. One of the most disappointing things was the lack of creative thinking. I really enjoy the abstract through processes of things like DPT or LSD, but I did not get this on this drug. <br><br>
Eventually, I came out of the bathroom and began to interact with people. Apparently the other two individuals I was with were feeling extremely goofy and happy, which did not mix well with my mindset. After about 5 hours all signs of the drug were gone and I was left feeling hungry and tired and very lazy. <br><br>
Overall, it was not a terrible drug. People say it is relaxing, but I disagree. I think that the intense body feeling is quite terrible. However, I would probably do it again, but at a lower dose, maybe to reduce the body tremors more. This is also the only time I have ever been all to myself with under the influence of a psychedelic. I think that this substance cannot be compared with any other ones that I have done. It is in a category all by itself. Not particularly bad, and not amazingly great either.<!-- End Body -->
