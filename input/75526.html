I was an honor student all throughout high school, and even made Dean's several times in college.  I would someday love to try ibogaine, mushrooms, or lsd less for euphoria and more for personal transcendence.  I have always been a fan of pills; I think they're amazing.  After reading Daniel Pinchbeck's Book, '2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl' my ideas about consciousness have changed from a quantum physics view to a view that it trying to tie all these things together.  It's possible to take a tablet and feel completely different emotions and sensations than the dull tedium of daily life?  I'm in.  Please note, this is something I partake in rarely, I have a great life and I do not ever drive under the influence of any substances.<br><br>
T=0  <br>
Early in the day, at about 9:30, I had a half pint of clear Bacardi (just under 8 shots) with organic juice.  This was before I had taken any pills.  I am prescribed Wellbutrin, but I did NOT take my dose this morning due to interactions with alcohol causing seizures and blackouts.  I also had a 'Function' brand soft drink called 'Vacation,' their coconut/island flavor containing 5-htp, L-theanine, Magnesium, and Zinc. I also took a multivitamin.<br><br>
T+2:00<br>
I chose to take 1mg of Clonazepam to heighten the experience.<br><br>
T+2:30 <br>
I'm feeling pretty silly but a bit too mellow.  I decide to take 3mg of Ativan (Lorazepam) and 1200mg of Provigil (Modafinil) because I had read on some forums that this may cause euphoria at such a high dosage.<br><br>
T+2:50: <br>
Definitely a little light headed as I walk to the bathroom, but no dizziness or discomfort.  It's a floaty, cloudy, confident feeling. <br><br>
T+3:00: <br>
My head is fuzzy, but so far no unpleasant affects whatsoever.  I'm totally comfortable just hanging out on the couch and watching some daytime TV.  This is most likely a reflection of the benzos and alcohol, although I can feel the Bacardi had less of an influence than before: fine by me, I like the pills.<br><br>
T+4:30<br>
I'm currently focusing very hard on this report, tweaking details in case some of our readers may be seeing this and in need of more explanation.  I'm currently spell and grammar checking, almost obsessively.  That isn't how I wanted this to go.  I blame the Provigil (Modafinil) that causes inspiration to work.  Modafinil (Provigil) seems to motivate me more at this level than at the 200mg dose.  My Blood Alcohol Reading is 0.10. I decide to take a shower.<br><br>
T+5:00<br>
Out of the shower and styling my hair, putting on makeup. I'm feeling a little more pleasantness with a no real clumsiness, but a small lack of coordination felt.  This combo is not some thing I would try while at the family reunion.<br><br>
T+5:30<br>
I feel quite mellow, calm, and content.  My brain seems to have developed a short-term memory difficulty in such that I've been wandering around in my room looking for a set of jewelry I had wanted to wear... and then forgot, so I walked out of my room half naked, and now am sitting on my couch.  I live alone, no worries.  I checked my blood alcohol level and it's down to .07, since that BAL reading is considered sober enough to drive a NASA spacecraft (teehee) I'm pretty sure most of the rest of the report, I expect, will be due mostly to Ativan (Lorazepam), Klonopin (Clonazepam), and Provigil (Modafinil).<br><br>
At this point I had decided to visit a local jewelers store and walk around the park.  It was cold but I was feeling good.  When I got back home, boyfriend had found this trip report saved on my computer, so there was a little fight, but I still probably feel more optimistic about the mild argument, I was honest with him and he eventually wasn't mad anymore<br><br>
T+ 5.50 <br>
Still calm after the fight, but feeling pretty down because of the argument, through no fault of the substances. We ended up going to the grocery store, where I was sick.  After coming home, Ill I wanted to do was to lie down. Im still feeling a bit slow and floppy from the benzos, and have not experienced and euphoria due to the large Modafinil dose.<br><br>
At this point, I believe the recreational effects have ended.<!-- End Body -->
