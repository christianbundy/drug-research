 "report": "\n\n\n\nI noticed an unexpected interaction between the wellbutrin I was taking and MDMA.\r\nI had been taking 150mg wellbutrin 2x/day and when I took 120mg mdma, the effects took an extra 1/2 hour to kick in.  \r\nI tried it a few times and the results were the same, everyone else got off before i did!   The intensity and type of effects from the MDMA were the same as they were when I wasn't on wellbutrin, not any stronger or weaker.\n\n\n"
