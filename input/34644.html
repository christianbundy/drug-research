This was an experiment.<br><br>
At approximately 9:00 p.m., I prepared the liquids.<br>
Two tablespoons each of commercial kava kava extract,<br>
homemade marijuana tincture, and absinthe. This mixture<br>
was put in the freezer to chill.  At approximately 9:30,<br>
I removed it from the freezer and added as much cold<br>
sparkling water as the total mixture.  It turned an opaque,<br>
swirling greenish color - the fabled louche of absinthe.<br>
I downed it in one gulp. The aftertaste was not as <br>
unpleasant as expected - the bitterness of absinthe with<br>
sweet anise overtones.<br><br>
I was at home, relaxed, with no pressing concerns.  By<br>
10:00 p.m., I was the only one still up.  My lips were<br>
beginning to feel numb, the sign that the kava was taking<br>
effect.  I was feeling slightly numb in my extremities.<br>
By 10:15 p.m., I was feeling quite good - even more relaxed,<br>
optimistic and peaceful.  I set up my Dreamachine (a homemade<br>
device that produces light flickers in the low alpha range).<br>
I then smoked a small bowl of high-grade marijuana.  As<br>
it began to take effect,  I sat down at the Dreamachine.<br><br>
The visual effects came on quite rapidly.  The initial<br>
entoptic imagery gave way to a ceaseless kaleidoscopic<br>
array of color, shape and light, reminiscent of some<br>
accounts I've read of mescaline's effects.  I began to<br>
see clear images within the swirling vortex, forming,<br>
rising up to full prominence, then being sucked down and<br>
replaced with new ones.  My spirit soared as I began to<br>
see _through_ the vortex, into a calm and glowing level<br>
marked by a stable geometrical pattern. It appeared to be<br>
hexagonal, in glowing green and yellow - although colors <br>
such that I've never seen with mortal eyes.<br><br>
After some ten or twelve minutes of this rapt contemplation<br>
of the fiery fractal mandala that lies on the other side of<br>
darkness, I got up, went to the couch and laid down.  Immediately<br>
upon closing my eyes, I began to see closed eye visuals (CEVs).<br>
These morphed and transformed as inexorably as the ones<br>
before.  After settling in and becoming quite comfortable,<br>
I took up a whipped cream dispenser, exhaled, and took in<br>
a moderate lungful of nitrous oxide.<br><br>
As I exhaled, I could tell the sensation of air passing<br>
through my trachea had already changed. Inhale, exhale. . . <br>
and my body began to experience Pure Pleasure.  I felt myself<br>
ascending the World Tree and emerging into the brilliance<br>
of the Living World.  Every joy and pleasure of mortal life<br>
was a mere shadow or gossamer simulacrum of this experience.<br>
Even as I soared above the canopy into the clear blue beyond,<br>
I knew that gravity was pulling me back.  A long long descent<br>
back to my body, where simply being stoned out of my gourd<br>
felt like being stone cold sober by contrast.<br><br>
I put everything away, brushed my teeth, took two ibuprofen,<br>
drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Got up seven hours <br>
later feeling fine.<br><br>
Do NOT attempt this if you are going to be in public.<br><br>
I intend to repeat this experiment, but not soon and not<br>
very often.  It was an extreme experience.<!-- End Body -->
