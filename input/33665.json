 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis has happened on two different occasions.\r\nThe smoking was first, heard rumors that it would fuck me up and hit me fast and wasnt like shrooming.\r\nWell, I hit it, tasted horrible, smelt horrible and I considered it a waste of the cap immediately.\r\nI got really giggle and a fast head change, even though my mouth tasted like burnt ass and fungus. Everything became quite woozy, and I was slightly dumb, like when I eat shrooms, but less oblivious to everything. A constant 'dur' moment.\r\nSnorting was different.\r\nI ground it up in a coffee grinder (which I also have ground up weed in). Me and my friend - who is 6'1 and weighs a lot more than me - did a 2 inch line each, he just said it hurt and didnt do much but make him laugh a little.\r\nFor me, (Ive never snorted anything else either), I got really giggle and happy FAST. I was like a little kid, yet still aware of everything. Just happy. Sound was more exquisite and I saw SLIGHT visuals (cottage cheese ceiling flowing and wall textures slowly moving).\r\nIt was pretty cool for such a small amount.\n\n\n"
