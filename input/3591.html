This report is about a drug used in treating pain, tramadol hydrochloride, or Ultram. now this is not a controlled drug, and doctors like to give it out, cause it is considered to be safe and the potenial for abuse is low. and they're right when you take it according to their directions, however i have found it to be alot like other opiates iv'e taken. i started taking 150 mg [three 50 mg pills] and found the effects to be that of hydrocodone [vicodin] and oxycodone [percodan, percocet] plus as a speedy effect, so its like the sense of well being, mellow effects of an opiate, and just a little speedy, enough to where you like it! and it doesnt have the side effects of tylenol which can destroy your liver over long periods of time, beware!!.<br><br>
i dont think to many people know about this drug, its fairly new, and is quite expensive at the pharmacy [about 1$ per pill] my feeling is that it will soon become controlled by the goverment. does anyone else indulge in this drug, if so please post, as well as any side effects you may have encountered. i have had problems going to sleep with this drug but some xanax or ativan helps alot, also DO NOT exceed 400 mg in a 24 hr. period of time,so the pdr says.                         later.....<!-- End Body -->
