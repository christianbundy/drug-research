I ordered a magic mushroom grow kit from a Dutch company earlier this Fall. The kit promised 20 - 25 dried grams of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. Two hardy flushes made good on this promise. God bless the Dutch. <br><br>
Days later I set off to my friends college with a jar chock full of crispy dry magic. <br><br>
Two friends and I sat down to five dried grams and peanut butter each at 6:30 pm. <br><br>
My mushrooms come on strong. Within twenty minutes I decide that Stalin, Lenin and I are unstuck in time. The three of us are very giggly. I remember going into fits of laughter and writhing on Stalins bed. There is intense euphoria and I assume strange, contorted postures that are somehow comfortable. I remember lying on the bed with my limbs splayed out like a broken G-I Joe. Our pupils dilate within half an hour. <br><br>
At this point the giggling subsides. We watch Simpsons after Simpsons and zone out to pleasant music. Everything seems warped and bloated. Stalin's ceiling bulges and swims like a thing alive. At this point I start to lose touch with reality. I see dripping blood everywhere at about 7 pm and I love it. At this point visuals are very intense. Both comrades are seeing streamers and the like. Stalin and I decide to go smoke a cigarette. Lenin remains in bed in a pleasant delirium. As we walk down the flights of stairs the dorm room becomes a sort of Aztec temple complete with crazy friezes, wall motifs, and a sense of mystery. I have a cigarette in hand but absolutely no idea what to do with the damn thing. To me every little human action is absurd. I have no idea what this piece of fabric they call a coat is. I have no idea how this piece of fabric is draped on my left shoulder and around my left arm. I have no idea where to go from here. Is this how a normal person wears a coat? How do I get this damn thing on? It all seems so absurd. So it went that night.<br><br>
We watch Simpsons after Simpsons until 7:30 pm. I say that we should go to a party over and over again. Finally I am convinced that this is a terrible idea.  <br><br>
Why go outside this room, this room is our spaceship.<br><br>
Staying put is a great idea. At about 8 pm I am lie on the bed and experience death after death after death. My mushrooms are strong.  I am in bizarre dream world of shades and shadows. Quite intense, but I somehow keep my cool. This is terrifying but the feeling doesn't last. <br><br>
At about 9 pm I feel great and get back to watching Simpsons after Simpsons. Existentialist that I am I constantly point out how absurd and meaningless human existence really is. I surf the web and show my comrades pictures of Yao-Ming the absurd Chinese basketball star. I rant and rave for hours about the hopeless condition of man and the bizarre relationship he has with his vast network of machines. Stalins computer does a lot of crazy stuff and really makes my points. At 12 we calm down. Even I stop spouting off ridiculous philosophies and tirades against the machines. We are still tripping.<br><br>
At 12:30 we all come down but watch Simpsons upon Simpsons late into the night. It's hard to sleep on mushroom after-effects. What a night We retire at 4:30 in the morning. What a time.<br><br>
Tripping allows me to blast my illusions to infinity and see life for the absurdity it is. Mere hours later I can get back to life and change this imperfect creation.<!-- End Body -->
