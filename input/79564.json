 "report": "</p>\nIt has been my experience, that after you use your favorite extraction method, if you freeze the liquid in ice trays you can then make frozen drinks. My wife and I like to make pina coladas. This makes it easy to drink with no nausea. You may experience one small problem; brain freeze.</p>"
