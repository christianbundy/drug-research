I have tried Dramamine 3 times everytime I have done it I had good experiences. The first time I took 14 pills @ 50 mgs each and second time I took 18 pills @ 50 mgs each, both time I experienced a slight head change and heard weird noises like things were a lot louder than normal, but I had no visuals. The third time I was with my cousin and my boyfriend and we each decided to take 20 pills @ 50 mgs each, the first 2 times it took around 2 or 3 hours to kick in. The third time it took 30 mins to kick in. I have the times as I slightly recall them.<br><br>
7:00pm - Took 20 pills with a glass of milk. I can't stand the taste so I use milk.<br><br>
7:20pm - Went outside to smoke a bowl, still no feeling from the pills.<br><br>
7:30pm - Just finished smoking and started noticing a big change in the way things looked and sounded, like things would appear and disappear. I would be talking to my boyfriend and then he would vanish, then reappear. This continued for the rest of the night.<br><br>
7:41pm - We decided to build a fire and pitch a tent so we wouldn't have to face my parents. I walked to my basement (alone) to get the tent. My boyfriend and cousin went to get a few pieces of fire wood to start the fire. I walked to the corner of my basement to get the tent and totally forgot why I was there.<br><br>
7:45pm - My boyfriend came down the stairs to find me standing in the corner starring at the floor, facing the wall. He came up to me and asked what I was doing. I said 'Pick that net up' so he did he moved the net from the corner and layed it on the pool table. I continued to stare at the floor. I bent over and stared at the floor, by this time I was really close to the floor with my face maybe like 24 inches, I started touching the floor and I said 'look it's a rat' but there was nothing on the floor at all. It took me about 5 mins to be convinced to go upstairs. I was still believing that there was a rat on the floor. Not a normal rat but a hairless rat.<br><br>
7:48pm - I went to the bathroom because I had to pee BAD. After I was done I stood up and started to laugh and I yelled for my cousin. My bathroom is all white and the shower curtain is clear, to me the entire room was orange and that's all I could see was orange. My cousin said he could see all orange too.<br><br>
7:50pm - We all seemed to have a good amount of energy and were all in really good moods. We all went back outside to pitch the tent. This was a really hard thing to do, because by then speaking was difficult to do, and really difficult to understand what the others were saying. It was all mumbling by that time. As me and my boyfriend attempted to pitch the tent I asked my cousin to get some fire wood, which was about 100 yards away but there was a 5 foot 6 strand high tension wire fence that separated us from the wood. He climbed thru the fence and turned around and climbed back thru, so I asked him again if he could go get some wood, and he climbed thru the fence and turned around and climbed back thru and stood there. He continued to do this about 20 times. Then finally I asked 1 more time if he would please go get some wood and he climbed thru the fence and walked to my house opened the door walked in and turned around and walked back to the fence climbed back thru and went and sat down. Needless to say we never got any fire wood.<br><br>
8:15pm - We finally had the tent up and now time to build a fire, by this time I was totally out of it, I couldn't see straight, couldn't focus, couldn't talk very well, and eyes and body felt really heavy. This is also the last time I recall seeing my boyfriend until around 11:00pm. He went to get some newspaper to light the fire with. And to my knowledge me never came back. He says he was sitting beside me the rest of the night. I felt alone I didn't even realize that there was a fire, I just knew my legs kept getting really hot. My cousin was sitting about 2 foot away from me in a chair and I was sitting in a tan suede mushroom chair.<br><br>
I was just starring off into my yard and kinda focusing on my rabbits cage, body and eyes still heavy, my eyes opened really wide as I looked at a minature black leopard climbing around the cage. Obviously this wasn't really there but I continued to see it for a long time and I would look away and look back and it would still be there then it vanish like most of the stuff did that night.<br><br>
After the leopard vanished I tried to focus on a strand of the fence and my 70 lbs dog walked under the fence (the dog is a chubby large boxer) but after he came under the fence he wasn't a dog anymore he changed into a Fuzzle. A Fuzzle is something from Oddworld:Munchies Oddessy, it's a little fuzzy thing with huge eyes that Munchie has to rescue. As my dog walked up to me my eyes opened wide and I said softly 'It's a Fuzzle' All I could see was a huge fuzz ball with huge eyes. He remained there the rest of the night, he wasn't scary looking so I didn't mind him being with me.<br><br>
A few minutes after that I turned around to look behind me and for the first time that night I noticed that I wasn't alone and that my cousin was sitting there and it scared me, because I could hear talking but I could see no one. My cousin was touching the back of my chair saying 'Do you see the flowers, they are spinning.' I couldn't see any flowers at first but then it was like wow, purple flowers spinning all over my chair.<br><br>
After the flowers vanish I turned the other direction and about jumped out of my chair because my boyfriend was sitting beside me soaked. I guess he was getting tired and decided to jump in my pool to wake himself up. I didn't think he was there all night and I guess he was there with me the whole time, that freaked out bad. I went to bed shortly after that. They stayed up for a little while longer.<br><br>
I had no problems falling asleep, but I was extremely cold for some reason and I noticed that is the only thing that bothers me about Dramamine. I don't have any problems with twitching or itching as I have read in several others experiences. I do have really dry mouth while doing it but it never really bothers me because I live most of my life with cottonmouth. I love Dramamine and I will probably continue to use it weekly. I just went and got myself 100 more pills, and I plan to have another fun weekend. I have had all great experience and think its a fun drug for people that know how to use it and will not drive or do anything stupid. Just get some friends and have a fun time.<!-- End Body -->
