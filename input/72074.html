I took my first line at 13.00, took about 250-300mg in a fat line (started out with a big line, then used 150-200mg as adjustments for best effect). I find that snorting this substance is the best way ;)<br><br>
13.05 I start to notice something, not sure what yet.<br><br>
13.08 IT HIT ME! heartbeat rising, vision is blurry, colors are brighter and beautiful to watch. It feels like I have no gravity!<br><br>
13.12 My whole boy is light, feels like I'm sprinting superfast and jumping higher and longer than usual. I pick up a small rock, then I pick up a pretty big rock, to me it feels as the 2 rocks aren't to different in weight. feels like I have endless energy!<br><br>
I went on to climb some steep hills, I ran around in the forest as well. I also watched some TV, drove around a little, and just spoke a lot with my friends. but seriously, try listening to some of your favorite music while on this substance, LOUD! At least Trance/Techno and that kind of music with a 'takeoff' in it if you know what I mean ;)<br><br>
The thing is that this substance runs out pretty fast, from it starts kicking till it starts decreasing is only about 20-30 min depending on how much I take. But I still enjoy myself for another 30 min before returning pretty much to normal.<br><br>
I started my first line at 13.00 and I kept taking new lines all day. My last line was between 07-08.00 the next morning I think, I went to sleep at about 11.00 after smoking quite a bit of hash, having snorted about 4-4,5grams of the substance alone.<br><br>
All I felt when I woke up at 18.00 was that I was exhausted. We took a couple of lines each that night as well, it was kicking much longer this day, and didn't need quite as much either ;)<br><br>
I feel how this substance can be addictive, so I would recomend not using 'Mephedrone' too often.<br><br>
My friends were with me from the first to the last line by the way, It's nice to do in groups ;) I'm 18 years old by the way, and this spices things up a little in a party! ;)<br><br>
It was all in all a VERY good stimulant, the downside is that it lasts so short.<!-- End Body -->
