Just a few nights ago I was rather restless and I wanted to take another shot at my bag of calea thats been hangin around for some time. I filled a standard coffee filter with the dry foilage and flowers and steeped in luke-warm water for about a half hour. I hadn't eaten anything in a few hours so I figured that I had a relatively empty stomach, so I chugged down the cup of calea tea as per my usual method (the more I drank this tea the more I could tolerate its flavor if I powered it down fast enough.)<br><br>
I didn't pay particular attention to time; calea makes me space out and focus on my thoughts and thought trains and I started to become aware of my heartbeat. At first it was a little bit interesting but though my mind wandered it kept returning to my heartbeat and with each successive return I became more and more aware of my heartbeat. It got to a point where it was all I could focus on and it became rather annoying. More and more I focused and I started to freak out all I wanted to do was space out like I normally do after drinking calea but my heart kept taking the spotlight and just as it became distressing the effects began to wane and I became less and less aware of my heart and I drifted off to relatively undisturbed sleep. I awoke the next morning feeling burnt but very much alive.<br><br>
A few nights later I witnessed my own reflection in the darkness under its influence and a friend suggested that I had achieved astral projection. Overall tho that particular night was stressful I don't normally experience problems with calea.<!-- End Body -->
