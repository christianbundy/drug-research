So I never knew anything about DMT until my friends started talking about a really strong visual hallucinogen that transports a person to a different planet for about 5 minutes.  Hearing that, I was at first nervous.  Then, after some thought, I decided I would give it a try. I enjoy my hallucinogens and love transcending reality, so I convinced myself it would be a great, eye opening experience.  As youll read, boy was I right!<br><br>
The first night we were at a party when the pipe was passed to me with the remnants of some DMT and some cannabis.  I took a couple pulls and realized that everything around me got very vivid.  There was some graffiti on the wall and I felt like it was the most beautiful, significant thing I ever saw in my life.  It all made sense.  I looked down and noticed that the crack in the floor was moving into a figure of some sort.  It created a large indent in the ground and spread across the ground slightly before snapping back to normal.  Everything around me was slow.  <br><br>
I told my friend of how great I thought the visuals were.  He told me that I had only very little and that one day he would really make sure I blast off (if done properly he said, I could blast off to a different planet).<br><br>
Sure enough, about a week later some more came around so I obtained it.  I took a small amount of cannabis and packed it into a pipe.  On top of the pipe I put about 200 mg of DMT and then covered the DMT with more cannabis.  I felt that by layering it, I would prolong it.<br><br>
I sat down alone and fired it up.  I instantly tasted something that resembled mothballs.  It wasnt a good taste at all, but it didnt make me sick or uncomfortable.  My friend smelled it so he came in the room and told me to hold it in as long as I could.  As I blew out, I felt rocked into a crazy place.  My friend kept coaxing me to keep hitting it.  I got through the second hit, held it in again, and blew out.  As this point I knew my world was going upside down.  He said, Come on, hit it, hit it, hit it. so I absolutely torched the rest of the product.  Well, what Im about to tell you is what blasting off means to me<br><br>
I am staring straight ahead and there is nothing to be seen.  The world is black.  My cellphone begins ringing inside my brain.  I start wondering where my phone is and I realize I am not there on the couch.  I feel as if I were a small orb where my brain was located.  There was no phone ringing.  I suddenly feel like Im 125 degrees so I feel the impulse to get up and run into the shower on full cold.  I realize this is not a possibility.  I stare straight ahead and begin to see.  <br><br>
Im convinced that I fully died, and with that, I watch my arms fully disintegrate, skin, bones and all, and vanish.  I look down at the carpet full of square patterns.  The carpet under my feet turns into the helicopter view of a rural farm neighborhood, complete with plots of cultivated land fit so neatly on the 8 by 10 carpet.  I am so amazed by it, but suddenly I start noticing my hands are alive.  I spend the next few minutes admiring my beautiful alive hands and arms.  <br><br>
Another friend comes through the door and I notice that he peaks in to see how Im doing.  I never looked at him and Im glad I didnt, because in my peripherals, his entire head and face turned into a dozen wispy black hands that were weaving in and out of each other, trying to grab my attention.  I lean back into the couch and begin standing up, telling my friends that I had the craziest experience of my entire life.  I look down at a wooden sculpture of a couple hugging and the man turns into one of my friends.  I begin laughing like crazy.  From then on, everything started to come back.  But one things for sure- it changed my perception in a great way.  <br><br>
To die and to be reborn is an experience, to say the least.  And thats blasting off.<!-- End Body -->
