 "report": "<p>\nI had been taking 300 of bupropion for depression already for several months.  Sometimes to get a boost before morning class I would pop 25-50 mg of ephedrine.  One such morning I had no ephedrine so I decided to try the bupropion up the snoot to see if it had a different kick.  I crushed one 150 mg tablet and cut it into four large lines.  When I snorted it back it burned painfully, like pure amphetamine.  This coupled with the size of the lines needed made this activity for strictly diehards.</p><p>After about 20 minutes of nasty drip my brain perked up notably.  Colors became more vivid, I felt enthusiastic and a bit giggly.</p><p>At 45 minutes I was pepped up good, not the edgy nerves of ephedrine but the more subtle stimulation of a small dose of good coke.  The long half-life of bupropion gave the feeling legs.  Over the next 4 hours my high peaked gently and faded away before being lost in the common fizzle of my mind.</p><p>While the activity itself is rather unpleasant the boost was quite enjoyable.  Soon I was bringing a flap of crushed bupropion with me when I was partying.  Great for when the cops stopped me.  With a prescription for the stuff they can't detain me and they don't seem to like that.</p>"
