This experience landed me in a Charter Palms Center and resulted in severe depression for about a year--during which I had to take Prozac to keep from killing myself.  Before the trip, I never had to worry about depression.  Five years later, I still take occasional herbal antidepressants (St. John's Wort).<br><br>
I went on a camping trip with a friend who brought a bag of shrooms from some picking that we did.  I had done shrooms several times before and enjoyed it.  We pitched a tent in an idyllic setting--waterfall, lake, trees, rocks--just a beautiful place where college kids go to camp and hang out.  I felt a little out of sorts though, prior to the 'shrooms.<br><br>
After taking five of the most purpled (small) heads from the bag, I felt nothing for an hour or so.  Then, as it got dark, I began to enjoy the experience--the stars and moon through the trees were angelic, dripping light, singing nature, dreamy colors.  We ate and talked by the fire, which I could not quit staring at--it was primordial and godlike.  <br><br>
As things darkened in my mind (and in the woods), My friend--a hellova nice guy--began to take on evil dimensions to me.  I backed away from him as the fear crept in.  Things began to get bad and I told him so--he just kept saying that I was tripping and to think mellow thoughts.  In another hour I was in the tent, gripping the covers, trying to keep from falling up into the night sky, rolling in terror.  When my friend finally came into the tent, I told him not to let me leave the tent or I would smash my head on a rock until I bled to death.  I meant it.  He tied a string from his toe to the tent zipper opening so that he would wake if I left.  I suffered hard until daybreak.  Fear.<br><br>
By morning, the world looked completely different--as it does to anyone who suffers clinical depression--a brain drained of serotonin--the inability to feel pleasant in any sense of the word from any stimulus.  <br><br>
I suffered this for weeks--never came out of it.  Tried several antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs prescribed by quack family doctors who dont know shit about the mind.  Lost my job because of my panic attacks and depression.  Lay in bed for months.<br><br>
Finally checked into a clinic and went through a real psychiatrist who prescribed prozac for a year.  I remember being able to do nothing but cry in his waiting room in front of other people who just stared.  I am not in any way emotional, but the chemical imbalance that existed after the trip turned me into a simpering mass of liquid emotion, fear, and blackness.  There are no words to describe the place I was in.<br><br>
If anyone experiences this all too frequent and long-lasting result of a bad trip, go to a real psychiatrist and get on Prozac--or the latest equivalent.  Take long walks.  The houses, cars and trees will seem evil to you--ignore them.  Trust people who want to help you.  Stay off of caffeine and alcohol while on the antidepressants.  Eat healthy.  Forget self-treating with beer, etc., it will just make it worse.  And for God's sake don't do anything stupid--you will recover in time.  I did.  I have been back from Hell for years now, and in a way i'm glad it happened because it was a death and rebirth experience for me.  Would never wish it on my worst enemy though.  <br><br>
Now, pot and beer aren't a problem, but never again with the LSD-type shit.<!-- End Body -->
