(1:15 a.m.)<br><br>
5ml gbl taken orally in lemonaide. I just got back from moving my car far down the ice covered hill after the cops called to tell me to move it or get it towed. Nice of them to call actually, but what a wickedly cold walk. After finally walking back through the door, I sat down at my computer as I was wide awake at this point. I had a sort of warm glowing feeling in my temples left over from sleeping and dreaming. I wanted to get back to sleep soon so I mixed up some gbl in juice and sat myself down to read some alt.drugs.psychedelics until i felt sleep calling. I also lit up my pipe which had the remnants of an earlier bowl of cannabis topped off with a wad of wormwood extract. The high of cannabis + the wormwood extract is nice and lucid, it does not fog my mind over with lethargy. I have a feeling I will not be heading back off to bed.<br><br>
(2:40 a.m.)<br><br>
met up with a friend online and he was taking dxm, so after the gbl had kicked in and i was feeling all sorts of manic and optimistic, i decided to insufflate the last 50 mg of DPT i had in my possession. It was a somewhat old sample, being aproximately 2 years old. The burn was still present however as it found its way into a rolled up american express traveller's check and into my nose. The back of my throat was also instantly inflamed into a sort of allergy irritation feeling at the back of my throat. I can feel the first alert within moments, my head feels as if it has blown up to 5x its normal size, and it is floating, bobbing back and forth in the ether.<br><br><br>
(2:50 a.m.)<br><br>
floating green geomtrical orbs of energy manifest before my eyes as i stare off into the swallowing darkness of the livingroom windows. It is very dark and stormy outside. I can hear ice pellets pelting against the windows. My mood has improved...i went from being mildly annoyed at being awake, to buzzed from the gbl, to feeling rather energetic and talkative. This is a rather nice surprise...to find myself awake and tripping with a friend after nodding off to sleep hours ago in a state of half conscious malaise. Earlier in the day our communal t.v. moved out with its owner from our apartment so we tried playing Monopoly and drinking and smoking weed, but eventually without t.v.'s glowing reassurance that we were safe, I drifted off to bed, sorta depressed at nodding off so early, wasting the evening basically.<br><br>
(3:01 a.m.)<br><br>
50 mg DiPT taken orally in a gelcap. I decided a while ago to take the DiPT with my last dose of DPT, so here goes! Let's see where this goes. I have a slight bit of jaw tightness at this point, but nothing really worth noting. I am wondering what tpye of auditory effects might manifest as a result of the syngery between DPT and DiPT. We'll see, or hear I mean...<br><br>
As of yet, I am unable to notice any significant synergy between the gbl and the DPT, although i do feel my mind sway in and out of focus, falling away into daydream like visions rather easy as the music grows more intense on my stereo. Some nausea at this point as well. My head feels especially light and as if it is drifitng away...i repeat the word 'driftwood' over and over softly to myself as jazz blairs in the background. <br><br>
(3:17 a.m.)<br><br>
a bowl of cannabis smoked and boy am i rollin'! I close my eyes and see my body extending past its boundaries. I see my fingers stretching out and connecting with infinity, like tree limbs shooting out of my wrist, each finger splintering into a lattice work of intense clarity and interconnectivity that stretches past the horizen of my thoughts, and back into the subconscious fader. I open my eyes to see what appears to be a long neon cord of geomtric light. It twisted about the room, moving in and out of the wall as if in the throws of some etheric peristalsis. I stared at it for a short while, wondering if it what i was seeing was some form of conscious energy, as it seemed to almost be dancing for my attention. I am thinking of the often described 'Cosmic Serpent' as I gape into the darkness.<br><br>
(3:43 a.m.)<br><br><br>
music sounds fantastic through headphones. I listen to www.wfmu.org, the best free form listener supported radio in New Jersey and anywhere on the internet! A mix of mind-expansive electronica and ambient sounds fill my ears, sounding deeper and more rich than usual. I can feel my attention shift away from other senses like sight and instead manifest in my sense of hearing. I can actually feel my awareness resting within my ear canals, much like how you feel your eyes to be your main area of consciousness in normal waking life. My ears actually had an orgasm like relaxation as the sound pleasured my senses. I could feel a slight ticklish reaction with the bass and drums registering intricate polyrhythms in my headphones. My whole body and breath relaxed with aural delight.<br><br><br>
(4:22 a.m.)<br><br>
smoke a 4:20 bowl...i start to notice an uncomfortable feeling in the head...a sort of static filled balloon-head feeling. My thoughts are somewhat hard to manage, it's probably best I am not in a social setting. There is a pressure in my chest/heart chakra area, as well as my lower throat. I take this as a sign that the DiPT is taking effect, as this is a new aspect to teh DPT feeling earlier. I take 2.5 ml gbl in juice to help relax. The bodyload feeling is somewhat unpleasant in somewhat the same manner that saliva d. is to me...the static/pins and needle type feeling, as well as the pressure on the chest and the vertigo. I put on Belle and Sebastion mp3s to have some nice light music to help relax. <br><br><br>
(4:45 a.m.)<br><br>
a distinct sense of pleasure has enveloped my body, an energetic change for the better. The gbl has made me feel sluggish and drunk, although I think it is also the reason for the warm and mdma like chest rush i have. <br>
Overall this combination hasn't blown me away outside of a few moments of weirdness early on, otherwise it has been a case of just being high. No real insights into anything. Could be that i started out from sleeping...<br><br>
Perhaps i was too tired to begin with. It has been an interesting experience to this point, but it has mostly seemed to be a mapping of what the effects would be of the combination, with no real experience entailing. So, at this point I decided to give up and sacrifice myself back to the gods of sleep, despite the fact that i was still tripping. The experience just wasn't grabbing me enough to justify being awake. <br><br>
So much for that one, but I've been woken up to worse times I guess.<!-- End Body -->
