Someone named Jamie wrote an <a href="http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=932">experience report</a> on a near death experience with Cannabis...I too had a similar occurence.<br><br>
I smoked 2 hits out of a bong and started coughing...everything suddenly slowed down. I stared at my arm and the skin was peeling off slowly. I got up and everything was all weird the sky was flashing grey and black and everything was black and white. I started to walk and my friend asked me if I was ok.. 'Yeah.' I lied.. Slowly the whole world became ink blotted until it covered up my whole field of vision. I started to panic. Was I dying? Was I dead? Why couldn't I see? Was I going to be blind forever?  Millions of questions ran through my head. I was screaming.<br><br>
'I'M FUCKING BLIND!!' <br><br>
my friend did what I can only imagine as waving his hand in front of my face 'How many fingers are do you see?'<br><br>
I just saw infinite blackness. 'I can't even see your fucking hand'<br><br>
Then all of a sudden my voice faded away and became distant and robotic.. 'I don't even exist anymore..' I said outloud and I curled up into a ball..<br><br>
Then *bang* back into reality with mild buzzing in my ears... To this day I never found out what the fuck happened but I will forever remember what it was like to be totally blind.<!-- End Body -->
