 "report": "<p>A bit of my background before I get started on this report - I am an everyday cannabis smoker; I have used LSD more than 80 times in the past 5 years; I have also used psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA, speed/meth, DXM, 2ce, cocaine and others that my mind cannot seem to call to memory right now (I'm still recovering from my 25I trip).</p><p>We were having a small party at a friend's place and we'd decided to buy 25I as it was a cheaper alternative to LSD that night. I was filled with a similar excitement I get to when I'm taking LSD, though in reality I shouldn't have had the same expectations I have for LSD for a drug I knew relatively little about. I took a 2mg dose while 3 of my friends had a 1mg dose. 2 of these friends had had only 1 tab of LSD in their lives (and smoked a whole lot of cannabis) whereas the other friend had never had psychedelics, ever.</p><p>T+0:00 - I put two 1mg blotters of 25I under my top lip and let them sit on my gum for about 45 minutes, making sure I don't swallow. My whole mouth and face go numb. Barely 10 minutes after I take my tabs, three of my friends take theirs as well (although they were on a lower dosage).</p><p>T+0:45 - The tabs are soggy so I chew them into little balls and swallow them. I'm already feeling light-headed, like I'm walking on squishy, bouncy ground wherever I go.</p><p>T+0:55 - I'm starting to get some subtle visual distortions and a creeping feeling of nausea coming over me. At this point I decide  to combat the nausea by smoking a bowl of cannabis, which only helped slightly. I can't put my finger on the feelings this chemical is giving me right now...what is this? I don't know...no one knows. I'm not sure if I regret taking this, because from here on in I literally have no idea what this dose is going to do to me at all. </p><p>T+1:00 - I've crossed my threshold and purged - HARD. As I was throwing up, I started to trip more heavily than I've ever tripped in my entire life - even after 1800ug of LSD. The room was changing, parts of it were melting and coming to life and dying and swirling around me in vast arrays of colours.</p><p>T+1:15 - I finish purging, clean up and lie down on the bed, making myself completely comfortable in a cocoon of blankets. The roof I stare up at is rippling with tidal waves. I wish I could take the warm feeling of being cocooned in blankets and pillows and get up and move around the party and talk to people and get high. </p><p>T+1:30 - I get a huge rush and lying down suddenly becomes laughably uncomfortable. I shed the blankets and move out to the fire, where I can talk to my other friends on 25I about this strange, new drug. They're having mixed experiences but the vibe of the party is helping the trip. At this point I look up and see the stars above me, and there are these brilliant flashes, kind of like fireworks behind the stars, but made of more stars. I stand there, with this new perspective of the observable universe in front of me, and I can't help but scream with childish delight. </p><p>T+2:00 - I have never had visual and auditory hallucinations like this EVER before. This is something entirely new to me, because there's no 'body load' at all, save for a feeling of being significantly lighter than before; but my mind is in a crazy new universe of its own. I'm like an entirely new and different psychedelic being to the one I was before, standing on its own legs for the first time in the strangest place imaginable. </p><p>T+2:15 - At this point, someone steps into the shed where I was tripping and mentioned it had only been 2 hours since I'd taken the tabs. Wait, what? WHAT? I felt like it must have been at least 5 or 6 hours, that surely this was almost over and the party was going to wind down with my trip. I'm in the phase of the high where I can enjoy my surroundings. I'm extremely happy because my best friend is on his way to the party, and I can talk to him about this crazy new trip I was on. </p><p>T+2:30 - Someone puts on the album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The room explodes in colour again, and I'm put into this deep rock 'n' roll meditation about what this music means, what feelings it communicates and what the music made me see. I have no lack of energy, no feelings of being drained like the others are having so I dance around, and feel my body becoming fluid like water. </p><p>T+3:00 - Nothing is wrong here. Everything is right. In the absence of a god or gods in this world, I have become a god for a night. I seem to be fiending off the energies of this party - every good and bad vibe I approach with an even more open mind than before, and I can feel all these different energies rushing off me. </p><p>T+4:00 - I'm now very clear-headed, but definitely still hallucinating. Surprisingly enough, the last thing on my mind is smoking cannabis but I decide to join a mighty ensemble of people on the floor of the shed, having a sesh. The cannabis keeps my body calm while my mind still races from the 25I. I'm beginning to like this, even though I know that tripping this way is flirting with physical and mental danger, and I can only flirt with it. I decide to ride the high of the night out, because I'll probably never take this drug again.</p><p>T+5:00 - The party is winding down and people are starting to head off. The three other trippers and I enter this amazingly comfortable phase of sitting in the warmth of the shed and its blankets and discussing the events of the night and the effects of this drug. </p><p>T+5:30 - My hallucinations have stopped, but my body is still high. We're all comfortable, lying on couches and the bed and smoking more bowls (as you do at the end of a long trip). We come to this really indescribable place of unity among us, and I really felt like we were related by a bond stronger than blood just because we'd ingested the same drugs that night. We start to share stories of our lives and the crazy things we have done, the places we have been and the highs we've ridden. </p><p>T+7:00 - The others are still tripping, and I'm just lying here unable to rest but still feeling a sense of pleasure coursing through my body. I feel so content with what's just taken place, even though I had to walk through the fire and flames of pure crazy before I got to the point where I started enjoying this. I can't seem to fathom that a ridiculously meek amount of human currency ($20) had been spent on the most incredibly vivid and intense drug I've ever taken. </p><p>T+9:00 - I feel comfortable enough to drive home, which is only 3 streets away or so. On the way I take my friends past the service station so that we can eat and replenish our stamina after many hours of crazy. What strikes me as I'm sitting in my car is that this drug has a complete absence of spirituality, unlike LSD and shrooms. </p><p>T+9:30 - I've made it home and I'm in bed. Although it's 4:30am I still can't sleep, so I go through my meditations to put my mind at ease for the night and in a better state to sleep. </p><p>So, it's now the next day and I'm not feeling any after-effects of the comedown on my body at all. I feel a little stoned, but other than that nothing. There's no afterglow, like there is with LSD. 25I-NBOMe was worth it just for the one-time-only experience of it, but in the future when I want to trip I think I will be sticking with beautiful old LSD.</p>"
