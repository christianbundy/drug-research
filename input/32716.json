 "report": "<p>I am male, 85kg and have no opiate dependence whatsoever.</p><p>7.15PM - Took 150mg of generic brand tramadol orally. </p><p>7.25PM - Ate a sandwich before feeling any effects. </p><p>7.30PM - 1st mild effects felt (Have to concentrate hard to notice.  Thought it could have been placebo, but, in hindsight, it was certainly the start of the 'come-up').</p><p>8.30PM - Now experiencing a very mild (but quite pleasant) opiate style stone. Some nausea (very mild again... just a feeling of slight queasiness). Appears to take some time to take affect fully.</p><p>9.00PM - Effect has deepened a little (pupils very slightly contracted and that 'squeezy' feeling behind the eyes that accompanies it). Queasy sensation persists. </p><p>10.30PM - Effects are still intensifying. Not 'noddy' at all, but pleasantly mellowed with a slight 'stimulant' style effect in the background... Definitely worth trying in its own right (very curious to see how it reacts with Kratom.) </p><p>11.30PM - Seems to have reached a plateau. Definite 'speedy' sort of feeling along with a mild euphoria. Slightly itchy around the face, queasiness has totally gone, now. </p><p>3.15AM - It's difficult to sleep on this... Effects are starting to wear off (down to about 60% of the peak) </p><p>8.00AM - Still feeling some effect - about 40% of the peak... (hard to put a figure on it). Could not sleep for the life of me.</p>"
