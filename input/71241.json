 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy experience with trazodone is very positive.\r\nIt helps with my alcohol addiction in that I can consume much less alcohol per day. Before the trazodone, I would need to consume at least 3 liters of, say Chardonnay, at 13% potency, per day to fall asleep. With 150mg trazodone, I need less than 1.5 liters\r\nto fall asleep. I know that is still a lot of wine, but it helps me not to need so much wine.\n\n\n"
