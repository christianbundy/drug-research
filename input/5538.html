After football practice in junior high, my friends and I (all active stoners) would go to a grocery store to steal bottles of rubber cement.  It was a free high, that would always send us into a very intense psychedelic trip.  In fact, if taken correctly the effects can be stronger than acid, a lot stronger.<br><br>
We would pour half to all of a bottle into a plastic bag, then make a small opening at the top to breathe out of (power hits).  Within the first four breaths everything would begin to echo.  After that a warm sensation would flow through my body, beginning in my upper body then progressing to my feet.  The first time that happened to me I thought I shit my pants (we dubbed it the 'warm ass feeling').  The longer we would breathe the stronger the effects would get.  Things would become paternized, background noises would become a fluctuating, monotonous hum, and my body would feel like rubber.  Strange rectangular patterns would enter my mind.  Things always looked square.  Everything was fucking funny.<br><br>
If we kept huffing, we would eventually pass out.  This would send us into a strange world.  Witnesses said that our bodies would still be standing and moving, but we would be nowhere near earth mentally.  I remember many trips in the cold, fall evenings when I truly believed I was standing on a dock at my lake being chased by bullies.<br><br>
If I huff it right, it is a totally crazy and psychedelic experience.  But I am careful, as it is also very dangerous.  And I always use the Ross brand rubber cement.  It doesn't make me feel all shitty and sick.<!-- End Body -->
