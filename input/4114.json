 "report": "<p>\nI had a feeling it was fake when I first saw the red rocks. Wrong color, wrong smell, wrong texture.  I knew I would be the right one to test it, because my friends were all convinced of it's authenticity.  </p><p>I currently take @ 100 mg of morphine (Ms Contin) daily. It had been almost 24 hours since my last dose. I was out of pills, and I was starting to hurt all over. I told my friend to give me some to test because if it was real I would quit hurting. Make sense? You might have to be a junkie to understand.</p><p>Anyway, I smoked 1/2 a gram, and my pain never subsided. Test complete.  There is no opium or opiate derivatives in these red rocks. Sorry to all who got got.</p>"
