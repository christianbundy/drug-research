I ordered 25g of this stuff from a web site after hearing about its mind altering effects. I put the root in my coffee grinder and got a fine powder. I boiled this powder with water for about 30 minutes and got a kind of tea. I drank the tea (Tasted nasty) and ate the root that was left at the bottom (I had to force it down and use a chaser) and sat around waiting for the effects to kick in. <br><br>
After about 30 minutes i felt kinda wierd, sort of disconected. This lasted for about another 2 hours until I threw up. As unpleasent as it was swallowing the root, it was 100 times worse on the way up! I continued to puke every 15 minutes or so for the next 4 hours or more! In between vomiting i would drink water and assume the fetal position on the floor of the bathroom shivering with fever like sympoms. I finaly passed out in the early morning. I am currently on Paxil, Webutrin, and Buspar for depression and anxiety. I know that I'm not supposed to take these medications with a MAOI. I read somewhere about the effects of some people who took a Ayahuasca concotion who were on certain anti-depressant medications. Maybe this adverse reaction people are experiencing is a result of a MAOI present in the Calamus root. I wonder if anyone knows.<!-- End Body -->
