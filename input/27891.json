 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter many experiences over the years with both 'street narcotics' and pharmaceuticals I found myself regularly taking between 150mg and 300mg of Codeine extracted from Tylenol 3 tablets. Maybe once or twice a week I would enjoy this. On the specific night in question I ingested the 250mg of Ephedrine and half an hour later as effects were starting to be noticable I decided to also take the 300mg of Codeine. \r\nAt about 1 hour after taking the Ephedrine and half hour after ingesting the Codeine I was feeling very warm and complacent. Fifteen minutes later I was sweating profusely and unable to ignore myself heating up. I had two glasses of water which seemed to help. I proceeded to watch a movie with my partner while I enjoyed the trip. At times I was manic, not able to sit still and constantly chattering as though 'speeding' on amphetamines. At other points I would lapse into a dazed sort of state.\r\nAt the two hour mark I was shakey and could not walk without somewhat drunken appearance. Body tingling and quite euphoric I lay down to enjoy the trip. My speech was clear but I found myself mumbling, unable to speak above a whisper as though my chest was very heavy. It's at this point that the Codeine really took hold and I felt as though floating in a warm bath. I felt very peaceful if not somewhat detached. \r\nThe experience lasted about 6 hours from start to finish with it just fading off quite nicely. I found my breathing very labored for the peak of the trip and at points had to conciously force myself to breathe deeply to avoid panting. \r\nI have not read any data about this combination of drugs so I would say that caution is the best route. The difficulty I found with my respiration would probably prevent me from attempting this combination again although seperately I adore both compounds and have had no ill effects.\r\nPlay safe.\n\n\n"
