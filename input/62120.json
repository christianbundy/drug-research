 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis is my experience of Zopiclone (Imovane). When it was first prescribed to me, I was ordered to take 1 pill of Imovane to induce sleep.\r\n9:00: I take the pill. No sudden changes.\r\n9:10: A mild, bitter taste arises in my mouth.\r\n9:30: The bitter taste is potent but no physical or mental changes.\r\nI guess it is because of my weight that I did not feel any sleepiness or weakness.\r\nThe next night I took 2 pills of Imovane.\r\n9:00: take pill.\r\n9:10: same bitter taste in mouth and light headedness.\r\n9:30: potent bitter taste and weightlessness.\r\n9:45: I felt as if I weight 20lbs, I felt like I was floating through my house. I couldnt even feel the floor with my feet. I felt euphoria in a mild degree. The experience was like being drunk, but better.\r\n9:50: I start feeling tired but all experiences peak. The euphoria is there. I felt as if I was flying at this time.\r\n10:00: I crash. My body feels weak and I just collapse onto my bed.\r\nThe next day I can still taste the bitter in my mouth. It goes away just before lunch. My experience with Imovane was a nice, safe, carefree experience.\n\n\n"
