 "report": "<p>This is my experience of Zopiclone (Imovane). When it was first prescribed to me, I was ordered to take 1 pill of Imovane to induce sleep.</p><p>9:00: I take the pill. No sudden changes.</p><p>9:10: A mild, bitter taste arises in my mouth.</p><p>9:30: The bitter taste is potent but no physical or mental changes.</p><p>I guess it is because of my weight that I did not feel any sleepiness or weakness.</p><p>The next night I took 2 pills of Imovane.</p><p>9:00: take pill.</p><p>9:10: same bitter taste in mouth and light headedness.</p><p>9:30: potent bitter taste and weightlessness.</p><p>9:45: I felt as if I weight 20lbs, I felt like I was floating through my house. I couldnt even feel the floor with my feet. I felt euphoria in a mild degree. The experience was like being drunk, but better.</p><p>9:50: I start feeling tired but all experiences peak. The euphoria is there. I felt as if I was flying at this time.</p><p>10:00: I crash. My body feels weak and I just collapse onto my bed.</p><p>The next day I can still taste the bitter in my mouth. It goes away just before lunch. My experience with Imovane was a nice, safe, carefree experience.</p>"
