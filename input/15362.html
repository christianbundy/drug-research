I am a 24 year old male who considers myself well versed in LSD and <br>
P. cubensis shrooms.  However nothing I have ever experienced prepared me for the salvia intoxication.  <br><br>
It started at my best buds house with myself and girlfriend my bud and his girlfriend. My friend obtained some 5x off the net after trying the leaves with no satisfaction. I first must say I underestimated this substance very much. For some reason in my mind I was about to smoke some yubba gold or wizard smoke like in the high times mag.<br><br>
 After smoking the before mentioned dose in one healthy toke I held it in for as long as I could. I guess the results were instantanious. There was a harsh feeling of nonexistence all the while there was some unseen beings almost gingerly discussing where to place me. There was a lot of darkness with 2 dimensional realities readily acessible. I felt a definite sense of metamorphisis although it was more complicated than just turning into something. I barely recall hallucinations with vivid colors and highly complex geometrical patterns. <br><br>
All of this happened in about 5 minutes.<br><br>
 When I came around I remember going through one of the 2d realities I seen earlier. I saw my girlfriend and grabbed her telling her to pull me through. I started to sweat heavily. I was still unable to see completely and felt unsure of where I was. I had mellow eye candy for about 20 minutes and then all physical effects were gone.  I felt very smothered as if underwater and scared during this time.<br><br>
 At first I was totally, 100%, never ever ever going to try this again. however my resolve is fading rapidly.<!-- End Body -->
