I would NEVER advise to use this drug recreationally. Here's my expierence:<br><br>
6:30AM-I Wake up<br>
6:45AM-I Take 6 Wellbutrin XL (Bopropion,150mg)(900mg)<br>
7:00AM-I felt confident and ready for the day<br>
8:00AM-I feel a little light headed, everything seemed okay<br>
9:00AM-I Stand up to go to my next class and nearly fall due to a headrush<br>
9:30AM-I feel shakey, mainly my hands and feet<br>
9:45AM-I was talking to a classmate<br>
*9:46AM-From this time until about 10:30 I remember nothing.<br><br>
What I heard happened during my 45 Minute black out was that I had layed my head down, and rested for about 3 Minutes, at this point I started shaking violently (I bit holes in my tongue), the shaking was a Myoclonic seizure, while seizuring I also started vomiting blood, this may have been from my wounded tongue, but regardless I vomitted several times. ((I DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING, TOTAL BLACKOUT))<br>
10:25-11AM-I remember getting the I.V put in me<br>
10:30AM-I become conscious being rushed around a hospital<br>
10:30-11:30AM-I take several blood tests and, urine test<br>
*(While I was given the urine test I could not pee, full bladder, but I simply couldn't get it out)<br>
*11:30AM-12PM-It is mandatory to hold seizure patients for a 12 hour watch, during this time I was on an IV for several hours.<br><br>
I just got home about a hour ago, and I felt it was appropriate to inform as many people as I can. It is absolutely the worst expierience of my life, if you're going to do drugs don't do anything thinking it's totally safe. I wouldn't even suggest trying this drug, it doesn't seem to have any positive effects.<!-- End Body -->
