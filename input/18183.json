 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHaving been diagnosed with ADD, and unable to use Ritalin properly without becoming hopelessly addicted, I decided to try alternative methods of medicating myself.<br>I went to my local health food store, asking for DMAE, and after being questioned as to whether I was a cop (the stuff is illegal to sell in Canada), the guy reached under the counter and pulled out a bottle.<br>I got home and took a single pill as directed.<br>Basically, the effects i felt were:<br>- an unpleasant physical stimulation, like drinking way too much coffee<br>- slight nausea, chills, and sweating (I presume these are cholinergic side effects, as DMAE is supposed to raise levels of acetylcholine within the brain)<br>- a general feeling of 'sketchiness' similar to the comedown from MDMA or one of the amphetamines.<br>It's been three hours since I took the stuff, and the symptoms aren't getting any better.<br>Thousands of web sites sell this stuff, touting it as a 'smart drug'. I call it a complete waste of money, and will not be repeating this experience.\n\n\n"
