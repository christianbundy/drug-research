I obtained 4 blotters of suspected 25i-nBOME, the dealer claimed it was LSD but as soon as I put it on my tongue I knew it was an rc because of its powerful chemical taste. Me and 3 other mates all tried one tab and waited, it took a lot longer then expected, about 2 hours, which is another reason why I know its an rc. <br><br>
I started to feel really euphoric with a nice body high and slight shifting in vision. We were all laughing uncontrollably at nothing. About 4 or so hours past and we decided to have a sesh, we had 2 cones each and went inside, my vision was starting to explode with subtle rainbows everywhere and I was getting colorful CEV fractals. Observing the people around had a weird perspective.<br><br>
We all sat around listening to music and enjoying the body high for hours, it lasted about 12 hours and kept us up all night.<br><br>
It was a pretty interesting experience, I really enjoyed it. I was disappointed in this dealer for selling it as LSD because some people drop 4 or 5 tabs in one dose and with an rc like 25i-nBOME you have to be careful you don't take too much.<br><br><br>
