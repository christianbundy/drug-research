Well, I'd like to start off by saying that over the last six years I have tried many drugs from weed to crank. I have also acquired a keen taste for pills, especially pain killers. But I would have to say that out of the many prescription and non-prescription drugs that I've done, Ultram is by far the worst. As a matter of fact I wouldn't recommend Tramadol to anyone, unless they're actually prescribed to you.<br><br>
The very first time I tried Ultram I started off with an unusually large amount of 500 mg. I, being naturally tolerant to opiates, thought that this was a reasonable amount to start with. Well, about a half an hour after ingestion I started to feel that oh-so-pleasant warm feeling that opiates present. But this pill was a little different. I didn't get the itchy feeling that codeine or vicodin gives you. I was very pleased with my new discovery of Ultram. <br><br>
Well since the person I was staying with at the time worked at a doctor's office, a stable supply of Ultram wasnt hard to acquire. So I began a habit that I wish I would never had started.<br><br>
After the first few times of using the little white demons. I started noticing weird side effects, like not being able to piss. Actually pissing became more of an effort then a naturally occuring part of everyday life. Then one day I had to shit really bad, so I went to the bathroom like I normally would, except this time was different. I couldnt shit if my life depended on it. As nasty as this sounds, it took me half an hour to shit just a little. And it hurt worse then anything I've ever done in my life.<br><br>
Then I remembered that I just took a large does of ultram. So I concluded that the pills were the cause of my ungodly constipation. With this in mind I decided not to take any the next few days to see if I was right. But two days later the bathroom calls again, and it had been a good 48 hours+ since my last dose of Ultram and still the wicked constipation stays with me. I decided not to take any form of Tramadol again.  Besides the horrible constipation and difficulty urinating, I also suffered from and still, do suffer from sharp pains in my sides, stomache aches, and headaches.<!-- End Body -->
