 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter recent discussions that red rock opium was a farce, I decided to go hunt some down and see for myself if I could what the dealio was. So, after shelling out 45 bux for the 'red rock,' I started breaking it up on top of bowls already packed with MJ. Prior to certain news group discussions, I truely believed this stuff to be the real deal. But PLACEBO has been in effect big time. <br>It is almost enlightening to see the outline of what you felt dissapear...I could see that I was merely letting myself enter an 'opiate mind state'. None the less fascinating, but a placebo for sure. I could feel the MJ buzz melting into a mellowness. But only becuase I was triggering a relaxed state of mind by thinking that what I just inhaled was opium and not incense. Whoah is all I have to say. Whoah.\n\n\n"
