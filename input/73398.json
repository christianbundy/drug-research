 "report": "\n\n\n\nI just wanted to say that I have taken many drug tests in the past while on DXM without a hitch.  When I say 'on DXM', I mean that I had dosed about an hour and a half to two hours before the test.\r\nI have one of the tests and it said that the following were tested for:\r\nCocaine\r\nMarijuana\r\nOpiates/Morphine\r\nAmphetamines\r\nMethamphetamine\r\nPhencyclidine\r\nBenzodiazepine\r\nBarbituate\r\nOxycodone\r\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine\r\nIt was a urine test done in a lab.\r\nTolerance MAY be an issue.  I had been taking DXM fairly regularly for approximately four years.  DXM is great.  It drains my soul, but it's fun at the time!\n\n\n"
