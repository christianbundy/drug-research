 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIm an experienced researcher who has a particular persuasion for stimulants. My stimulant experience is as follows: amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, dexmethylpheniate, methylenedioxypryrovalerone (MDPV), MDMA, bk-MDMA, bk-MBDB,among others.\r\nSet/Setting: 4-FA is acquired from trusted source in hopes of finding a new study aid. 150mg measured out on +/-.001mg scale. Allergy test produced no undesirable results.\r\n..and without further adieu:\r\n+00:00 150mg dissolved in distilled water and ingested on empty stomach. \r\n+00:35 Delightful nervousness and warmth building in chest. Im light on my feet. \r\n+0:45 Getting chatty at this point.\r\n+1:00-4:00 Im impressedundeniable entactogenic qualities with smooth stimulation keeps me on my toes. Work is accomplished with gusto and fervor; mixing music with a friend is particularly enjoyable.  \r\n+4:15-7:45 Entactogenic qualities have subsided although there is lasting stimulation for the remainder of the experience. Physical discomfort was nearly non-existent. \r\nConclusion: The subtle empathogenic qualities in conjunction with the clean stimulation really tie together this long-lasting stimulant. Recommended only if your in it for the long haul.\n\n\n"
