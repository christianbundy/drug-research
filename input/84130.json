 "report": "<p>Im an experienced researcher who has a particular persuasion for stimulants. My stimulant experience is as follows: amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, dexmethylpheniate, methylenedioxypryrovalerone (MDPV), MDMA, bk-MDMA, bk-MBDB,among others.</p><p>Set/Setting: 4-FA is acquired from trusted source in hopes of finding a new study aid. 150mg measured out on +/-.001mg scale. Allergy test produced no undesirable results.</p><p>..and without further adieu:</p><p>+00:00 150mg dissolved in distilled water and ingested on empty stomach. </p><p>+00:35 Delightful nervousness and warmth building in chest. Im light on my feet. </p><p>+0:45 Getting chatty at this point.</p><p>+1:00-4:00 Im impressedundeniable entactogenic qualities with smooth stimulation keeps me on my toes. Work is accomplished with gusto and fervor; mixing music with a friend is particularly enjoyable.  </p><p>+4:15-7:45 Entactogenic qualities have subsided although there is lasting stimulation for the remainder of the experience. Physical discomfort was nearly non-existent. </p><p>Conclusion: The subtle empathogenic qualities in conjunction with the clean stimulation really tie together this long-lasting stimulant. Recommended only if your in it for the long haul.</p>"
