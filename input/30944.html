The first time I smoked pot was before my senior year in high school. I had been interested in it for a long time, as I had many friends who smoked copious amounts. I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Admittedly, the setting for my first time was somewhat less than ideal.<br><br>
I had spent the night at a friends house. We didnt sleep, but instead stayed up and watched movies, getting no sleep at all. In the morning, we walked over to another friends house. While we were there, he brought out his stash to show us his pipe. I suggested that we fire it up, forgetting that his parents were downstairs. Even so, he agreed, and we stuffed the bowl. After we smoked a bowl and a half between two of us, I still wasn't feeling any effects. I knew that for many people, the first time does not get you high. All of a sudden, I realized how interesting the light streaming through the venitian blinds, and then through the smoke and dust was. I watched it swirl and dance, and waved my hands through it to create patterns. This in and of itself was not particularily odd for me, as I have always enjoyed the simple pleasures in life. But after a minute, I realized that this was way more intense, and way more interesting than it should be. I immediately starting giggling at the revelation, and could not stop. I was sitting on my friends bed, and I fell off it onto the floor with laughter. For the rest of the time, I lay there, talking and laughing. <br><br>
Eventually, my mom had to come and get me. I didn't have a job at the time, hence no money, hence no car, hence if my parents needed the car, I couldn't drive. When she came, I was still freaked out a bit, even though it was several hours after when we had gotten high, and I had slept some in the mean time. However, I now attribute this to lack of sleep, instead of the effects of the marijuana. It was a while (4 months) before I would get the opportunity to smoke again, but it was much better the second time.<!-- End Body -->
