After something like 30 years in the dance music &amp; drugs scene &amp; about 5 years learning about Research Chemicals, I have recently had the most remarkable opportunity to try out a very unusual &amp; seldom seen compound related to LSD.<br><br>
The compound in question is Al-Lad, or 6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide. This psychedelic drug appears amongst those reported by Alexander Shulgin at the beginning of his famous book TIHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) but is extremely rare due to it's instability &amp; because it is expensive &amp; truly very tricky to synthesise. Although I have no way of telling for certain, I am extremely well experienced with psychedelic drugs &amp; I personally have little doubt that I have actually now tried Al-Lad.<br><br>
We found ourselves in excellent mood after dodging a heavy but unfair parking fine so, one weekend recently, after having received some blotters in the mail, I decided with my partner in crime Sister Moon, to celebrate by assaying the new blotters. We spent the day in my bright, sunny flat with my cat. A small amount of strong marijuana was smoked once the effects had established. I am asthmatic, but apart from my Symbicort, no other drugs or medicines were present.<br><br>
I am a very cautious drug user. I'm the sort who scrapes a little off of every pill &amp; allergy tests it, before taking something sold to me as ecstasy. As such, I cut the first blotter carefully into 4 equally sized pieces &amp; wedged one quarter into the space between my gum &amp; upper lip. I then shut up for a half hour, not easy for me I might add.<br><br>
After half an hour I chewed up the paper. I discerned no taste whatsoever, even after chewing. This made me confident that the blotter is not likely to contain an NBOMe compound. At the hour point nothing had happened so I gave the same, quarter tab dose to Sister Moon &amp; placed two quarters in my mouth, in the same place. Within half an hour I began to believe first alerts were appearing. I seemed to become more aware of peripheral movements of shadows in my room, which was well lit on a gorgeous English spring day. 2 hours had now passed since the first quarter tab so at this point I added another half a blotter to my repertoire &amp; the same for Sister Moon. No more substance was absorbed from this point, &amp; as the blotters are dosed at 150ug, my dose was aproximately 187ug &amp; Sister Moon aprox 112ug.<br><br>
The trip picked up for both of us once these doses began to work. The effects were subtle but typical of psychedelic tryptamines &amp; phenthylamines. In fact, the effect was so similar to DOC that I began to suspect that the blotter might have contained DOC. It did not however, &amp; I'll explain why I know that in a sec. I'm not going to describe all the psychedelic effects because these are well documented &amp; I'm wary about affecting the experiences of others. Instead I'm going to compare the effects with more common psychedelic drugs, such as LSD &amp; Psilocybin, &amp; DOC of course. The usual rippling, breathing &amp; waving of movement in stationary objects was observed, &amp; the giggles were constant. The appearance of colour were highly enhanced. The effects were similar to Psilocybin &amp; LSD, as you'd expect as these are also psychedelic tryptamines. The come-up seemed quite drawn out, the peak was fairly brief &amp; the tail off also seemed to last ages. The total time from initial effect to sleep was about 7 or 8 hours, much less than DOC &amp; less than normal dosage LSD. The effects appeared to be about half the strength of a standard LSD trip. This was quite fortunate as I put Jacobs Ladder on for Sister Moon, who'd never seen it, &amp; if we'd been tripping heavily, it would definitely have freaked her out ALOT more. My mistake!<br><br>
The effects began at about 3pm but we were both able to sleep easily by midnight. There appeared to be no nausea &amp; only the lightest of body-load tension, almost non-existent. The trip was mild so perhaps the side-effects &amp; tension might increase with higher dosage. But I suspect that this is just one of those really gentle compounds that does exactly what it says on the tin &amp; nothing more. A truly remarkable psychedelic which I hope many more Psychonauts will have an opportunity to assay in the future. Sadly, I may never come across this compound again, due as mentioned above to the costs &amp; complications associated with it's synthesis. This is not something that your average Chinese mephedrone chemist can knock up in ten minutes.<br><br>
The next day we increased our dosage &amp; the effects increased but duration was unaffected. No hangover or any untoward effects were experienced at all on either occasssion. Sister Moon enjoyed a much lighter Sci-Fi movie with no disturbing bits!<br><br>
All in all, I found this stuff to be amongst the finest psychedelic drugs I've ever tried, but I am a fan of gentle, mild tripping &amp; I must accept the possibility that folk who prefer a powerful trip may find this compound lacking. I most certainly did not. Not at all! Wonderful stuff, true mind expansion!<!-- End Body -->
