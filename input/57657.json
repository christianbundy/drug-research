 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt was Saturday night me and my friend were really bored. We wanted to find a high. At two in the morning we were looking through websites. We had heard of nutmeg before but had doubted it. We thought we would try it.\r\nWe knew that it was common to ingest nutmeg with a drink but thought it would be cool to experiment with smoking it. We had about 2 grams each for each spliff. It burned well and produce a tastefull aroma. 15 minutes later after a couple of spliffs we began to feel a relaxed state of mild euphoria. Sense were slightly impaired but it was good because there were no side effects exept for a pleasurable drowsyness.\r\nNext day, sunday morning we thought we would try to go for a high. This time we wanted to experiment snorting the ground nutmeg. I had about 2 grams first, I felt very drowsy because the effect of snorting was almost instant. Half hour later we both snorted about 4/5 grams in one go. We felt extremely stoned extremely quickly. The recreational effects were shortlived and I don't recommend snorting unless in lots of small doses. Snorting induced extreme tiredness and gave head achces- took about 4 hours to recover fully.\r\nSmoking nutmeg yet it is a pleasurable experience. The smoke is thick but tastes good.\r\nWe are both around 105 pounds or 7+ Stone.\n\n\n"
