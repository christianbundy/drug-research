 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI smoked the half joint slowly. About the third toke I always start coughing uncontrollably. I find it helps to sip on iced water in between. I love the first draw the fragrance and the taste of the pot.\r\nI laid on the sofa and listened to Vivaldi's four seasons. I couldn't believe how the music was filling my head and running down to my toes. My head was filled with images wrought by the music. I was in a garden filled with flowers of every colour. I was there reaching out to them, in the bright sun, marvelling at the green grass. I wanted to stay in the garden forever. I felt so relaxed, so peaceful. There was nothing else. No everyday worries. I looked at myself out of the garden. I laughed at me, laying there on the sofa.\r\nI walked along looking up at trees moving softly in the breeze. The music was playing on. The trees were trembling to Vivaldi's violin. I saw a large mushroom and sitting on the cap was a plump, laughing, fairy child.\r\nThen I was out of the garden, spinning in a coloured vortex. The music took over and I was in a giant cathedral looking up between vast gothic arches. The stone walls and floor made me shiver, so I pulled a blanket over myself. I keep it right there on the sofa, as I often feel chilled when I'm high. Then I was sailing out the stained glass windows, trailing the red, yellows and blues behind me in a vapour trail. I floated to the moon and dripped tears onto the world beneath.\n\n\n"
