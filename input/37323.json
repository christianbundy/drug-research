 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nToday I acquired a few ultracet pills. I did a little research on the net and decided on an dose of two pills. This yields a total dose of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen. The cannabis I had was a very high grade hydro. I'm unsure of the exact strain, but it is very good. Like you haven't heard that before.\r\nT-1:30 \r\nI ate a full dinner.\r\nT+0:00              \r\nI took both ultracets orally.\r\nT+0:15        \r\nSmoked approx. .5 grams of high grade bud.\r\nT+45 mins        \r\nI think I start to feel something other than the weed. A little bit opiate in nature but definitely something else to it. I feel quite alert.\r\nT+1 hr 15 min    \r\nNot quite sure I've hit the plateau because it keeps getting hard to type. Excellent euphoric body sensations. The torso feels so light.\r\nT+1 hr 40 min    \r\nGood friend called conversation was fluid and warm. Conversations with this particular friend usually go this way but it was better this time.\r\nT+2 hr 25 min    \r\nPast peak still going strong more weed or another ultracet will spike me back up.\r\nWeed definately amplifies the action of this drug. I did not feel any of the nausea that others have reported with this drug. I also feel 'speedy' as others have reported but I have noticed this with opiates antagonist drugs ( oxycoden, hydracoden, codine, etc. ). B+ combo. A little short lived for my taste, but to be expected considering the ingredients.\n\n\n"
