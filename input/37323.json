 "report": "<p>Today I acquired a few ultracet pills. I did a little research on the net and decided on an dose of two pills. This yields a total dose of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen. The cannabis I had was a very high grade hydro. I'm unsure of the exact strain, but it is very good. Like you haven't heard that before.</p><p>T-1:30 </p><p>I ate a full dinner.</p><p>T+0:00              </p><p>I took both ultracets orally.</p><p>T+0:15        </p><p>Smoked approx. .5 grams of high grade bud.</p><p>T+45 mins        </p><p>I think I start to feel something other than the weed. A little bit opiate in nature but definitely something else to it. I feel quite alert.</p><p>T+1 hr 15 min    </p><p>Not quite sure I've hit the plateau because it keeps getting hard to type. Excellent euphoric body sensations. The torso feels so light.</p><p>T+1 hr 40 min    </p><p>Good friend called conversation was fluid and warm. Conversations with this particular friend usually go this way but it was better this time.</p><p>T+2 hr 25 min    </p><p>Past peak still going strong more weed or another ultracet will spike me back up.</p><p>Weed definately amplifies the action of this drug. I did not feel any of the nausea that others have reported with this drug. I also feel 'speedy' as others have reported but I have noticed this with opiates antagonist drugs ( oxycoden, hydracoden, codine, etc. ). B+ combo. A little short lived for my taste, but to be expected considering the ingredients.</p>"
