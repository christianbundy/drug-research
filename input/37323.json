 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nToday I acquired a few ultracet pills. I did a little research on the net and decided on an dose of two pills. This yields a total dose of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen. The cannabis I had was a very high grade hydro. I'm unsure of the exact strain, but it is very good. Like you haven't heard that before.<br>T-1:30 <br>I ate a full dinner.<br>T+0:00              <br>I took both ultracets orally.<br>T+0:15        <br>Smoked approx. .5 grams of high grade bud.<br>T+45 mins        <br>I think I start to feel something other than the weed. A little bit opiate in nature but definitely something else to it. I feel quite alert.<br>T+1 hr 15 min    <br>Not quite sure I've hit the plateau because it keeps getting hard to type. Excellent euphoric body sensations. The torso feels so light.<br>T+1 hr 40 min    <br>Good friend called conversation was fluid and warm. Conversations with this particular friend usually go this way but it was better this time.<br>T+2 hr 25 min    <br>Past peak still going strong more weed or another ultracet will spike me back up.<br>Weed definately amplifies the action of this drug. I did not feel any of the nausea that others have reported with this drug. I also feel 'speedy' as others have reported but I have noticed this with opiates antagonist drugs ( oxycoden, hydracoden, codine, etc. ). B+ combo. A little short lived for my taste, but to be expected considering the ingredients.\n\n\n"
