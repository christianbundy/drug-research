I'd like to start by saying that I didn't initially take Ambien to trip, I used it as a sleep aid and became dependent on it.<br><br>
Two years ago, I had sleeping problems. I didn't know why, and I never saw a doctor for it. I just couldn't sleep and it drove me crazy. Once I found out about Tylenol PM, I took that because it helped aid my sleep. Then once the bottle of Tylenol was empty, I found my dad's prescription Abmien. I did some quick research and decided to try it. <br><br>
Let me tell you, Ambien gave me the best sleep ever. I would wake up so relaxed and felt energized the next day. I started taking reasonable doses almost every night, like between 10 ang 20mg.<br><br>
It was inevitable that having taken it so much for sleep that I would eventually realize how it made me feel when I was awake and on Ambien. I smoked pot frequently at that time, and I liked the way I felt on Ambien. It made me feel light, carefree, (tired), and hazy. <br><br>
So, the one night I decided that instead of just going to sleep after eating my Ambien, I would instead go to my basement and have fun while on the drug. Take advantage of the way I feel, rather than sleep it off. BIG MISTAKE.<br><br>
Details here are very hazy. I took 4 10mg Ambiens that night, more than I usually had taken, but still didn't seem like too much to me. I wanted to feel good, then have the best sleep of my life. <br><br>
The last thing I remember was sitting on my couch watching TV. My next memory jumps to me waking up in the ER in a scary hospital bed, and my dad walking over to me saying 'So what other drugs do you take?'<br><br>
Apparently what happened was that I tried to make it upstairs to my room on the third floor sometime in the middle of the night, and I collapsed on the second staircase. My mom found me passed out and drove me to the hospital with my dad. While half-conscious in the ER, I admitted to them that I had taken abunch of Ambien, though I couldn't remember exactly how many. Still being under the guidance of my parents, I was pretty fucked.<br><br>
I was sent to weekly therapy after that, and my parents don't seem to look at me the same anymore. It WASN'T worth it, and I will avoid Ambien and stick to my Celestial Seasons Tea that puts me to sleep the same.<!-- End Body -->
