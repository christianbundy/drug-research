I acquired a vial of hydromorphone from a friend who knew someone who worked in hospice and accidentally brought home a leftover vial. The vial was labeled hydromorphone and was dilute to 2.5mg/ml. I should mention that the solvent was either rubbed off the label or not indicated, it was probably distilled water. I informed a friend who is a med student about my luck and both of us set out to experience the liquid after work in his dorm room. New needles were bought from the drug store (10 needles for under 5$). <br><br>
The work day was very laid back and slow so we were not tired when we finally punched out at 9pm after 5 hours of work and the typical school day. The two of us went to the med student's room to relax and prepare. The needles were typical insulin syringes in .5 cc increments and two were prepared with 3cc of the solution. The med student injected at 10:00 (after proper injection preperation), sat back and we made a brief conversation before I let him inject me. My heart was pumping slightly faster with anticipation when I lied down to recieve my shot in a large vein in my left bicep. He applied the tourniquet, cleansed the area with an alcohol pad, and injected at 10:09. Sitting up and removing the tourniquet a warm, relaxed, and sedated feeling saturated my body. I felt my heart rate slow down as I relaxed and let the feeling sink in. My mouth became somewhat dry and I went to get some water. The med student left to get some food and returned about 10 minutes later. <br><br>
Experiencing some nausea (as expected) i sat down and med student got me a glass of water. There was no itching associated with opiates, but there was miosis. The two of us sat in the room for about an hour and half and the feeling was still strong. I needed to go home to go to bed and the med student drove me there (I use the bus to get to work). When I got home I turned on some music, sat down, and closed my eyes enjoying the feeling while my head slowly bobbed, similar to when junkies or heroin addicts 'nod out'. I stretched and had some very nice sleep that night. Outside of any necessary analgesia, I wont use hydromorphone again. After experiencing the sedate euphoria I understand the lure that opiates can have and how hard it must be to break an addiction to them.<!-- End Body -->
