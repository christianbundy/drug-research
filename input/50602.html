I first tried methadone at seventeen, during a rather predominant nine-month hydrocodone addiction. I had become more and more interested in opiates as my Vicodin addiction became more prevalent in my life, and wished to explore heroin at some point. I later did, as a result of the experiment detailed here. I took a pill containing ten milligrams of methadone, and half of another identical pill. This dosage was recommended by the friend who had sold them to me. <br><br>
The pill came on slow, unnervingly slow, until, after nearly two hours, I felt the distinctive electric crawl in the spine that tends to indicate opiate action. Within fifteen minutes I was in the grip of the most distinct euphoria I had felt to this point. I found it necessary to sit, as movement resulted more and more in vertigo and nausea. But sitting or lying down I felt perfectly numb. This wasn't the sharp pleasure of hydrocodone and alcohol, and it wasn't the general wellbeing of marijuana. Neither was it the euphoric energy of cocaine, although I felt remarkably tempted to take some of the cocaine I was holding during the high. This was the complete and total absence of pain. Mentally, physically, emotionally, psychologically free of any imaginable pain. I spent the next several hours only moving to change records. Brian Eno and Aphex Twin's ambient work went over well, as did the Velvet Underground. I believe the enjoyment had more to do with lack of emotional content in the music than anything else. it's difficult to say.<br><br>
The following morning I was awake with a heavy reassurance and no sign of hangover. However, within forty minutes I was sick, vomiting twice. This sickness was as bad or worse than Vicodin withdrawal. It subsided with 20mg Vicodin taken orally.<!-- End Body -->
