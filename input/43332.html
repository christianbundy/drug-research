Well it all started 2 days ago when I found a unused bottle of Strattera that was prescribed to me around a year ago. I was feeling like crap so I decided to take one and goto bed (around 10PM?). So I wake up for no apparent reason, sit in my computer chair, and stare at the blank computer screen for about 30 minutes, then go back to sleep (I felt like I was in a half/sleep walking type daze).<br><br>
Next day I wake up (today) feeling great (better than I have in months) so I decided to take another one (60mg). Alright, lets skip all the way from morning 'till the time when I went to bed.<br><br>
As I slowly started drifting into sleep, I noticed that my body started getting numb. I started getting a little scared, but being the experienced 2c-I user that I am, a bad trip never becomes me. I keep on thinking positive thoughts. As time passes, I start hearing a noise.. first it sounded like car horns (impossible for me to hear because I live in a high rise building). <br><br>
The sound started morphing, and it started to sound like a mix of jazz and blues music.. intensifying, getting louder by the second. By this time I felt like I was floating around 2 inches above my body, I felt like I was rolling on E. The body high was amazing yet scary, my teeth were clenched and my eyes were rolled back tight.<br><br>
I didn't get to enjoy the body high because of the feeling of impending doom.. thinking that I was having some sort of seizure or something. Well.. the music continued on, then in my 'field of vision' I started to see morphing characters of people or anything that I was thinking at the time. <br><br>
My field of vision can only be described as a 3rd person view in a video game. With my eyes closed, I was looking down at my body, I could see the complete outline of every body part, as if I was seeing a little boys sketch of a person but filled with that grey static that you see when you accidentally unplug a cable wire from the TV (this somehow represent the euphoria and feelings that I was feeling, as it intensified as time passed... going deeper and deeper into psychosis).<br><br>
Then after 10 minutes, out of nowhere, I was sucked back into my body as I plunged into a surreal dreamlike landscape for about 2 hours. I had the most intense dreams I ever had. They were all about sex and smoking weed. In one part of the dream, after I smoked weed I literally hallucinated that I was high (I dunno how that is possible, but throughout almost the whole dream I was stoned like a mofo, a 'synthetic' thc, cloned high).<br><br>
In the last part of the dream, I somehow became blind/partially blind in my dream. And when I looked at myself, my eyes looked like they had cataracts and were crosseyed. Well after a point I was able to take myself out of the 'trance' and come back to reality.<br><br>
When I opened my eyes, the world around me took on a jello like consistency. Various random flashing colors and bright lights which morphed into people and random figures were also noted.<br><br>
Trails are intensely prominent at this point, when I look into the dark areas of my room. It looks like Ive been staring at a bright sunlit window then quickly closed my eyes to get that flash of light that I usually get after staring at a bright object for a long time.<br><br>
Everything looks fake, and it feels like my head is not attached to my body and is moving on it's own... and typing (sorta like the sims). <br><br>
Well this was totally unexpected, since it's a school night, at it's 4:30 AM... and I dunno if Im going to be able to go back to sleep tonight. I really feel sorry for inexperienced people who are prescribed this drug (especially children) for adhd because what I just experienced in the last 3 hours was the most hardcore psychedelic experience I ever had.<br><br>
I would say this most closely resembles a diphenhydramine trip because that dream was so intensely real that I woke up thinking I was permanently cross eyed and around 300 years into the future (thats when it supposedly took place, but I didn't feel like getting too much into the details of it).<br><br>
This is a high, where, I don't know that I am high, and everything that is hallucinated is real to me at that moment.<!-- End Body -->
