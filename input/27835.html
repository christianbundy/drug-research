In general I don't read junk mail, however I had heard on-line pharmacies were easy to order from.  So, one day I decide to click the link to the online pharmacy adivertisement jumbled amongst the rest of the spam in my e-mail folder.<br><br>
First off I am an avid drug researcher/medical journal reader when free time, at home and work, allows for it.  So, I know quite a bit about pharms and ethnobotanicals alike.  Second, I smoke marijuana a least 5 times per week, and have experimented with mushrooms, ecstacy, a few different painkillers, kanna, wild dagga, ritalin and adderall.  Out of all of these Adderall has continued to interest me, although I do not allow it to become a habit or have the constant resource to do so.<br><br>
With this in mind I began researching the different diet pills offered on the literally thousands of online pharmacys and attempted to find a pill with a similar effect profile to adderall..  After a few weeks I decided on didrex <!--, an amphetamine analog, which includes the meteabolites amphetamine and methamphetamine..in small amounts-->.  I faked my height to weight ratio and easily recieved the $80 bottle of 30 pills in a few days, I see many problems with this trasaction but thats another story.<br><br>
I took (chewed) my first pill the next day before work, trying not to expect anything.  In fact the drug isn't half bad.  About 10 minutes into the drive I found myself singing along to the music in my car, my heart rate was midly increased and I had mild to medium rushes of euphoria.  This euphoria is what I was hoping for, since Adderall is so effective at providing it. Once at work I was moderately concentrated, though a bit more jittery than would be the case on an ADD drug.  <br><br>
The surprising and not so cool part was the short duration I felt energized for.  I took the pill at 7:30 am and by 10:45 I was hungry, my stomach was actually grumbling, which does not say much for the dieting effectiveness of the pill.  On Adderall I do not have an appetite for hours and hours.  Therefore, I chewed another half of the pill and felt the effect return almost immediately.  Well, the jittery felling returned, my appetite decreased, there was no way I could have fallen asleep, but the euphoria from before was significantly reduced.  Also, I felt very mild chest pain, nothing serious, but mixed with a coffee or two some heart palpitations were felt.  Overall, I wasn't too happy with the price I paid, but they are much more effective than coffee and mild euphoria is always fun. <br><br>
Note on chewing:  the pills have a burning/cooling/numbing sensation and very bitter taste, and it is felt on my tounge and down my throat when I swallow.  I have also found the euphoria is not significantly decreased if I just swallow it whole..but the palpitations are decreased. I supposed it could be snorted as well, but it is a time release pill and removing the onders would not be easy.  I have also taken two with in a short period of each other while drinking yerba mate and euphoria is quite nice, good rushes and body sensations. <br><br>
I would say the price just barely reflects the fun involved.<!-- End Body -->
