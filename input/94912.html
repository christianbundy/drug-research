I've been researching chems to ingest for the purpose of study over the last year. I've tried a few of the racetams, (pir, ani and oxi) finding that oxi gave me near photographic memory while piracetam seems completely inactive. <br><br>
I've been pricing ritalin &amp; adderall but due to their unaffordability and unavailability in my location, i have turned to RC's. There is already a report online for MPA, but as I have read mixed and conflicting reports, I though I may as well try it myself. <br><br>
As a little background info, I'm well familiar with all types of drugs but I am not a stimulant kind of guy. I have bouts of mildish depression throughout my life and anytime I have taken any kind of stim in the past has usually been a bad time. <br><br>
With my particual brain chemistry, don't ask me what it is as I don't know even enough to speculate, whatever it is I never seem to become euphoric or love buzzy with any typical stims (coke, e, drone etc) but rather just become anxious and tired, in turn stopped taking them around 2 years ago. I am more of a hallucinogenic kind of guy and substances I have had great experiences with are LSD, nn-dmt and it's various derivitives, 25c-nbomes and my main love Ketamine. These are substances I never become paranoid or aggressive on, and oddly enough make me quite sociable. I am also a long time ganga smoker but have cut down dramatically in the last 5 months.<br><br>
Ok, so I had a little smoke last night and am little late to rise this morning. Theres lots to be done today and so after the shower it's go time. I had a good breakfast of porridge and an egg afterward. Washing down omega oil supplements (3, 6, 9, flaxseed &amp; sesame) multivitamins and about 3g's of piracetam with green tea. I have weighed out 30mgs of MPA as a starter and will redose when deemed necessary.<br><br>
00:00 The 30mgs is spilled out. It's a fine powder and slightly clumpy. 30mgs looks like a big line so I split it. There is a mild burning sensation.<br><br>
+00:05 Could feel it within a minute. Slight increase in heartrate &amp; that slight uneasy feeling I associate with stims has made itself present. Effects of the 15mg aren't very pronounced so I am now insufflating the rest of the line.<br><br>
+00:20 I'm slightly dazed. No euphoria or noticed increase in motivation or focus. Nose is running slightly. I can feel slight pressure on the sides of my head around the temple area. Am going to try and do some theory based lectures for the moment. Also from what I read on other reports, 30mg insufflated should be a sufficient dose for study without redosing for the next hour at least.<br><br>
+00:55 Have been fluctuating between cold and warm, trade mark sign of an RC? Nothing unpleasant though. Read 5 lectures. No noticed increase in retention though it could be argued, to early to say. I am definitely more focused and alert. Also noted a sudden increase in libido, and being a young lad, masturbation of course ensued. I noticed an increase in penis sensitivity, orgasm was good, not as good as sex though.<br><br>
+01:20 Feeling like I've possibly reached a platau. Redosing orally with 30mg.<br><br>
+01:30 Just dosed 30mg in a skin. Haven't eaten in 2 and a half hours. Also am drinking plenty of fluids. Worthy of noting also is that there is no perceivable pupil dialation.<br><br>
+01:50 Felt the brief fluctuation between hot and cold again telling me I'm up on the last dose. I'm seeing the same results as the last time, increased focus and alertness. I feel as though I'm on the edge of a kind of tunnel focus, so I have insufflated another 15mgs just to see the effects.<br><br>
+02:10 Marked increase in alertness, still no 'tunnel focus' per se. Am looking to rap this up so will have one final bump of 15mg.<br><br>
+02:10 Insufflated final dose of ~15mg. I'm still slightly cold, but i don't have those cold sweaty palms that could be associated with 'dirty' RCs or just RC's in general.<br><br>
+02:20 Even after dosing in relatively quick succession, I am still in the initial peppy, focused and alert state.<br><br>
To sum up. I think it's a useful substance. It's affordable, as I said I feel peppy, alert and focused and as the worlds greatest procrastinator with a goldfish attention span i'm studying no problem without distractions. When i say peppy, I don't mean speedy. It is not speedy at all, heartrate is steady, no pupil dialation and no 'wired' feeling.<br><br>
Also, I usually become very anxious when taking stims and must say I've experienced zero anxiety on MPA, just a slight coldness when coming up and very slight shake of the hand/muscle tension.<br><br>
No urge to redose at all.<br><br>
I'd use it for studying, subtle but effective.<!-- End Body -->
