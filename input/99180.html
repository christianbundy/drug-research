Let me start off with some basic information about myself. Ever since I was a child I suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Depression. Because of my mental health I tried many things to try to stop it. I learned that meditation was the best medicine and along with meditation became an interest in altered states of consciousness.  At the time of the experience I had tried inhalants,  DXM, diphenhydramine, Salvia (over 50 breakthrough trips), marijuana, various synthetic cannabinoids, morning glory seeds (5 times), mushrooms (once), 'MDMA', 5-MeO-DALT (around 20 times), 4-HO-MET (4 times) and 4-AcO-DMT (3 times). <br><br>
I ordered 100mg of 4-AcO-DMT. With the 4-AcO-DMT I had I noticed that it was rather  weak compared to Shulgin's notes and others experiences I have read. The three experiences I had with the chemical produced little effects. I took a dose of 12mg, 18mg and then 34mg. Even with the 34 mg dose I hardly had any profound thoughts or visuals. After doing some research I found out that the source of my 4-AcO-DMT confirmed that it was low potency.<br><br>
Now to the trip.<br><br>
It was 12 am on Thursday and I had school the next day. I already finished my finals and I had a week left of classes. So I thought I deserved to enjoy a nice pleasant and rather weak trip. I meditated about an hour beforehand to prepare and to calm my mind down and I was pretty excited to just listen to music and maybe do some writing. Unfortunately my night didn't go as planned.<br><br>
T+0:00. Assuming I had only around 40 milligrams of rather weak 4-AcO-DMT, I poured a little of water in the baggy that had the chemical in it and just swallowed. As soon as it was in my mouth I noticed it was much more bitter than my previous experience but I didn't think much of it. I headed to my computer just to read some low level mushroom trip reports to get me in the mood and maybe get some ideas of what to do. <br><br>
T+0:06. I noticed I was having trouble focusing and my vision seemed a tad off. This gave me a little anxiety but I was able to brush it off easily. I decided to go to the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror I noticed my pupils were very dilated. Seeing my pupils made even more anxiety manifest I thought maybe there was more in the bag then 40mg.<br><br>
T+0:10. I tried to induce vommiting but unfortunately I couldn't. As I was leaning over the toilet it seemed the toilet seat was spinning very rapidly, I then looked at the carpet and noticed patterns forming and things flowing around. I began to panic. I knew I was in for a hell of a trip.<br><br>
T+0:15. I finally left the restroom and visuals were more intense than anything I have seen besides salvia. Everything looked like a purple and green tinted painting and I could see everything swirling, morphing, and fusing together. For some reason I wasn't having any psychedelic thoughts just intense visuals.<br><br>
T+0:20. As I was pacing my room trying to rationalize what was happening things exploded. I was in a different dimension. My room shuffled about. I was so confused and past the point of anything I have ever experienced.<br><br>
T+0:40 - 3:00. The madness died down a bit but I was still tripping harder than I ever have. I laid in bed and just started crying. I was so anxious, scared, depressed and angry. Every negative emotion was surfacing and the pattern cycled for what felt like an eternity. I needed to stop this insanity. I managed to work my way to my bathroom and grabbed a bottle of melatonin. Each pill contained 3mg and I just started eating handfulls. Then I remember being on bed again. The trip shifted from seeing futuristic and alien landscapes to a more spiritual setting.<br><br>
I was connecting to different consciousnesses throughout history. The visuals changed and I was experiencing a bad trip from a child who accidentally consumed mushrooms long ago. I saw trough his eyes concerned people standing over him as he was screaming at their distorted faces. Pleading for an end, I felt his struggle. Then it changed again, I was now in the body of a teenager in the late 80s or early 90s having a bad trip on acid. I saw palms trees swaying to the voice of the teenager's friends trying to calm him down. I again felt the connection and his horrible stress.<br><br>
Next was probably the worst part. I began to experience false realities that felt too real. I was suddenly in the back of a police car shirtless and yet relieved that it was coming to an end. Next I was in ambulance I was so confused of what was happening. Then next I was in the backseat of my car, I saw my mother crying and scared for me and my brother was driving fast down the road. Then I was back in my bed. I was questioning if what I experienced were alternate realities with completely different outcomes of my current situation.<br><br>
T+3:00-5:00. The trip began to turn around as the melatonin made me feel so comfortable and I knew I would make it through. I just drifted through thoughts and listened to the intense sounds and watched the fantastic visuals caused by the chemical.<br><br>
T+5:00-6:00. I entered a phase where I was still tripping quite hard but it was somewhat manageable and I called my girlfriend to tell her about my night as we were talking it dawned on me that I had to leave for school in less then half an hour. As soon as a realized this I began to panic as I knew there was no way I was going to be sober by then. I scrambled to get ready. I quickly took a shower which was very unpleasant as I looked at my skin and felt disgusted. Everything seemed dirty and primitive. After the shower I tried to find my school uniform. It was no where to be found but I knew I had to get to school. I ended up putting on the wrong clothes and just rushed out. <br><br>
T+6:30-7:00. The fresh air and smell of morning dew lifted my mood quite a bit but I was still very anxious. I put on some Shpongle on my iPod and just tried to relax. Once on the bus I was hiding my face to make sure no one would notice my dilated pupils. The bus ride felt like a journey on a space ship and I kept giggling which brought some attention to me. Once I arrived at school my friends all greeted me and walked me to class so I wouldn't get stopped by teachers.<br><br>
T+7:00-10:00. I was still tripping through my first few classes which was unbearable, I couldn't read or write anything and speech was somewhat hard. Luckily because it was Friday and the school year was almost over it didn't matter much. By 10 the trip was almost at an end.<br><br>
T+10:00-14:00. The high was still dragging on but I was again completely functional, once I got home from school I just crashed and had a wonderful sleep. <br><br>
The next few days I felt very happy and motivated which I'm guessing was a result of the drug.<br><br>
This trip was one of the most profound experiences of my life. I wish I was a better writer so I could explain it better. <br><br>
Anyway the moral of the story is not to assume that the amount of chemical you bought is the amount you received. I have no accurate guess of how much I took but I wish I could go back in time and weigh out that dose.<!-- End Body -->
