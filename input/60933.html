Diphenhydramine in my opinion is a truly beautiful substance when taken in moderation. I often used to hear about train wrecks and horror stories involving the drug so when I first decided to give it a try I made sure that I was taking a very small dose in comparison to what many say is the norm. <br><br>
When I first took the substance I started off with only 100MG's barely if at all over the recommended dose. I felt the effects very lightly and decided that next time I would up the dose.<br><br>
A few days later I bump the dose up to 200MGs and I can safely say that I have found my groove. The buzz that was produced with such a small amount was beautiful. I became very, very relaxed. I found that things on TV and conversations with friends became a lot more funny to me. Not to the point where everything was hysterical and I found myself giggling like a complete fool but just to a point where it was alot easier to appreciate the humor and laugh. Everything became a lot more interesting as well and overall I had a great feeling of well being.<br><br>
I was in control the entire time but my mind WAS altered. Just enough to where it was enjoyable.<br><br>
Since then I've always used the substance at around that dosage and always had an enjoyable experience. I've even found that using  it about an hour or 2 before sex allows be much greater stamina in terms of controlling climax and when I do reach that point it produces a bit of a drawn out longer orgasm. Imagine an Orgasm in slow motion and thats what you get.<!-- End Body -->
