 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first trip was a psychedelic blast.  My girlfriends and I were out watching a band at one of our regular haunts.  The lights were awesome.  We danced all night.  I didnt drink but I was so happy I spent $50 shouting other people drinks.  Ouch!  Unfortunately this wild night led to a two year tripping binge which totally fucked me up, without me knowing it.\r\nThroughout this time I had a few bad trips, many good.  Acid tricks your mind.  I told myself I should never end on a bad trip and of course after a good trip, there was no need to give up.\r\nI was a good girl from a good home in a good middle class suburb.  My parents broke up and moved and I felt like I had no real sense of home.  I lived as I chose and I thought this meant I was free, but in all reality I was falling into a lonely life of grungy drugs and rocknroll, which tore at my self-esteem.\r\nMy worst trip began as a real hoot, as many bad trips do.  My boyfriend and some of his friends and I were driving around in the hills, checking out the forest.  The trees vibrated, leaves pulsed, it was awesome.  We drove up to a huge weir and watched the sun go down.  I remember we were on top of the world up there and I dont even remember whose idea it was, but one of the guys and I did something terribly stupid, which could have ended in disaster for me.  \r\nThe stars were bright and the water shone far below and Geoff held me by the ankles and I floated there upside down looking  at the water.  I felt free, truly free and  I remember thinking, if he dropped me I would either break my back or drown, then my boyfriend saw us and said oy you two, stop being so stupid and Geoff pulled me back up.  It was really weird.  We laughed and kidded around for a while then went back to the car, which was Geoffs Mums.  \r\nIt was dark and Geoff was spinning out so he pulled over and we all just sat there silently in the dark.  The tension was frightening.  I felt negative vibes pouring from Geoff towards me and I felt incredibly vulnerable like I needed to be hugged and loved and I was stuck in this car with four negative yobbos.  I closed my eyes and watched as pictures came, bright moving pictures, of space and time and dimension.  I saw universes inside universes and it freaked me out.  I felt tiny and worthless and miserable and I vowed to give up acid, but it took me another year before I did.  I have used it occasionally since as a party drug, but now I am too old to trouble my brain with it.  I would maybe indulge in a quarter tab at a concert one day but it would have to be damn good outdoor concert.\r\nI have smoked pot off and on over the years, much more on than off though.  I wish I smoked less but I dont.  I have had difficulty finishing things, finding myself and I have noticed that in research of former LSD users this is quite common.  The experience I had both at the weir and after in the car, were so huge, that they numbed me spiritually for about five years.  Since then I have been lucky to find God and Goddess in nature and feel the natural highs of life without chemical drugs.  \r\nAfter much growth and finding myself I have recently come to notice how much the casual drug use I grew up with, has affected me for the negative.  I have suffered from depression at times although I have tried to hide it from myself.  Denial is my middle name.  I had low self-esteem and endured crappy relationships because I felt like a cracked fragile person.  I am now finally seeing some successes in my life, through following my heart, my intuition, God and Goddess.\r\nI still feel like I need to learn people skills, like many acid heads, I have hidden away from the 'real world' for a long time.  I find sustained conversation with strangers difficult because I am always stoned.  I plan to cut down my pot intake soon, maybe give up for a year, and go to uni, start learning again.  I do a lot of research about subjects I am interested in but until recently I have had trouble remembering what Ive learnt.  I think this is more the pot than the lsd but who knows?\r\nI would give up pot today if I could stop kidding myself I need it to have creative thought as a writer.  Perhaps by admitting this now I am half way there.\n\n\n"
