 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI swallowed 25 mg's of oxycodone at 7:30. At 9 o'clock I was feeling euphoric and in the mood to write how I felt. Extreme beauty and the feeling that everything was getting better swarmed around me. I was also taking Effexor 150 mg's and Risperdal .5mg's daily for my depression. I also smoked two black and mild cigars while writing. Here is what I wrote..<br>Warm waves slip into my heart,<br>My eyes close and enter sweet slumber.<br>Smoke rises from a joy-filled plain.<br>The cold of the night doesn't enter me,<br>Yet gains awareness that I don't grasp for it.<br>Fuzzy cottonballs replace my bone.<br>They cozily fit together to form my body.<br>The starless night still seems bright,<br>Unevading and calm the moon does appear.<br>No news could change my state of mind.<br>The moon then creates a spotlight on me.<br>Everything working for me is ten times as clear,<br>And the negative things cease to exist.<br>Time drives by in bundles as I smile.<br>Lights gain a mysterious glow.<br>My limbs move in a warm fire of hope.<br>Yet my skin stays in a radiant way.<br>Clear are my thoughts and ambitions.<br>My eyes are starlit as if another universe is inside me,<br>With only good to let the planets revolve.<br>Towards the end of the experience, I felt better about myself. As if my current depression had been swept away. All and all, I had a very pleasant time. It was the best Halloween of my life..\n\n\n"
