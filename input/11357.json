 "report": "<p>I swallowed 25 mg's of oxycodone at 7:30. At 9 o'clock I was feeling euphoric and in the mood to write how I felt. Extreme beauty and the feeling that everything was getting better swarmed around me. I was also taking Effexor 150 mg's and Risperdal .5mg's daily for my depression. I also smoked two black and mild cigars while writing. Here is what I wrote..</p><p>Warm waves slip into my heart,</p><p>My eyes close and enter sweet slumber.</p><p>Smoke rises from a joy-filled plain.</p><p>The cold of the night doesn't enter me,</p><p>Yet gains awareness that I don't grasp for it.</p><p>Fuzzy cottonballs replace my bone.</p><p>They cozily fit together to form my body.</p><p>The starless night still seems bright,</p><p>Unevading and calm the moon does appear.</p><p>No news could change my state of mind.</p><p>The moon then creates a spotlight on me.</p><p>Everything working for me is ten times as clear,</p><p>And the negative things cease to exist.</p><p>Time drives by in bundles as I smile.</p><p>Lights gain a mysterious glow.</p><p>My limbs move in a warm fire of hope.</p><p>Yet my skin stays in a radiant way.</p><p>Clear are my thoughts and ambitions.</p><p>My eyes are starlit as if another universe is inside me,</p><p>With only good to let the planets revolve.</p><p>Towards the end of the experience, I felt better about myself. As if my current depression had been swept away. All and all, I had a very pleasant time. It was the best Halloween of my life..</p>"
