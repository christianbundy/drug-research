 "report": "<p>Having received 2*20mg doses of 2c-c, an open afternoon seemed a likely chance to try the material out. Opting for the cautious approach, 1*20mg capsule was swallowed at t+0, with first alerts felt in 20minutes. 2c-c has a truly strange onset for me, like entering a sort of non-descript stupour state. I'd call it confusion, but I'm too apathetic and disassociated to really be involved enough in cognitions to be confused about them. As the experience progresses, closed eyes reveal a sort of smoke screen in my cognitive processing. It's almost as if impulses from certain areas of the brain are being inhibited in some way. </p><p>After ~1.5hrs of foggy psychedelic 'boredom', an additional 20mg was taken to 'test the outer edge' of this material. A half hour after the second dosing, the experience got a little more interesting. Basically,  the 'fog' kind of shifted into a sedated sense of relaxation reminiscent of mda. I'd characterize this level of dosing as fairly empathic and relaxing, the sedation kind of pulls the mind out of the visual content of the experience,  and there's no real desire to engage in any specific type of activity (physical or mental). Basically, a nice material, not terribly interesting but def. glad I explored it.</p>"
