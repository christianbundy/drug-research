We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
I got a mouthful of gas. I was kind of scared I would die but I really didn't care. I didn't call a doctor or try to throw it up. I lived but I had gas burps for two weeks and everything I ate tasted like gas, which I didn't mind because I love the taste but most people don't.<br><br>
I huffed gas every day for several years, hours at a time,(usually in a garage) and my friends and I would see who could huff the longest without breathing oxygen. Many times I would suddenly find myself in another room or outside with no idea how I got there. Every sound had a never ending echo and even things I could see had a visual echo which would spiral out into eternity. <br><br>
I never knew when I would black out, there was just missing scenes from one moment to another, however I could see my friends when they blacked out. Their eyes would roll back and they would drool or mumble nonsense. Sometimes I would get sucked into a spiral pattern coming from a sound or an evergreen tree that had some crazy pattern and I would go through it like a tunnel with a light at the end which could have been where death was if I went through it. <br><br>
Huffing gas made everything beautiful and awesome and it's the most high I can get, but I eventually had to give it up or become a vegetable. To this day the whole world is a total mystery and everything is confusing and nobody understands a thing I say unless I try as hard as possible to speak legibly. The side effects don't go away.<br><br>
I do not regret huffing gas but I'll never do it again. I am ok with what it did to my brain though because I am an artist and now I can see the world in a special way. The person I used to be might as well have died, especially because I can't remember most of it. My memory is full of holes.<!-- End Body -->
