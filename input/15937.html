I currently take 50 mg of atenolol each day to control periodic heart palpitations which I have experienced for about 10 years.  I began taking atenolol about one year ago. I use MDMA about twice a year, but have not had the courage to try it since beginning atenolol.  My fear was that the two might be a deadly combination. I tried in vain to find any hard data about the combination of MDMA and atenolol.  Last week, after deciding to go ahead and not worry about it, I took two hits of MDMA at an all night outdoors party over the course of four hours.  While I did not expect to drop dead from the combination, I did think I might suffer increased palpitations or anxiety.  To my surprise, neither was the case.  My 'trip' was about as normal as ever although not quite as intense as times before.  This could of course could have been due to weak MDMA.  I do not know. In fact, the next day, I felt better than ever, with no hangover of any kind. I am sure that the combination of atentolol and MDMA was not a wise decision, but I wanted to share my experience all the same.<!-- End Body -->
