Im into nootropics, antiaging, and supplements in general. Ive been taking Selegiline and Phosphatidylserine for a long time but I heard about Piracetam so I had to try it.<br><br>
The first night I took 2400 mg and went to sleep. I had the most amazing vivid dream! It was truly wonderful, unlike anything ever... so I was jazzed and I continued with the Piracetam at 2400 mg 3x/day for several months. I didnt have such vivid dreams but the effect was that my brain hemispheres started working together. Im an intuitive/thinking person by nature, Myers Briggs ENTP. Intuition is right brain and thinking is left. Thats all fine but at puberty men lose the communication between hemispheres and that is the biggest problem for any NT male. I got it back with Piracetam. Planning went from drawing flowcharts and straining to get things done to just doing them naturally. Meeting and getting along with women went from a strained thing to just naturally telling them what I think and feel. Life got considerably better. I started remembering names of people I went to grammar school with and all sorts of pleasant childhood things. I started writing poetry and some of it is very well received. The downside was that I felt very tired a lot of the time and sometimes it was sort of a sudden onset tiredness I started taking Choline Bitartrate with every dose of Piracetam to the tune of about 1:2 and the tired thingy went away pretty muchly I cannot get enough choline from eating eggs if I take large doses of Piracetam afaik.<br><br>
I had some of my female friends try some Piracetam and they reported that it did nothing. That makes sense to me, women have good communication between the brain hemispheres. <br><br>
Id say that Piracetam is good for men and nearly essential for Intuitive-Thinking ones<!-- End Body -->
