Hi there an thanks for reading. I am writing this report at the end of my experience with MDVP. This is a very very interesting drug. What I can say for certain is that it shares properties with most stims but that being said it effects everyone differently. First off I must advise this drug is stronger then my will power. Seriously it very moreish. I have consumed .06 over the last two days.  when i say .06 I mean .6 of a Point [gram]. I really don't need this much for this drug, really a few flecks will do me and keep me pumping for 2+ hours. I have been dosing with tiny tiny amounts for the last 48 hours the only side effect I have found is lack of appetite, cravings, sore muscles and utter boredom. DO NOT DO THIS DRUG ALONE!<br><br>
Also of note is increase heart rate (I can feel it) don't push yourself. I don't want to dance either, but I'll want to talk and talk and talk. I have some lab rats that are using ATM and effects are varied, some get horny, some don't, some can eat, some cant.<br>
***<br><br>
Important part: The 'I WANT TO SLEEP BUT CAN'T' is the worst bit, I will require 1) Booze (a shot of spirit will be good) 2) Any benzo.  I will be using 5MG Xanax<br>
***<br><br>
I believe this drug to be very very addictive, please only purchase in small quantities. Once I did that first line it was very VERY hard for me not to do another and another. If i was to recommend a dose size it would be 0.005g - I know that sounds weird but it is the truth, a little bit goes a long way.<!-- End Body -->
