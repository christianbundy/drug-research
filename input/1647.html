UPS arrived with my package of 250mg of Foxy two days after ordering some online. I ingested a moderate amount (10mg or so), &amp; waited.<br><br>
When it started kicking in, I felt as if an acid trip were coming on. Music sounded slightly distorted &amp; out-of-place. In fact, a lot of things sounded distant &amp; detached from reality, including myself.<br><br>
Within about an hour or two, I started to notice something startling: visuals. In fact, the visuals I saw were a LOT like LSD. Colors seemed to seep through the borders of inaminate objects, &amp; I started experiencing strong tracers. To tell you the truth, about 3 hours into the experience (towards the peak) I saw so many hallucinations that I was dumbfounded, mainly because everything I have read about this drug says you DON'T experience visual distortions, but the distortions I experienced were those of a moderate LSD trip.<br><br>
Talking to people seemed strange, &amp; there was paranoia when having to talk to parents, etc. It made concentration difficult &amp; I was searching for the 'right' words to use when conversing with others. <br><br>
It was very physically euphoric. I remember laying down on my bed on my back &amp; staring up at the ceiling... everything was moving &amp; swimming. When I was online, the words on the screen looked more like waves, &amp; were slowly moving up &amp; down with each sentence. I became lost in time, very happy &amp; euphoric. I still could not get over all the hallucinations I was experiencing. It was like acid but 'wavy'... the high seemed to come in &amp; out like waves, but I still felt it the entire time. The visuals were more like acid than 2C-B. It was quite a trip.<br><br>
After coming down, I went out with friends &amp; gave out free samples. Everyone who tried it loved it. For me, it also made sex more intense... way more. But I only became horny after thinking about it... which was only twice or so. I was having a lot more fun just enjoying the trip.<br><br>
If I had it, I would certainly do it again. But the comedown was like an acid comedown, &amp; it was not very enjoyable laying awake ALL night long until 9am (I dosed around 1pm or so), so I'd have to take that into consideration.<br><br>
All-in-all, it was well worth it. But not something I'd want to partake in every week, or even every month.<!-- End Body -->
