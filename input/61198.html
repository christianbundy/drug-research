Before I start I must tell everyone.2ce is more powerful than LSD, it is as no where NEAR as good (nothing really is) as LSD but its effects are much more insane, not in a good way.<br><br>
I had heard that my friend Drew had ordered 2ce online and it was some obscure hallucinogen.  My friend Taylor had done something like 40mg one night (way over what your suppose to do) and he claimed he had lost his mind for like 6 hours.  So wanting to experience it for myself we went to Drew's to buy some.  When we arrived he opened the door, pale as a ghost and said nothing other than 'I just died.'  He acted foolish and couldn't comprehend what we were saying when we were trying to get the 2ce from him he just kept saying that he was dead and that he could not release it.  Finally we got him to let us 'see his wallet' (he was holding the 2ce in his wallet.)<br><br>
We proceeded to take the 2ce out it was in a little manila envelope with a little baggie inside which contained the powder.  I poured out 2 huge lines (which were estimated at 25mg) without knowing anything about the drug not even how much this was or how much I should take.  My friends said 'Dan, dont do that much only do half one of those lines.'  I responded 'I have done allot of drugs this is nothing.'  As soon as I snorted the lines we left and about 2 minutes after snorting it I asked to go home because I felt it setting in and for some reason wanted to be home.  I lived up the street from Drew so I got home like 5 minutes after the lines had been ingested.<br><br>
I felt very insecure and the threshold was HEAVY.  I then felt extreme nausea and my nostrils burned as they always do when snorting 2ce.  I must have puked about 15 times then just kept dry heaving.  After about 20 minutes of being sick I felt okay.  I curled up into a ball on my mattress and felt very cold my brain could not make sense of anything.  When I was puking I puked out of my window and I still functioned enough to grab a role of paper towels and clean that up at like midnight.  I dont remember much but I remember just wanting the feelings I had to end for like 6 hours then I drank a little vodka when my trip was coming down and fell asleep.<br><br>
When we were at Drews I had made a little take home baggie of 2ce for myself that consisted of about 10 mg.  I never learn my lesson with any drug so after recovering from the night before at about 5 p.m. I opened the little baggie and snorted it in my bathroom.  This time it was a normal dosage but my nose still felt like I had snorted glass.  I turned around and puked 3 times then felt great.  I had a very smooth trip.  Then and from that point on whenever I've taken 2ce it makes me feel like someone put a substance which makes objects easy to move in my thoughts, such as grease or Vaseline.  I realized all the wonders of the world and just loved being alive.  I went out and just looking at trees and seeing the sky and smelling the air made me feel wonderful.  Plus all of my thoughts came and went so smoothly it was heavenly.<br><br>
A couple days after that we got my friend Glen some 2ce and just like me he thought he could handle it even though we told him not to do that much he snorted about 20 mg.  5 minutes after snorting he laid on his back of my friends finished basement.  Snots began running down his face like water.  I had never seen so much snot before the bottom of his whole face was a shiny layer of snot leaking off the sides of his face.  He then became disoriented and laughing hysterically.  He then began puking.  I counted his puking up to 20 times then I left the room and he continued to puke.  <br><br>
Once his sickness got over he sat on the couch and had no recollection of anything or anyone.  He kept asking us who we were and where he was.  We would try to talk to him and he would just keep repeating what?  Who are you?  And where am I?  I left before he could snap back into reality because I was also tripping on it and that was too much for me so I went outside and looked at some trees then listened to some music and enjoyed another nice smooth trip.  After that trip glen said he would never do it again and to this day he has not.  I will trip on it again if it ever comes around.<!-- End Body -->
