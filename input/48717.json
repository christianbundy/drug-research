 "report": "<p>I don't have headaches often, however; tonight I did.  Given it was only a slight headache and not even worthy of any soothing relief, I took relatively strong doses of pain relievers.  I did not do this to really ease the pain, but rather to experience relatively strong doses of pain relievers.</p><p>I took 5 Ibuprofen pills at 200mg a piece.  I took 2 Excedrin Migraine pills each containing 250mg Acetaminophen, 250mg Aspirin, and 65mg Caffeine, which is odd because headaches are an effect of caffeine. I know now that caffeine is also an aid for analgesics.  I took a stronger analgesic containing 500mg Acetaminophen and 25mg Pamabrom, which is just a diuretic, per pill.  I also took 2 memory and focus pills containing various vitamins and minerals including 100mg of Gingko Biloba 24% extract per pill.</p><p>I have always been skeptical of the actual efficiency of an analgesic.  Because painkillers are so gradual and faint, I have never felt their effects take shape.  If nothing else, I can now say that I have felt the effects of analgesics.</p><p>About 10 minutes after consumption I could feel a satisfying (not irritating at all) tingling sensation capping my head.  There was a tense tingling wrapping from temple to temple under the jaw line. This lasted only temporarily and then nothing. That alone rid of the trivial headache without a doubt, although; I do not recommend this recipe for any general pain relief for the simple fact that Acetaminophen causes liver damage at high doses.</p><p>30 or so minutes after that, the pharmaceuticals returned in full effect.  I found my entire body relaxed.  It was not the oversensitive, overwhelming kind of relaxation that I find while high on any kind of psychoactive.  Instead, it was a realized relaxation.  It was as though my muscles loosened and relaxed (which they probably did) and I was just comfortable.  Eyes open or closed, rather sitting up or collapsed, I was comfortable.</p><p>Needless to say, it was weak.  Maybe the doses where not as superfluous as I had originally thought.  Then again (as I had said before) Acetaminophen at high doses causes liver damage.  Honestly, it is not near strong enough of a drug to begin making any type of health compromise what so ever.  I exploited as a trial in analgesic intensity.  I would smoke a bowl any day (or every day for that matter) instead.</p>"
