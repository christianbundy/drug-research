Indian raga music playing on stereo.DMT like visions with <br>closed and open eyes.<br>K--I entered into a golden realm with a bright deity present, who said <br>very clearly 'Not with him' which snapped me back to the awareness of <br>sitting on the couch. I asked V 'What does that mean?' And V, <br>flabbergasted, twisting and turning,said 'What do YOU think it means?'  <br>My response was indignant and I wanted to go after the entity that had <br>said this to me!<br>V-I was deep into the music and felt like I was entering a sacred realm. <br>Suddenly I got to a point where I was being told where this realm and <br>music is only for those entering with a single heart and pure love. I  <br>could go no further till I had expressed my pure heart. I took K by the <br>hand and said let's go lie down on the bed. We cuddled and preceded with <br>our trip.<br>K-Upon cuddling, I entered into a beautiful moving colorful oneness with <br>V. I sensed V taking my hand, approaching a golden being, where he had a <br>conversation with it, requesting us to enter together into the entryway <br>beyond the being.V pulled me into the entryway, where we became as one <br>and back into the beauty of the oneness with V again. I was loving this <br>so much and I said to V, this is so beautiful, where are you taking me? <br>and V responded , 'That's what we're going to talk about..'<br>V-I confessed/explained that my heart was not int the same place as K's <br>and that I had to be 110 % honest before we continued this journey <br>together. K told me to chill out and relax and we continued to embrace.<br>K- I went back into a huge golden space that the entity had permitted us <br>to enter, it was beautiful but I as I went further into the entryway,  I <br>came upon the essence of some kind of accident/ train wreck/distortion, <br>preventing me from going any further. Very clearly, I was now told to <br>listen and be quiet. I was not permitted to speak..However, I was <br>blurting out things I was not suppose to say, and constantly reminded to <br>be quiet at least four times.I.I perceived V to my left as a golden <br>being on a throne,and to my right was the entryway with the being <br>inside, I was dressed all in blue, veiled, with bangles all over my <br>dress. I was in a realm of intense blues and golds.I laughed at V, and <br>said 'You will not be my God!' V, angered said 'You will laugh when I <br>tell you to laugh' I responded with silence.<br>V- I remembered saying to K, I like to hear her laugh, it is interesting <br>that she heard it a completely different way.<br>K- in my anger, I now possessed a staff in my right hand and I went into <br>the chamber where the entity was and proceeded to tell it that it was a <br>false god and that Jesus  was the real God and that he had created <br>everything, including them. I raised my staff and struck the being and <br>it vaporized. I did this repeatedly with many entities, I was angry and <br>like a warrior princess archetype. I was now thrown back on the bed, <br>noticing how I would go in and out in waves. V and I were astonished at <br>how beautiful we both looked to each other and commented on it. and we <br>cuddled and kissed...even with all the ongoing craziness of it we still <br>had a love for each other.<br>V-We had some intense conversations on our relationship and due to my <br>personality and her religious beliefs that there were some <br>irreconcilable differences. K pointed out some very astute observations <br>on what my problems dealing with woman were. Boy, did she nail me! These <br>were some valuable insights. I realized and said that I was like a wolf <br>stalking his own heart .We also discussed our very different spiritual <br>beliefs. This took place over a span of  several hours as we would <br>alternate intense conversations as the effects of the drug ebbed and <br>flowed in waves.<br>K- I would drift back to the beauty constantly, but I could only go so <br>far until I encountered the vision of a trainwreck. This happened four <br>times, I didn't want to face it and on the fourth time I realized that <br>the trainwreck was V's relationship with me..and I was now trying to fix <br>it.<br>At 5:30 am the most intense parts had passed, sleep was difficult,so we <br>both took Xanax.We were both shocked at waking up at 5:30 pm on the <br>next day !<br>V- Basically this was an incredibly potent substance, but like MDMA I <br>believe that this has strong empathogenic and therapeutic properties. We <br>both joked that we had saved thousands of dollars in therapy bills!<br>K- With the right person, the person you love, this could be the best <br>experience of oneness one could ever have in this lifetime.\n\n\n"
