 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nDose - 15 mg ACO-DMT  ('K')\r\n       20 mg ACO-DMT  ('V')\r\n850 pm - drank powder dissolved in water\r\n910 pm - felt a heavy vibration, palms sweating\r\nWe sat on a couch , holding hands, that's when we noticed our palms were \r\nsweating. Indian raga music playing on stereo.DMT like visions with \r\nclosed and open eyes.\r\nK--I entered into a golden realm with a bright deity present, who said \r\nvery clearly 'Not with him' which snapped me back to the awareness of \r\nsitting on the couch. I asked V 'What does that mean?' And V, \r\nflabbergasted, twisting and turning,said 'What do YOU think it means?'  \r\nMy response was indignant and I wanted to go after the entity that had \r\nsaid this to me!\r\nV-I was deep into the music and felt like I was entering a sacred realm. \r\nSuddenly I got to a point where I was being told where this realm and \r\nmusic is only for those entering with a single heart and pure love. I  \r\ncould go no further till I had expressed my pure heart. I took K by the \r\nhand and said let's go lie down on the bed. We cuddled and preceded with \r\nour trip.\r\nK-Upon cuddling, I entered into a beautiful moving colorful oneness with \r\nV. I sensed V taking my hand, approaching a golden being, where he had a \r\nconversation with it, requesting us to enter together into the entryway \r\nbeyond the being.V pulled me into the entryway, where we became as one \r\nand back into the beauty of the oneness with V again. I was loving this \r\nso much and I said to V, this is so beautiful, where are you taking me? \r\nand V responded , 'That's what we're going to talk about..'\r\nV-I confessed/explained that my heart was not int the same place as K's \r\nand that I had to be 110 % honest before we continued this journey \r\ntogether. K told me to chill out and relax and we continued to embrace.\r\nK- I went back into a huge golden space that the entity had permitted us \r\nto enter, it was beautiful but I as I went further into the entryway,  I \r\ncame upon the essence of some kind of accident/ train wreck/distortion, \r\npreventing me from going any further. Very clearly, I was now told to \r\nlisten and be quiet. I was not permitted to speak..However, I was \r\nblurting out things I was not suppose to say, and constantly reminded to \r\nbe quiet at least four times.I.I perceived V to my left as a golden \r\nbeing on a throne,and to my right was the entryway with the being \r\ninside, I was dressed all in blue, veiled, with bangles all over my \r\ndress. I was in a realm of intense blues and golds.I laughed at V, and \r\nsaid 'You will not be my God!' V, angered said 'You will laugh when I \r\ntell you to laugh' I responded with silence.\r\nV- I remembered saying to K, I like to hear her laugh, it is interesting \r\nthat she heard it a completely different way.\r\nK- in my anger, I now possessed a staff in my right hand and I went into \r\nthe chamber where the entity was and proceeded to tell it that it was a \r\nfalse god and that Jesus  was the real God and that he had created \r\neverything, including them. I raised my staff and struck the being and \r\nit vaporized. I did this repeatedly with many entities, I was angry and \r\nlike a warrior princess archetype. I was now thrown back on the bed, \r\nnoticing how I would go in and out in waves. V and I were astonished at \r\nhow beautiful we both looked to each other and commented on it. and we \r\ncuddled and kissed...even with all the ongoing craziness of it we still \r\nhad a love for each other.\r\nV-We had some intense conversations on our relationship and due to my \r\npersonality and her religious beliefs that there were some \r\nirreconcilable differences. K pointed out some very astute observations \r\non what my problems dealing with woman were. Boy, did she nail me! These \r\nwere some valuable insights. I realized and said that I was like a wolf \r\nstalking his own heart .We also discussed our very different spiritual \r\nbeliefs. This took place over a span of  several hours as we would \r\nalternate intense conversations as the effects of the drug ebbed and \r\nflowed in waves.\r\nK- I would drift back to the beauty constantly, but I could only go so \r\nfar until I encountered the vision of a trainwreck. This happened four \r\ntimes, I didn't want to face it and on the fourth time I realized that \r\nthe trainwreck was V's relationship with me..and I was now trying to fix \r\nit.\r\nAt 5:30 am the most intense parts had passed, sleep was difficult,so we \r\nboth took Xanax.We were both shocked at waking up at 5:30 pm on the \r\nnext day !\r\nV- Basically this was an incredibly potent substance, but like MDMA I \r\nbelieve that this has strong empathogenic and therapeutic properties. We \r\nboth joked that we had saved thousands of dollars in therapy bills!\r\nK- With the right person, the person you love, this could be the best \r\nexperience of oneness one could ever have in this lifetime.\n\n\n"
