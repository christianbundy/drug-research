 "report": "<p>Just heard Evan Wright, author Generation Kill, speak about taking Zanax before job interview at Hustler Magazine in his new book, Generation Kill.  Funny for me, I took valium and klonapin to get through job interviews, too, before I learned how to relax by getting outside myself and observing the pleasure of being under intense scutiny, a benefit of living, a privilege of being.  Not that I am at ease when I don't use sedatives, but I develop a weird detachment from assigning myself a quiet place (attentive to what comes through my senses) within a reality that I need not fear because I am party to its existence and co-author of its outcomes.  Hired or not.</p>"
