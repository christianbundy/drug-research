For a while now I've believed my days of experimenting with psychedelics were behind me. For the last couple years I've been content to smoking my weed, and I've been considering giving that up.(Right) I've done my share of drugs. Believe me when I tell you I have experience with drugs of all types. I've always been curious, and when I found out how wonderful drugs could be, when done in the proper ways,  my curiosity naturally drew me towards a life I once promised myself I would never participate in. But that time in my life ran its course, so I thought.<br><br>
Poking around on-line one day I came across one of those 'legal' weed sites. You know the ones that sell you bags of 'herbs' that totally fuck you up. Sure, I've heard of <br>
this shit, but I've always thought it was for old hippies who can't score any real stuff anymore, or college kids who dont want to get caught smoking weed in their dorm. But this site perked my curiosity and I started searching around for other legal ways to get high. That's when I found some random discussion board where people were talking about 2C-I. 'Hmmmm. This sounds interesting.' This is the first time I've heard about research chemicalsI promptly ordered some before I could talk myself out of it. <br><br>
That's when I started reading about people's experiences posted online. I learned an extraordinary amount about this substance just from reading, and I'd recommend that everyone thinking about trying this or any other substance do the same. For starters, I realized I needed to get a scale, and I actually found a pretty descent one; accurate down to 10mg. <br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: For substances active at such a small dose, scales accurate to 10 mg are insufficient measuring devices. See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">related article</a>]</font><br><br>
The other extremely valuable thing I learned from reading experiences with 2C-I is this drug has a tendency to sneak up, and even though I may think I need more, I don't.  Now to the actual trip report.<br><br>
My package arrived via express mail early in the afternoon, and as luck would have it, my scale was to be delivered later that same day. I hurried excitedly to my room, shut the door, and ripped open the envelope. There it was, my own little bag, clearly labeled 2C-I, 100mg. Upon close inspection of the bag I noticed the off white colored flakes looked crystalline in appearance and tended to clump together. I compared my little baggie of dust to pictures posted online, and I decided this was 2C-I. <br><br>
At this point I'm getting excited, and I can't wait for my scale to get here. I was alone for the day, and after much deliberation that week I decided to try 10mg, a small dose, and see what it does. But I wanted to be safe, so I waited for my scale to arrive.<br><br>
After smoking a couple bowls I grew tired of waiting. I knew I could eyeball a safe amount if this was indeed 100mg, but I was a little scared after reading about one person's experience in which he got double what he ordered. Fuck it, I can't wait anymore, it's now three in the afternoon, and I don't want to be up all night because I have to work the next morning. <br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">related article</a>]</font><br><br>
I dump out the bag, and pretend I have 100mg, even though a little was stuck to the inside of the bag. I carefully split this pile in half. I then split one of the piles in half, and then in half again. If I was exact, I would have exactly 12.5mg, but in reality, it was closer to 9 or 10. I took this small amount and put it under my tongue. It tasted the way I expected, slightly bitter, but easy to handle. I let it dissolve, and then washed it down with water. Now I wait.<br><br>
I already knew that this drug could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours to kick in. It was 3:15 when I took the stuff. I smoked another bowl, and realized I should prepare myself for the trip I'm about to take so I dimmed the lights, put on some nice ambient trance, and just meditated for a few minutes. I've always known of the importance of being in a positive frame of mind before I do psychedelics, and I wasn't about to take any chances with this drug. I wasn't quite sure of where this trip would take me, but I was definitely prepared. <br><br>
Calm, yet excited, I was already feeling good from the weed. I noticed it slowly start to change my perceptions about fifteen minutes after swallowing, and by 4:00 I already had an idea of where this trip was heading. It starts subtle, I have a black subwoofer that started to shift suddenly to shades of gray, then back to black, and the body load at this point was also already noticeable. But the effects are light and pleasant and very easy to handle. I'm enjoying myself so I smoke another bowl. <br><br>
By 5:00 I feel like I'm feeling the full effects and I start to wonder how much I've taken. The body load and visuals are getting intense, but despite a little confusion I still feel pretty much together mentally. The visuals at this point are amazing. Full CEV's and OEV's. Beautiful patterns crawling all over everything. Things seem distorted, then suddenly come back to normal. This drug has an amazing effect on shadows, and light, my mind was creating a vast array of objects out of the shapes of shadows. <br><br>
Also, I can't leave this out, this drug makes sex amazing. Granted, my experiences were autoerotic, but it doesn't change the fact that it was comparable to MDMA in the sex department. And I have had sex on MDMA. One thing to note about that, I've only ever cum once one MDMA, I had no trouble cumming on 2C-I. And trust me, it was sweet. Moving on.<br><br>
It's now 6:00 and I'm wondering where the fuck my scale is. It's safe to say I'm tripping balls at this point, but I still feel more in control than on acid, and less in heaven than on MDMA. I'm also feeling a little speedy, but I expect this from my past experience with psychedelics. I remember having some deep introspective thoughts at this point as well, which I wont get into, but they were perfectly rational and insightful.<br><br>
Similar to acid this drug offers the whole range of emotions while my mind is in its grasp. Its effects come at me in waves, building to a point that will make me feel lost, then suddenly dropping me, and making me feel normal again. The body load and overall experience was almost overwhelming at the peak which was a little after 7:00. This is ironically the same time my scale arrived. I had a little trouble signing for it, and I knew it did me no good that night, but I was still glad I got it, because I can definitely use it for other things. I had fun playing with it for a little while, and figured out I had done a decent job measuring out my dose. Yes, I could operate, and read the scale. I was fucked up, but I had taken a small dose, and while it was more difficult than normal to operate this small device, I still found myself more than capable.<br><br>
By 8:00 I feel like Im starting to come down. The waves are still tossing me about but not as strongly at this point. The visuals are still amazing. This is when I take my muscle relaxant, for back pain due to a car accident, I take a vicadin, and I smoke another bowl. I lay in bed listening to music, and watching the ceiling dance with colors and abstract shapes. I could do without the body load though. Thats really my only complaint with this drug, it can make me uncomfortable, luckily I was able to handle it by meditating a little, and by 9:00 I was in heaven.<br><br>
Im not sure if it was the muscle relaxant, or if its normal for the come down for this drug, but I remember thinking this was better than the ride up. The body load had turned into a pleasant tingle, and the visuals were absurd. I was also feeling very at peace and honest, and again, very introspective. I sat in my chair and smoked bowls for almost two hours, enjoying the hell out of this new experience. <br><br>
About 11:00 I popped another vicadin, and got in bed. One of the last things I remember before falling asleep was watching the sky change color outside my window. I remember realizing this was caused by the shifting patterns of the winamp visual I had running, but it was still amazing, none the less. <br><br>
All in all this was a gratifying experience, with a very nice come down, and I plan on experimenting with this RC a little more. I was thinking about insufflating 1mg, and seeing what it does. I might also smoke a tiny amount, but I havent yet decided if I will buy more after this 100mg is gone. Im leaning towards no because I like to experiment, not get addicted. <br><br>
In parting, if youve taken the time to read this, thank you. I always treat 2C-I, and all other psychedelics with respect. This is a powerful chemical. I took a small dose and had a pretty intense trip. I feel sorry for the poor bastards who order 100mg online and take the whole thing because they think its not working or theyre just fucking stupid. Be smart, and be safe.<!-- End Body -->
