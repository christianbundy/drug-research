Ethylphenidate<br>
Dosage: repeated<br><br>
Method of ingestion: oral/insufflated<br><br>
Experienced with a various array of drugs including: Adderall, Amphetamines, Cannabis/cannabinoids (JWH-018,122,UR-144), LSD, MDMA, Methylone (BK-MDMA), 4-MEC (4-methylethcathinone), Opiates (Oxy/Hydrocodone). Other things I cant remember.<br><br>
Im in good health and keep a good exercise routine. However, the night before Id only slept about 2 hrs and then woke up early to finish a paper  which ended up getting done!<br><br>
Setting was at a club, with a well known EDM DJ playing. Was feeling a little tired from not sleeping much the night before, but overall in a good mood. Smoked some UR-144 (a favorite synthetic cannabinoid, highly recommended :] ) on the way down. This is recalling from memory a few days ago, to the best of my ability.<br><br><br>
T 0:00  UR-144 smoked, just a little providing a relaxing effect<br><br>
T +1:00  after arriving, settled in, smoked a little more UR on some cigs, still a good time<br><br>
T +1:30  insufflated 20 mgs, I had heard it could take a little while to kick in, so I sat back and let it happen.<br><br>
T +1:45  WOW  ecstasy like euphoria, increasing. Very much like a light dose of MDMA, but lacking empathy  very euphoric. A def +,<br><br>
T +2:15  insufflated another 20 mgs, euphoria still very present, good feelings, VERY MDMA like in euphoria, very fun. ++! Massages are great. Getting awesome light shows  crazy good time!<br><br>
T +2:45  Feelin GREAT  wishing I could tell people how great I feel. A song comes on that reminds me of a good time at a past music festival, want to cry tears of pure joy :D. +++. UR cigs smoked throughout, a highly recommended blend.<br><br>
T +3:05  Last 20 mgs insufflated<br><br>
T +3:10  UR dipped cig smoked, helps kick it in better!!!!<br><br>
T +3:30  WAVES of euphoria, still kicking.<br><br>
T +4:00  Much more stimulated than euphoric now, still glowing though :D. <br><br>
T +4:30  Concert over  a GREAT show. A personal favorite artist of mine though, so naturally everything went well. <br><br>
T +5:30  still after-glowing, needed food. I have a rather fast metabolism, so I require food when on stimulant drugs. Feeling WAY way better after eating, stimulated, still operating at a +ish level. Still feelin good.<br><br>
T +6:30  Car ride home, still feelin good, desire to do more is present, so another 20 mgs is orally consumed, along with another 10-15mgs insufflated. At this point, two friends of mine, Friend A and B = who were rolling on molly decided to ingest some as well. <br><br>
Friend A had beautiful moon-rocks straight from the source, and after she ingested some Ethylphen intranasally - ~15mgs, started rerolling  feeling very good. Talking about how much she loves life.<br><br>
Friend B had some pretty decent molly, and after ingesting a 20mg cap, and 10mgs intranasally, stated he felt very good  and was surprised to the extent at which the EP was effecting him (He was feeling good at 160 mgs of Adderall in a past experience). Discuss how it can be used as replacement molly  and how I looked as if I was rolling harder than he was, and he was on real molly.<br><br>
T +8:00  Feeling way more stimulated than euphoric now, needed to study for a test. Oops, big mistake. Too cracked-out-silly feeling.<br><br>
T +9:00  Stimulation still very present, my eyes are blurring intensely! If I try to focus on anything  like my studying, eyes blur up real fast. Very annoying, Friend Bs face is blurred. Friend A does some special K, gets some crazy CEVs; she tries sleeping, and cant. Friend B is still very up +.<br><br>
T +10:00  Attempt at studying for my test fails miserably. Too hard to see computer screen to resume notes. Still feeling rather euphoric, but mostly stimulated. A calm stimulation is what I would call it. Yes. (Similar to how Im feeling now, recounting this several days later on a similar dosage of EP). <br><br>
T +14:00  Test likely failed miserably, smoked a UR-144 cig to calm down any anxieties present with the slight come down.<br><br>
T +18:00  Still stimmed up, cant really sleep, decide to go out to a party drinking. Break open another with Friend B around T +28:00. Bike riding around late at night, a fun time. Climbed a 30 foot tree.<br><br>
T +30:00 Get home, riding out the feelings for another few hours.<br><br>
T +40:00  Details of what happened here are fuzzy, just remember falling asleep sometime soon-after.<br><br>
Overall review:<br><br>
A fun drug. Definitely has party potential  especially the initial hits  very euphoric; almost just like rolling. Coulda been passed this off as bunk molly in the past actually; thinking about it. However, it had a very distinct appearance. White clumpy powder; very clumpy when grinding to snort as well, had to keep cutting it up a bunch of times.<br><br>
Dosing past 60 mgs for me was way more speedy/amphetamine-like. Also, after oral dosing, followed by intranasal dosing, the blurred vision got to be rather intense! Too intense at some points; I could barely look straight ahead without my vision fuzzing. But if I looked side to side or more rapidly, I could focus. Furthermore, I had zero libido on this stuff. No sex drive whatsoever.<br><br>
Overall, substance gets an 8/10 in my books. Definitely fun. Tiny hangover... nothing compared to other stimulants, easily cured by some cannabis or synthetic noids :).<!-- End Body -->
