 "report": "</p>\nI've taken E on antibiotics, admittedly towards the end of course, with few problems except the usual morning afters.</p><p>Ditto asthma. I'm asthmatic, and often use ventolin [Albuterol] while flying. It hasn't been a problem. Something the rush can seem quite intense, and the increased heart rate is reminiscent of some exercise-related asthma attacks I've had, but I don't experience any tightness of breathing. In fact, when on E I find that I need to rely on my inhaler less than I would (considering I'm dancing my lille feet off).</p><p>American man</p>"
