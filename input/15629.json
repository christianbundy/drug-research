 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI first thought of using the poppy seeds after learning that LSA could be extracted from morning glory seeds.  I figured I could probably do the same with poppy seeds. It took me a while to find a place that I could buy enough seeds, but finally I did.  I have tried it many times since then.\r\nI made the tea by putting 420 grams of poppy seeds into a container and adding some concentrated lemon juice (just enough so that it is like a thick soup).  Then every five minutes mix the seeds around in the juice.  After 15+ minutes, I can filter out the seeds and drink the juice.  I usually mix the lemon juice with lots of sugar.  It tastes just like lemonade with some funky after-taste.\r\nThe tea begins in about 10 minutes and for the next 10 hours it slowly increases more and more to a climax.  During the tea's climax I can barely move and am in an extremely euphoric state of mind.  It is one of my favorite experiences, out of everything I have tried, including acid (however nothing beats acid, especially my first mind-expanding experience).  \r\nEven though Opium is declared as very addictive, I have not felt addicted yet.  I do know what addiction feels like because I used to dip with smokeless tobacco.  But, I quit that.  Be careful cause becoming addicted could seriously fuck up your life.\n\n\n"
