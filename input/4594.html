I've had a total of four ecstasy experiences. Three of those consisted of single doses. The other included five doses in a period of three days. The first experience was followed by at least two days of pure bliss. I floated through life, and everything was simply okay the way it was. A particularly enjoyable aftereffect was a day of involuntary gaping. Whenever I let myself get relaxed, I found my jaw hanging open. It felt really good. My three day jag was an unusually endurable journey through a rollercoaster ride of more bliss punctuated by increasing degrees of physical discomfort, lasting just over a week. The painful stages were accompanied by a solid faith in the concept that it was all for a reason and would result in profound spiritual growth. I did a lot of writing during the high, and as the time between me and my ecstasy experiences grows, the profundity of those writings fades from my intellect. However, I know that the magic remains within those words, whether to be experienced again through drugs or natural enlightenment. <br><br>
Each ecstasy experience has been profoundly different, yet they all share similar aspects. In the last, I enjoyed pleasant visuals when I closed my eyes. I saw spirals of simple objects, such as trees, crosses, stars, etc. In the second experience, I got a kick out of eye jiggles whenever I wrote. All four times, I had no desire to eat. I tried, out of curiosity, but the sensation of taste proved to be a distraction I rushed to leave behind. In three of the trips I spent some time outside, and I got a real understanding of becoming one with nature. The last time with ecstasy, my world became a finite, linear group of solvable dilemmas. <br><br>
My limited experience with ecstasy has been profoundly positive. If I never experience ecstasy again, I'll forever be grateful for the times we shared. My doses came from two different suppliers, in the forms of powder and tablets. I always took one dose at a time. For the five-dose journey, I took two doses eight hours apart in one day, took a day off, and took three doses four hours apart on the third day. It was simply a compulsive indulgence. My body paid for the following week, but I don't think I've sustained any permanent effects. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend the experience. It was unnecessarily risky. I spent many hours wondering if I had permanently impaired myself in some way. I experienced mild nausea, headaches, and extreme shakiness. It's one of those things I'm glad I did, but I probably wouldn't do it over in hindsight...unlike skydiving.<!-- End Body -->
