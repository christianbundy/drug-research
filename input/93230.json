 "report": "<p>As soon as I dozed off, I vividly dreamed I was chased by a by a tribe of rainforest indians who wanted to sacrifice me to their holy plant :| Hahahaha Ok, I knew I was dreaming, yet it was hard to take control or wake up. After I did wake up and went fer a pee, I fell asleep again only to have more dreams I can recall reasonably good. Somewhat humourous the first and most prevalent dream was, I guess I have to assume that the Calea zacatechichi works quite well vaporized, right before going to bed. Especially considering the dose is about 10 times smaller than the dose to make an extremely bitter tea would have to be. The vapors also tasted bitter, but were more pleasant than the tea. </p><p>[Reported Dose: '2 VaporGenie bowls of dried herb approx 300mg']</p>"
