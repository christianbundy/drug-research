Alright so it was the summer of '05 and I had alot of cash and alot of time on my hands so I figured I would eat a bunch of shrooms one saturday. This was the third time I would be doing them and I wanted to experience a new level of 'tripping.' <br>
I bought a quad (7 g's) of golden caps and weighed out about 5.8 to 6 grams to myself. I gave the rest to my friend who was dogging me with those puppy eyes. After doing so I got a phone call from my dad telling me I had to come home this instant (I'm 17).<br><br>
Leaving the shrooms on the scale at my friend's house I went home and got in one of the worst fights with my dad. In a state of fury I stormed back to my friends house and I ate all of the shrooms without second thought. After that we started playing some Halo2 (fuck yeah). I remember I started tripping after about 30-40 minutes. Feeling good, we turned on some Static X. The last thing I remember is talking about how we should go to the forest reserve nearby to trip out on some lakes and trees and stuff. This was around noon on a sunny Saturday. <br><br>
The next thing I know I wake up on my friend's couch. My body is soaked in something. My socks are off and my feet are covered in blood. I have random cuts and bruises are beginning to swell up in the most weird places. I was alone in the house but I knew that was ok because that was the Saturday the Stones came into town and my friend had tickets. I look at the clock and it says 6 pm. Shit, what a complete waste of shrooms.<br><br>
The following is my friend and his roomate's description of what happened between noon and 6pm of that day:<br><br>
So we got to the forest reserve and you and I were both tripping. Dustin (the roommate) was with us and we were walking and all the sudden u dropped on the ground. You kept passing out and waking back up. You were sweating like a pig so we figured u were just dehydrated and hot. So we literally dragged you back to the car which was horrible because people were looking and I thought you were going to die, man. On the car ride back home you kept passing out and waking up. We tried to calm you down because once you were awake you would freak out and try to jump out of the car and stuff.<br><br>
You passed out again and we dragged you back to the house. We were certain that we were going to get arrested or something because this was in broad daylight. Once we got to the house you were okay for a while, but you definetly were not conscious. Sometimes you would roll around the carpet as if you were having a seizure or something, and for a while you were just jumping around the house, kicking shit around and knocking stuff off. You would yell stupid shit like 'WOAH!' or  'OH MY GOD!!' You did this for a couple hours and then you just passed out for good. Then we left for the show, but called Pat (good friend and neighbor) to check up on you once in a while.<br><br>
When I heard this the next day I was in shock, mainly because I don't remember any of this. But each event or thing that they described was somewhat related to the fucked up dreams I had while I was passed out. I had a dream where I thought I was living life in slow motion and sometimes in rewind, which explains the walking backwards and rolling around on the carpet.<br><br>
I had a dream I was the first person to try this new drug which would give you the craziest high and the craziest trip, but at the end your brain would inevitably fail and you would die at the end of your trip. I had more dreams but now I don't remember. It's one of those things, you know??<br><br>
I'm a little embarrassed with those story but to this day I have no idea what the fuck happened there. I think that a combination of a negative mental state, a pretty large quantity of shrooms, and eating them on a totally empty stomach caused my body to reject the shrooms and my body shut down?? I'm not sure, but this has never happened before or after.<!-- End Body -->
