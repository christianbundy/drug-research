 "report": "</p>\nI am a 21 year old healthy, physically active male.</p><p>I have recently been using E in a very meditative fashion, usually sitting outside and sensing EVERYTHING in my surroundings. This practice has caused real physical effects which I had attributed to sensory overload. My heart starts racing and sometimes my hands and feet go a bit numb. This is NOT a reaction to MDMA per se: if I just use it normally, no effects.</p><p>After one such experience I couldn't 'shut off' my mind and for the next few weeks I experienced: Increased blood pressure, Some heart palpitation, numbness in the hands and feet, A continuous feeling that I was still on E and A feeling of 'Energy' and 'Light' flowing through my body.</p><p>I even had a CAT scan which turned up no abnormalities... this was serious.</p><p>Then, recently I noticed that now I can feel a distinct force between my fingers when I hold my hands together - almost magnetic or electrical - and when I visualize this energy I can make it grow to where I can feel a REAL ball of energy between my hands. With intense meditation, it gets to the point that i cannot even close my hands together.</p><p>A few weeks ago I would have thought someone a bit wacky who was reporting such effects, but now after reading G. Krishnas books, and accounts on K awakenings I cannot help but put credence into the idea that there is some little known real force in man that can be activated by meditation or, more easily, by MDMA use.</p>"
