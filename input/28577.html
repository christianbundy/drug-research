This is my experience with Datura...It is defeantly not a pleasent one. In one in which i will turn you away from using this drug. It all started one day when my friend Jon moved back from Las Vegas with a trash bag full of this stuff. The fruit or what ever you would call it, was the size of a baseball. We didn't really know what part of the plant would be the most affective in making the utterly disgusting tea,so we split open the fruit and seeds and boiled it ALL. My mom wittnessed the whole process and said we were stupid. <br><br>
After ten minutes we poured the tea into a 42 oz. cup, we split it in half. We sat down on the couch with no idea what this tea was about to do to us. (11:30 p.m) 15 minutes after drinking the tea we began to feel very drunk and my guitar sounded very unusual. Jon started laughing uncontrolably and kept insisting that he need to take a piss. When i told him to take a piss, he pissed on my bathroom floor i then realized i had gotten myself into something i wouldn't want anybody else to experience *EVER*!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
After about TWO HOURS of watching Jon drink out of imaginary drinking fountain, picking peach pits off the ground and gluing my car keys to the wall with my mom's nail glue that he had found.(4:00 a.m) I woke my grandma up, crawling to her bed military style. I told her that we had drank some tea and Jon is hallucinating and we need to take him home. We drove 50 Miles and the whole time Jon was trying to jump out of the car. He had removed the head rests from the seats and tried to throw them out the window.<br><br>
For some reason or another I wasn't as fucked up as Jon, but that was soon to change. When we arrived, I could not explain to my grandmother where he lived. We turned around and headed back to my granmother's house. On the way we dropped Jon off at a friends house because my grandmother could NOT handle us both at the same time. (6:00 a.m) This is about the time i could not distinguish my imaginary friends from real people. I began to talk to people that weren't there the entire following day. The fact that they would talk to me for 5 minutes and then dissapear was not unusual for me. I sat on my bed for hours when i finally got up, i asked my grandmother how long i had been sleeping???? She told me i had been sitting on my bed staring at the wall for several hours. <br><br>
Meanwhile Jon had escaped. He went to the neighbors house, walked in and turned their T.V. on and began to dance. The cops arrived...They asked him what his name was. He said 'Jon' They proceeded to ask questions...'Where do you live?' His response 'Everywhere.' By that time my friend had begged the police to let him go and not press the issue. The police told my friend if they ever saw him in town again he would be 'ARRESTED' for sure. If your cup of tea is to: black out for several hours, hang out with your imaginary friends for 2 days, your pupils dialated for 3 days...very painful...i still suggest NEVER TO DRINK OR EAT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THIS PLANT....YOUR IMAGINARY FRIENDS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE NICE..... but i must say the most interesting thing about my experience was the fact that the people i was seeing and dissapearing was not unusual to me whatsoever. If you have any questions feel free to email me and i can explain it in more detail....<!-- End Body -->
