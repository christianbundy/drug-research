 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to use them in my experiance is to start with 5 each time I get a batch (lowest level I find can be effective from MOST batches) to get a feel for the potency of said batch.<br>I have a very unique way of preparing them also.<br>1- get all the fuzz off of the outside of the seeds.<br>2- grind the seeds to a fine powder<br>3- spit on the seeds and let them sit for about 5 minutes<br>4- take the mush and put it on about 8 oz. of gatorade<br>5- stir and let the gatorade sit for about 45 min to an hour<br>The drink can be allowed to macerate overnight for better effect<br>6- use cheesecloth to filter the seed mush (which it will be by this point, and coffee filters clog up too easy)<br>7- Drink the liquid and enjoy!!<br>This method allows me to feel the effects very quickly, instead of the 1 hour minimum wait I experianced with all other preperations I tried. Effects within 30 mins most times.<br>Also, I find a quick bike ride or walk while waiting for the effects will greatly ease the leg cramps that are unavoidable with this substance. The saliva begins to break down the seed mush and allows for a much more effective extraction, as does the acidity of the gatorade.\n\n\n"
