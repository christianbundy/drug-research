Prior to taking the drug, I only drank water and had a small BBQ sandwich for breakfast. <br><br>
11:55pm  One complexed blotter, said to be 600ug is placed between my upper lip and gum, and held there for the next hour. The blotter produced a very slight tingly sting, an almost numbing sensation against my lip. I tried to swallow as little spit as possible although it probably wouldn't of made a difference if I hadn't.<br><br>
12:10pm  I feel very relaxed. I just want to close my eyes and drift off into a dream.  Visually, things seem more open. I mostly feel really calm and relaxed. I feel like Im mediating.<br><br>
12:15pm  It seems like I can make out sound around the house very clearly and separately. It is almost eerie.  Usually everything sounds like a jumbled clutter but now everything sounds separate and clear.<br><br>
12:20pm  Im feeling a bit more anxious but pretty much the same as before. Sounds seem to invoke more sensual and emotional feelings than normal.<br><br>
12:30pm  Things are starting to change visually. My depth perception is a tad off. Objects at a distance appear smaller of course, but it seems like I'm actually interpreting them as being small. Things appear to have a natural morphing effect to them. There is also a thin aura around objects in direct light. My palms are sweaty and I feel a kind of heaviness throughout my body.<br><br>
1:30pm  I feel very clear headed, happy, relaxed and yet stimulated at the same time. My body feels great all around. Im laughing and just enjoying myself. I have to focus on things for a few seconds to get them to morph and what not. Music sounds much more enjoyable. Its easy to focus on each individual instrument playing and take in the whole song one note at a time.  Music has a quality to it that I have not experienced since the last time I took MDMA. Going outside is also very pleasing to the senses.<br><br>
3:00  Music still sounds better, not the same as before but still has something more to it.<br><br>
By 4:00 the psychedelic effects had completely worn off. I was still feeling weird, but everything was pretty much normal. When biting down my teeth felt very sensitive. Also my nose and throat felt overly sensitive, slightly cold and dry like I had been breathing in front of an a/c window unit all day.<br><br>
By 7:30 I was feeling completely normal both physically and mentally. The drug gave a nice afterglow rather than a hangover.<br><br>
Overall the trip was slightly visual but had a huge effect on the quality of sounds and music. Im sure if I would have taken more than one blotter the trip would have been more visually intense and would have lasted longer but I really have nothing to complain about, the trip was great.  <br><br>
IMPORTANT:<br><br>
Later in the night, around 8:30 I got a headache (most likely a caffeine headache from not drinking any coffee or soda in the past two days). I took two ibuprofen like usual. After about 15 minutes I suddenly started to feel very uncomfortable, anxious, dizzy, and nauseous. Also my palms and the bottom of my feet became very sweaty. This lasted around 3 hours. Im thinking the ibuprofen had an interaction with the drug possibly causing vasoconstriction. I will not be inclined to take Ibuprofen or any other drug of that sort during or after I take 25C-NBOMe.<!-- End Body -->
