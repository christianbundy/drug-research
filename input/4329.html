I read all the experience reports here and other places and decided I'd like to try this legal drug. So I ordered the 5x. I first loaded my pipe with about .05 grams and inhaled the smoke in two hits. I felt a little dizziness and just a general weirdness. I figured I hadn't held in the smoke long enough. <br><br>
So about 1 hour later I tried again with .08 grams or so. I smoked the first hit and held it for about 30 seconds then the second for about 20. As I exhaled I suddenly found myself standing up. It felt as though I was being forced backwards but I was stuck. It was almost like I lost the third dimension for a while and was stuck on a plane. This is a terrible feeling and I feared that I would be stuck like this. I tried to move, but I could not, then I remembered that I had just done a drug. So I forced myself to move. I then looked towards my two buddies and tried to stop them from smoking any. I never wanted that experience again. I realized that it was light that was pushing me, and the light bouncing off my friends bodies was smashing into me. The stereo was playing Start Me Up and singing about 'you make an old man cry' and I suddenly thought 'I'm the old man' and I blurted it out. It was as though I was trying to remember who I was. I was glad it was short lived because I was shocked by the power of this drug. I smoked once more later in the night and had a much better trip but still the feeling of being smashed.<br><br>
I think salvia is a great introspective drug. But be prepared for the possibility of a strange smashing feeling. It is quite different from any other drug I've ever experienced.<!-- End Body -->
