 "report": "<p>When I made this mistake I fell into a hole, became non-responsive to my family's pleas to unlock my door and had the cops called to rescue me.  But when they came I thought they were soldiers from the evil queen's army come to slaughter me and I fought them like an animal until they finally beat me down and cuffed me.  That's when the seizure occurred.  </p><p>It can only be described as hell on earth as my body convulsed uncontrollably and I screamed non-sense and the paramedics and EMT's trying to help me while I lay handcuffed to a stretcher.  They repeatedly shot me up with Haldol but nothing worked for an hour or so until my body finally shut down, thank god not permanently.  </p><p>I spent 3 days unconscious in the ICU.</p>"
