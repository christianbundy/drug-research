Upon noticing a vinpocetine product advertised in a magasine, I decided to try it out. <br><br>
I began by taking a 10mg dose every morning. After two weeks I stepped up to a divided 20mg dose. After a month the dose was stepped down to 10mg again, and this is what I have been taking for the last two months now. The 'attack' dosing was neccesary to achieve fuller effects within a smaller timescale. <br><br>
Subjective effects difficult to detect, but I notice an increased ability to recall specific facts and details. Clarity of thought and awareness may have been boosted, but it is difficult to say, having been using the drug for such a long period. On two occaisions I took 30mg at once: this caused a definite high and buzz similar to methylphenidate. Vinpocetine seems to be effective, but I have no way of telling if this is indeed the case, or if I am in fact suffering placebo. If there are indeed effects from my course they are subtle; making them largely unnoticable, especially in the long term.<br><br>
I intend to continue the course, despite a lack of definite benefits. Vinpocetine is inexpensive and I feel that in the end placebo is better than nothing, so it can only be doing good.<!-- End Body -->
