To whom it may concern:<br><br>
Unlike many other experiences that I have read, I will try to write this with as much neutrality as I can.  For the past 2 months I have been ingesting at least 4 seeds worth of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose (henceforth HBWR) everyday and up to 8 seeds (rarely).  My experience has been as follows:<br><br>
Weeks 1 and 2:<br><br>
Same as usual HBWR experiences: enchanted moments, time dilation, random (extremely clear) thoughts, excessive chattering (aloud and otherwise).  I was eating the seeds directly which causes serious digestive problems if one gets carried away (which I did).  For the most part I was able to ignore these problems for at least the first 2 weeks.  I am currently studying the Chinese language and I did notice that I was able to focus on memorizing characters while I was under the influence of the seeds.  So not much interesting going on these weeks.<br><br>
Weeks 3 and 4:<br><br>
I've come to the point where I can no longer remember 'ordinary' reality.  The very admission of this sends twinges of the flashback persuasion up my spine.  I have had countless encounters with nature that I can only describe as surreal.  I will list those that I can remember (this was a month ago) below:<br><br>
1. The Squirrel Council:<br><br>
I was wandering through the courtyard of my school after downing an ethanol extraction from HBWR seeds raw (its in the dictionary under supernasty) and suddenly the flow of time nearly stopped.  That is to say, that my perception of time changed as to make it appear as if time had stopped (very important).  I stumbled upon three squirrels locked in some sort of 'wisemen's council'.  Allow me to explain:  they were standing on the vertices of what looked (from my angle) like an equilateral triangle staring at each other completely still.  So still that I almost didn't see them standing on the middle of the sidewalk.<br><br>
2. Man vs. Squirrel<br><br>
Don't ask me why the squirrel motif, I am only reporting.  Here comes squirrel story number 2.  I was walking up to class after drinking a straight up water exract of HBWR chased with orange juice and I noticed a squirrel burying some nuts.  I took note that the squirrel took many precautions in concealing the location of his precious nuts, though my mother tells me that he forgets where they are half the time anyway.  I spent a lot of time thinking about this experience and a few days later I saw another squirrel, or perhaps the same one, they all look the same to me, just finishing up burying his (or her) nuts.<br><br>
This time, I waited till he began to walk away and then I snuck over to the spot where he buried them and pretended like I was digging them up.  When I looked over to see his/her reaction, the thing was standing on its hind legs flailing its front legs around in the air, clearly agitated by what I was doing, and making this absurd squeaking noise, similar to a squirrel calling another squirrel but more intense I guess is the word.  After a few moments of that I began to walk away only to be followed for a good long way by the squirrel who I can only assume was spying to see where I planted his/her nuts.  This may not sound like much of a story but think about the contents of it and you just may realize what it means.<br><br>
Okay, let's skip to last week, that's when things get interesting:<br><br>
My botanicals supplier sends me some Cebil seeds (Anadenanthera Colubrina, I hope that's the correct spelling) because I ordered so many damn HBWR seeds I guess.  By this time my small intestine probably looks like some sort of putrid rancid swiss cheese and I haven't had a normal bowel movement (aka 'shit') in weeks.  Every time I sit on the can it's either this green baby shit or a full on ass-plosion.  If you're still reading, I apologize but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't tell you the truth.  <br><br>
Anyway, so immediately when I got the Cebil seeds I started grinding them up and smoking them.  This was all while I was under the influence of the HBWR seeds.  Smoking any sort of seeds is generally a bad idea but I don't have that many of these and don't plan to buy any (sorry botanical supplier!) so I thought it would be ok.  The first time I smoked the seeds here's what happened:<br><br>
The Eye of God Burns the Mountain:<br><br>
I just finished my last 'hit' of the seed smoke.  I looked into the sky.  In incredible detail there was an eye formed in the clouds with light (sunlight) pouring out of it.  I began fearing for my life as this situation seemed similar to what happens in movies when someone dies and the heavens open up and receive them.  It didn't take me long to figure out that if I were dying, heaven would NOT be receiving me (if indeed god is 'the good guy').  I took comfort in that fact but I found a new fear welling up inside me.  What if this eye was looking for me?  In retrospect, this may have been some sort of psychotic episode because the fear was all too real and staggering not like normal LSD or mushrooms 'bad trip fear' which I have also experienced and been able to shrug off pretty easily.  Oh yeah, the Cebil dose was light, only 2 seeds smoked, but I think it was the combination of Cebil with HBWR that pushed me to the limit.<br><br>
Finally, we come to the present. I have regrettably picked up smoking cigarettes again, after quitting for 8 months, which I think is largely due to the Cebil addition to my repertoire.  I have almost finished with my last batch of HBWR which I have been aching to rid myself of ever since I had a stabbing pain in my gut which I am certain is a result of the badness contained therein.<br><br>
As you've probably noticed (if you are still reading) that my daily dose was extremely low compared to what most people would consider a 'decent acid trip'.  This was deliberate because I was doing this while running a normal life and not really letting anyone know (except my closest friends) what I was doing.  I leave you with this,<br><br>
quest not for knowledge,<br>
quest not for wisdom,<br>
but quest for the annihilation of self,<br>
because that's all you're going to get!<!-- End Body -->
