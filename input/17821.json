 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nYesterday night I ingested 8 ozs of robotussin. I came home, and my parents were extremaly worried becuase of my slurred speach and incoherance. So they took me to the emergency room. In the emergency room I was givin a urinalysis, which came up positive for OPIATES!!!!!\r\nI raised hell. I never used opiates, and am a recovering mental marijuana addict, who is currently in rehab so don't smoke. I raised hell and was givin a blood anylsis, which is still pending, these results were extremaly devastating to me. In fact I could be put in in-patient rehab. My parents think I am a heroin user now.\n\n\n"
