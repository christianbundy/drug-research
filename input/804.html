I, too, had been taking 1,4-Butanediol several times a day for close to two years, and binges on weekends. When I finally decided to quit, I experienced the shakes, sweaty palms, anxiety. Xanax helped that. Also, my sleep has been awful since I quit - I have to drink wine and take some antihistimine sleep aids in order to fall asleep, and then don't sleep very deeply.<br><br>
I usually smoke cigarettes at night, and would take the 1,4-Butanediol at night as well - even after a week, when I light up my first smoke I get the shakes.<br><br>
I'm very tempted to get some more, and am using all the old adages that alcoholics use - I've proven that I don't NEED it (I've only had a small amount in the past two weeks), but I still WANT it. And I truly miss the good night's rest - other than waking up and having to take more.<br><br>
We were all told that it had little potential for addiction - take it from me, this drug has a nasty bite to it if you start abusing it.<!-- End Body -->
