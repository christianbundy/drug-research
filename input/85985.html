I've taken 2C-T-7 several times before, so I wasn't expecting anything too crazy. I had been out in the sun all day and it was just a hot day in general. Also my house doesn't have a/c - point being I was very hot once I started tripping. I found myself wandering around my house, sweaty and confused then in a flash of genius I decided going swimming in the lake behind my house would probably make all of my problems go away. Easily one of the best decisions of my life. I felt connected to the earth in a primal way that I cannot put into words. I could feel that my ancestors had evolved in this planet's oceans. I could feel in my cells that I was a product of billions of years of evolution on this planet and how well adapted I am to life here.<!-- End Body -->
