During my freshman year of college, I started experimenting more and more with drugs, for various reasons. I had little experience with the subject matter, that summer I had smoked pot for my first time, which I proceeded to do whenever I got the chance, and previously used to do whippets when at work (we used them to make whipped cream). Anyway, shortly before the end of my first semester, I talked to a my psychologist about going on medication for my ADD again, hoping it would help me study more. He prescribed me a new medication, similar to ritalin, but from my understanding more potent. I went back to school, bottle of pills in hand, and thats where the trouble started.<br><br>
After attempting to research the drug online and finding reports of similar drugs being snorted for a high, yet nothing about this one (it was very new, and just beginning to hit the market), I decided to try it out. After opening the capsule, I discovered the medication was not a powder as I had expected, rather, it was hundreds of tiny balls, each roughly a millimeter round. Being away at school in a dorm, I made my own mortar and pestle out of a shooter glass and a ceramic cereal bowl. After about 15 mins of steady grinding, I poured the powder out and used a notecard to form 2 small lines of the powder, snorted both, and wound up pacing the room back and forth for about 10 minutes talking non-stop about how I wasnt sure if the drug had worked or not. Clearly it had.<br><br>
I did it a few more times at school, and then at home for xmas break. One night comes to mind in which I snorted a copious amount and actually got a nice 15 minute body buzz and felt mentally very warm and content, something I hadn't felt before. I also spent a solid 3 hours typing a memoir of my life, as well as emailing it to my favorite author at the time and asking for an opinion. It was a very interesting experience, to say the least. A few days later I tried it again when my best friend stayed the night to drink. He wound up falling asleep shortly after I snorted about 3 or 4 pills all in about 5 minutes, and a few shots of vodka. I spent literally 9 hours sitting in my boxers, on the floor of my basement with my laptop typing 13 more pages to that same memoir, all based off of my life experiences. I went upstairs at about 10.15 the next morning to shower, and I believe I had a mild case of hypothermia from sitting in my cold basement with no shirt or pants for so long in the same position. <br><br>
One experience comes to mind though, that didnt turn out so well. Back at school one night, with nothing to do, I decided to take a couple bumps of focalin, hoping for that nice warm buzz I had gotten at home. I dont remember how much I took, and I know it wasnt the most Ive taken before, but things took a turn for the worst. After about 10 minutes or so of feeling very wired and energetic, I began to feel a sort of pressure building in my chest. Eventually, I noticed it felt like my chest was being gradually compressed, and breathing was becoming difficult. Somewhat frightened, I started to lay down on my futon, thinking a nap would be nice but knowing due to the nature of the drug sleep would be impossible for several hours. Not only that, but a sudden understanding that if I went to sleep, I would surely die gripped me.<br><br>
Quite shaken up and worried about what was happening, I decided to call my girlfriend, who lived back at home and I was going through some very turbulent times with. I noticed she was online though, and decided to use AIM to talk instead. This whole time I had noticed a severe tension in my body, which made itself terrifyingly apparent when I couldnt get my hands to unclench from the fist they had been forming for the last 10 minutes or so. Typing was impossible. I used so much effort keeping my fingers from retracting that I couldnt hit any of the keys. I tried calling her instead, she knew something was wrong, and called the room phone immediately. I could barely hold the phone in my tight fist, and actually squeezed it out of my hand several times. I clung with my other arm to the top of my loft for support, speaking in quick, breathless outbursts as I struggled to breathe normally. My girlfriend became very afraid of what was happening, and told me to call 911 if it was so bad. I rode it out on the phone with her though, and after about 10 more minutes of talking things got better. My hands loosened up, my chest felt less compressed, and I began to breathe normally again.<br><br>
I used focalin a handful of times after this experience, in much smaller doses. I have since stopped taking it to prevent this from happening again.<!-- End Body -->
