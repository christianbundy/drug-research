 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI took 2 25 mg tabs at 8:30AM.......  By 9:15 I had a pleasant, sedated feeling.  A kind of euphoric side effect as well, but not like the euphoric sensations of an Opioid.\r\nI noticed if I took this at beditme I slept soundly.  But by taking it while wide awake, it produced a more noticable lightheadedness.  Somewhat like a mix between valium & Soma.\r\nThe effects of the Prometh lasted 3-4 hours with no 'come down' effects. Promethazine produced a drowsy feeling\r\nI gave a friend 2 25mg tabs today.  He took them & within 45 minutes, he described a relaxed, sedated, almost like having a drink feeling.\r\nMy drugs of choice are Opioids, & I look for other medications that will produce a similar euphoric feeling. Promethazine comes close.  It will brought about a calm, slower state of being, & causes slight giddiness, & disorienting.\n\n\n"
