I have taken the substance before, but tonight was wuite different. I RAILED four emptied-cut-lined capsules in one sitting. when I stood up my balance was altered, though not impaired. I had a good feel for gravity. aside from that, the rest is all new experience.<br><br>
When I was getting dressed and drying off from my shower, I found that without thinking about it, I began doing it in a dancing and singing manor! who would have thought. well I decided, when I noticed the peculiarity, I should let the spirit in me have its way and well just dance and sing. when I looked at the mirror, I saw a reflection of myself, and without batting an eye began to loudly talk to it. We had a very interesting discussion about the nature of this drug, and how the mirror was very facilitative at letting me talk to my split-self. Talking to myself is nothing new, but doing it in the mirror and on this substance was entirely real. The wood trim in the bathroom however caught my eye, when I saw it's color and shape variations just melting and floating down like falling water. I even found that I could control the flow with my touch. now I sit here. It should be noted that my social mind, the part which controls logic and speach, the parts that I hear and see with, these are all completely normal, and all the strange things beheld on this short trip were just believed and taken to be part of the trip. <br><br>
And at the same time, my mind accepts the strangeness when I can interact with it around me. and one last thing, people and creatures, although I know they are not, seem to be all around me. I have the feeling of being surrounded by life when I am alone. To think of it, this is very much like a dream. The rules that govern my present thoughts could be described only as the same rules that govern dreams.<!-- End Body -->
