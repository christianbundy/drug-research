The following is a recollection of my experiences taking Mirtazapine (Remeron, Avanza..) in conjunction with various recreational drugs. I was prescribed Mirtazapine for depression and anxiety. I never got any benefit from it, though I was doing hard drugs a few times a month and that could have interfered with the treatment. I took Mirtazapine at doses of 15-90mg depending on what stage of treatment I was in. Ive read from various sources that say the maximum dose of mirtazapine was 45mg but my psychiatrist insisted that 90mg would be fine. I will now list the various drug interactions with mirtazapine:<br><br>
Alcohol: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapine<br><br>
Cannabis: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapine<br><br>
LSD: no response at all dosages of mirtazpine, I did not get high at all. Once, when I was not on mirtazapine, I was tripping on Acid and I used mirtazapine to come down. It worked very well; I fell asleep while I was still high which I think is very unusual.<br><br>
Ketamine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapine<br><br>
Dexedrine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapine<br><br>
Cocaine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapine<br><br>
MDMA: Decrease in response during treatment with mirtazapine at dosages of 15-30mg, I had to take more mdma than usual to attain the desired effects. Very little response at 45mg of mirtazapine. No response at doses of mirtazapine above 45mg. <br><br>
I suffered no ill effects from combining mirtazapine with all of the above recreational drugs. I would not recommend that a person with depression use most of these drugs but I did and I respect your right to do so as well if you choose. I hope this information has been helpful.<!-- End Body -->
