The only reason I wanted to try yohimbe was because a couple of nights ago I partied and drank up a lot and I took this girl back to her dorm.<br><br>
We had sex 3 times and to my surprise I couldn't keep an erection up, whether it was because of the alcohol or what not. this had never happened before.<br><br>
I'm a smoker of 2 yrs. as well and they say that smoking makes you impotent. I'm 20 yrs. old and I was thinking that this shit can't be happening to me.<br><br>
So I stumbled upon this website and looked up Yohimbe.<br><br>
I went to [a popular health-food supplement chain] the next day and bought some Yohimbe Active.<br><br>
I tested it on an empty stomach and to my surprise it started working in less than 30 minutes.<br><br>
I started getting really hyper and tingly all around. I started to get cold and my skin became a flushed pink color and my eyes became bloodshot. <br><br>
My mood was more cheery and I wanted to see if my erection would stay up. I watched some porn and I got an incredible erection. It was harder than ever since Yohimbe is supposed to make blood flow more throughout your body. I got a pretty good orgasm from it, but it wasn't super or anything.<!-- End Body -->
