Firstly I would like to say Im 21.<br><br>
When I was 15 I hate a whole medium sized datura stramonium plant with about 15 leaves and 4 apples on it. I had an amazing 3 day hallucinogenic festival all to myself (in hospital, Basically, if you take enough datura to have a hallucinogenic experience, youll end up in hospital or die, your choice its not a rule though.) with absolutely no long lasting side effects except slight stomach upset and quitting cigarettes entirely! (I was a moderate smoker). Even though I thoroughly enjoyed it I never tripped on it again, its not like that. I did use it about 40-50 more times to potentate the effects of opiates and cannabis.<br><br>
One day I was talking to a friend who smoked 3 buscopan tablets powdered up on a cone of weed. Ten minutes later she was tripping very hard yet still remained in a state where she was able to enjoy it. <br><br>
Ive taken ten buscopan tablets before but all I got was a little euphoria, which was possibly just a placebo. For my experiment I took 2 buscopan tablets crushed into a powder and mixed it up with a couple of cones of catnip bud.  I smoked one cone first, then another, and within ten minutes I noticed the familiar hard to swallow, very heavy legs, euphoria,  and then I lied down as I felt a little sick. Inside my head with eyes closed was like I was sitting in a cave (I was really there, this was like a whole separate world) with lots of cavemen mumbling and everything was in shades of purple, like a black and white TV. While sitting in my room I noticed the strings on my guitar oscillating, incense smoke came from everywhere, my drawers would open and purple haze gas would bellow out then the draws would open and shut. There were a lot of spiders in webs throughout the trip, and they and other insects would slowly come towards me and then disappear before they reached my face.<br><br>
All in all it lasted for about 3-4 hours and afterwards I still had rainbow lines over everything. This would come and go, and if I stared at anything it would just keeping morphing into different things continuously. This portion lasted about 6-8 hours and was much like having half a good blotter LSD tab, afterwards I could not read small print for a day or two.<br><br>
All in all Im glad I was told of these tablets.<!-- End Body -->
