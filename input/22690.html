The evening came and I was looking for 'that something extra'.  Having taken the GBL followed immediately by two tokes (1/2 bowl) from the bong I waited for a few minutes for the come up.  Once I was in full flow (about 15 minutes) I inflated the balloon with 2 cannisters of nitrous and settled back in the chair, expecting something different.<br><br>
My previous experiences have shown the GBL to synergise any other substance and expand on its effects, and having had some 'nice' experiences with nitrous and cannabis, I wondered how this one would be tempered.<br><br>
I wasn't ready for what happened next.  Two cannisters are more than I can inhale in one breath, to I took what I could comfortably and sat back.  As I was coming up on the nitrous, I breathed in and out of the balloon with the remainder of the nitrous in it a few times.<br><br>
Suddenly I was transported to another dimension, where the whole concept of reality folded in on itself, all five senses became one, then dissolved, sounds melted, consciousness melted, I was transported to several different instances in the time-line, simultaneously, as different people, there were religio-philosophical implications and much much more as my consciousness raced to keep up with the evolving experience. It could have been an acid trip.  I was gone for hours, but in reality it was unlikely to have been more than a minute or two. A second balloon with two more cannisters took me even further!!<br><br>
This experience, though changing in content has been repeatable on demand with the same combination, and I have tried it on two mates, both of whom are hardened experimenters and both of whom had the most profound and pleasurable experiences with it.<br><br>
I have used shrooms, salvia, hb wood, absynthe, ayahuasca, charlie, GHB, acid, and one or two less desirable, but as yet I haven't found a more enjoyable and profound combination than this!!<!-- End Body -->
