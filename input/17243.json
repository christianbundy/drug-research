 "report": "<p>Last night a few friends and I got together and let each other in on some of the things we've been doing recently. My contribution was a small bottle of Absinthe and some Salvia divinorum. None of the other 3 guys have ever tried these. They had one huge bag of the infamous 'Red Rock Opium'. I had not yet tried 'Red Rock' though I have read the reports on various websites so I already knew it wouldnt have any effect along the lines of real opium however I'm the type that *usually* sticks to the idea of 'I never know until I try' so I was willing to at least give it a shot. (Plus I've not yet heard of any incense-related deaths so what the hell). </p><p>So we settled down around a table and talked and first had a couple of glasses of Absinthe. After that I packed a bowl with some Salvia because one of the guys was really anxious to try it and the others we're all for the idea too so we passed some of that around until it was completely vaporized. All the while the anxious guy was talking about how it would be interesting to find out what it would be like with Red Rock on it. Since we lacked any marijuana at the time we did decide to try splitting some into the Salvia. </p><p>Once it was gone I really didnt notice much of a change (other than the odd taste/feeling of inhaling perfume) due to the fact that Im perfectly used to the Absinthe and Salvia (I usually drink a glass or 2 of Absinthe every day after work so I'm really used to that one..) but after about 5-10 minutes or so I seemed to have a somewhat different feeling, kind of a distant pot buzz with a feeling of being drunk mixed in. I was rather relaxed and everything had a kind of lag in motion, I was moving at regular speed but movements seemed to be slowed down. </p><p>After that our conversations with things that should be mildly funny were totally hilarious for some reason. Reality stayed in check though through the experience there wasnt any lack in concentration like with marijuana and it had absolutely no hallucinogenic effects, but it had a quite unique 'buzz' to it. </p><p>Overall, I would have to agree that Red Rock has no actual drug content and I would not pay for it personally, but I would say that it does in some way have a unique effect to it and its not a placebo effect since I fully knew about it before hand. It was decent enough that I would do it again though, and will since they gave me a couple of rocks free before I left.</p>"
