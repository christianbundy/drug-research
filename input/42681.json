 "report": "<p>I had just finished the MCAT and was in need of some experimenting. I was greeted by two bottles of champaign outside of the test and in short order was rather wasted. The second bottle was finished (with a little help from friends) around 5:15pm. Drinking continued over dinner and until around 8pm.</p><p>I then ran into a friend who had wanted to try kratom, as I had just ordered some online, and we had been waiting to try it.</p><p>I put 1g 'super resin extract' and 2g '2X leaf extract' into 300mL of water and a splash of lemon juice (for good measure, I hear its always better to make things like this acidic) in a double boiler and cooked it until the resin extract disolved, it took some crushing under a spoon.</p><p>I filtered the concoction with a coffee filter, added some honey for flavor, and went off to find my friend.</p><p>He had started drinking and didn't want to take it after drinking (he didn't tell me why, but I knew that drinking all of this would be a high dose, I believe that this is a lot more dangerous than how it turned out, everyone's body is different).</p><p>I ended up drinking almost all of it (not wanting to waste my tea). It didn't taste very bad at all, just like some shitty cheap tea, not too bitter.</p><p>The onset began before I finished drinking it (it took me about 15 minutes to finish). I had continued to drink through all of this, and continued to after the trip began.</p><p>3 dimentions seemed clearer, my hand would glow as I waved it in front of me. I also felt very clear-headed and could very much hold a conversation, probably better than I could sober. I felt very awake as well. I was very interested in conversations with people, and ended up talking until 3am with a friend about everything.</p><p>Sleep was uncomfortable, but I woke up without any sort of hangover (even from the drinking).</p><p>After talking with people about this experience, I realize that it was probably dangerous to try this with alcohol, and I probably wouldn't again as I don't know how strong the resin extract was. I had a very good time and have bought more from the same place, but will not mix it with alcohol again.</p>"
