I was feeling bored one weekend so I decided to try out a pill I had been given a while back. Let me just say now that I had never successfully tripped before this night. I had read reports of hallucinations, and reports that didnt mention it, so I didnt really know what to expect as I ingested 15mg of the strange new drug.<br>
Just as the reports had said, this drug kicks in fast. Within 15 minutes I felt the beginning affects, I expected it to be hard to stay awake, but I felt very little drowsiness.<br><br>
Now that my little experiment was in motion I decided to lay on the love sac (for anyone that doesnt know, its like a giant soft been bag) completely still, to see if I could feel anything different. I did. I knew the affects were starting to strengthen as I started to feel the love sac poke and prod my legs. Then I turned onto my belly and looked at my wooden floor, it was melting away in the direction of the grooves, and also parts would rise and fall. I looked down and a wood right in front of me swelled, so I decided to push on it with my thumb, it went back down. I could actually touch these hallucinations, I could feel my finger sinking into the floor.<br><br>
After a while, I got up and walked to my room to fetch the other 7.5 mg, and I noticed parts of the floor would rise under my feet making it hard to balance. <br>
I eventually returned to the living room and sat down at the computer by the love sac. I looked back, and the love sac was breathing. I turned on the tv, I felt like I was in the same room with all the laughing people. So when they would laugh, even if I wasnt watching the tv, I would laugh too. Next I remember having a crazy grin on my face as I proceeded to break the pill into many different pieces (I dont know why I did this, seemed like a good idea at the time). I then ate the little pieces one at a time for about 3 minutes. <br><br>
I then signed onto instant messenger and typed things to my friends. Crazy things like I hin te flor is tring tu drag he lov sak away. It became even harder to have these conversations as the other 7.5 mg kicked in. For example, as I would type the sentence would get further and further away (sort of like in the beginning of starwars). I found myself with my nose against the screen trying to read what I was typing. Well anyways, my friends must have thought I was out of my mind. 10 minutes later, I was seeing people in my peripheral vision, laughing on cue with the people on tv and pointing at my computer screen, I would laugh too, and nod in agreement to whatever the hell they were pointing at.<br><br>
Looking around the room, I realized every inanimate object was moving, my pants on the floor, my soda can, they all had souls, and did whatever they wanted. I then decided that it was time for a cigarette, so I went outside and lit one up. Looking around, and examining myself, I decided I had most of my mind back. My senses were still crazy though. Then, I looked at my dads truck. It looked like there were people in the car, robbers I presumed, about 10 of them. But I knew in my mind that this must be fake so I walked up and they slowly faded away, except for one which shrunk and I looked it in the eyes (I now think this one was my reflection).<br><br>
After that, I took a step back and looked at the truck and it was moving up and down, like it was on hydraulics, but much slower and much much smoother. I sat staring at the mass of machinery which now had life, this is when I decided that this was definantly a chaotic trip, everything had its own agenda, and there wasnt shit I could do to stop it. I suddenly felt insignificant compared to everything around me. <br><br>
Next thing I know its 3 in the morning, and I can just faintly remember the 4 hour trip, almost everything was back to normal, except the floor and lovesac. <br>
Overall, I enjoyed the experience. But I dont think was wise to ingest a dose over 15 at once my first time. It kicks in so fast, theres enough time to up dose. Good luck.<!-- End Body -->
