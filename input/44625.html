I thought I would write up this experiment as a note on the possible loss of potency in a sample of 4-AcO-MIPT that had been stored in solution, dissolved in everclear, and stored in a mostly airtight glass container, inside of a safe. So, the storage environment was cool and dark. However, after only a few months the sample had turned colors, leaving the sample colored a dark purple to black color. The material was aproximately 1-2 years old at the time of the experiment, depending on how long it was with the supplier prior to being shipped out.<br><br>
After reading from several intelligent folks that the sample should remain safe for ingestion, and probably without loss of potency, I began to wonder if this were the case. So, 15 mgs was added to water and ingested.<br><br>
9:55 am&gt; 15 mg taken orally in water. I've been awake all night already pulling an overnight shift in the booby hatch. I had taken 100mg of ephedrine throughout the course of the night to stay awake, but felt mostly down from the ephedrine by now. <br><br>
10:00 am&gt; I swear I feel a first alert already. My saliva is a bit more copious than normal, which is always one of my alert signals that something psychedelic is happening to me. If I fell asleep I would probably drool all over myself to be honest. I can also already detect something in my cheeks, a sort of energy/muscle activity.<br><br>
10:12 am&gt; Feeling flushed in the face. I remember this from past trials with this chemical in particular. There is a slight buzz in my chest as well, it feels nice, like when I steal a feather pillow away from a loved one's spot in the bed after they have gotten out of bed to go to work when I have off.<br><br>
10:16 am&gt; Facial tension begins to set in, backed by a growing surge of energy felt in my cranium. I feel like something wants to shoot up and out of my spinal cord.<br><br>
10:20 am&gt; smoked resin out of my bowl as I am plumb outta the good green herb. It does the trick though, and I feel a cloud of cohesion begin to form around me and the experience of the chemical. Something about weed that always makes the chemical seem much closer of an experience to me, while without weed the drug always seems to be underlying an empty space from which I can't truly feel it. Weed is truely one of the Gods of the Gaps.<br><br>
10:46 am&gt; Increase in intensity. There is a swelling of energy the continues to mount within me. By this point I feel as if my head is being held in the air by an invisible pair of energy hands, gently cupping my skull at the base behind the ears. It is very relaxing if I can not think of the speedy surging aspect of the rush I am feeling. I feel a slight twinge of pain, probably muscle tightening, in my left arm (which always raises the alert level in my head). My vision is being affected as well. I have a very grainy field of vision, as if everything was made up of tiny hyper vibrational particles that I could actually see in motion, like watching a swarm of gnats in a way. I also notice an erotic body buzz settling in my legs and groin area. I decide not to act impulsively on it and distract myself with music.<br><br>
I am playing guitar and can feel myself wading in and out of the zone. Everytime I start to focus on the speediness, and the anxiety that accompanies it, I fall from grace. This starts to frustrate me, so instead I sit down on my keyboard and use Reason to make a cool loop called, 'Insects standing in line for the elevator to the honey shaft.' And I like it! It actually sounds like bees hiving about in a mechanical sorta of order. For the curious I have encluded a link to it:<br><br>
11:24 am&gt; The intensity suddenly seems to drop. It went from feeling like I was headed to a solid +++ to being an underlying feeling, much more sober than not. The suddeness of it is what grabs my attention. It was as if I walked through a door that made me soberer (ererer).<br><br>
12:04 pm&gt; I could drive, go back to work, go to church, meet a stranger in the supermarket, anything normal I could do again now. I feel just ever so slightly off baseline and am a bit dissapointed. I feel as if the rug got yoinked out from under my experience. Just as the rush and push of the drug seemed to be reaching for the top of the hill, it was actually stepping off the bottom. Bummer...<br><br>
And that is basically all there is to tell. I am not sure if it did lose potency or what, but the experience was much shorter than ever before, and the manner in which it moved from point a to point b to point c was unlike before as well.<!-- End Body -->
