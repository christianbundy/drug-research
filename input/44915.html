After placing a big order with an herbal wholesale site online, I was given 7g of free A. muscaria with my order. Thinking this wouldn't really be enough to take orally, I figured we might as well try smoking it for possibly a stronger, yet shorter duration experience. The 7g that was supplied was one very large whole mushroom, cap and stalk. I sat down one afternoon with two friends, S and B. All three of us have a fairly good background in substance use, having smoked good reefer just about every day up to that point, and at one point or another taken psilocybin mushrooms, acid, smoked various extracts and just leaves of salvia, about every narcotic known, benzos, dxm, amphetamines, taken aminatas orally before, etc. <br><br>
B filled up his fairly large water bong with material from the cap and we passed around the bong, taking several big hits. Almost immediately after taking the hit, I made the observation that the intoxication was very similar to a mixture of weed and the strangely altered feeling one gets from smoking salvia but slightly more speedy, almost like an energy boost. Note that I have never gotten actual visuals from salvia by itself, just the feeling that something about reality was different, but the inability to figure out exactly what.<br><br>
S agreed that it was very similar to mary jane but instead of the sedative feeling he gets from green, almost like a very 'awake' feeling. B just commented that smoking them was much more enjoyable than taking them orally and how incredibly little of the cap it took for us all to experience this feeling. He said just the cap we had alone would easily make at least 50 bowls. None of experienced any visuals as many who have taken this mushroom orally have, just a marijuana-like stoned feeling with a slight feeling of reality distortion and a speedy buzz along with it.<br><br>
We passed the bong around several times, just enjoying the music and the movie that was on tv. As someone who gets pretty affected by the sedative feeling associated with weed, I greatly enjoyed the 'awake' feeling associated with smoking the cap. In fact, out of everything I have smoked (narcotics aside), I would say this was the most enjoyable smoking experience I have ever had, and I would definitely recommend people give smoking these awesome mushrooms instead of eating them for a completely different feeling that I personally have ever gotten from my experience of substance use. <br><br>
Positive Notes:<br>
+Enjoyable stoned weed-like feeling<br>
+Lacks the sedative effects of weed, slight energy boost<br>
+Takes very little shroom cap to smoke to get the desired effects<br>
+The more we smoked the better the sensation and still with no ill side-effects<br><br>
Neutral Notes:<br>
/Food wasn't as good tasting nor did I have the 'munchies' like I get with weed<br><br>
Negative Notes:<br>
-When lighting the shrooms, they can sometimes catch on fire and flame <br><br>
This experience exceeded my expectations. The experience was very enjoyable with no ill side-effects.<!-- End Body -->
