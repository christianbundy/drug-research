A word about ghb and relateds (1-4 butendiol, and gbl)<br><br>
I, and a few other people I have associated with have experienced true physical addiction to these things. In specific with myself, I had a CASE of an over the counter gbl mix sold in health food stores until recently called 'regenerize'. I started taking it more and more frequently, then in small doses during the day, then after about a month of this, either from taking too much, or from having a fair amount on a weekend then pretty much stopping on monday, I experienced some really icky symptoms.<br><br>
Aside from being edgy, and hyper, I had an overall feeling of what seemed like a neuropathy to me. You know how when you run your fingernails accross a chalk board, some people get the chills and shiver? I felt like that from almost any stimulus except sitting in a warm tub of water. Fine vibrations were the worst. I mean, driving the car, the road vibrations were so irritating to me that I could hardly touch the steering wheel. Running my hand accross a coarse fabric was intollerable. Even the sound a flushing toilet made me cringe. At the time I wasnt sure if it was a withdrawel reaction, or a toxic reaction. I cautiously took a small dose of the stuff and the symptoms dissapeared, then I went through four fucking days where I balanced feeling as bad as i could stand and keep working, vs taking a little shot of the stuff to stop the chills. In the end, I am not sure if it was addiction or toxicity. It's been over a month and I still don't feel totally normal. I feel fine as long as i am well rested, but if I get overly tired my fingers still feel a little funny.<br><br>
At one point during that four days, I tried a shot of cherry brandy and that also made the chills go away. That sort of made me feel that it might have been some weird receptor sensitivity shift that was mediated by the substance, since a lot of those things cross react with alcohol.<br><br>
I tossed out the rest of the stuff I had. Im not adverse to having some of it for an evening sometime in the future, but for the most part, I've just wiped the idea out of my head.<!-- End Body -->
