 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nage:24\r\nwt:280\r\ndosage:see story\r\nWell the long wait was over.  It had arrived, my jwh-018, and a long wait it was. I received a gram of off-white yellowish powder.  As I understand this is the appearance that you want, as opposed to a rust colored lump that others have been buying on the internet. \r\nA friend and I decided to try it out.  I could not find a proper vaporization (meth) \r\npipe so first I improvised with a light bulb based vapor pipe.  I took a tiny amount \r\nof the powder and put it in the bulb.  I just stuck the tip of a knife in and got as \r\nlittle as I could.  i took 1-2 hits and blew out very little smoke as did my friend.\r\nIt took aboubt 5 minutes to start affecting us noticably.  The effects were identical \r\nto smoking very good marijuana.  I was not extremely 'high' per se but the effects \r\nwere unmistakable.  \r\nWe followed up by smoking roughly the same amount on foil.  this worked much better \r\nbut it was difficult to get it to that point where all the smoke releases at the \r\nsame time in a big cloud.  We got pleasantly baked.  After we were already high and \r\nhit the foil again we could notice a rush right when it hit us. the buzz lasted for \r\nabout 1.5 hrs.\r\n4 hours later I went to another friends house and were gonna get good and blasted this \r\ntime we did a few foil boats and got extremely high.  It lasted about an hour for me \r\nbut was extremely pleasant.  I'm sure i went over the 5mg dose recommendation and \r\nI did not have any sort of paranoia or 'bad place' type feelings.  All and all it \r\nwent very well and the only thing I am going to do differently in the future is get \r\na vaporization pipe rather than that nasty foil.\r\nIts not for everyone as the method to smoke it is a difficult learning process that \r\nis more for the harder drug user.\r\nIn closing I think that milder forms like Spice are probably better if one \r\nplans on smoking it for a long time (probation).  But for the price per use jwh-018 \r\nis unbeatable.  In the future I plan to use the proper pipe and I am going to try \r\noral dosing dilluted in grain alcohol.\r\nSide effects: munchies, red eye, short term memory loss, telling stories no one \r\nwants to hear, cottonmouth, and telling stories with no point. Hope this helps.\r\nThe Mayor\n\n\n"
