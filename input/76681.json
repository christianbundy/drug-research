 "report": "<p>age:24</p><p>wt:280</p><p>dosage:see story</p><p>Well the long wait was over.  It had arrived, my jwh-018, and a long wait it was. I received a gram of off-white yellowish powder.  As I understand this is the appearance that you want, as opposed to a rust colored lump that others have been buying on the internet. </p><p>A friend and I decided to try it out.  I could not find a proper vaporization (meth) </p><p>pipe so first I improvised with a light bulb based vapor pipe.  I took a tiny amount </p><p>of the powder and put it in the bulb.  I just stuck the tip of a knife in and got as </p><p>little as I could.  i took 1-2 hits and blew out very little smoke as did my friend.</p><p>It took aboubt 5 minutes to start affecting us noticably.  The effects were identical </p><p>to smoking very good marijuana.  I was not extremely 'high' per se but the effects </p><p>were unmistakable.  </p><p>We followed up by smoking roughly the same amount on foil.  this worked much better </p><p>but it was difficult to get it to that point where all the smoke releases at the </p><p>same time in a big cloud.  We got pleasantly baked.  After we were already high and </p><p>hit the foil again we could notice a rush right when it hit us. the buzz lasted for </p><p>about 1.5 hrs.</p><p>4 hours later I went to another friends house and were gonna get good and blasted this </p><p>time we did a few foil boats and got extremely high.  It lasted about an hour for me </p><p>but was extremely pleasant.  I'm sure i went over the 5mg dose recommendation and </p><p>I did not have any sort of paranoia or 'bad place' type feelings.  All and all it </p><p>went very well and the only thing I am going to do differently in the future is get </p><p>a vaporization pipe rather than that nasty foil.</p><p>Its not for everyone as the method to smoke it is a difficult learning process that </p><p>is more for the harder drug user.</p><p>In closing I think that milder forms like Spice are probably better if one </p><p>plans on smoking it for a long time (probation).  But for the price per use jwh-018 </p><p>is unbeatable.  In the future I plan to use the proper pipe and I am going to try </p><p>oral dosing dilluted in grain alcohol.</p><p>Side effects: munchies, red eye, short term memory loss, telling stories no one </p><p>wants to hear, cottonmouth, and telling stories with no point. Hope this helps.</p><p>The Mayor</p>"
