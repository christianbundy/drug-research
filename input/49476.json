 "report": "<p>Took the compound at 10:30am</p><p>11:00am - 12:00pm going up!</p><p>12:00pm - 2:pm peaked</p><p>5:00pm - back to absolute baseline</p><p>The come on was incredible: very euphoric. I was very suprised when, at T+2 hours, I began peaking much harder than I expected. Everything about this compound was more than I expected. I believe I went into it cross-comparing it to 4-ACO-DiPT.</p><p>Medium in the visual department: lots of breathing, colors where incredible; music was ORGASMIC and like its DiPT cousin, narrated everything. Medium to strong psychedelics. All in all, it just felt really damn good.</p><p>Very clean, not as clear as LSD but felt better IMO. Strangely, as the effects wore off, my field of vision went hay-wire: I was watching a movie and the TV would not stay still. Everything was moving wildly (slightly scary) and very DMT like. This only lasted for about 15 minutes and then the poof: it was done.</p>"
