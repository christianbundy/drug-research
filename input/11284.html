My first experience with 4-AcO-DiPT was with a low dose of 15 mg. to test its effects. At this dosage range the effects were very pleasant and slightly empathogenic. I felt very in touch with the feelings of the friends I was with at the time. At this low level there was very little obvious impairment except when I tried to figure out how to use my friends oven, at which point my hands felt a bit clumsy and hard to control. There were no visuals to speak of at this level just some interesting thought alteration. Part way through the experience I went to go lay down in a dark room and I found it quite fun to be alone as well feeling my thoughts wander. I found myself slightly aroused and happy and I wished I had my lady friend about. While there was a definite mood lift there was no speediness to be found at this dosage level and sleep was easy within three hours after taking the chemical.<br><br>
The setting for my next 4-aco trip was my girlfriends house with her and two other close friends. All of the others were taking mushrooms and since it was my girlfriends first trip I felt like I needed to be in a more lucid state to watch over her to make sure she had a good trip, I decided that since the 4-aco seemed to allow for a pretty lucid mindset I would use that instead of mushrooms (as mushrooms make me feel more dreamy and introverted).<br><br>
As my supplies of this rare chemical are quite limited I decided to try it at the 30mg. level this time. Not surprisingly, I found that the dosage curve for this stuff is not linear at all and that 30mg is more than twice as potent as 15mg. was (it felt to me to be about 3 or 4 times more potent than the 15mg. trial).  At this level I felt a definite body load, complete with nausea and diarrhea. Even with this body sickness there is still a definite erotic component to the experience and I definitely would have wanted to try having sex on this compound if there was less of a body load. There were visuals at this level and an incredible level of thought alteration. One thing that I especially liked about this compound is that although there was a massive level of thought distortion my train of thought did not become disjointed like it does on LSD or psilocybe mushrooms. I found it easy to carry on a conversation and remember what people were saying.<br><br>
When I lay down to rest that night about three hours into the trip the thought patterns were still going strong. I felt a strong arachnid like intelligence come into the experience at this point. I watched a closed eye visual of a giant centipede crawling out of the eye-socket of a bald man, wrap around his head, and crawl into his mouth. I felt that the compound had connected me to some sort of spider intelligence that wanted to tell me something by this vision unfortunately the message was garbled. <br><br>
Interestingly enough, earlier that week I had been doing some visualization work with spirit animals and this compound had probably connected me to that. Another interesting thought pattern formed before I nodded of to sleep in half-tripping hypnogogic consciousness I felt I had become a werewolf and my body was changing shape. Then I fell into a fitful sleep, at about 5 hours after ingesting the 4-aco.<br><br>
Other than the body load the experience was pleasant and worth repeating. I went into the experience with a good mindset and came out with one as well. I felt cleansed of a lot of psychic baggage as I normally do after a mushroom trip. My next trial will be a bit lower than 30mg. but higher than 15mg. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of 18 - 22mg. I will also remember to bring along some other chemical and plant allies to combat and body load if it arises next time.<!-- End Body -->
