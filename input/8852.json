 "report": "<p>Hear is a true story that happened to me recently and I thought I should share this for those of you who would like a little education on 1,4-Butanediol.</p><p>About a month ago, I purchased some 1,4-Butanediol (bdo) and had plans to use it for the manufacturing of elastomer rubber.  First of all for those that do not know, it is NOT illegal to purchase this chemical as of yet(today is 08/17/01) unlike it is to purchase and possess GBL.  As long as BDO is not used for human consuption, you have the complete legal right to purchase it, but you better know what you are going to use it for.  </p><p>Anyway, once this purchase had taken place (all legally mind you) one week had passed and the DEA was knocking on my door, wanting to know what I was doing with this chemical.  I told them of my plans to manufacture the rubber product I had in mind, and they DID NOT LIKE NOR BELIEVE anything I was telling them.  First they told me that BDO is a schedualed drug, in which they are full of shit, because it is not.  Then they insisted I tell them I was using it to make GHB.  But because I was not using it to make GHB, they could really not do anything about it.  They asked to come back to my appt. and I said no problem, I had nothing to hide and have done nothing illegal so why not.  They came back to my place, I showed them what I had purchesed and they looked at it, asked again what I was using it for (to see if my 'suppossed story' was still matching) and then they told me I was lying to them and sooner or later I would be in trouble.  Then they left.  Remember before when they said it was schedualed, well if it was, they would have siezed what I had, then immediately arrested me.  But like I said, since this is not schedualed, they could not do anything about it.  </p><p>The DEA proceeded to harrass me for about three more weeks, so during this time I had gotten a lawyer.  I had the lawyer look up all the legalities on BDO to see what possible trouble I could be looking at.  And here is what he found.  My lawyer has a contact who is an anylitical chemist and uses him as a professional witness in cases that involve chemicals and so forth.  The chemist told my lawyer that if the DEA wanted to bust me on my purchase of BDO, they would have to equally bust anyone who purchases gasoline in a gas can, for the fact that they might go home and huff it.  Gas is not illegal in anymeans unless it is used for human consumption, the same as BDO.  Because of BDO's wide economic use it would be almost impossible to make illegal.</p><p>Here is the scary part.  The chemist also said, that BDO is in no way possible nor proven to convert to GHB upon ingestion.  It is unknow why BDO has the effect it supposedly does.  But he said that the active part of the BDO is the glycol(tetra-methylene glycol).  And it is fact that you can take one cup of anti-freeze and have the effect upon ingestion.  The active ingredient in anti-freeze is ethylene glycol.  So the chemist said if I know anyone taking this chemical, to stop immediately.  The long term effects are unkown...period.</p><p>Hope this helps some of you educate yourselfs.</p><p>I will report any further trouble with the DEA.</p><p>Tathen.</p>"
