My father is dying, and he is caught in a weird twilight zone where the past keeps jumping out at him.<br><br>
He was prescribed Zyprexa 2.5mg a day (he is very frail) as well as an anti Alzheimer's drug, which my mother discontinued.<br><br>
I've become very close to my father in the last year.  As he realized he was dying a depression set in, and he started to spill the beans and confess to transgressions hard to understand.  Pandora's box was open, at least in his head.<br><br>
I tried a 2.5mg Zyprexa pill on a rather lazy day.  My wife and I walked around the streets of Toronto's East side.  The only effect I felt from the pill was a mild 'grooviness' - much like a low dose benzodiazipine, a beer, or a toke.  I felt a little bit anxious and confused, but that could be compounded by my emotional state.  As well I drank coffee, which I hadn't touched in a week, so my fluttery heart may have been due more to that than anything. <br><br>
Apparently this is an extremely low dose and it is supposed to take a few days to take full effect, so.......<br><br>
Compared to many psych meds, it was quite pleasant, though not anything I would be looking for.<!-- End Body -->
