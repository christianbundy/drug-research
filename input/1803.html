A friend of mine just discovered crack about two months ago. His behavior was classic crack addict. He shifted from one circle of friends to another. 'Borrowed' money from everyone he new. He was convinced the he had mastered the art of the 'con', but he was really just trading on his good reputation. He only conned himself. We could tell that he no longer enjoyed talking to us; he spoke monosyllabically to us. He dreamt of dealing his way to fortune<br><br>
We did what we could. We spent more time with him. We made it clear how we felt, but then we didn't talk about too much after that. But we still spent more time with him. We considered giving him a beating; As time went on, he saw the shit he was in and asked for a baseball bat to head, but it never came to that. <br><br>
He stopped, but he considers himself an addict. He says it's the best feeling.<br><br>
For myself, I don't like coke. I've snorted between 5 and 10 times, smoked once or twice. I decided that I really didn't like it about ten years ago. I've never bought it. The mental association that I have with coke is this: When I see that line of white powder offered to me, I think to myself 'If I snort that, in twenty minutes, I'll feel a little worse than I do right now.' Then I consider how I feel and I always decide that I feel OK, and that twenty minutes from now I would NOT like to feel a little worse. <br><br>
Then I say 'No thank you'. It's a joke when my snorting friends offer me a line, they know I'll turn it down.<br><br>
There's a transitory side effect, that it does make you feel great, but that's not a big deal for me. Been there, done that. I've felt great before, I'll feel great again and I feel fine right now.<br><br>
Here something that my crack addict friend told me: The twenty minute crash is a lot worse for an addict than it is for someone who isn't. It dosen't go away and a lot of subsequent crack is just an attempt to stem the crash.<!-- End Body -->
