I tend to take a substance tens of times before I write a trip report on it, but I think after only a few uses I already have the feel for 2c-t-21, and it is pretty much best summed up by saying <br><br>
Hello, I am here. Not much going on, how about you?<br><br>
That is pretty much what 2c-t-21 says to me when I take it. No great insights to speak of, hardly any psychedelic effects other than a very mild brightening of colors, headspace is pretty much everyday reality with a slight shift to the paranormal but nothing with much personality like other 2c-X chemicals. Stimulation is the most noted effect I have thus far discovered, and even it is mild. It isnt a <br><br>
clean your house and count your tooth picks stimulation, such as meth. <br><br>
It is more of a <br><br>
Hey dont go to sleep asshole, you have guests in your body and we are not going to leave for another seven hours!<br><br>
Not really a <br><br>
You want to sleep but cant sleep <br><br>
Stimulation, more of a <br><br>
you might be able to get to sleep but probably not, and why would you go to sleep anyways?<br><br>
Stimulation. <br><br>
Sort of a stoned feeling I guess but I imagine I could still get around to stuff. Stimulating as in I dont particularly want to sleep, stoned as in even though I cant sleep I am not particularly driven to do anything. Music sounds about the same as ever, perhaps a bit clearer? Taste seems about average. Touch feels softer but it sure isnt blowing me away.<br><br>
Nice compound and worth a try but it is far from my favorite phenethylamine. I think this  substance would do well with a person who has never tried a 2c-X compound before, provided they dont take a lot of it as I hear in higher doses it can be a bit more pushy.<br><br>
I will do it again I am sure. I think it would be a great drug to take for a relaxed yet stimulated sexual experience with ones significant other (although maybe only morning sex as sleep will no be easy.) Also a great drug for school or something, eye dilation didnt seem to be a big thing for me. Although my eyes are perma-dilated (I have big pupils naturally), and I have not used this enough to look at my eyes in the mirror frequently in order to remember eye dilation as being particularly bad or not so bad. But I dont recall it as being very bad at all. If my eyes are dilated I want to know why because the visuals are next to non existent =P.<br><br>
It is worth noting that I have been pretty much abusing psychedelic phenethylamines for the past week, 2c-t-2 every other day, 2c-e once or twice and 2c-X in the morning, so I am sure I have some (probably large) degree of tolerance.<br><br>
For all I know if I stay week for two weeks and try this again it will be much different. But some part of me doubts it for some reason.<!-- End Body -->
