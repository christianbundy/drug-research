I've been suffering from severe anxiety and depression for most of my 24 years. I've tried nearly every drug with recreational potential. Last month my shrink prescribed 600 mg. of Neurontin to be taken three times daily. About 1/2 hour after popping my first pill, I started feeling fucking great. It was a lot like an MJ buzz that was just starting to creep on. The euphoria lasted about 4 hours, and i was a little drowsy, but I had no real urge to sleep. I've been taking the proper dose for nearly a month, and the euphoria has lessened somewhat, but this shit has really done wonders for my emotional problems. It also helps the pain from a herniated disc in my neck enough that I could stop taking that god-awful Flexeril, which made me feel like I had the flu. <br><br>
Neurontin REALLY does help all the problems the manufacturer claims. The only (side effects) I've noticed are a mild cannabis-type buzz and slight sedation. I just hope the DEA doesn't schedule it as a narcotic, because fucked-up people like me really need it. Oh yeah, I wouldn't try to snort it. There's a lot of filler in the pills and it will severely fuck up the sinuses and lungs.<!-- End Body -->
