 "report": "<p>Well, I haven't tried psychedelics in a few months, and I got some aMT. I'm experienced with LSD, mushrooms and DMT, in terms of psychedelics, and many other things besides. The other night I tried this stuff.</p><p>This experience was interesting. I'd very much like to try it again but perhaps next time sticking to a 50mg dose. I was on my own, and indoors throughout, because it was bloody freezing outside, and as much as I wanted to experience the snow... well, I don't do cold very well.</p><p>8.00pm: I take 50mg orally, using a cigarette paper to bomb it. I then carry on my activities (watching a bit of TV, listening to music, playing guitar).</p><p>9.00pm: By this point I was noticing a mild stimulation. It felt slightly speedy, I felt like I wanted to dance a little and was getting pretty excited about the experience.</p><p>10.00pm: Now I started feeling a sense of disorientation when walking about. I started feeling pretty euphoric, and my vision was crisp and clear. I phoned a good friend and chatted for a while, which really helped my well-being along. After a while I found my vision jumping about, things flipping around my visual field. I turned the lights off and listened to music. At this point I could see dots and flashes, very mild visuals. CEVs were also mild and similar.</p><p>11.00pm: I found that my thoughts were flying around and were confusing, I had alot of images in my mind of a sexual nature, and still I felt stimulated.</p><p>12.00am: I decide to take another 50mg... here goes.</p><p>1.30am: Now a nausea had settled in and I threw up. The energy I previously felt had left. Visuals didn't really increase. It was here that I started reliving painful memories, and the thoughts were looping in my mind. These remained for what felt like hours before I got them under control, but throughout I was feeling panicky. I developed a painful headache and I didn't want to move, although I kept thrashing in my bed. I tried to watch family guy but I couldn't concentrate on it and it made no sense. I felt the desire to just sleep.</p><p>5.00am: No sleep came, although I felt calm and relatively content by now. Very tired, but satisfied.</p><p>Overall, it was interesting. The frightening part was obviously nasty, but nothing that concerned me upon returning to relative sobriety, I considered it a warning to have a bit more respect for this stuff. I would say the mental aspect felt a bit shallow... I'm willing to try this again though. Visually I was disappointed, but do not underestimate the capacity for mind-fuck with this stuff. It's powerful.</p>"
