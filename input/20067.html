I love taking showers. I usually take long hot showers and sit down in the tub. For some reason i feel completely altered. My thought process changes, my mood changes, everything about my existence changes. I find myself capable of achieving very high levels concentration and awareness. <br><br>
For me showers are completely psychedelic. The repetitive and rythmic beating of the water against my flesh, The many different tones that it emits as it reigns down from above to nurish  my skin, the beauty of the light as it reflects off of each and every drop of water. I feel as though my spirit is completely renewed. All the troubles of the world just seem to wash away during my shower sessions.  <br><br>
The many different tones, duration, pulses and sensations of the entire stimuli involved with the essence of a shower are capable of inducing great states of ecstasy. My brain waves are completely entrained as they synchronize with the beating of the precious liquid against my flesh. My mind is brought into a theta state of consciousness as the warmth engulfs my body. I am just an empty vessel and the shower is my catalyst for enlightenment. <br><br>
