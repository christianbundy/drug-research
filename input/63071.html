I read about people insuffulating this to bring it on quicker, don't do this. It burns. I made my eyes tear and water for 50 minutes before the oral dose kicked in.<br>
It hits me much like MDEA does, a stoney and strong rolling feeling. It has visuals and a euphoria I can easily describe as selfish. Unlike x, I don't feel like hugging others or being particually nice or open. It isnt' that I can't, I just don't feel the empathic urge to do so. It brought on a heavyness to my eyes that made me want to keep them closed. It had an opiate like nodding off effect that was plesant, and quite easy to sleep on.<br><br>
The effects last about 5-6 hours, I found that the Tihkal dosages are a bit shy of what is needed for me. The 00 capsules filled up seem to make about 200-220mg of this, and that is what I need to get rolling.<br><br>
The after effects are great, for the next two to three days I'll feel just fine. No crash, quite the opposite, I feel good. I'm guessing that's the antidepressant part working. A fellow experimentor noted that ketamine brought on the 'roll' just like it does with ecstacy.<!-- End Body -->
