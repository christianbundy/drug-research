 "report": "<p>About a year ago, I was 15 years old, I went over to my sisters apartment to help her clean. Her boyfriend and other friend R were over there too. They broke out some tweak and started sparking up bowls in what looked like a crack pipe, I was asked several times to try it and declined every time, but I finally gave in. :) So I took a hit, feeling nothing, took another hit, still feeling nothing, although BILLOWS of smoke are coming out of my mouthand then the third hitBAM! It finally hit me and I was rushing so hard, I laid down on my back and stared at the ceiling. What a wonderful feeling it wasall night I cleaned and talked to R. I didn't know R at all before I had gone over there but it seemed like we became best friends that night. Honestly, it was a blast.</p><p>One drawback though is the jaw-clenching, it can cause a lot of canker sores on the inside of your mouth if you can't control it. Also, when I come down, I feel terrible, like I just don't want to live, but, it eventually passes. Crystal is very addictive also, I had only done it that once, yet craved it for a LONG time afterwardsif I could've found some, I would've bought itso be careful and be responsible.</p>"
