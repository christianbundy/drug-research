My beloved 17 year old daughter took 64 Coricidin Cough and Cold pills yesterday around 8:30pm. Around 2:30am we heard a loud noise, so I investigated, she had knocked her dresser over. I tried to help her up off the floor but she couldn't get up. I knew she had been foolish enough to gamble with her life before by abusing DXM so I guessed and made her admit it. I called the ambulance, I just spent all night with her in the emergency room and now she is in the Cardiac Care Unit of the hospital, and hopefully she will not have done too much damage to her brain, heart and liver. <br><br>
It is so f___ing stupid and dangerous for all of you kids to mess around with DXM. I know from looking at her PC history that she has been to this website before, so this begs the question, was she trying to kill herself? The front page of this site tells us that Coricidin Cough and Cold is extremely dangerous. On July 4th she drank enough vodka to become unconscious, and required another hospital stay. Before that she had attempted suicide--indisputably--4 times, but it has been 2 years since the last time, so I thought she was better. So how stupid am I? What the hell am I supposed to do? She doesn't want help and is almost 18. She is ruining my life because of temporary feelings. I do not know how I can go on if she manages to succeed in killing herself? She has had almost 8 years of off and on therapy---I will try to get her some psychological help again. Whoever reads this-please do not do this; to yourself, or to your mother.There have got to be better ways to get a buzz.<!-- End Body -->
