 "report": "<p>I used buprenorphine to detox from dope - it was a relatively painless procedure - it basically cut my detox symptoms by 3/4. I still felt a bit bad, but I could function.</p><p>My problems arose due to my  Doctor's subscribing a huge amount of bup for the detox- two years later I am off the 'hard' stuff but still injecting 1-2 vials of bup a day... admittedly cheaper than heroin, and I function better than on methadone but BE CAREFUL!  Buprenex is a highly addictive drug, and the withdrawal is even worse than heroin- for the casual user, there is hardly any high to mention, thus not even worth trying.</p><p>...this warning is for the dope addicts considering going onto buprenorphine- be sure you go to a good doctor who will limit your prescriptions, and use naltrexone- otherwise you will be facing years of relapse and a new, (at least) legal addiction.</p>"
