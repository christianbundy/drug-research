 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt started out as being bored one night. My brother and I had nothing to do, and so when I get bored I smoke. I was sitting watching South Park when my brother comes downstairs and hands me a white pill & says,' Here, we're gonna have some fun tonight.' So, no questions asked, I washed it down with some milk, and afterwards he told me it was Vicodin and said it was going to be great, so I said ok, it was fine with me. He had said it would take about 15 minutes to kick in, but after 15 minutes I wasn't feeling anything. So since I wasn't feeling anything I decided to go outside & smoke a bowl of white widow with my brother.<br>It was nice, it was about midnight and we were takin fat rips off of our pot. I was then starting to complain about the vicodin because I wasn't feeling anything, but he said to just wait, and that Id start feeling it soon. So I waited, and it had been about 30 minutes since Id taken it. We had just finished the bowl, and we were sitting down on a bench. So I packed everything back into my pockets & stood up. Then, WHAM! It hit me hard. It didn't slowly come on like Id expected, it was like one second I was sitting there smoking, then, literally, the next second I was standing up feeling like I was floating.<br>It was great, as we walked back to our house I started to realize things I would have never normally really thought about. I would figure out basic conflicts in my life, and it just really opened up my mind. Everything seemed more amazing. The wind would blow & it would feel so soft, I would hear a noise & then would think about how unique it was. We clattered up the stairs to our house and silently snuck in. I sat down & I felt like I was floating. I looked close at my hands, and they were shaking. I tried walking upstairs, but it was very difficult. I saw colorful images on the wall. Some were pink squares outlined with purple, then I saw dark blue diamonds outlined with black. So halfway up the stairs I gave up & slowly hobbled back down the stairs, and of course I had the munchies & chowed down on some cookies.<br>I sat because it was hard to stand up for long periods of time. I was trying to pay attention to the T.V., but other things kept coming across my mind. Id stare at my hands & try to figure out their mysteries. Then I got the idea of washing my hands & I got so excited over it. I went to the bathroom & washed my hands & the rushing over my hands felt so great. My brother made fun of me for it, but he was enjoying the wind on the balcony.<br>The type of mind-high it gave me was crazy. I was happy & giggly (the normal effects of pot), but there was also this strange aura feeling surrounding me. Not like I was invinsible, but like I was magical or something. My mind did slow down slightly, though. Like my brother would say something to me, and for seconds later I would really think about what he said, and it would feel like I was living in that exact moment for about 10 - 20 seconds. It takes all of your worries away & it's like you think about nothing, but also everything. It was great.<br>The type of body-high I got was absolutely amazing! It truly felt like I was sitting on clouds floating. My eyes would sometimes shake, and I would feel a little bit tipsy. But the greatest part of it was the sudden pulses of some great feeling I would get. I would all of a sudden feel extremely good & relaxed.<br>After Id been high for about 2 - 2 1/2 hours, I started to come down from it. It wasn't like other drugs, where I start to feel sick & nausiated. All I felt was really sleepy. So I walked up the stairs, but with greater ease seeing that I was coming off my high. I slept so good that night. So overall it was a fun experience, and would definitely do it again whenever, plus that was possibly the greatest sleep I had ever gotten.\n\n\n"
