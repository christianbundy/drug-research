 "report": "<p>I've been on probation for a couple months and been avoid cannabis so I have been searching for a legal intoxicant. Today my order of an ounce of dried wormwood arrived. After reading other reports I tried smoking some. I rolled a decent sized joint (it's a pain in the ass to roll) and lit it. The first thing I noticed was that the smoke was pretty harsh, I smoked it down to a roach and put it out without any pronounced effects.</p><p>I smoked a cigarette then went to make a tea with it. I let around 5-6 grams seep in warm water for about 15 or 20 mins strained the brew, then ran it through a coffee filter to get out the grain, added honey to the mix stirred and took a swig. The taste is very bitter but I want to get the experience so I finished the cup.</p><p>Around 45 mins later still no effects sat out back and had a cigarette. About halfway through the cig all the sudden I felt sedated and just mellow, the effects were more pronounced than I had expected, a nice buzz good for chilling out. If you can bear the taste I think it is well worth a try.</p>"
