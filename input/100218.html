'Ride the dragon, walk with the dragon, or lead the dragon; but never chase the dragon.'<br><br>
A little bio, I am about 200 pounds, male, an also recovering addict. I have experience with several other drugs and RCs, but MDPV had really taken hold of me in the past, been a very fiendish MDPV user in the past, which always results in a horrid crash followed by days of agony and craving. <br><br>
The title says it all. MDPV is indeed the pitbull of RCs, it is all about the way I treat the drug. In the past I had binged on tan PV and slipped into a psychotic state. <br><br>

[00:00]&gt;15mg  insuffiated<br>
[00:15]&gt; Euphoria is strong, but nothing like Tan MDPV<br>
[00:30]&gt;Going to use this focus to draw up a plan for me and my fiance.<br><br>
[01:00] Still strongly mentally stimulated as well as physically.<br>
[02:00]Comedown left me wanting 'just one more line!!'<br>
I'm fighting the urge, I know I won't regret that. <br><br>
♣♣♣♣♣Mission♣♣♣♣♣♣<br><br>
1▪ Determine whether I can resist the urge to redose. <br>
/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>
★Yes, DO NOT CHASE THAT EUPHORIA★<br><br>
2▪To find a comfortable dose and intervals to redose at.<br>
/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>
★5-10MG every 2 hours with a bottle of water for every line★<br><br>
3▪Find a good dose to treat my ADHD with.<br>
/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>
★15MG orally at 5AM and then at 12PM makes my job extremely pleasant with no bad side effects. I sleep at around 10PM.★<br><br>
4▪Making the comedown less dreadful.<br>
/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>
★Follow 1 and 2★ <br><br>
                      /Start<br>
[01:00]Kick the night off with a 10mg line to get rolling, 5mg for her. Much less nasal burn, not looking forward the drip. <br><br>
--Bananas eaten-- <br><br>
[1:05]▶Comfortably stimulated, both very talkative and. She is absorbed in her phone, I have to remind her to blink. <br><br>
[1:45]▶Got sucked into Call of Duty, time doesn't even seem to cross my mind while I play, extremely focused.<br><br>
--We both have ADHD--<br><br>
[2:30]▶Euphoria has just recently began to fade. EXTREMELY tempted to redose. The stimulation feels similar to Ritalin, better read while I still can, browsing the internet reading many other people's experiences. <br><br>
[2:50]▶ Coming down from what I've determined to be the plateau,Desire to redose is strong for me, but I don't want to teach her bad habits, like breaking your own rules.<br><br>
[2:55]▶ Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!<br><br>
[3:00]▶10/5 MG nasal. No problem.<br><br>
♥♡♥APHRODISIAC!!!♥♡♥<br><br>
3:15&gt; I suggest we watch porn, I know exactly what this is going to lead to. Will try and take note of anything worth knowing about it effects on our sexual performance. <br><br>
+++++++++++PROs++++++++++<br><br>
(M/F)Sex drive is way up,<br>
(M)Took forever for me to cum, almost lost hope,<br>

[4:55]▶ H20!<br><br>
[5:00]▶She decides to put the PV away for the night to see if sleeping is plausible. <br><br>
[5:05]▶ Desperately needed bathroom break, urine is clear but smells like MDPV.<br><br>
[6:00]▶Seems that we both are having a bit of an uncomfortable comedown, despite being physically exhausted we are mentally awake. The fiend in me keeps asking for 'just a bump', I dont plan on telling her the comedown can be alleviated by redosing.<br><br>
[7:30]▶(F)She feels mentally drained and her body is restless.<br><br>
[8:30]▶ She is taking 50mg of Benadryl and few bong hits.(BHO)<br><br>
