My Calea Zacatechichi Induced dream from the previous night, with the subliminal expectation of a light, spiritual/personal trip, woke me early in the morning primed and ready for an expedition of sorts.<br><br>
9:10 - I Drank an extraction of LSA from 7 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds prepared from the night before. The seeds turned out to be rather weak, but had some minor body rushes, CEV's, slight mood elevation and slight nausea. The visuals were of fleeting geometric vistas suggesting old dynasty Ancient Egyptian or maybe even Sumerian architectures, on a grid of infinity. The colors quite dulled down, I attributed to the lack of potency in the seeds.<br><br>
11:15 - I Took out a pre-measured dose of 100mg of 2C-C, split it into 4 equal parts, and encapsulated them, then swallowed one. I had read that especially this type of Phenethylamine took quite some time to kick in. This was my first experiment with 2C-C and I was a little anxious as to the effects, and had not prepared myself nor had the physical time for Ego Death or a full on trip, so I smoked alot of homegrown high grade Cannabis. So I didnt really notice too much of the effects as I came up.<br><br>
I painted for about half an hour totally entranced and amazed by the textures created as I painted, I was mesmerised by the colors, at times, it could get a little intense, but it was easy to keep under control. A slight buzz in the head, or the beginnings of a headache started. I continued to smoke cannabis throughout this time as the effects of the 2C-C were somewhat light.<br><br>
Went inside to lie down on the couch with some chillout and enjoyed some slight CEV's, there were small times of intense euphoria, which were apparently psychosomatic, as the only body load I ever got was from the Cannabis. The type of visuals were lacking in character, quite randomised bits of hypnogogic images overlapping generic lava-lamp type fluid visuals. I soon realised that I wasnt in the mood for daydreaming. This was about the time I realised I was thinking slightly differently, more lucid, from multiple perspectives. I found that it had become very easy to concentrate on mental problems and solve them, without getting distracted by any powerful visuals or sensations. I found it to be very analytical (Not self-analytical), and that it significantly enhanced the aesthetic appreciation of music and visual-spatial relationships.<br><br>
As I got bored I concluded that it was safe to go out and resume my daily errands in the city. As soon as I left my spirits had lifted immensely, I walked through a park during the beginning months of spring, and I suddenly became aware of all the natural beauty around me, totally astonished by all the trees. I continued to stroll around the park admiring all the details of nature. The walk was a beautiful one, which allowed for introspection, deep thought on several required subjects, and simple wonder at how subtly psychedelic and therapeutic this substance was. It reminded me of a light dose of Acid, with a clean head high tinged with Mescaline type thought patterns. When the scenery changed from beautiful blooming park to crowded and dilapidated streets of Istanbul, the visuals adapted to a more very sublime and subtle Escheresque visuals of morphing, rusted buildings, similar to oil paintings I have painted in the past.<br><br>
I ate outside, and completed my errands, and walked back home, I had peaked somewhere on the walk but have no idea as it was so as I approached home I decided that a tiny cosmic touch was needed to finish the experiment.<br><br>
14:20 - Arrived home and prepared a bowl with fine Cannabis laced with (eyeballed) approx: 10-15mg of DPT. Put on Shpongle's Tales of the Inexpressible, relaxed and took a deep, long hit. It wasnt much, but enough... about 2-3 minutes after smoking, I was overcome with sensory and physical intensity and an intense euhporia swept over me. The effect was quite like bypassing the tricky parts of the mushroom trip to the bare essentials and effects. Walls morphing, fractal textures, high frequency shimmering ect, but I was like looking through a veil of yellow cosmic fog. The music's depth complexified immediately, I closed my eyes for a couple of minutes in fractal and snakelike cheshiresque morphing hallucinations that gradually gave way to the kaledioscopic DMT or LSD type visuals. Slight nausea set in but it wasnt a problem.<br><br>
14:30 - Got up and repeated the hit. This time the experience was very similar but much more intense, tripping hard for several minutes I closed my eyes to fall into an abstract psychedelic dimension that I could pull out of at will. When I awoke maybe 10 minutes later, The world seemed completely different, like I was born again. It felt as if a great weight had been lifted, I was in a state of euphoric catharsis. I indeed did feel centuries younger...<br><br>
The afterglow was extremely pleasurable as I write this, the afterglow resembles the Salvia afterglow but in a much more positive light. In conclusion I was quite satisfied that I had both completed my daily chores and errands, painted and worked, while having bursts of insight, euphoria, shallow and sublime psychedelic excursions without the messy ego death, paranoia or anxiety in half a day. I have cooked dinner for my wife who is to arrive from work, Im extremely positive and feel reborn. I could easily have doubled the 2C-C dose, for quite a full trip. I would like to repeat the experience however, I would prefer to replace the LSA with Mushrooms or good old Acid in the future.<br><br>
18:30 - Cleaned up the house, had a couple of beers and smoked a little more Cannabis while I watched some tv, had a small snack, and a wonderful shower.  <br><br>
I feel highly charged, creative and motivated, most likely to enhance the afterglow with some kratom extract, and additional cannabis, folowed by A Calea Zacatechichi Tea and Calea joint before bed to complete the cycle...<!-- End Body -->
