My love of opiates began in 2002, when I was taken to the ER because I had a cripling migraine, and the pain was so intense that I was crying and scared I was going to die. I saw a neurologist who promised me that I wasn't having an aneurysm, or anything like that. He gave me 20mg oxycontin, and a fioricet. and wrote me a script for percocet and fioricet. 6 months later I was addicted and getting pills any way I could, I checked into a methadone clinic and detoxed in 3 months.<br><br>
So, one night a couple of weeks ago, I had a craving, a dream, and in that dream, I was high, and I remembered the feeling. So, I got desperate, and ordered some otc codiene from an online pharmacy in Canada, god bless our northern neighbors.<br><br>
I'd done my reading on the cold water extraction technique in the days waiting for my medicinal saviour to arrive.<br><br>
I crushed up 18 pills and added 45ml of lukewarm water, gave it a stir, and let the glass sit in an icewater bath, with a thermometer in it. Once the temp reached 40F, I let it sit for 20 more minutes, and then filtered the solution through a regular coffee filter, soaked in cold water of course.<br><br>
I downed the filtered solution at 9am, on a relativly empty stomach, I ate half a hotdog to start my digestive juices flowing in order to get the quickest and most intesne high.<br><br>
+ 0:15 - Feeling the tingle, I remember this, some anticipation, I can really feel the caffine taking hold now.<br><br>
+ 0:35 - Ah, Codiene bliss. Opiates rock. Music is fun.<br><br>
+ 1:05 - Wow, the ichies really hit me with codiene, I got them with oxy and percs the first couple of times, but then after my tolerance built up I never experienced them anymore. Call me crazy, but I rather missed them.....it wasn't ever intense, just a warm fuzzy itchiness. I feel relaxed, but the caffine really makes the codiene buzz a little less enjoyable.<br><br>
+ 2:00 Codiene buzz fading, still really shaky from the caffine.<br><br>
+ 3:00 All gone, got another batch brewing. This time I will try 200mg<br><br><br>
All in all, I liked it, OTC codiene works, I just wish there was a way to lose the caffine.<br><br>
Be careful, I've been through the throws of addiction, maybe not as hardcore as some people, but its no joke, I used to sit and say that heroin/opiate users were weak, and that the 'withdrawal' was just an excuse to keep using.<br><br>
Withdrawal is real, it is absolute hell.<br><br>
Best of luck to the rest of you psychonauts.<br>
