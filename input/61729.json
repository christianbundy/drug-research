Divinorum\t1 pinch '40x' (enough for a single person to hit in a bowl)<br>\t\tSublingually Administered - 'dipped'<br>___Chronography___:<br>0530 (+0000)\tAdminister dose.<br>+0010\t\tStart Music.<br>+0015\t\tSwallow.<br>+0045\t\tFall Asleep.<br>+1200\t\tWake up, holy crap I needed to sleep.<br>___Notes___:<br>0530 - Ah, what a beautiful taste - so familiar from the liquid extract I tried before.  I'm afraid to swallow my saliva, as the Salvinorin-A dissolves in the stomach before getting a chance in the blood stream. Sigh, I really hope this works.  If not, then I'll have to smoke it.  Let's get some nice music going - while reminiscing, I might as well bring out the Infected Mushroom & Shpongle.<br>0540 - It reminds me of plant food - or fish food - or both.  Whatever, it's just slightly annoyingly bitter.<br>0545 - Swallow - Fifteen minutes of sitting and swishing should be plenty.<br>0548 - I swear!  I'm immune to Salvia!  It must have been one of the endless shots given in the military that did it.  Ha!  Just kidding.  Really though, wtf mate?<br>I love my Infected Mushroom though.  I'm just in the mood for it.<br>0552 - Just keep listening to music.  I don't expect anything at all to happen - not even the slight visual effects I had before.<br>1732 - I fell asleep, and felt no effects whatsoever.  Oh well.  There went about ten bucks worth.\n\n\n"
