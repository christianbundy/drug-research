Divinorum\t1 pinch '40x' (enough for a single person to hit in a bowl)</p><p>\t\tSublingually Administered - 'dipped'</p><p>___Chronography___:</p><p>0530 (+0000)\tAdminister dose.</p><p>+0010\t\tStart Music.</p><p>+0015\t\tSwallow.</p><p>+0045\t\tFall Asleep.</p><p>+1200\t\tWake up, holy crap I needed to sleep.</p><p>___Notes___:</p><p>0530 - Ah, what a beautiful taste - so familiar from the liquid extract I tried before.  I'm afraid to swallow my saliva, as the Salvinorin-A dissolves in the stomach before getting a chance in the blood stream. Sigh, I really hope this works.  If not, then I'll have to smoke it.  Let's get some nice music going - while reminiscing, I might as well bring out the Infected Mushroom & Shpongle.</p><p>0540 - It reminds me of plant food - or fish food - or both.  Whatever, it's just slightly annoyingly bitter.</p><p>0545 - Swallow - Fifteen minutes of sitting and swishing should be plenty.</p><p>0548 - I swear!  I'm immune to Salvia!  It must have been one of the endless shots given in the military that did it.  Ha!  Just kidding.  Really though, wtf mate?</p><p>I love my Infected Mushroom though.  I'm just in the mood for it.</p><p>0552 - Just keep listening to music.  I don't expect anything at all to happen - not even the slight visual effects I had before.</p><p>1732 - I fell asleep, and felt no effects whatsoever.  Oh well.  There went about ten bucks worth.</p>"
