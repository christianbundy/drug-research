 "report": "\n\n\n\nRight, Ive been meaning to type this up for a while, but it seems only now, approx. two weeks later, that Ive got the proper perspective to right something useful for people. Initially I was going to classify this as a Bad Trip, but now Im thinking Difficult Experience or even just as First Time. I hope this is useful or interesting as Im really going to try my best.\r\nId like to preface this by saying that Im a VERY experienced drug user. For many years I have used cannabis, mushrooms (brilliant), MDMA (also brilliant), cocaine (waste of money), Meth (yuck), BZP and TMFPP (also yuck), morphine (interesting). I have also done things like experimenting with massive dose caffeine and prescription drug cocktails (stupid). Basically Im know what Im talking about. I would also like to add that I love psychedelics, theyre my favourite. Anyhow, I did all the reading up on salvia, and I mean thoroughly, for months. I knew to inhale deep and use a torch lighter. I knew to use a sitter. I knew how hardcore this stuff can be. I bought some 5x and despite my reading everything I made stupid mistakes.\r\nMy girlfriend was out for a couple of hours, the house was empty, and I had nowhere I had to be for a couple of hours so I thought Hey, Ill smoke that salvia I bought. Ill see some shit and itll wear off by the time I have to go out. What an idiot. I would also like to say I was in a pretty good mental place at the time, but I should have been somewhere better.\r\nI cleaned up, locked the door (didnt want to go wandering off into traffic now, did I) and sat down on my bed. I filled the bowl with about 1/8 of a gram by eye (I had read this was a common amount  double checking I see this is strong  big mistake not checking). I had planned to smoke a threshold amount just so my brain had seen the chemical before, but I didnt bother  another mistake. I was feeling slightly anxious  as I torched and sucked in all the bowl in one massive rip. I thought the smoke would be harsh but didnt find it so. I held it and honestly didnt expect anything to happen as it was my first go  boy, was that a mistake. \r\nI could feel the salvia coming on after only a few seconds. I went to take another toke but I cant remember if I bothered. I reached down hundreds of miles to put the bong on the floor, scrabbled to turn on the CD player then watched myself lay back on the bed. I never felt myself touch the bed. I was instantly the highest Ive ever been. You know those graphs to show you how you go up and down? There was no line up. I went from baseline to fully high instantly. It was at the top of an asymptote.\r\nReality got sucked away into a swirling vortex. I have noticed many people describe similar things but here goes anyway. There was an orange swirl going clockwise that was my bedroom, then a green swirl going in the same direction, yet in the opposite direction. The geometry of what I saw is completely impossible to explain as it can not exist in our reality. The green swirl was my living room. I was running backwards and forwards between them as my reality was being sucked away. I didnt remember smoking the herb. I didnt remember what reality is or was as it was being pulled from beneath me. \r\nThis was almost complete ego loss and I was terrified. I mean, seriously, I had The Fear. I new that to bring reality back I had to be in the right room, but every time I reached one, I had to go back to the other way (the phrase kept repeating in my head) as the correct room had swapped again. I didnt want to be pulled along the twisting spiral and I tried to pull myself back by grabbing the banister of my stairs and pulling myself along. I could just do this, but it was more effort than I could ever explain. Also I should explain that I had no body and was using the hands of my mind.\r\nI am aware of the wooden porch my parents had when I was a child. I am also aware of how cross my mother is with me for being so stupid  screwing up my brain with this nightmare because I was a bit bored (I think the image/knowledge of my mother may represent the salvia itself  lady salvia, hey?). I try to say my name in my head but I cant finish it because a) I cant remember it all, b) it sounds ridiculous to me at the time, and c) language doesnt make sense. I try to say the name of where I live but I cant make language at all now.\r\nIm standing in my bedroom. Im confused and hot. I know Im in my room but I dont understand what the things in it are. Is this reality or somewhere else? Should I be here? Am I in someone elses house? I decide to find out if I really was running around the house. The door is unlocked. This confuses me, as I dont think I would have had the mental capacity to unlock a door. I creep down the hall and peek in the living room. The hall and the living room seem strange and disturbing I dont recognise them and I dont think Ive been here, although the scuffed carpet confuses me. I decide I definitely want to be in my bedroom. Im now just starting to get a handle on things. I change my T-shirt (Im really sweating). If I concentrate on something for a long time I know what it is, but if I concentrate too long I forget what everything else is, and I dont want reality to slip away again.\r\nI should mention that I still seriously had The Fear. Just remembering what happened in this much detail is still making me uncomfortable now. I want my girlfriend to come back and make it better (remember  no sitter = big problem) but I was scared she would be cross with me like my mum is/was. I also at some point around now spilt all the water out of my bong in attempt to put it away, because that might make it stop. I decide that acting normally will make me get better quickly, but TV seems so superficial and I cant concentrate on it. Plus as I said, when I concentrate I forget where I am. Also the TV program had an antique doll whos head had three different faces on it (this is true not a hallucination) which I didnt want to look at all  sill wouldnt. Adverts were OK. \r\nI spent the next hour/hour fifteen wandering between my bedroom and living room until my girlfriend came back. I instantly felt a bit better. I told her I was feeling confused by everything and she made everything seem better  God bless her.\r\nIn retrospect Lady Salvia is not benevolent, not malevolent either. I went straight to I (level 5) on the S-A-L-V-I-A scale, and I dont want to be there again. I had nightmares about that complete ego and reality loss that night. Sometimes I look at how ridiculous the world is and I worry that Im not back in reality proper. This is just over two weeks later. Initially I swore off salvia completely, but I noticed I havent thrown away what Ive got. It was a profound experience and I may try (MUCH less) salvia again. I would, however, recommend it to no one. But I am glad Ive done it, even if it was the single most terrifying experience of my life. No one should have to feel what its like to be pulled from reality and forget who they are and where they come from  this last one worried me most How do I know if Im back if I dont know where Im from?\r\nI needed to get this off my chest as Ive only just managed to integrate what happened. Incidentally, my housemate was upstairs the whole time and said that I was definitely NOT running around the house, so I dont know what was going on there.\n\n\n"
