 "report": "<p>I suffer from depression, sometimes with anxiety, and one of the side-effects is called 'leaden paralysis', an inability to get up from bed.</p><p>During my Junior year, this became quite frequent, and I began to miss a lot of school. My psychiatrist perscribed wellbutrin and provigil. It's been about a year, and I am now graduated from the High School that once encouraged me to seek alternate education. I went from missing 60 days out of 180 to only 8. Provigil gives me increased awareness and helps me get to school, as well as keep a regular sleeping patern. </p><p>A happy side-effect is the weight loss that accompanied the regular use of provigil. My metabolism increased dramatically, and I now weigh roughly 30 pounds lighter. I also eat less. This isn't surprising, considering the relation it has to amphetimines and other drugs commonly used to lose weight.</p><p>I continue to use other drugs, and I can give the following information:</p><p>With marijuana, there is no noticable effect. I have never noticed the high becoming shorter due to metabolizing. However, I generally only smoke marijuana in the afternoon or late night, long after the morning dose of provigil. In direct combination, I imagine the faster metabolic rate might affect the duration of the high.</p><p>With tobacco, I notice the stimulating effects of smoking are generally made more apparant. A cigarette before school often caused a euphoric lift and an increase in the 'stimulated' feeling. Mild, and not unpleasant. </p><p>I've noticed no effects on benzodiazepines such as xanax or lorazepam, nor does it seem to effect the Wellbutrin.</p><p>The various research chemicals I have tried are the only drugs that seem to cause a problem. On both 2c-t-2 and 2-c-t-21, I noticed headaches and body loads other trippers didn't feel. A low dose of LSD didn't seem to have any adverse reactions, but it was a single, stale hit. The problem, however, may not be due to the provigil, but instead due to the wellbutrin. </p><p>There have been no real problems in taking provigil. My school work was increasingly well done, and I finished sixth in my class. I also scored higher on my SAT. There was a lull before it started working fully, and it wasn't until at least a month after I began taking it that I noticed a real difference in sleep patterns. </p><p>I have never used this drug recreationally, nor do I plan on it. I am not generally a fan of recreational stimulants (excepting tobacco). The medical uses for this drug have been infinitely helpful to me.</p>"
