We start in the McDonalds, after biking about 5 kilometers.<br><br>
21:30 With a hamburger, took 50mg 6-APB orally. Felt a slight rush, but not a coming-up. Finished eating and biked about 500m to the beach party. The beach party itself was in a semi-regular bar arrangement with a collapsible tent adjacent where the DJs were. There was a large patio both in front of the bar and the tent. When I arrived the place was quite empty and the music was quite soft and slow (especially for techno standards).<br><br>
22:10 Started coming up. This happened a lot more quickly than my last experience, but also more intensely. Quite like the coming up of MDMA.<br><br>
22:30 Ingested about 15mg cocaine (insufflated). This was my first time using cocaine, so I kept it at a modest 15mg. The cocaine gave me energy, but didn't really enhance the 6-APB that was still coming up. To be honest, in my opinion, it's not worth the trouble, since it didn't have any noticeable affect on the 6-APB.<br><br>
22:45 Orally ingested the remaining 50mg pf 6-APB. Started rolling well on the first 50mg (taken at 21:30). The cocaine was still noticeable in the background but already fading. The energy supplied by the cocaine was now being supplied by the 6-APB. Just as with MDMA, the music became more pronounced and I had energy for 3. Inside, the temperature was quite warm, and I started sweating, but not in extreme amounts.<br><br>
23:15 Orally ingested one unit of alcohol. The slight energy-boost of alcohol was felt, but I was rolling deep on the 6-APB, so it added just a slight bump.<br><br>
23:50 Orally ingested one standard sized can of Redbull energy drink, as the rolling had hit a little valley. The Redbull increased the affects in a slight but noticable fashion and made the high even higher. I still had energy for 3, and I continued sweating at a normal rate.<br><br>
02:15 Orally ingested MDMA powder. I wasn't paying attention and dipped my index finger instead of my little finger. The MDMA tasted salty/sour/bitter, and gave me a very slight tingling/numbing sensation on my lips and cheeks (on the inside).<br><br>
02:25 Felt a slight buzz signaling the coming up of the MDMA, but otherwise just rolling from the 6-APB.<br><br>
02:40 MDMA came up like a rocket. I needed to sit down and get some air. I started panicking because it was all so extreme. My hands were trembling and I was sweating pretty heavily. I looked up the symptoms of an MDMA overdose online so that I knew what I needed to look for if things were to take a turn for the worse. In hindsight, the feeling was amazing: not nauseous, tingles over my entire body, blurred vision and light visual hallucinations of lights. Extreme coming up. Once I got over the initial shock, by far the best coming up yet. I sat down, relaxed, and talked with my friends who were there to support me and quide me. My friends had taken 6-APB and one had also done a line of cocaine. They were trying 6-APB for the first time, and were quite satisfied. Once they realized I had taken a bit too much MDMA, they made sure they stayed with me the rest of the night. But as mentioned, after the initial shocks and tremors, the experience was unlike any I've ever had.<br><br>
03:30 Rolling incredibly hard on the 6-APB and MDMA mix. The shock wore off, but the energy was still there. I noticed that I was sweating heavily, more than before for the same amount of exercise. The best approximation of the feeling is an orgasm. It's cliche but true. Everything was beautiful, I had boundless energy, everything in my body felt good.<br><br>
04:00 Left the party and started biking home. The weather was a tiny bit chilly, but the movement canceled the chill out. The experience of biking was extremely satisfying, the wind blowing across my extremities was godly (especially since I had been sweating so much). Arrived at the station at 04:25 and needed to wait 15 minutes. The time flew by.<br><br>
04:50 While biking home, noticed that the razor edge was wearing off. Still rolling hard, but not as incredibly hard as a half hour ago.<br><br>
05:15 I couldn't sit still and definitely not sleep so I decided to go for a walk. Music going, everything is lighter (except my legs, as I was dancing all night). Bruxism really starting to become noticeably annoying.<br><br>
05:40 Still rolling but becoming more aware of the physical fatigue. Mentally still wide awake. Bruxism of course not abating.<br><br>
05:55 After walking about 2km, the physical fatigue is quite apparent. Mental fatigue is starting up slowly, but by no means is the roll over.<br><br>
06:10 Orally ingested 41 mg Centrum brand multivitamins.<br><br>
06:15 After walking about three kilometers, I came home to lay on my bed. Still listening to music and mental fatigue is noticeable. I am able to still concentrate on one activity, which is interesting because I have ADHD, and being inactive usually does nothing to quell the symptoms.<br><br>
07:10 Mental fatigue is becoming increasingly more noticeable. Physically my legs are worn out, but the sensation of aching muscles is so... sweet. That's the only way I can describe it. My legs ache, but not in a solely-adverse fashion. The bruxism is painful, but to be expected.<br><br>
Conclusion: 6-APB and MDMA worked together to give me an incredible night. I have never rolled so hard; I was on a rocketship to Mars. If I could do it again, I would use less MDMA powder, since the coming up really shook me. The experience was overall a positive one!<!-- End Body -->
