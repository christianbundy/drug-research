 "report": "<p>\nI have been a long time user of MDMA and never really experienced any negative side effects, well the noramal fuzzy head and what not but no emotional drain.  My last experience with mdma was quite different though.  I took three pills of pure unpressed mdma over a 6-8 hour span. I rolled possibly the hardest I have ever rolled in my life, if not the hardest at least in the top 3 times.  The odd part is that the next day I felt tired and run down, not out of the ordinary.  Two days after the experience my emotions started to peak and valley.  In a wierd very uncomfortable way.  </p><p>I found myself experiencing waves of anxiety dealing with situations that a day previous I had been completly comfortable with.  I felt very unloved and removed from my girlfriend.  Also I recieved a phone call from my parents and it nearly brought me to tears.  The closest way I can explain this feeling was having a itch on your brain but not having anyway to make it better.  Nothing I did seem to make me happy. Also I questioned everything that I thought was solid in my life.  I freaked out about some really trivial things and couldn't figure out why.  I have been taking 5-htp and meditating to try and ward off these negative feelings.</p>"
