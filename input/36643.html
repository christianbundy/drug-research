Today I had a cross country meet and I decided to test an idea that I had got a few months ago. I was reading an article that caffeine was tested for as a performance enhancer in man aerobic sports (marathons, cross country, anything lasting more than 5 min.). <br><br>
I decided to take 7 200mg caffeine pills an hour before the race so my caffeine levels would peak just before the start of the race. I warmed up, and about 2 minutes before the start of the race, my hands went completely numb. I shrugged it off and decided that it wasn't a big deal. The gun went off and I imediately took first place and held the position untill the last 400 meters when my head began to throb with pain. I was passed, but I managed to get second place. <br><br>
Right after crossing the finish line, I was handed a bottle of water. I downed it and walked over to a fence where I began to vomit. I usually vomit after I race, but I began to panic after 20 minutes of vomiting. I checked my heart rate and it was at 140. 45 minutes after the race, I begining to vomit bile. <br><br>
I found my mom, who is a nurse practitioner, and told her what happened. She said that I would be alright and I could go to the ER if I wanted to. I opted out because I didn't want my coach to find out what I had done in fear of being disqualified and kicked off the team. I spent the next 12 hours trying to fight the caffeine. I was puking every 20 minutes and I had to drink a glass of water everytime I puked or I would puke up bile the next go around. I was able to eat a candy bar and a few bites of cereal before I went to bed.<br><br>
I was able to sleep for about 2 hours, and I just woke up. My legs are very sore, they are keeping me awake with the pain. My resting heart rate is down to 70 now. I am still vomiting, and I don't see and end to it anytime soon. <br><br>
In conclusion, if you want to use Caffeine in high dosages, don't. It was probably one of the stupidest things I have ever done. I wouldn't recomend taking more than 300mg of Caffeine at any one time. It is a terrible existance to overdose on the shit. I don't doubt caffeine's ability to improve endurance, I ran a very good time and raced pretty well. I just don't believe that it was worth it one bit. <br><br>
Peace,<br>
