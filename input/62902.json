 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nRhodiola rosea is wonderful!  \r\nI have been consuming 350mg. r. rosea in pill form every morning for the past month.  In retrospective summary, I can say the following:\r\n - r. rosea is mentally stimulating, yet does not contain any of the negative effects associated with other stimulants I have used, such as caffeine or amphetamine.\r\n - r. rosea increases physical endurance, easily noticed in aerobic activities such as running, and swimming.\r\n - r. rosea provides me with a clear state-of-mind, and a general sense of peace.\r\n - r. rosea was helpful to me in simultaneous cessation of my tobacco and amphetamine addictions.\r\n - r. rosea is wonderful.\n\n\n"
