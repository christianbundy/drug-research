As I am writting this, I cannot sleep from the fear of hallucinating and extreme paranoia. This is almost a year after going on my last trip of Diphenhydramine. I cannot remember exactly what happened the three times I took it, but I will do my best. Honestly, I don't even want to remember, but this may help somebody out there.<br><br>
The first night I took Diphenhydramine, I went into another world. I itched, I had cotton mouth beyond control, and worst of all, I was afraid to open my eyes due to hard hallucinations. Most of the hallucinations were bugs and spiders. These scared the hell out of me. I saw them everywhere. The reflection of my friend looked like a lion. This seems fun, but it wasn't.<br><br>
To this day, I still hallucinate. I often wake up in the middle of the night and see snakes, spiders, and other bugs. I constantly jump out of the bed 3 am in the morning because I'm hallucinating. I will dream these hallucinations and when I wake up, the object is still there, but the surroundings are not that of my dream rather what I'm actually seeing. I'm messed up for life. I lie in bed closing my eyes still I see shit. I'm fucked up permanetely. I would do anything to have my old self back. Anything. I thought life was hard before I used drugs, well, it's a lot harder now. I'm paranoid over stupid shit. That tweaked up guy who sits in the corner resembling a drug addict you see in books and TV, that's me.<br><br>
Many are okay from it and I'm aware of that. I'm not overdoing this. I've done plenty of Meth and I've never been like this since I've done this drug. I regret it. I could cry and that pisses me off that I'm this low in life.<br><br>
Stick to Weed and Alchohol. That is, assuming you just want to get fucked up and your not a speed freak or anything. It's worth it in the end.<!-- End Body -->
