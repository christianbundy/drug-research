We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
So I had nothing to do tonite, I had also used up my last bit of weed and wasn't picking up a new bag till tomorrow. No liquer in the house and nothing else to fuck me up.<br><br>
I decided to try some Computer Duster. This was my second time doing it. The first time I only had one or two small hits out of an almost empty can (most of it was used the correct way on my keyboard).<br><br>
I took about 4 hits off the new can. I held each in for about 20 seconds before blowing out. Nothing happened for a while, but soon the feelings I had felt before started to appear. Fuzzy feeling in my forhead and my vision blurred. I didn't notice any darkened or tunnel vision because my room is pretty dark and I only have my TV and computer turned on. Soon though, some new things started to happen. I could hear my heartbeat perfectly and I could feel the air around me. I could feel my existance and everything else's existance pulsating through my body and my head.<br><br>
I started to hear a droning buzzing sound along with the pouding. I lost control of my neck muscles and my head bobbed back and forth while I moaned and laughed at myself and the experience. My voice sounded a bit deeper, but not as deep as in the other reports I've read on Erowid. I took 2 more hits and held them in.<br><br>
The droning got louder and the vibrations of existance became stronger. Family Guy was on, and I stared at the tv, but I didn't really see the show. My eyes were open, but I didn't see anything through them. I didn't need to see. I could feel vibrations of the world around me. I sat in the chair for about 2 minutes like this, and then started to come down.<br><br>
As I'm writing this, I still feel a bit light-headed. It was a good experience and I'm glad I did it. However, I dont think I'll be doing it that much as it obviously does some brain damage, and I dont want to end up drooling in a padded room when i turn 30.<!-- End Body -->
