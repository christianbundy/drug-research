Let me first start by saying that I am a novice to alcohol (or any drugs, for that matter).  The experience I am about to tell you was approximately my sixth time ever getting drunk . . . which would explain my complete and utter stupidity.<br><br>
My previous few experiences with this particular liquor (Bacardi Limon) were mild at best.  I began slowly, starting at three shots and so on.  But I was never feeling the drunk I was craving.  A good buzz that would disappear too quickly.  This was not acceptable if I wanted to enter the club scene.  My drunks were weak and short-lived, unless mixed with another alcohol such as vodka or beer.<br><br>
To add to it, my tolerance to the fluid was building quite quickly.  Soon, six shots would hold the same effect as three.<br><br>
Finally, I said 'Fuck it' and purchased 12 shots from a friend.  (Dosage confusion arises here.  Twelve 1 oz. shots should obviously equal 12 oz.  But it filled a 16.9 oz. bottle nearly to the top.  Still trying to figure it out.)<br><br>
Did I plan on finishing the entire bottle in one night?  Not exactly.<br><br>
As soon as the night began, I was pumped.  I thought it would be nice to get piss-drunk for a change, so I started downing the bastards one after the other.  I mean, I would literally take another shot directly after the previous, using only swift sips of O.J. to mask the bitter taste.  I do not know what got into me, but I was a madman.<br><br>
About thirty minutes or less had passed before I had destroyed the entire 16.9 oz. bottle.  Was I insane?  Apparently I had underestimated the power of liquor. . . .<br><br>
'Whoa,' I said, spinning.  'I need to get this drunk *every* night!'  I did not realize that the effects I was receiving -- which were pretty fucking strong -- were as a result of only about a fourth of what I had consumed.  The first fourth, hehe.<br><br>
'It hasn't hit you yet, bro.'<br><br>
And that is when I choked.  It had occured to me that I was about to take a journey.  A long and miserable journey that I never want to encounter again.<br><br>
That exchange in dialogue was the last thing I remember. . . .<br><br>
Suddenly, I wake up outside on the concrete in the freezing cold.  I hear a vaccuum cleaner whining inside.  I hear people in a silly tone of voice, but with a hint of panic.  What the hell just happened?<br><br>
What sucks is that I only remember the HORRIBLE part of the night.  The part where I attempted to recover from what was probably alcohol poisoning.  I am covered in puke.  People are around me, feeding me water, taking pictures, laughing, staring, asking questions (like I can answer them).  Out of nowhere, vomit sprays from my mouth.  This is not a case where you can control it.  I felt no warning signs that I was about to puke.  It just fell out.  And the worst part was that it was all over me.<br><br>
I was in such terrible condition that I was literally laying in my own puke.  The icing on the cake was that it was on my new clothes I had purchased just hours earlier!  The smell was rancid, and the people around me were going nuts (all while laughing and thinking it to be 'cool').  I heard hacking in the background.  My friend was also puking, only it sounded more like prolonged dry heaves.  Oh, the sight it was!<br><br>
The night was long.  I mean, the longest, most miserable night I can recall.  The fact that it was freezing did not help much either.  The most potent simile I can conjur up would be that I felt as though I was going through heroin withdrawal.<br><br>
It is not fun to sleep in your own puke on hard concrete in winter weather.  Especially when that constant feeling of 'I'm going to vomit again' is hovering over you.  When I woke up (yes, I slept there all night and even got up to go inside and piss!), I felt that if I moved to go home, which was quite a distance, I would hurl again.  But I eventually forced myself to ride my bike back without a shirt on.<br><br>
The next day was torture as well.  I *had* to eat, no doubt, but when I ate, I puked.  I was sick and tired all day.  The alcohol was taking its sweet-ass time to free me from my personal Hell.<br><br>
To add to the pain, I was slave to the people whose house I painted with vomit.  I had to scrub up the stank all day.  And washing the shirt that spent a night soaking in throw-up was not an easy task either.  The experience was NOT what I would call 'cool'.<br><br>
Little blanks here and there were filled in by my friends.  They said I was doing all kinds of stupid things.  I was wobbling around, knocking over people's drinks, staring blankly at uniform objects.  What is so odd -- and I have never before experienced this -- was that I do not remember a goddamn thing.  Besides getting punched in the balls (which still hurt), the heroin withdrawal feeling (wish I forgot), and a few minutes of following my friends around (annoying them, I guess), it is all a blank.  Especially hurling all over their living room floor!<br><br>
Looking back on it is fun, sure, but the experience was a mess.  Sure, I now have a rep for being an insane drinker (remember, my tolerance is low, as well as my body weight) . . . but I would never want to go through it again.  Smelling Bacardi brings home memories -- I doubt I will drink it any time soon.<br><br>
I have (crime scene) pictures to show my grandkids, and we all get a kick out of laughing about it.  However, I would take this as a warning:  ALCOHOL IS A POWERFUL DRUG!  My first time alco-puking will hopefully be my last!<!-- End Body -->
