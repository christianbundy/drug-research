<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body -->
T - 0:00 - Consumed tea consisting of 2 flowers and 2 leaves (Datura inoxa and Datura metel).<br><br>
T - 0:10 - Feel anxious. <br><br>
T - 0:20 - Feel slightly stoned. Similar to small dose of cannabis.<br><br>
T - 0:25 - Quite dizzy and tired. Focusing is difficult. Movements are exaggerated. A 5 degree rotation of my head feels like 45 degrees. The cannabis like buzz is transforming into something unfamiliar.<br><br>
T - 0:30 - Mild sedation with an intense drawn out rush. Struggling to keep eyes open. Feel peaceful enough to just be.<br><br>
T - 0:40 - Sat in meditation for 10 minutes. Reality doesnt feel right.<br><br>
T - 0:42 - Balance slightly off. Floating and sinking at the same time.<br><br>
T - 0:45 - Mouth very dry. Strong heartbeat.<br><br>
T - 0:55 - Body feels extremely drunk. No euphoria or disassociation.<br><br>
T - 1:00 - Eyes bloodshot and pupils dilated.<br><br>
T - 1:05 - Desperately need to lay down. <br><br>
T- 1:08 - Get in bed. I get up every 30 minutes to use the toilet.<br><br>
T - 3:00 - Im walking in the countryside with my dog. I try to call her name but cant speak. Within a split second Im home watching television with the remote control in my hand. I keep trying to change channel but cant focus on the buttons. <br><br>
T- 3:01 - Remote control vanishes and I realise Im sat up in bed arm outstretched pressing my empty palm. Then I realize Im not even watching television. I dont have a TV in my room.<br><br>
T- 3:15 - I must have been sleeping for a while. My dreams are more real than reality.<br><br>
T- 3:16 - Eyes shaking from side to side. Feel too ill to relax. Exhausted but cant keep still. I wander from bedroom to bathroom 7 or 8 times then sit on the edge of my bed.<br><br>
T- 3:17- Mouth ridiculously dry. I have water but swallowing is too painful.<br><br>
T- 3:18 - A girl is standing in my doorway waving at me. A small child appears next to her. I approach to see if they are real but they disappear when I get close.<br><br>
T- 3:19 - I step back and the girls reappear. I notice a snake behind my stereo, worms in my bed and spiders on my door. The floor is covered with food. I reach for some but it disappears. My dog multiplies. I can see 3 of her. <br><br>
T- 3:20- Turn lights on to make some notes. All the hallucinations disappear when the lights come on but everything now has rainbow trails like HPPD.<br><br>
T- 6:00 - Ive been watching people gather in my hallway for 3 hours.<br><br>
T-6:15- Fall asleep (3:30am). Very lucid dreaming. This was the most enjoyable part of the experience because the unpleasant physical effects were left behind. The dreaming state was clearer than the waking state. I occasionally wake up next to a porcelain head then realize its actually my pillow.<br><br>
T- 13:15- Panic attack (10:30am). I calm down when I realize where I am.<br><br>
T- 17:00- Motor control back to normal.<br><br>
T- 21:00- Vision back to normal. Eyes no longer dilated. Overall an interesting but rather unpleasant experience.<!-- End Body -->
