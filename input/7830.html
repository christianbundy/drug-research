All right, I have done a lot of researching on the internet about DXM and stuff, so one night I decided to go down to our fry's and get some. I had done Robitussin and stuff before, but I couldn't handle the taste. I remembered somewhere it said one of the products was really bad for you but I couldn't remember; I thought it was the Contac cold tabs. So I got the Coricidin cause it had 30 mg of DXM in it. So I wait till 12 and pop 8 of them. I figure since I've had doses of about 200 mg of DXM before that this would just be like a tipsy, fun experience. I was wrong.<br><br>
It didn't start to kick in till about 2 in the morning. I started to lose concentration while on the computer. I couldn't focus on anything for a long period of time. Then I went to go get a drink of water, and when I got up it still felt like I was sitting down. When I walked down the hall everything around me was just one big blur except for the object I was looking at ahead of me. So right now I'm thinking, Hell yeah, this is pretty cool.<br><br>
Eventually the trip was beginning to get more and more intense. Suddenly my heart beat jumps up to twice it's rate, and my breathing is so heavy. Right there I thought I was gonna die. I tried to calm down by listening to some light music, but that only helped for a couple minutes. I needed to go to the bathroom really bad so I got up, and I still felt like I was sitting down. I walked to the bathroom, and I almost passed out. Everything got really fuzzy, and when I was standing, I heard this loud POP! I didn't know what it was. It sounded real, but it sounded fake. I kept hearing these metallic sounds, and by now I was freaked out. So I went back to the computer and was telling my friends how freaked out this was. By now I was at the peak of my trip and it was about 4 in the morning. I eventually calmed down a little bit, and thought I could sleep. So I told my friend I was all right, and I went to bed. I kept waking up, and then my room started to shake, and my mind was going insane.<br><br>
I said I can't handle this and got back on the computer. My friend was still on, and I asked him how long I was asleep for. He said 5 minutes. I was like what the hell! Now I couldn't even move thinking that if I did, it would mess with something in my body and I would die. I was shaking like crazy, and I kept hearing all this shit. My room is really dark because I put aluminum foil over the windows to keep it cool, so at 5 AM I decided I would go out and get some water even though I thought I would die because I would pass out and stop breathing.  So when I went out of my room it was light out, and that all of a sudden made me calm. Like I was out of a bad dream. My heart still hurt but I made it to bed. It's 3 days after I did that and my heart still hurts, and it hurts when I take big breaths.<br><br>
My advice to anyone is don't mess with Coricidin. DXM is fine in other forms, just don't go crazy with it. It seriously isn't worth it at all. The whole time I wasn't enjoying my high at all. I was worrying if I was gonna die. I hope that my body isn't really messed up because of that. I've read all the bad trips about the Coricidin before I did this, and I thought, Oh, their body just reacted bad. Everybody that I've known that has done that brand has the same story. My one friend thought he was dead. Stick to Robitussin and Vicks or whatever. DON'T DO CORICIDIN. <br><br>
Thanks. Be safe and have fun.<!-- End Body -->
