 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nBackground: 29 year old male.  6'2' 250lbs.  Very experienced with psychedelic drugs.  <br>Going into this experience, I had been quite stressed from personal financial matters and work related complications.  I have the house to myself for the night.  Girlfriend is gone for the night, and the roommate is out of town.  My dog will be keeping me company.  I had a few beers in the afternoon(between 2:30 and 3:30).  Followed by hydrating, and relaxing.  I ate an early dinner.  Around 5:30.  2 slices of pizza.<br>7:52pm I opened a beer to relax my nerves.  I plan to consume about half of it before dosing the AL-LAD.  I will wash down the 4-aco-DMT with a few sips of beer.<br>8:08pm dose placed on tongue<br>8:16pm AL-LAD onset is always super quick.  Warmth, slight alertness, light headed buzz, and euphoria.  Tab still is in my mouth.<br>8:20pm tab swallowed<br>8:23pm 4-aco-DMT consumed orally<br>8:25pm Very alert.  At a ++<br>Still nursing my beer.  About to put on some music.<br>8:31pm I let the dog out to pee, plus took a few rips off my kratom vape pen.  Feeling really good.  I am sweating.  Which is normal for these psychedelics.<br>8:42pm very smooth come up.  I feel the speedy component of the tryptamine as well as the dream state of the ergoline.  The dream state will over take it, I know this<br>8:55pm Tracers present.  Very tactile feel.  Loss of ego present.  I feel very connected.  Thinking a lot about my relationship with my wonderful girlfriend.  Rooms and my phone are breathing.  Huge connection with my fellow man.<br>Little to no body load for me.<br>9:01pm minor closed eyed and open eyed visuals<br>9:18pm still at ++<br>Enjoying the introspection and the CEV's<br>Thought a lot about the tendencies and actions of an old addict friend I haven't spoken with in years.  I miss him despite all his short comings.<br>I reflected on my own short comings.  How I can be wasteful or irresponsible.  How I have slowly been making changes.<br>9:31pm shooting up to +++<br>Visuals intensifying.  Thoughts quite profound.  Pondering my death.  My life.  Connections.  What is and isn't worth doing?<br>Some mild stomach discomfort<br>9:49pm still some stomach discomfort.  Trip is intense.  Shower curtain is vibrating.  Like a water fountain tumbling down.<br>10:04pm stomach discomfort dissipating.  Still at +++<br>10:31pm<br>Stomach discomfort completely gone.  Really high.  Just took several rips of kratom.  It really potentates the trip.  Cracked beer #2<br>10:44pm cracked beer #3. Def past the peak.  At a ++ right now.<br>11:00pm I just ate some Indian garlic fried rice, leftovers.  Taste is incredible.  Very spicy.  I am sweating profusely from it.<br>Post Trip notes:<br>Between 11pm and 3am, I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and then the Big Lebowski.  I administered St. John's Wort, Valerian Root, and Melatonin to myself around 3am.  I feel asleep right before 4am.  I woke up around 7am.  <br>I had a hangover from drinking 8 high gravity beers, plus the usual feel from synthetic psychedelics.  By the afternoon, I felt fine.  I rested, and exercised (as sweating out the toxins is the best means to recovery).  <br>Overall it was a great trip.  I never really got too out there.  It also never really reached the level of intensity I desired, but that was also expected given the dosage of each substance.  As a side note, I find kratom to be an excellent substitute for marijuana when it is absent or not available.  I had purchased an e-cig from a local head shop which had a kratom cartridge in it.  It def helped in the trip and intensified the trips at times.\n\n\n"
