Herbs had been my hot topic for a little while now and through my many searches the california poppy popped up. It looked like a drug that could potentially replace my sleep aids and with that in mind, I set off to gain a supply. Upon receiving it from an online vendor I preceded to make a tea out of the red flowers. I used about 2 teaspoons in a coffee mug of water. I let that sit for about 30 mins along with a tea bag of apple cider flavoring. This resulted in a very dark red liquid that stained anything that it touched.<br><br>
The taste of this liquid was not enjoyable. In fact it was rather unbearable seeing on how I could only finish it after holding my nose shut and drinking all of the liquid at once. It took about 30 mins for the stuff to kick in and I started to feel the sedating effects. The effects seamed to max out around the 1 hour mark and it stayed there until the 1.5 to 2 hour mark when I started to feel the effects subside. I could of at any point during this event fallen asleep but I wanted to 1st know the full limits of the drug.<br><br>
In conclusion it has great potential for a sleep aid. It could also maybe help flush some stuff out of your system if your were in going in for a drug test at work since it makes you go to the bathroom frequently. I really dont see any addictive qualities that I could find since it would be a worthless recreational drug.<br><br>
