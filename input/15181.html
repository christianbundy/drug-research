I had a most intense experience recently with the combination of Tramadol, DXM, and a little marijuana. I started off by taking 150 milligrams of tramadol. Since it usually takes 2 hours to hit me, I waited an hour and then took 100 milligrams of DXM, so that the two would come on at the same time. When they did, I experienced a mild and pleasant general painkilling effect, similar to a strong hydrocodone buzz. <br><br>
After a bit, I shared a joint with a friend, and that's where the intensity began. I immediately got a rush of euphoria and was getting very sleepy. Time was going very slowly, and my throat dried up like sand. I could no longer walk straight. I attempted to walk around my apartment complex to get some fresh air. I wobbled and stumbled around outside. It seemed to take forever to get anywhere. I could not feel my body at all. I was totally numb. Mentally, the same thing began to happen. As the marijuana wore off, I found myself in a profoundly 'dumb' state. The painkilling effect was so great that I could not think incredibly deeply, and later, when I listened to music, it seemed dull and uninteresting. My imagination was almost blank. <br><br>
I must admit, this buzz was NOT the most pleasant in the world. It was too much for me. I felt more fucked up than I wanted to be. I enjoy a nice buzz. With this, I was just 'trashed'. My eyes were glassy and dilated (from the DXM). At one point I slurred a comment to my friend that I felt like I was on acid and drunk.<br><br>
I had read before trying this combo that DXM is used medically to potentiate the effects of painkillers, so that patients can take less of their pain meds and lessen dependance. I urge strong caution here, however. It was indeed true. I get only a mild buzz from either the tramadol at 150mg, or DXM at 100mg, but the combination of the two turned out to be more than I wanted. And the marijuana, I am positive, intensified it even more.<br><br>
The effects lasted around 5 hours, and I fell into a deep sleep. I awoke feeling fine the next day, with no sign of a hangover.<br><br>
I may try this combo again, however I would lessen the dose of DXM by half, and probably avoid the marijuana until at least halfway though the experience.<!-- End Body -->
