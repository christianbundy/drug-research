I'm 40, in good health. I smoke MJ, I quit tobacco several months ago.  Amounts are estimated.<br><br>
I ordered some Catuaba bark from an online shop. It's used in Brasil as an aphrodisiac. The add said that it is a nervous system tonic and is cool to use with pot, to reduce paranoia and irritation.  Well, if that stuff is an aphrodisiac, it must be in the S&amp;M scene. I tried it once as a tea, with a little amount ( 1 g ) without feeling much.<br><br>
Yesterday, I tried a tea with 2 or 2.5 g. I let it boil for 20 mn and then cool down for 10 mn. The tea is dark red. A beautiful color, deeper than cinnamon or sassafras teas. I drank it quickly. It tastes good, not very strong. It tastes better than sassafras, but not as good as cinnamon. I started to feel something almost instantly, but I always do with herbal teas. Sometimes, I think that i could use hot water as a drug. <br><br>
Catuaba belongs to the  Erythroxylum family, which includes Coca. After 10-20 mn, i felt an effect, which was obviously not a placebo (unlike the kind of 'high'  I get when drinking teas). Catuaba is definitely a stimulant. But I can't see why it's called an aphrodisiac. I had absolutely no loved up nor horny feeling. I was concentrated in what I was doing, but less than with ephedra. My heart was deeply pumping, but not in a weird way, more regularly than with caffeine. It was a bit like with C, but less strong. Though I was able to work in productive way, i was easily irritated by small things. I was alone, but I guess that I would have been aggressive toward other people. The whole effect lasted 4 hours and slowly worn off. I guess I was still a bit excited 7 hours later. No side effect nor hangover of any kind. 5 hours after having drunk the tea, while the effect was wearing off, I smoked some pot. I felt still stimulated, but in a more cool state of mind. To me, pot must be used to remove the Catuaba irritation, and not the opposite. <br><br>
Catuaba is cheap, effective, and doesn't produce adverse side effects (at the dose I used). It's more a stimulant for work than anything else.<!-- End Body -->
