 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing numerous reports about 2C-T-7 on the net and looking for something new I decided to try some of it. I bought 500 mg and cut out a dose of approximately 11mg. I snorted it and instantly I had a horrible burning pain in my nose and throat. <br>After about a minute of laying on the kitchen floor trying to not focus on the horrid pain I jumped up and went to the bathroom where i proceeded to throw up through my nose and my mouth. It was at this point I started seeing insane visuals. Awesome trails, psychadelic color patterns and all the normal things that you come to expect from tripping. The only thing was I couldnt enjoy it well because I was steadily throwing up my guts.<br>After the being sick routine was over I was in another world! More intense visuals than acid and I started to feel as if it was having a dissassociative affect on me kind of like ketamine has on me. But don't mistake me it is no replacement for Ketamine.<br>I kept finding myself losing concentration easily and music sounded very good to me, listening to music almost seemed to put me in a relaxed laid back manner.<br>Overall the experience was great, but the horrible 15 minutes i spent in my bathroom were like hell!\n\n\n"
