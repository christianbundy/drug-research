I was given a 'mitsubishi'-looking pill by a friend of mine.  I took it at a well-known dance club in chicago on gay night.  I thought I would have a well-being feeling, would feel connected, and would have an experience similar to other first-timers that had a positive experience.  The crowd on gay night is very accepting (and, from what i've heard, very heavy X users), so I thought I'd be okay, surrounded by 'family'.<br><br>
In fact, it was the opposite.  When it hit me, I immediately became anxious, like 'this is horrible - when does it end?'  my digestive system began functioning on what I can only call a 'hyperactive' state - I had to use the bathroom three times in one half-hour.  The toilets were so crowded I had to cut in line, apologizing, and then immediately go to the back of the line to use them again.  I was so tense I thought my brain was going to explode.  Worse yet, my car was in a parking lot that would close at 5am, and if I didn't get it out of the lot, it would get towed.  This meant that I had to drive.  I could have drove it about 100' to street parking:  even if it was an illegal spot, and I got ticketed, that was better than getting stopped while driving while toasted.<br><br>
But because I was toasted, I didn't think correctly, and I decided to drive.  This was worse than any acid trip I ever took in the '60s. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font><br><br>
I drove to a hotel not far away.  It was the worst drive of my life.  If a cop had stopped me, I would have been arrested.  For me, based on my sexual orientation and gender, that *could not* happen.  I didn't think about what to do with the car before taking the X - *Big Mistake*.  It was one of the most tense, anxious nights of my life.<br><br>
At the hotel, within minutes *everyone* knew I was toasted.  My pupils must have been the size of dimes.  I went up to my room, went to bed, and just shook for hours.<br><br>
Was it X?  Was it speed?  Was it cut with baby laxative?  What was it?  I don't know and I don't care.  *I will NEVER take it or anything purporting to be it again*.  Reality feels so good now, I hardly even drink, and take no 'recreational pharmaceutical' drugs whatsoever.<br><br>
Some people say X is wonderful.  I say the whole thing sucked.  At the end of the day, it's your body, it's your brain, it's your life.  Caveat emptor.  Whatever you do, do NOT drive.  Please!<!-- End Body -->
