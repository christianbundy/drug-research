On Friday, February 21st, 2003, I went to a party at a friends house.  I had been very depressed for a week or two.  At around 12 I insufflated 40 mg of 2C-C.  I heavily drank beer.  I either lost or ate another 40 mg capsule at some later point, I can't remember.  I had a similar as before, but much more sedated.  Trails of dots following cigarettes, rapidly jumping thoughts, etc...<br><br>
When I woke up at noon on Saturday, the 22nd, I immediately insufflated 120 mg of 2C-C.  I broke it into two lines and snorted 1, then the other about 10 minutes later.  I had to focus to do the second line.  I was still a little under the influence from Friday, and it hit me fast.  I heard voices, laughed continuously, saw quick lines of color, had rapid thoughts trying to find significance in the most basic ideas and processes, and felt extremely internal.  I went outside and laid down on the stairs, cold rain drizzling on me.<br><br>
After around 20 minutes I went inside and lay down on the couch and became very cold, yelling and laughing for blankets.  At this larger dose, I felt complete vertigo, both physically and mentally.  I wanted company, but felt like a burden to my friends who were there.  I could not stand or light my own cigarette.  I laughed, and talked little.  The vertigo is the part that was completely new; its hard to describe.  Just a strong desire to pull all the way inside myself until .<br><br>
I had many questions that I asked myself, but few answers.  This lasted strong for around 4-5 hours.  I went home, and my internal thoughts turned into dazed depression.  I cried and felt hopeless.  I had been feeling very down for the last couple of weeks, and this brought it all down on me heavily.  I ate some pizza with my friend and smoked a few bowls of pot.<br><br>
I remained depressed until I went to sleep at around 10.  I felt much, much better the next day.  I don't think I will take that quantity of a substance I don't know that much about again when I am depressed.  It was a learning experience, though.  It gave me several deep questions about myself that I am soberly contemplating.  I do not regret the experience.<!-- End Body -->
