After doing much research about DXM, I decided to go for it. I swallowed 6.8oz of Robitussin Maximum Strengh, and this is what happened:<br><br>
Within the the first three hours after taking the drug,I had some interesting experiences with my eyes closed, abstract imagery and linguisticly hard to define concepts; It all had a dark and negative feeling to it, heavy is a good word to discribe it. Thanks God I was psychologically prepared and did not freak out, but it was NOT a pleasant experience. Then about three hours after I had taken the drug, I started feeling sick, really sick. This are some of the symtoms I experienced:<br><br>
- All of my body felt extremely itchy.<br>
- I experienced chills and sweat.<br>
- The worst headache I have ever experienced.<br>
- Comfusion, like daydream nightmares.<br>
- Heat waves all over my body.<br>
- Nausea and vomit.<br>
- Fever.<br><br>
I was looking for a spiritual experience, but this is what I got.  I came to the conclusion that I had an allergic reaction to the high dose of cough medicine I took. I was confident when I decided to do this drug, the amount of research I did on the subject made me feel like I knew what I was doing. I did not. I learned an important lesson, everybody is different and so are their reactions to a drug.<br><br>
Never ever again.<!-- End Body -->
