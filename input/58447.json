 "report": "<p>I took 600mg Adrafinil at 8 a.m. on an empty stomach along with my usual morning gingko, tea, blood pressure meds, etc.</p><p>Like the first time I tried piracetam, I noticed within an hour that women looked better.  I did not feel much of a buzz until 4 hours later when I went into work.  I applied myself with intensity and focus but I felt too revved to be at ease.  I was more talkative, alert, and faster paced but it had what felt like a bit of an amphetamine edge. It was difficult to relax or even smile though my mood was definitely good.  </p><p>Eight hours into it I definitely felt wired but not terribly anxious though I was worried enough to check my blood pressure. It was way high (145/92).  By hour 16 I was compelled to write some poetry, something I haven't done in years.</p><p>I went to bed a few hours after my usual time but my sleep was very thin and spotty.  Next morning I'm still in a good mood considering not sleeping.</p><p>Sex is better, too.</p>"
