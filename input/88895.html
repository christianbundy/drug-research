For a while now I have been hearing all the news about K2 and these other incenses that contain JWH-018, and it has gotten me very interested.<br><br>
I did some research on line, read about peoples horrible experiences, and there was a common trend amongst most of them  these people underestimated what they were dealing with, expected it to be weak, smoked way too much and had a horrible experience.<br>
I bought some K2 ultra, which was supposed to be the strongest concentration 1gram JWH-018 per ounce of herbal blend. Keep in mind I hadnt smoked pot or anything in over 4 years. Mostly because I had been getting very paranoid while smoking it so I quit.<br><br>
My first experience was very intense. I packed about a tsp amount of herbal blend into a pipe and took a pretty strong hit and held it in for about 20 seconds. Upon breathing out I realized I took one hell of a wicked drag. I waited a couple minutes, and noticed only slight changes in consciousness so I took another hit.<br><br>
10 minutes in it was coming on hard, very hard and very fast. Everything was in slow motion and the old paranoia I was feeling from pot years ago was coming back hard. But for some reason I had a grip on these thoughts and talked myself out of it, sat down and watched the military channel and relaxed with a big glass of water. Overall effects reminded me of some decent nugget. After about an hour I was relatively normal again.<br><br>
Next day I took it easy and took smaller hits with longer intervals in between. The effects were great, I was high, laughing like a fool, in a good mood, it was like pot used to be for me 10 years ago. This time no paranoia. I felt as though yesterdays experience was therapeutic in that I learned how to control my mind in such a situation and erased the paranoia.<br><br>
I smoked every day for a week after that and it was very predictable, Im actually quite fond of this chemical.<br><br>
One thing I have noticed is very abstract dreams, very vivid and memorable.<br>
I also drank a few beers while smoking which may have eased the anxiety feelings as well, or kept them away.<br><br>
My impression is that if you keep your head and dip your feet before jumping in, you will have a good grip on what you are getting into and at that point you can figure out what you can handle. This is definitely no joke, If I had taken 5 hits like I would of pot the first time, I think I would have lost my mind. This shit comes on like a hurricane and doesnt give you much warning or time to adjust to your mindset. But it has been a very pleasant treat. The day before they made this chemical illegal in my state I bought 3 ounces of it for 100 dollars at a local shop. When you figure the cost was 44.95 for 3 grams a month ago, that is a hell of a deal.<br><br>
I dont recommend this to someone who doesnt have experience with crazy psychoactives, or at least plenty of experience with crazy stong pot. This is definitely 5 times more potent than pot, at least to me.<br><br>
Know your mind, Know your Body, Know your dose, Know your source. Keep everything in perspective and dont underestimate this machine. If anything over estimate it, you can always smoke more. Beer definitely helps ease anxiety.<br><br>
Dont be like the idiots that buy pure jwh and smoke 25mg ontop of their pot, no fucking wonder they freaked out and ended up in the hospital. A dose like that first time would scare the hell out of anyone.<!-- End Body -->
