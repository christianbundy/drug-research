It all started when my friend comes to school, having just taken a 8mg pill of Buprenorphine. We go smoke a cigarette, and he is looking around saying how cool everything looks. While we are walking back to school he hands me this pill, saying just take it I feel so good right now. So I put it under my tongue and man, did it taste bad. So my math class starts and I go to it, not feeling anything. But about 20 minutes later it hits, hard. This is my first opioid I have ever taken, I get up and walk and it feels like Im bouncing. I felt so good and everything looked so cool. About a half our goes by and I start to get nauseous, really nauseous. So I figure ill drink some water, big mistake. Made me want to puke. So I put my head down for the rest of the period and feel incredible. But if I lifted my head I would instantly feel like puking, or even if I drank any water, I felt like puking. So after class I'm walking to the bus and my friend who took the other pill starts puking, a lot. Walking to the bus we both are extremely nauseous and feel like complete garbage. <br><br>
We get on the bus and the whole time I had my head behind the window will cold air blowing on my face to keep me from puking. The second I got off the bus I start puking a lot. We arrive at my house where we instantly hit the couches and then the great feeling comes back. But then my parents make us move a bed out of the house, we instantly start feeling like shit. Out pupils are tiny, and remain this way for about 3 days. We move the bed down the stairs where my friend starting puking again, luckily my parents didn't notice. <br><br>
Then we decided to go to my friends house, where if we drank, or ate anything we would puke within 5 minutes. We could not even open our eyes without puking. This went on from about 3-10 o clock, where finally we smoked some reefer and I went home and passed out.<!-- End Body -->
