The second time I did ayahuasca I rented a hotel room and brought 4 other people with me, 2 others where also imbibing this sacred drink. They experienced no nausea or vomiting. Effects began in about 6 minutes, starting with alterations of conscousness, that 'pineal feeling.' Lay down and took shelter next to a guide, a girl whom I felt very comfortable around. <br><br>
The visual hallucinations began in about 20 minutes. Patterns emerging from the walls. When I closed my eyes I felt as though I was traveling deeper into myself. If I payed attention to the outside world the effects would lesson, I heard a voice telling me to just let go of the outside world. I did and the deeper I traveled into myself the more 'entities' I would encounter, I met many entities who claimed to be part of myself, I saw myself as a machine and they where the operators. They gave me suggestions about how to run more smoothly. At one point I saw the widely spoken of, 'knomes' they where pushing a crank, and they all looked very depressed and walked very slowly. My current visionary guide, who had the personality of a gangster and much style and attitude, told me that the machine was broken and not running properly. I came out of the trip with a better understanding of myself. I don't believe I ever left myself though. I was hoping that i would travel to remote places but most of the travel was restricted to my own body. <br><br>
Before we drank the ayahauaca we made an agreement to try to find each other in the realm but I never gained contact with my fellow ayahuasca expiditioners. They seemed to have a nice trip. so did I but I became depressed as I was coming down. I seems as though the basis of alot of my psychedelic journeys is negative and introspective.<br><br>
