 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSceletium Tortuosum<br>250 mg ± 50 mg<br>After a full day's work, i came home to find this little goodie waiting in the mailbox from a friend up north. I consider the possibilities, and decide to roll some into a cigarette (250 mg ± 50 mg).<br>By the second puff i'm beginning to feel the effects. It feels like a burden being lifted from my shoulders. The billowing and twisting of the trail of smoke being pulled from the glowing ember between my fingers peaks my interest in its simplistic elegance and infinite complexity. I turn on some ambient Jazz and can't help but feel that i'm hearing the music more clearly than usual, as if every beat is articulated to the height of my perception. A very mild edge indeed, but quite enjoyable. Can't wait to introduce her to my friends :)  <br>Now that the effects have subsided, my eyes are a little dry and i feel rather tired. This makes the warm place between the sheets an even more enviable position from the end of the long day. Shallow, mellow, light, dreamy, happy.\n\n\n"
