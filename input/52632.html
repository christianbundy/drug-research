For the first experiment with Kratom, I have decided to listen to the wimp in me, I went for the low dosage of one tablespoon or approximately 3-3 1/2 grams of superior crushed leaf. I began with an empty stomach, I had only consumed a couple cups of coffee in the last 12 hours. I have read that Kratom is great for workers, and attention span, so I intend to use this low dosage as an enhancement to my daily chores.<br><br>
I brought the Kratom to a boil in 2 cups of filtered water, and then let it simmer together with one teabag of  Tea. The concoction simmered till cool, I added two ice cubes, and one teaspoon of clover honey and drank the mixture in one blast. I drank some of the Kratom leaf, but most was left as sediment in the glass.<br><br>
1:33 pm - Drank it, the mixture was remotely bitter, but the enhancements of Tea, and honey took great care of that known issue.<br><br>
1:44 pm - Feel a slight buzz, or more specifically a lightheaded sort of pleasant feeling centered in the temple.<br><br>
1:55 pm - Pleasant feelings, some mental, but mostly physical. Continue to feel a tension, or tingle in the scalp.<br><br>
2:15 pm - The motivation to get up and do something is not there, but once up I can't stop, I am motivated, able to multi-task, and am getting work done at a good rate. Starting to feel codeine like symptoms as well as some eyesight focusing issues.<br><br>
3:05 pm - Feeling a pain in the neck (brainstem area), and a bit of a headache. most likely from cleaning products. I feel like chilling out a bit. Grabbed a juice and am gonna veg on the couch for while.<br><br>
3:15 pm - Once I sat down for a while I was starting to feel light codeine like symptoms; nerve sensations, tingles, and a general physical well being. My eyes were not focusing on anything unless I willed them too, like my whole body would only function if I exert my will, and I don't feel like it. These symptoms are all light, I can imagine on a higher dose I wouldn't be getting off the couch for a while, if even for an earthquake.<br><br>
3:30 pm - The headache is about gone now, no nausea. I still feel nerve sensations, and noticed that my back pain has dissipated, funny that I hadn't noticed that before. <br><br>
4:00 pm - The symptoms seem to be subsiding, all in all this was a pleasant experiment. I was able to keep my motivation up for unpleasant tasks, and I noticed potential for pain relief. My mind is clear through the whole process, this drug is mostly a physical one for me, at least at low doses.<!-- End Body -->
