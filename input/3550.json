 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThis past summer was when I started puffing, and my best friend Dan who got me into it bought alot of beasters nugs for a while, and the first time I puffed with those, oh man. About 20 minutes after we smoked, he was playin a game on PS, and I was sittin there watching. And there was something about the music that just made me relax so much, and I just closed my eyes, and it was like I was falling. Even with the littlest thought and motion I could 'change the direction' I was falling. <br>I lost track of all time, but I'm guessing this lasted for a good 2 hours. From then up until about 6 hours later, I was still high, but not at all like I was immediately after we puffed. In the time after the first 2 hours, everything felt like it was in rapid stop-go animation, and I couldn't tell if it was just me twiching like nutz or if it was just in my head. Either way, it was frickin great.\n\n\n"
