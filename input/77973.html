Executive Summary at the end of this report for the lazy and/or hurried.<br><br>
20/M/Austin, TX. Experienced in LSD, MDMA, Psilocybin, DMT, 2C-I, etc. I am a calm and collected person, and have never flipped out on psychedelics.<br><br>
Set: I was in a good mood, calm, with no lingering or hidden anxiety. My girlfriend and I were happy and cuddly, despite the fact that there was only enough 2C-P for me. I had not used psychedelics other than DMT in about 10 weeks, and felt a desire for a day-long psychedelic experience, which motivated me to use the 2C-P.<br><br>
Setting: The apartment I share with my girlfriend, and surrounding areas.<br><br>
Preparations: Made sure I had nothing to do and that my girlfriend was cool trip-sitting me. Checked that there were no issues between us. Cleaned the apartment and read everything I possibly could about 2C-P online.<br><br>
Then I pulled out the the bag labeled 2C-P 10mg and snorted the whole thing. I did this because other reports mentioned a 2-3 hour comeup, and it was already 5pm. Additionally, other friends who had done it reported it to be less intense than expected, and I have a lot of psychedelic experience, so I thought I would be able to handle it.<br><br>
My nose started to burn shortly afterwards, and my eyes began to water profusely. I would recommend snorting this stuff in a few small lines, spaced out by ten minutes or so, but the burn is nothing one cant deal with, and goes away fast. The visuals began almost immediately, with Persian carpets undulating on every surface. Snorting definitely shortens the comeup, and I found it invigorating.<br><br>
I smoked a bowl of cannabis, and then my girlfriend and I went out for a drive (she was driving, as I was tripping). It was a gorgeous day, so I cant tell how much of the beauty was due to the 2C-P (and possibly cannabis  other have mentioned weed enhances the visuals). Nonetheless, this was the most beautiful drive Id ever experienced. The visuals were primarily Persian carpets and some color enhancement, with everything having a slight purple tinge. The visuals werent spectacular, but they were beautiful.<br><br>
The mental state was excellent. I think about things (society, the socially-constructed self, etc) constantly, and I felt as though I had increased insight, better conversational abilities, and was in a great mood. If pressed, I would say this stuff feels like MDMA and LSD combined, but without any speedy element (Im very susceptible to uppers). Musical enhancement is less than with some other drugs, but music was still enjoyable.<br><br>
We came home, and I did some nitrous and smoked some DMT (~20mg). Both of these increased the visual aspects of the 2C-P, but didnt significantly alter the trip otherwise.<br><br>
I was able to fall asleep pretty easily around 3am or so. Snorting leads to a shorter and more tractable experience, in my opinion.  16mg of this stuff is a definite overdose according to Shulgin and others, so obviously do not snort (or parachute, or anything) that much).<br><br>
Overall, a great day and an enjoyable drug. The trip was primarily characterized by its lucid insightfulness and pleasant visuals. If I ever do this again, Id probably snort 12mg, as I feel I can handle that now.<br><br>
Executive Summary:<br><br>
-	All psychedelic disclaimers apply (dont do it while drunk at 3am)<br>
-	All 2C-* disclaimers apply (5mg can be the difference between a head trip and a hospital trip)<br>
-	Pretty visuals, though not spectacular. I recommend cannabis and nitrous in addition.<br>
-	GREAT lucid headspace, lots of insight, conversation easy and flowing<br>
-	Little body load<!-- End Body -->
