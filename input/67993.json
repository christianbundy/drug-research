 "report": "<p>I find and use strong peppers, which are usually Habaneras. Start by chopping up the entire pepper and put as much as you can fit in a quart jar. Then add rubbing alcohol or vodka as you see fit to do. Allow this to set in the sun for a day or longer and after that simply strain it into a jar that can be closed. What you have done is extract the oily capsaicin from the peppers and you can throw the used peppers away. With this extract you can further concentrate by allowing the alcohol to evaporate away. To make a rub, add some of your extract to any good hand cream and mix well. This will work for those aching muscles and will really show itself as you shower. Best bet unless you are use to the heat is use it sparklingly at first.</p>"
