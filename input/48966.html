Tram is SO easy to get.  I go to the doctor, say I've got back pain but don't want to use opiates, I've done some research on the net about Ultram and, viola, prescription for six months with unlimited refills.<br><br>
Tramadol is really interesting. It gives me a sense of well-being not unlike 15 mg of hydrocodone.<br><br>
I dropped at about 8:30 AM the first time and it took about 45 minutes for the tram to kick in.  When it did, I thought 'whoa' I've gotta get some chew.  I chew tobacco to enhance my euphoric experience while high.  I dropped the chew and three minutes later I was zipping around in my brain and horny as hell. I like porn when I'm under the influence, so I went online and downloaded a few pics.  At about the third pic I couldn't stand it anymore, I was so gone.  I stripped down and started to whack. I seriously believe that I didn't need to beat off to come.  When I did it was the most indescribable experience, like I was spurting out my soul to God.  I was mixed with lust, love, warmth, pleasure and disassociation at all the same time.<br><br>
Some people believe that Tram makes you unable to reach orgasm, and, I'll have to admit, after my three months of use, I occasionally find it difficult to come.  The peak effects, for me, last about 1/2 hour and a pleasant feeling of well-being and happiness last about 5-6 hours coming down very gradually and slowly.<br><br>
I worry a little bit about my liver and kidneys, but I haven't seen too many warnings about this much on the net.  It will have to be something that I'll have to check into soon, because I like this shit so much. When I've been unable to fill my script because it's over the weekend, I've also felt a mild depression.  If I take 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 fifty mg pill, it seems to help, but it's still there for about a week.<br><br>
Tram has got to be the perfect drug, not too overwhelming or up fucking, but warm, pleasant and spurting when it's added to sex.<br><br>
Be careful out there.<!-- End Body -->
