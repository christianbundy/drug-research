Let me start off by saying that I am not experienced with drugs at all.  All that I have done prior to this was a little bit of Pot.  But the experiences of pot that I had were so good and it had been such a long while since I had smoked it that that I desired to feel its effects again.  So when I heard my dad ordering prescriptions on the phone I heard some drug names that rang a bell, such as Valium and Xanax.  With this a curiosity was struck and I went online to look up different drugs and how to safely use them.<br><br>
I found three drugs that I could consume that would give me a nice high, Valium, Hydrocodone, and Ambien.  After reading up on each I eventually decided upon taking Hydrocodone.  This came about for several reasons.  First of all, both of my parents were home.  That meant that I could not take anything that would make me bug out or act out to much.  Secondly, I was stressed out, so I did not want to swallow anything that would make me even more anxious or give me a bad trip.  Secondly, I wanted to take something that would leave me with a good happy feeling.  With all of this in mind, I settled upon taking Hydrocodone.<br><br>
The next step was how to consume it and how much.  After reading much I decided to take 15mg to start with (two 7.5mg tablets).  Next I decided I should crush the pills up and dissolve them in a liquid, that way I'd be sure the effects would not take forever to take in.  I also decided to dissolve them in some tea, so I cooked up some Sleepy Time tea and let the drink cool down till it was luke- warm so that the chemicals would not be alerted.  Then I crushed the two pills up, let them dissolve, and drank.  I added a ton of sugar to the mixture but it was still bitter, oh well.<br><br>
The next step was to wait, and boy did I wait.  I was reading articles for about twenty minutes when I decided I might need another half of a pill to make sure that this does kick in, for the only effects that I noticed was that it was hard to focus on reading large paragraphs.  But as soon as I stood up I realized it had in fact already kicked in.<br><br>
I had a funky sense of balance and every step I took felt like I was walking through space.  I still wanted the other half of a pill and after a wonderful walk I swallowed it like any other pill.  The walk back to my room was even better.  Every time my thigh would stretch the most amazing feel came into, the only thing I could call it was like having an orgasm in my leg every time I took a step.<br><br>
Then came the next phase: after about an hour of consuming the Hydrocodone I noticed my head was feeling heavier and heavier.  All of my limbs were numb; I could feel the time it took the pain to travel up my arm and neck when I pinched myself.  When my dad coughed in the other room I could feel the sound on my back.<br><br>
Then I got the sudden urge to talk.  I went onto AIM and talked to anyone that would listen, I felt as though everyone was my friend and I told almost everybody that I loved them.  I even asked some highly personal questions just because the drug made me feel as though everyone loved me too and I could talk about anything with them.  I also noticed that as I listened to music I could kind of feel it.<br><br>
Also, in between all of this I noticed that I could just zone out on a letter I drew on a piece of paper for minutes at a time.  In addition to this, I felt compelled to make and write beautiful things.  Thats when I decided to take another 7.5mg dose just to make the effects last.<br><br>
About two and a half hours into the high things started to wear off, but ever so slightly.  I think the way I described the affects above it sounds like a real heavy trip, but it is not.  Everything touches you in just the mildest of ways so that you feel perfectly happy.  The most wonderful thing about this was that I could act completely normal in front of my parents, though I did have to concentrate hard on moving without swaying too much.  My parents had no idea how amazing I was feeling.  <br><br>
So, in conclusion, I would say this is a WONDERFUL drug, though I do not have much to compare it too.  I think it'd be a grand idea to take about 30mg of this with some friends on a warm summer evening and just talk outside.  If you're ever bored or slightly stressed out just take some Hydrocodone and you'll feel just grand, and you'll feel good for about three hours too.  I would recommend this to anyone.<!-- End Body -->
