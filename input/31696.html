I took this at 3pm and went to band rehearsal. The only comparison I can make, is that its like going to a lazer lights show on acid. There was a slight nausia, but that could have been because I had not eatin in a while. But the effects started kicking in at around 4:30-5, and wow. The music was just wrong..it sounded off. The director sounded very low, but I couldnt tell to much, because the effects came on very slowly. Once rehersal ended I noticed my voice was much deeper (this was just my perception of my voice, everyone else thought I was normal). Everyones voices sounded off, like an old transistor radio that is set wrong, and everything is low and wavy. I read that the effects last about 6-8 hours. Well I am writing this 28 hours later, and I can still hear mild differences in bells and ringing sounds. Nothing in peoples voices, but the changes were still noticable the next morning. This drug did nothing to alter my state of consiousness. I went to a meeting and lead activities, and no one knew anything. I hope this helps, I would recomend this drug, but be prepared for the long haul, not a quick trip. <br>
