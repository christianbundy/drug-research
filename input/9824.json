 "report": "<p>ahh, what can i say about adderall?  from someone who has a HIGH tolerance for speed, its better than shards,coke,crystal,and crank.  </p><p>it doesnt leave me with that all too familiar feign for just another bump. all of my senses are multiplied by 1000. I take it and about 1 hour later, I have strength like a gladiator, my vision is crystal clear, I truly feel every part of my body working. the complexity & subconscious of my mind is peeping its little petals out like a flower just blooming. </p><p>my body feels absolutely tingly like when I was a kid squishing my naked foot in the mud & wiggling it around. a drag off a cigarette tastes heavenly. I sit down pause and realize I can be exactly on the same level & page as everyone. coming from an angel, I truly got a taste of heaven and a whiff of an angel's wings,..hell I bounced on cloud 9.</p>"
