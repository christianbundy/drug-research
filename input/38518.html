I began the evening by boiling down 1/3 of a large bag of Calamus root.  This turned out to be about 2 or 3 teaspoons of pure oil, though I had to estimate because much of it was still diluted with some water.  I shared it with my friends, and I ended up taking about 1 teaspoon pure. Then, a short while later, when I was feeling some subtle effects, two hits from a dryer-vent bucket bong (BIG hits) of 17x were administered very effectively, I've been told.  I don't remember finishing the last hit. Their comments will be added to the bottom of this account.<br><br>
I was transported to another world, much like ours.  I was leaning against a brick wall, having trouble standing since my balance was very bad.  Like a dream, I get that I'm in a small town, probably in the Netherlands, though I'm not sure.  I'm leaning over some green bushes against that brick wall, and a woman asked whether or not I was alright.  Over in the room, which was still accessible through the left side of my left eye, my brother said, 'Dude, are you okay?' I said, to both, 'Yeah, I think I'll be fine.'<br><br>
But I was not.  I couldn't snap out of this fit of the spins.  I grabbed at the bushes and the wall, trying to stand straight.  But I just couldn't.  This was a pretty abstract worry, though.  I was mostly very confused, since I felt that this was just the last interpretation of many that I had gone through.  Pretty soon, I started coming down, and moving from interpretation to interpretation of the world. I progressively got closer to a real interpretation of the world, though the above was the strongest and most long-lasting of them.  Eventually, my friends set me down in a more comfortable spot a couple of steps away, and I finally started to understand that I was just in my brother's room with my friends.  My pants were wet, and my friends were frantic with questions.  The hole I pushed in the angled ceiling/wall in my room started becoming more pronounced than the rather faint rose chalked on the wall.  I'll let my friends tell you what they told me.<br><br><br><br>
Observer 1: after he took the first big hit, he managed to take another, though he looked pretty confused at the time, then he got up like he was trying to get somewhere, but either he was really uncoordinated about it, or he was trying to 'get' to a place that he couldn't figure out how to move to get to from where he was. Trying to get somewhere, or grasping for something caused him to knock over some cups of watter and lamps, and put a hole in the soft wall/ceiling of the small room. We tried to calm him down, tell him not to worry. I don't know if he understood, just kept with behavior for 20ish seconds and muttering 'Whooh - man, whoa.' After that he describes a brick wall, a car, a woman like his mom, and a ordinary crappy situation in a totally mundane yet 'NOT THIS WORLD' place, a new huge society 'structure'?  He wants to just sit back and relax to 'absorb' or 'rest from' what he, all he, has just experienced.<br><br><br><br>
Observer 2: Twin brother of the reporter, and owner of the room in which the trip started and ended (I can't really say most the the actual trip took place here). My brother took two large hits of the strongest stuff I had. This was after taking more Calamus than I was aware of. It started normally. He got confused during the second hit, so I took the wicked bong from him, and offered him some water. It took me a couple of tries to get his attention, but once I had it, he slowly reached for the cup. He lost attention to the cup, and started spilling water. After that, he started flipping everything over. Water everywhere, lamp on the ground, cards flipping left and right, hookah toppled, and, in trying to stand up, a hole in the wall. After a little while, he calmed down and we moved him to a better seat, so he could relax properly after what was definitely very intense.<br><br>
I took about 1/8 of the total sweetflag concentrate we made, equivalent to about 50 grams of root. My calamus experience was nice. I was very alert, senses were intensified, and I had no bad side effects but a feeling of being sped up. My theory is that the calamus negated the motor function suppression that Salvia normally exhibits. Ordinarily, high doses of Salvia (with which I am very experienced), will make a subject seem more comatose than anything else. Subjects' experiences will be very dramatic and full of movement, but it doesn't translate to movement because of a similar mechanism that sleep employs. Calamus negated this completely, as all movements experienced during the Salvia trip also occurred in the real world.<!-- End Body -->
