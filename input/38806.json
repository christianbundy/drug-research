 "report": "<p>In a nutshell I had a serious injury which kept me in the hospital and on narcotics including Fentanyl, Morphine, Oxycodone, and Hydrocodone for a period of about 6 weeks. One exacerbating circumstance is that it required HIGH doses of opiates for any analgesic properties to be recognized. Needless to say withdrawal was a nightmare.</p><p>I found references to the use of Kratom as a way to ease withdrawal pains and discomfort. It doesn't just ease the problems, it totally wipes them out. At lower doses my energy level is increased to an extent, I feel great, a little opiation is present, and I had no trouble with nausea at low to moderate doses. High doses can turn my stomach a bit.</p><p>I'm a kava user as well, prepared the old fashioned way. Whole ground root only. If I want some recreation from it I wait for about 90 minutes after taking the Kratom [ 'Super' Kratom ], when the effects are at their fullest, and have a quick Kava. Nice mix of energetic bliss and contentments without inebriation.</p><p>For people struggling with Opiate withdrawal I would say this is a miracle, and I'm not easily impressed.</p>"
