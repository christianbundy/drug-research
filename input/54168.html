I was looking for another form of smoking as I had to give up normal ciggies for the sake of my girlfriend and for my health, my girlfriend said for my to try catnip, so I went to a expo and they was selling catnip, so I bought the bag and I seen a bag of mugwort as well and I wanted to see what else herbs could do for me and in the sense of sleeping. So I brought a bag of that to.<br><br>
So that night I got 2 big pinches of catnip and one pinch of mugwort put it into a bowl and cut it up, mixed it and put it into to a water pipe to be smoked. Within the hour I had smoked the entire bowl of catnip and mugwort. It was very different to what normal ciggies feels like when smoked. I had hot boxed my room and the smell of the smoke that was in my room must of drawn the cat to where I was sitting on the bed. She rolled around and did playful kitten things and went to sleep next to me.<br><br>
15 minutes after the 1st bowl, I had the same mixture again and hoped on the computer talk for a while and I noticed that I was making more mistakes than normal and that my eyes were lagging. It like when you move a camera really fast and the pictures cant keep up with the camera.<br><br>
The cat moved of the bed to meow at the door to be let out, so I got up and the feeling was like I had too much to drink. So I let her out and went back to my bed where I put my head to the pillow and I went to sleep and had the most strangest dream where I can control what was happening. The next morning I woke up to fine the I could still remember the dream.<!-- End Body -->
