I started taking Paxil after being clinically diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks. Now, I have always been willing to try anything once, so I followed my doctors advice.  <br><br>
It took about 1 week for me to notice the effects of the drug. I started on 10 mg a day and increased to 20 mg in two weeks.  After 2 weeks I was able to function in society without panicking and wanting to die. It was instant confidence for me which before I had only been able to reach through alcohol or E.  Friends and family think it is a miracle. A few friends often get irratated and jealous of my new-found happiness and upbeat nature. <br><br>
         After a visit to a new doctor today, he mentioned <br>
                    a few intersting things. <br><br>
1. That I will need to be on Paxil for the rest of my life or until    medical science develops something other than a pink pill.<br>
2. That research shows Paxil is re-constructing DNA in certain areas of the brain.... ??? This is quite interesting<br>
3. I do not have medical and it is getiing expensive.... really!?!<br><br>
              A few side effects I have noticed... <br>
                 some are fun... some are not.<br><br>
1. Balance - like I am walking on a rocky boat from time to time.<br><br>
2. Very vivid and complex dreams<br><br>
3. I am like a non-sexual being. No feeling, no interest, no nothin'<br><br>
4. Enhanced self image, and extreme self confidence<br><br>
5. Smoking a lot more, Grinding teeth quite often, jaw clenching.<br><br>
6. Loss of emotion, yet extremely happy and confident @ the same time<br><br>
7. Have always been blessed by the gift of telepathy, it is now       slowly withering away. Can no longer read minds, and this saddens me.<br><br>
I am still taking Paxil and will continue for fear of falling back into my old self. I am now vey scared for what will happen if I stop taking the drug. So in fact, medical science has now trapped me financially and emotionally. I am now dependent on a little pink pill... until there is a new teal, turquoise or fuschia pill.<!-- End Body -->
