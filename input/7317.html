-6:30pm, I swallowed what I thought was MDMA.  It was a double-stacked blue pill with a label of 'RN.'  To kill some time, I went downstairs and played Tekken Tag.  I was by myself, which probably wasnt the best idea.  <br><br>
-7:30pm, my head began to throb, in sync with my heartbeat.  The pain was 10 times worse than any migraine I have ever been through.  I got really hot, and couldn't see straight.  There were no feelings of a normal roll (I've done X about 5 times before, and each time was fine).<br><br>
-8:00pm, the wall began to move, just as if I was tripping.  I saw mild visuals, then began to vomit violently.  My head began hurting even worse, and could not stop dry heaving.  I felt insane, and I was talking to myself, contemplating whether or not to call 911.  My roomate finally got home, and I told him to take me to the hospital or else I would die...<br><br>
***Went to the ER, my blood pressure was way above normal, and my body temp. was 101.  They injected me with 50mg of phenergan and demerol (sic?), and slept till 1:00AM...Filed under a 'severe migraine.'***  BE CAREFUL OF WHAT U EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<!-- End Body -->
