I have a stomach that does not do well with psychedelics (mushrooms, acid, cacti), so I decided to try an MAOI, in the event that in the future it will allow me to ingest these at lower doses with a greater potency.<br><br>
I had abstained from tyramine-containing foods for over 24 hours (and followed up with that regimen as well). The night came of my planned experiment, and I was feeling rather irritated with myself for not having worked all day.<br><br>
+0:00 I measure out a tablespoon of seeds, wash them, and begin eating, crushing them in my mouth very well before swallowing.<br><br>
+0:15 My mouth is pretty numb.<br><br>
+0:20 I read a little Lewis Carroll. Something he writes is so clever, that I chuckle. All of a sudden, I feel much better emotionally, and my funk is gone. I take a shower and sing.<br><br>
+1:00 I haven't felt much of anything up to now (but I've been distracted, getting ready for a party. All of a sudden, entering a room with lights, I notice crystal-like trails when I move my head. I noticed this the one time I drank ayahuasca tea, which I also prepared with rue.<br><br>
+1:45 I experience some nausea. I'm also feeling a bit distractible, and do rather poorly at boggle, a game at which I generally excel.<br><br>
+2:30 I'm walking around, and not feeling so well. I almost run to a bathroom to puke, but decide against it.<br><br>
+3:00 The badness has subsided, and now I'm just seeing the crystal trails every once in while. I notice nothing exceptional with my eyes closed. It's not unpleasant, just 'there.'<br><br>
+5:00 I notice that the trails are pretty much gone.<br><br>
All in all, a good experiment. In the future when I take psychedelics, I will do so at a lower dose, having taken an MAOI 2 or 3 hours prior. I think I will blend the rue in the future. The nausea and the 'rue burps' were the most negative aspects of it, however, the whole experience was pretty calm. I don't know if the mood shift was purely due to Carroll (he is awesome), or if it had something to do with the antidepressant effect of the rue.<br><br>
Good luck, and be safe!<!-- End Body -->
