 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nComputer Duster:\r\nMy friend Craig was down and looking to get fucked up because his Girlfriend was in Canada on a Cruise (smoking lots of bud and opium.) So we went over to a hardware store and looked around for some Computer Duster.\r\nIt was really funny, the can had a computer sparying himself with the duster, he looked really stoned, and he was laughing.\r\nAnyways we went off to our other friend, Dan, who had some nugs, but he wasn't there so we decided to hit the can some. We went down in this sewer and walked across it. We each took a couple hits and i could feel it kick in a few seconds later. I hit the can just like some weed.\r\nI could hear an echo, this really weird sound that kept on going the entire time i was high. Also I could hear my heart beating, it wasn't going fast, I could just hear it really well.\r\nThen Craig started hallucinating some. He said 'Look out D----! Theres a girl over there!' After it wore off he asked me if I saw that girl smoking a joint, and I told him he just hallucinated it all.\r\nI started hallucinating some and I thought I saw Jesus at the end of the tunnel, so I started following the light. It was all very weird, but very fun.\r\nThen Dan came back. He tried it a couple times and loved it excedingly.\r\nThe next day Dan came over and we went to hit the bottle behind this building. We did it a few times, and then he took a big one, starting trippin out, and fell face first into the concrete.\r\nHe busted both his teeth and had blood everywhere. At first I thought he was dead. He then came too and later got oxycodone (christ! its like a lottery for idiots!)\r\nEffects:\r\nLightheaded, euphoria, laughing, mild to full blown visuals based on how many hits, loss of concious\r\nDuration:\r\nKicks in, in a few seconds, lasts a 1-2 minutes\r\nAfter Effects:\r\nChills, body might start shaking for no reason, mild hallucinations, drowsiness\r\nComputer Duster can kill.\r\nIt is very urgent that you don't do this alone, and that if you do it with another friend make sure they are tripping out when you are. Don't do it around hard places, around water, or anything else you could hurt yourself around if you do pass out.\r\nComputer Duster also kills brain cells and damages your lungs.\r\nIf you do it, proceed with caution.\n\n\n"
