I recently decided to try Morning Glories, hoping to achieve a psychedelic experience similar to those reported by LSD, mushroom, and mescaline users.  I went to the local Wal-Mart, purchased four packs of Morning Glory seeds which contained 1.5 g each, went home, pounded the seeds with a hammer to break the shells, poured the crushed seeds into a glass of milk, and drank, at approximately 1:30 pm.  I then returned to normal activities about the house, and waited for the seeds to take effect.<br><br>
At around 3:00 pm, I began to feel tired and vaguely happy, for no discernable reason.  These feeling remained throughout the day.  I was slightly disappointed that I experienced no psychedelic effects, especially since the dose I took was deemed to be between medium and strong, and these psychedelic effects were supposed to be fairly pronounced.  Nonetheless, I was very pleased with my experience, and will most likely pursue it again, as I was able to achieve mild euphoria without any noticeable impairment in my capabilities to perform normal tasks, and noticed no decrease in mental capabilities.<br><br>
Here is a list of effects that I felt:<br>
	Mild euphoria for a prolonged period of time (from about 3:00 pm to 12:00 am.). This was accompanied by increased appreciation of humor, and increased interest in matters that I normally find banal.<br>
	Relaxation and tiredness.<br>
	Slight increase in abnormal thinking.<br>
	Slight increase in talkativeness.<br>
	Mild nausea at the beginning (cured by one sip of Pepto Bismal), mild headache (cured by two Aspirin pills).<!-- End Body -->
