 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter trying a snuff of these seeds I decided to try smoking them. I toasted 5 seeds for 13 min on a med low flame. Seems this was a perfect toast. I removed the outer husk. Then ground to fine powder. Placed them in bong. \r\nTook 4 giant hits. Smoke was harsh but not too bad. Felt it coming on in a few moments. Started as a pain in my jaw. Then a tightness in my head. Then in my belly, and soon a very big body high had developed. This happend over the course of about the first 5 min.\r\nAfter 5 min it grew to a plateu at 10 min. \r\nThe plateau lasted 15-20 min.\r\nThe effect was not very visionary. There where no visuals. There was no noticable change in cognition. Just a giant body high that made me feel heavy. Lotsa pressure in my head and twitching muscles. My stomach stayed a bit unsettled for about an hour. It was kind of intense and I reached a plus 2. It was sort of pleasurable but nothing too special.\r\nCame back slowly for 1 hour.\r\nI would like to try some other seeds and see if its more like 5-meo-dmt. These seeds seem to be worth further exploration. But I think all future experiments will be done with some kind of extraction.\n\n\n"
