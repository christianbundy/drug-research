Note: I do not explain the experience of smoking crack here, at little about the come-down.  This is an explaination of my expiriment with a come-down coping 'technique'.<br><br>
Trying to deal with the definite issue of coping with crack cocaine 'come-downs' in the daytime, I decided to eat half of the $5 piece.  To do so, I crumbled it as best I could, split it into two piles, and placed each pile into empty gel capsules.  When it looked like the other half of the $5 pile had about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of smoke-time left, I ate one of the pills.  A half-hour later, I ate the other pill.  fifteen minutes after that I finished smoking and went to work.  I did feel blank for a short while, but not particularity negative in the hours that followed. <br><br>
The time-table was 30-45 minutes as to allow the ingested cocaine to enter my bloodstream both while I was still high and after the smoked cocaine was beginning to lessen in my body.  At the end of the day I felt quite good, and had an extra bit of energy throughout.  Two major error-possibilities arise when I wonder whether my experience would equqate to 'the general experience': I only smoked $2.50 worth that day, I don't have a tolerance or much (bodily) experience with the drug.  Another factor that comes to mind is digestion-rate.  Mine seems to be about 45 minutes, thus I set my plans to follow.<br><br>
One further point of note:  I did seem to 'crave' the drug more than usual in the days following my smoke-and-eat experiment.  Dependence is an interplay of psyche and physiology, always.<!-- End Body -->
