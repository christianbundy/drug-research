Last night I took 400 mg of Valeriana Officinalis, 5 mg of melatonin, and 1 mg of Pyridoxine HCl (Vitamin B-6) 30 minutes before going to sleep. I had the most INTENSE series of dreams of my entire life! At times it felt as if I was not dreaming and was actually in a twilight-type of sleep where I shifted between sleep and conciousness continously. I could hear the radio and the rain outside my window and those sounds would blend into my dreams.<br><br>
At one point I actually felt that I stepped (not really floated, but stepped) outside of my body and was able to percieve myself sleeping. I couldn't really see myself, but I *sensed* that I was there. In the morning I dismissed it as my overactive imagination, but throughout the entire day I can't seem to shake the feeling that there was a lot more to this than I'm ackowledging. This was my first time taking valerian. I have taken melatonin before and have noticed that my dreams seem a lot more lucid, but could it be the combination? <br><br><a href="http://www.erowid.org/spirit/dreaming/dreaming_info1.shtml">2 Responses</a><!-- End Body -->
