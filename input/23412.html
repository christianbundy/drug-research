Hello.<br>
I've been a very heavy marijuana smoker for almost 8 years. In addition, in the 6 months preceding the test I've gained 20 lbs (plenty of extra fat). I spent days searching the web on how to pass a urine drug test once I knew I will be tested for a new job and I had 7 days to pass it. Below is my account of how I've done it. During my search for information I was particularly thankful to people who posted their actual experiences, not just general advices, so I thought someone else might find my experience very helpful as well. Since I believe drug testing is a violation of my rights I felt I must make my personal experience of how to beat a drug test available to potentially help others. Please feel free to reformat the following information. What I have is pretty much is a time-line.<br><br>
-------------------<br>
Day 1<br>
  -- did nothing<br><br>
Day 2<br>
  -- ran a few miles<br><br>
Day 3<br>
  -- biked a few miles<br><br>
Day 4<br>
  -- did nothing<br><br>
Day 5<br>
  -- drank LOTS of beer throughout the day<br>
  -- took 2 tea-spoons of creatine (one in the morning, one in the evening)<br>
  -- took 2 pills of Activated Charcoal (same as above)<br>
  -- drank some *pure* Cranberry Juice<br><br>
Day 6<br>
  -- ate a very large meal in the middle of the day<br>
  -- drank some *pure* Cranberry Juice<br>
  -- drank about 12 beers<br>
  -- took 2 tea-spoons of creatine (one in the morning, one in the evening)<br>
  -- took 2 pills of Activated Charcoal (same as above)<br>
  -- took vitamin B-2<br><br>
Day 7 (morning before the test)<br>
  -- got up 5 hours before the test and made a gallon of 'Herbal Clean Master Tea' <br>
  -- took 1 tea-spoon of creatine<br>
  -- took 1 pill of vitamin B-2<br>
  -- 4.5 hours before the test started drinking the tea with little sugar in each cup, periodically taking gulps of *pure* Cranberry Juice<br>
  -- 1.5 hours before the test took 2 pills of creatine/B-2 (included with the tea)<br>
  -- pissed as often as I could during the entire time (didn't wait for full bladders)<br>
  -- pissed the final time before leaving home for the test<br>
  -- during the test pissed into the cup only from the middle of the stream<br><br>
PASSED THE TEST AND GOT THE JOB !!!<br>
