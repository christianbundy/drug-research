The night started off great, I was at a friends house getting drunk off my ass.  I was partying, drinking beer, and smoking a little weed, basically having a good time.  Let me back-track a little.  Prior to this night, about 3 weeks ago, I had been arrested, and not for the first time.  It was about the fifth time and it was alcohol related.  I was looking at jail, probation, and everything I thought I got away from.  I don't remember leaving the house I was at or getting home, but I do remember chasing the rest of my Wellbutrin, which was at least 40 150 mg pills, with a 12 oz. Bud Light bottle.  <br><br>
I don't remember much about the few hours after this, I just remember being in the living room talking to my mom.  She was asking me what I was on and I remember telling her I did PCP for some reason, I have never done PCP.  I remember being way way fucked up.  I was trying to read the guide on the satelite to see what was on TV but I couldn't read!  No matter how hard I tried I couldn't.  I couldn't think, I couldn't talk right.  I knew what I wanted to say but it was coming out all wrong.  I told my parents what I did finally and they freaked out, which is what they should have done.  <br><br>
They told me to make myself throw-up, which I did.  My dad had the phone in his hand and wanted to call 911 but I begged him not to because I did not want to be admitted to some psycho ward or something.  I threw up for about 2 hours until I had nothing more to throw up.  After this I went to my room and started to look at a poster, which was moving all over.  Next thing I know I was running to the bathroom every 5 minutes.  I puked for about 20 hours straight.  I would drink water and it would come back up in 10 seconds.  I was miserable.  It was still tripping out seeing shit, still couldn't read, and this was about 8 hours later.  I kept telling my parents 'What if I'm like this forever?' and they kept telling me it would end.  I went in the hot tub with my parents for a while, still fucked up, they thought it would help, and it did a little, basically all it did was relax me a little.  I was dizzy, sick as a dog, and still messed up until about 11:00 pm the next night.<br><br>
I still to this day don't know why I took all those pills and don't know why I'm not dead right now.  Was I trying to kill myself? I don't know.  There is a lot more to the story that I don't remember, but I do know I will never touch another Wellbutrin pill again.<!-- End Body -->
