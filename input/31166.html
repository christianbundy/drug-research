<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body --><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: The term 'yopo' is traditionally used in reference to Anadenanthera peregrina. Recently many people have started using it to refer to both A. peregrina AND A. colubrina. This report specified only 'yopo' so we do not know the exact identity of the seeds used.]</font><br><br>
Since I first took LSD about a year ago I've been on a quest of mind expansion.  I've developed a nice relationship with shrooms, I've smoked salvia a number of times and am starting to 'understand' it a Little, I had one spectacular ayahuasca journey, and I've recently been broadening my knowlege of lesser known substances.  When I first read about Yopo I thought 'Holy crap, 5-ho-DMT in seed form and it's legal, how did I miss this before?!'  So I got some and tried it out.<br><br>
The seeds will burn if I simply grind them up, but not very well.  For the best results they can be roasted, covered, on a frying pan until they make a little popping noise, which takes about a minute.  Then take the thin seed coating off and grind them as finely as possible.  Smoking out of a bong is probably the way to go...the smoke is a little harsh otherwise and I need fairly large hits.  So once I figured all of this out, it was go time for a true test of Yopo.<br><br>
I put about 7 seeds worth of the powder into the bowl, on top of a little salvia leaf.  I take about 5 big hits, trying to balance doing it quickly and holding the smoke as long as possible.  The onset begins after about 45 seconds after the initial hit, but it comes on smoothly and takes maybe 2 minutes from the start to really kick in.  I really like this fact...I have a hard time with salvia because it hits me like a sack of bricks, which tends to startle me into resisting it.  Yopo gives me time to  take my hits, lay back, and smoothly begin the trip.  <br><br>
The visual patterning is very fine and wispy, very nice looking.  The colors are not super bright and a pleasant orange seems to be the primimary tone I've seen.  The patterns look somewhere in between ayahuasca and mushrooms.  I am still coming up as I start to enjoy this.  A body load hits at some point, I feel weighted down and warm, it is quite a sensation but is not overwhelming.  <br><br>
I hit a point of 3-Dish space.  I haven't broken through to true hyperspace Yet, but it feels extremely close and is only a matter of smoking enough.  Well, I did hit hyperspace with Yopo and DXM once, but that's sort of a different story.  In this space I begin to hear things, which I normally don't get tripping, it seems to be a kind of ambient noise that goes with the visuals.  This is really cool, makes for a very immersive feeling.  As I get higher the noise becomes more like fast talking voices and takes on more meaning.<br><br>
I make my last surge upwards and hit a peak.  The plant is comunicating with me directly, sharing specific information and presenting it nice and logically.  It showed me how I haven't been acting myself lately and what I should do to get back on track.  I felt that I could ask questions if I would like, but I have not felt the need yet, choosing to listen instead.  The main message that Yopo sent me as we first met was something like this:  'I am a very powerful teacher, a direct doorway to the planetary mind.  Mother Earth created these seeds to communicate with humans.  I am willing to teach you all that you want to know, but you will have to listen carefully.  To learn you must lead a pure life and have a clear, focused mind.  Here's what you should do...'  It went on with details of the preperation of the seeds and what I need to do to focus myself and my life.  At the peak I was simply aware of much of what it had to tell me, but as I came down it repeated this basic message so that I would not forget.  Oh yeah, there is a distinct male feeling with the plant, which kind of suprised me..kind of hard to describe why.<br><br>
The peak experience lasted a few minutes, leaving me tripping lightly for about an hour afterwards. So, that's been my experience with Yopo so far.  Although I'm just begining my relationship with the plant, but it has already had a profound impact on me.  I feel more like myself than I have in a while and I can see a clear path for myself forming.  I wanted to post this to encourage serious explorers to give Yopo a try.  It is the real deal.  It is of particular interest to people interest in ayahuasca but are on medication, such as SRRI's, that may not be combined with a powerful MAOI, which is part of the brew.  Smoking Yopo can unlock the same doors as ayahuasca, with its own special style.<!-- End Body -->
