It seemed like all my friends at school lately had been starting to take Adderall, either to lose weight, or just for the satisfaction of the feelings we all got. <br><br>
Today was my second day to ever take Adderall and I didnt even think about the effects it caused until now. Since I didnt really care about the after effects and was just in it for the essential high, I didnt even think twice about how many milligrams I should take. My first time trying it (yesterday) I only took 10 mg but I wanted to feel crazy happy so I knew the next day I was going to take tons more! Well, I did and today will be a day that I will never forget. <br><br>
The day started off GREAT! I was energetic, happy, willing to learn, and pepped to take on whatever the day had to throw at me! I was more confident than ever and knew that nothing could stand in my way! I went to school and took at least ten pages of notes in every subject (I just had to stay busy) and before I knew it I was in last period which is softball. Well, the first thing we did was lift weights. I grabbed the bar (25s on each side, oh yah!) and felt really flustered but started to begin squats anyway. After about 6 squats I began to realize that I was sweating way more than normal and was feeling a little nauseous. I didnt know what to do and I didnt want to tell my coach I was on Adderall so I just asked to sit down for a minute to catch my breath.<br><br>
Well, I got back up and the sweating and panicking continued for about 20 more minutes. By that point I was freaking out and my friend was starting to notice that my face was turning red and my hands were slightly twitching. I was so happy when coach told us to go outside cause I assumed practice was over and that we were just gonna have a short session that day. So we go outside and these huge-ass jump ropes are out there and we all partner up. One of my girls and I were both starting to freak out cause neither of us knew if I was gonna be ok or not. Well, I went first and jumped for about a minute. By then my heart rate was up to 140 BEATS PER MINUTE! I wanted to sit down so bad but then I here coach talking and vividly look up to see him telling us to run around the gym.<br><br>
I just started slightly jogging thinking that when I passed coach I could just walk and catch up my breath and slow down my heart beat. But I couldnt even do that. I couldnt even walk. I remember feeling like I needed to throw up as I tried to inhale more air. The next thing I thought to myself was that I was going to die and that I had overdosed. My heart was tightening and my stomach felt as if I had ulcers that were on fire. I remember staring at the concrete and blacking out. I was hyperventilating big time and didnt know what to do. The next thing I know everyones jogging up to me asking me if Im ok. I didnt know if I was or not, and Im still feeling the Adderall now. I cried up until 30 minutes ago just because I was so freaked out about what could have happened. <br><br>
The sad thing is though, I like Adderall, ALOT. And even though this happened to me today, I dont know if Im going to have enough will power to stop taking it. Its not as if the drug is addictive in such a way that your body feels it needs it to function, its more like a mental drug. Because when I take it I am mentally all there but my body is on a high and feels tingly all over. It helps me concentrate and is a complete boost towards my self-esteem. The only thing that is making me think twice about Adderall is the comedown that I had today. I feel like shit, whereas this morning I felt on top of the world. I guess I am just going to have to convince myself that the comedown isnt worth the essential high, because theres gonna be that one time when Im not going to have the chance to get that comedown again.<br><br>
Im not going to take Adderall tomorrow, and Im just gonna see how it goes. I havent been able to sleep in 52 hours, and tomorrow is going to be hell. Adderall is some serious shit, so before you take it read up cause I wish I woulda known the facts before I got myself into it. Cause from now on every time Im depressed Im going to remember how happy that Adderall made me and hopefully Ill be able to say no, but thats not something that I will be able to predict right at this moment.<!-- End Body -->
