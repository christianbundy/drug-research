At 17 years old, having smoked weed, drank alcohol, and tried DXM, mushrooms, valium, hydrocodone, codein, speed (ritalin and adderall) and xanex before, never have I had an experience like Benadryl.  I had looked up OTC drugs to try out of curiosity and a desire to trip.  I had read about Dramamine and how it makes you trip, so I went to get some, but couldnt find any at the store, the grociery store by the way, so I looked at all the drugs they had, and found benadryl, and saw that it contained diphenhydramine, which was also an antihistamine.  My friend had told me about how antihistamines make you trip, so when I got home, I researched about this particular drug. I read many of people's experiences, most of which had said they had tripped, but did not recommend the use of this drug.  I had a thought that maybe I would be one of the few who would enjoy it.<br><br>
I was at my house, in my room, downstairs, with my dad in his room, upstairs, where he usually goes to sleep around 1 or two in the morning.  At around 11:00 pm on a school night, I took 15 25mg pills with water, four or five every 30 seconds or so.  I sat down at my computer and started to talk to people online.  After about a half hour, I started to feel heavy, as I read I would.  My dad came into the room, and talked to me for about 5 minutes, I was a little nervous, cuz my speech was already a little bit slurred, so I spoke as little as needed.  But he left and had noticed nothing.  After a while, I stood up, and took two steps and collapsed on my bed.<br><br>
Not wanting to fall asleep, I stood back up, and sat in my computer chair.  I stared at a 'reserved parking' sign that was on my wall, hoping to see something.  Nothing, so I talked online a little more, and when I started to lose concentration I told people bye, and got off.  I stared back at the sign for a few seconds.  Then it started to slide across my wall, I looked away, then back, and it was back where it had been before.  I stared again, and it grew larger, and small again, then started to slide again.  I looked at the wall 3 feet to the right of it, and it rippled, like water, then morphed as though it was a portal of some sort, like you would see in a science fiction movie.  I couldn't look at the sign without it moving, and I felt it harder to stand or move, so I stood up and jumped onto my bed, where I layed and looked around the room.  I looked at my guitar, which was proped up against my TV, the neck started to bend, and morph.  I heard my dad walking around in the next room, although I knew he wasn't really there.  The craziest thing was to happen next though.  I was looking below the computer desk, which is 3 feet or so from the door to my bathroom, and I saw two potato chip bags, walking, or sliding I guess, but as if they were alive, from under the desk, into the bathroom.<br><br>
After that I either passed out, or just dont remember what happened.  I woke up the next day, and felt a little dizzy and uncoordinated, but had no trouble driving to school.  I just felt like shit.  A physical hangover feeling, although no puking, and a mental hangover, like thinking twice about drugs in general.<br><br>
The next night, not knowing whether I had enjoyed the experience or not, I decided to try it again.  This time, I took 18 pills, in the same way.  These pills by the way were gel-caps, so I couldn't break them in half or anything.  Just take them.  This night was harder to remember.  I was sitting at my computer chair, doing god knows what.  I heard sounds first, sounds of people in the next room, but the light was off, and there was no one in there.  I don't remember seeing them come in, or leave, but throughout the hour or two that I was sitting at my computer chair, I talked to at least three of my friends.  I know this because I can remember the conversations.<br><br>
I remember talking to Jim, about the band, and how it was ruined by drugs and all. He was sitting next to me on the bed.  After a while, I noticed I was talking to a different friend, Zach, about the drug I had just taken.  I remember telling him that I couldn't talk quietly, I could either talk LOUD, or whisper, I had no control over the volume of my voice, and in fear of waking up anyone in the house, I whisperred.  I also remember talking to my 'girlfriend' Jen, about whether I should be doing over the counter drugs or not.  These hallucinations though, were so real, there was no sense at all that they weren't really there.  I could see them, hear them, and they responded to what I said to them.  I carried on a conversation with Jen for at least a half hour.  At some point after talking with my friends, and others were there too, but I didn't remember them as clearly, I went to sleep.<br><br>
The next day, I went and picked up Jen, told her about my experience, and she was sceptical as all of my other friends were, saying that it wasn't a real trip.  I felt like shit as I did the morning after the first experience, so I threw out the bottle of benadryl. Later that day, after talking to my friend Lance, and telling him of the experiences, he convinced me to buy him a bottle so he could try it out, since he had no time that day to buy it for himself.  I bought it, and couldn't get it to him until the next day.  That night, I was curious to see if maybe it wouldn't have as many bad effects if I took a lesser amount.  These were also 25mg but they were tablets, not gelcaps.  It was the same thing though, Diphenhydramine - (Benadryl), so I took 12 of them, breaking about half of them in half.<br><br>
This time, I was in bed for the experience.  After about a half hour, I started to feel the uncomfertable heavy feeling.  I stared at the ceiling, the walls, the sign on my wall, and saw nothing, after another half hour or so, having seen nothing, I fell asleep, probably due to lack of sleep from tripping the past two nights.  I woke up the next morning, not feeling as bad as before, but still feeling like shit, and having decided that I wouldn't take benadryl again.  So I gave all of the pills to my friend.<br><br>
He took 12 pills, but he is only 130 lbs or so, and he said he felt nothing. So he took 16 the next day, and tripped balls.  I saw him later in the day, he took them in the morning, and he looked very zoned out, and he felt like shit.  He said he wouldn't do them again either.<br><br>
The experience was more bad than good, although I can say I tripped my balls off on these pills.  This experience has slowed my drug use down, which is what I needed.<!-- End Body -->
