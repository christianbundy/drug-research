 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell I started not being able to fall asleep when summer started. My mom told me to take 1 (25mg) pill of benadryl. The number of pills I took per night rose quickly (100-200mg every night) and I was at 200mg for about a week. during that period my tolerance was up (I was taking them every night) but occasionally I hallucinated. Mostly hearing things but one time I saw a 3 eyed dog nawing away at my chair. It was one of the scariest things I've seen in my life. <br>I know benadryl is no heroin but I just want to let people know to just try to get to sleep normally, I started at 25mg but that went up and I wasn't able to sleep without it. To get off it my mom got me valerian root and I took that with benadryl for awhile and then I got off the benadryl completely, then off the valerian root.\n\n\n"
