We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font> <br><br><br>
First off I'd like to note that I'd eaten about 10 Adderall pills, slept 4-7 hours, smoked some pot (1-5 times each day) and eaten only 2 small meals in the 3 days before this. Any, all or even none of this could have factored into the effects. The Adderall pills are time-release and meant to last 12-14 hours. The computer duster was PerfectData 'PerfectDuster II', containing Chlorodifluoromethane.<br><br>
I learned about computer duster the night before from a friend of mine. He let me try it at his house. I took a hit and enjoyed it. I decided I would try it again soon. The next day I got my hands on a bottle. I ate 2 Adderall pills sometime between noon and 1. I called my friend and asked him to meet me at 10. We walked down to a gas station to get cigarettes, stopping a couple times to take a hit. We got back to my friends house around 11, waiting for his parents to go to bed.<br><br>
They went to bed at 11:30, so at 11:45 we put on the Kottonmouth Kings, A band who has at least one song perfect for every drug, and started taking hits. We took a hit every few minutes for half an hour, totalling about 10-12 hits each, every hit getting more and more intense. The first 5 or so hits felt like I'd taken an entire baloon of nitrous. After that, it was almost exactly like I was peaking on multiple, potent, ecstacy pills. The last hit I took gave me visual hallucinations. The world moved in and out quickly, like my eyes were pulsating like my heart. I headed home around 12:30.<br><br>
I got home and was planning on hitting the duster a few more times then sleeping (it'd been a while since I had), but I noticed that my heart rate was still up. I decided to wait a while until the Adderall wore off. Around 4 I was still pretty speedy, I got tired of waiting and went to my room. I put on my headphones and picked the song 'Brain On Drugs' by Shakey Bones, thinking it would be the perfect song to listen to while doing a duster. I was lying in my bed under the covers with the lights off. I took a hit and held it in. I pressed play on my boombox as soon as I started to feel it. As soon as I exhaled, I took another hit. I'd never done 2 hits in a row of it before.<br><br>
Visual hallucinations set in instantly. I felt like I was rising in the air slowly, the walls turned a dark red. My mind split in two, one thinking how incredible this was, the other saying the words, oddly enough, 'drug experience' over and over again in my head. But the words stopped and the trip changed directions. The song I was listening to had a DJ spinning a record. But I couldn't hear the song any more. All I could hear was the record spinning faster and faster, getting more and more high pitched. I rose higher into the air, the walls were getting a brighter red.<br><br>
I panicked, thinking ( or maybe it was) that my heart was going faster to the music and that at any moment it would explode. I sat up quickly and I ripped my headphones out of the jack, but that didnt help. The record still spun faster, my heart beat more and my mind was preparing to die. I ripped the boombox plug out of the socket and the record stopped. I sat on my bed, taking huge gasps of air. The trip itself was a mere 1-2 minutes long. My heart returned to normal. I came down from the high. It was horrible. I was positive I was about to die.<br><br>
Despite always taking precautions before drug use, I was incredibly stupid about this. First off, mixing drugs is never truly safe. Second, I was well aware of the hallucinogenic effects of this on one hit, 2 was a whole new world, and I did it alone anyway. Never, EVER trip alone. Third, any drugs you should do with caution when you're worrying/scared/any negative thoughts. (i.e. I was worried a bit about my heart beat, since the Adderall had not yet worn off after I expected it to.) I would suggest both Adderall and computer duster (not a lot though) for recreational purposes, but mixing them was obviously a bad idea. Please, everybody, no matter what you're doing, I beg you, BE CAREFUL. Being certain you're going to die is easily the worst feeling in the world.<!-- End Body -->
