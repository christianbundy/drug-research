I cant believe Im feeling like this. After only using coke for 5 days (about 1.5 grams), i find myself constantly thinking about doing some more. <br><br>
Its Monday night, Im not working tomorrow and I have over 6 grams sitting in my bedroom, begging me to come join them. Every minute or so, I catch myself thinking about it. I cant help but think that this is the start of an addiction and all the money Ive saved up is about to be blown on coke. Im actually not working for the next couple of months so how the **** am I going to keep my mind off coke during the days &amp; months ahead?<br><br>
I dont know what it actually is about coke. Ive tried E and speed, but coke is so different to them. Dont get the rush or the come down that I get on E and I love the fact that its a short hit  doesnt last hours on end. But my mind cant stop thinking about it now. And I keep beating myself up about it. I want to be able to use it, but not this anxiety of wanting more and more and more. It surprises me that such a strong feeling could take hold in such a short amount of time. My only hope is that I can hold out till I fall asleep. Maybe tomorrow I wont feel this way.<br><br>
Right now, Ive taken to the wine to dull my senses a bit, but if that doesnt work  Ill be hitting the joint. Funny that, trying to over come the effects of one drug with another. This sux!<br><br>
I remember having it 5 days ago for the first time. My dealer shouted me two lines after I bought a gram from him. He left and I just kept going. I got sooo horny. About 2 am I jumped into the chat room and picked up a guy. Drove round to his house to pick him up and brought him home. I did a line of coke and then we jumped into the shower. It was the best sex I have ever had. We kept going for a while. I couldnt cum and after that I drove him home. I finally got to bed after having half a j. <br><br>
The next day, my neighbour joined me in a mini binge. We got together in the early afternoon. Polished off a couple of bottles of wine. Started on the coke and then headed into the city. We went from bar to bar doing lines of coke everywhere we went. I went out that night, with enough left for one line. When I went to the toilet to have it, I found myself really angry that it dissipated into my wallet. I can still remember the feeling now  it was one of shock and disappointment. I kept wetting and sticking my finger and rubbing it on my gums to get some sort of sensation. And I remember thinking if it was too late to call my dealer cause I dont buy off the street.<br><br>
I didnt get more that night, but the next day I went to the bank and pulled out enough cash to buy .5 an ounce. Called my dealer and he brought it round. I thought I had it under control cause when he offered me a shout of a couple of lines, I declined, saying I was saving it for tonight. I knew that if I started, I wouldnt stop. I had a good night that night and did about .5 gram. Got home and did another couple of line before going to bed. I felt wonderful.<br><br>
The day after I did a couple of more lines while out with friends and then when I got home, I did a few really big lines while watching a movie. That was about 22 hours ago.<br><br>
Whats so weird about it all, that 22 hours is the longest time frame since having coke and I cant believe what Im going through. Without a doubt this is my drug of choice. But personally, I cant see coke being used as a recreational drug  not like E or speed.<br><br>
Cocaine has a much stronger mental additive power than E  something that wasnt stressed in all the literature about both drugs Ive read.<!-- End Body -->
