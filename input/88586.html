I have a quite long history with melatonin  I started taking it in 2003 as a sleeping aid and also to help with lucid dreaming. About 2 months ago I stopped taking it, due to running out of the supply. I also feel quite depressed (late Fall), so I didnt bother buying more. Since then, my sleep schedule was highly irregular  going to sleep at around 2-3AM, waking up after 11AM-1PM. <br><br>
Most of all, I was missing dreaming. My nights since stopping taking Melatonin were filled with groggy, hazy dreams that I barely remembered in the morning. I keep a dream journal, but lately barely had energy to write even a few words down.<br><br>
Today I said enough, and got more melatonin in an attempt to reset my sleep pattern to more normal hours. However, I decided to do this in style and pulled every trick I knew to increase the vividness of my dreaming as well:<br>
1) Going to sleep early (around 10 PM) to maximize time in darkness<br>
2) Drinking water to force awakenings<br>
3) Taking a combination of melatonin + vitamin B6 to boost vividness<br>
4) Extending the time in bed to 10+ hours to eliminate anxiety<br><br>
I took a 3mg Melatonin pill and a 50mg Vitamin B6 pill with a very large glass of water (around 500 ml). This took place at 10:30PM. I just sat on my bed in the darkness and contemplated philosophy in my bed until I felt really sleepy (around 20 minutes). I fell asleep in my clothes and felt very comfortable. The usual tossing and turning was not there.<br><br>
Drinking a lot of water before bed causes me to wake up at least once through the night, and I did wake up at around 2AM. Quickly examining my experience, I realized that I woke up from an incredibly long, vivid and detailed dream. Putting it in writing here is doing disservice to the experience, so Ill leave it out of this. The dream featured a good quantity of awareness. <br><br>
After using the bathroom, I quickly wrote down the dream and fell back to sleep after drinking a bit more (half a cup  100ml) water. At 3:30 I woke up again to use the bathroom, after an incredibly detailed dream in which I experienced conscious flying among other things. That was really fun!<br><br>
Without letting the excitement or expectations overwhelm me, I repeated the procedure  wrote down the dream and drank another 100ml of water. And I woke up again after an intense dream in which I thought I time traveled 8 years ago. It was delightfully trippy and confusing. <br><br>
I did not get out of bed for the rest of the night, but still managed to regain awareness after each dream episode and recorded several more dreams. I got out of the bed at 10:30 AM.<br><br><br>
This night was remarkable  after weeks of nothing, Im back into interesting, engaging and aware dreaming! Two qualities set these dreams far apart from the usual ones:<br>
1) The intense, bizarre, yet comprehensible dream world with deep history and characters<br>
2) The unusual level of awareness, able to analyze the experience, respond and interact with it in meaningful ways (not quite lucid dreaming, but the next thing closest to it)<!-- End Body -->
