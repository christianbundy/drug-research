 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have been consuming sinicuichi as an alternative to cannabis, and have found the two plants very disparate in effect.\r\nI am aware that the traditional method of consumption entails soaking the fresh leaves for a day in the sun.  Rather, I soak dried leaves in the sun for just a few hours, until the water resembles a golden sun-juice.  The taste of the tea is inoffensive, most like flower-vase water as another submitter has noted.\r\nThe effects tend to set in as soon as I begin drinking.  Most notably, my sense of color is highly sharpened.  Drinkers of sinicuichi have noted a 'yellowing of vision.'  In my opinion, this is due to the finer precision with which one is viewing sunlight.  Light seems to take on substance, is soft and creamy-gold.  \r\nSinicuichi is noted for its auditory effects.  I have not noticed these as much as the visual.  Sounds do seem softer and somewhat more distant.  Sitting down at the piano, a delicateness with and attentiveness to music is much easier to manage than usual.  I have experienced intense auditory hallucinations from cannabis use but have yet to from this plant.\r\nThere is a certain dilation of general awareness, particularly of one's perception of time.  While watching TV, I do not hear a speaker's voice as sequential statements.  Rather, it all seems to tie together and I am momentarily unable to distinguish what they have said first.  This effect is not as disturbing as it may sound.\r\nThere is a calm tranquility induced, but very little like that of cannabis.  This peace is very clear, and I am allowed to meditate on my problems with an enhanced objectivity.  There is none of the 'cloudy' or delusional awareness that comes with cannabis.\r\nMost importantly, sinicuichi imparts a sense of 'oneness.'  Listening to music I am unable to distinguish myself from the musician--the sensation is as if we are just alter-egos.  I am filled with an almost overwhelming sense of love, and get strange urges to handle insects nearby as if they are my friends.  \r\nAll in all, I have found sinicuichi a valuable plant that is surprisingly obscure.  When drinking sinicuichi I often feel like a stately Mayan emperor, reclining in the sunlight.  The benefits of the plant are absolutely to be explored and made use of.\n\n\n"
