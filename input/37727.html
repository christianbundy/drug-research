Last night is all sort of a blur to me right now. I didn't really plan or focus on tripping my balls off that night, and Ambien is known to be make users forget what the fuck just happened. Therefore, this account of what goes on in a high dose Ambien trip may leave out a few things.<br><br>
11:00p.m. - I was going to bed after watching some TV and browsing forums. I went into my bathroom and for some completely spontaneous reason, took 10 times my normal dosage of Ambien that night. The previous night, I had taken 25mg, so I guess I just decided it would be fun and interesting to double that.<br><br>
11:15 - I was feeling mild Xanax-like effects, and in this zone where everything is starting to transition from real to, just like the medicine says, ambient.<br><br>
11:30 - I was full out tripping. I still felt somewhat sober, though I found when I let it go and started doing whatever felt right, I would be acting really fucked up. I stumbled into my brother's room at one point, falling all over the place, barely able to stay awake. It was like I was the only thing moving, and everything else was just a swaying, stationary, confusing world. Everything around me was tilted the right; I was being dragged in that direction.<br><br>
12:00a.m - I turn on the TV and watch some Family Guy. I focus hard on the screen and the picture becomes completely three-dimensional. I am absorbed within the boundaries of the screen.<br><br>
12:30 - I am feeling extremely good at this point... Not even tired really. I can make anything melt or tilt or swirl. It was fucking nuts. I fell into my brothers room once again, barely able to walk, and sit down at the computer. Something makes me search for 'psychedelic' on Google images, and I stare at a ribbon rainbow pattern for at least 30 minutes, watching it bend and swirl, comparable only to the 5 gram mushroom trip I recently endeavored. Though also completely different.<br><br>
1:00 - I go outside and look at the three artistic photos of my dog hung on the wall... I stared at him into the glass for about 30 minutes, and I could have sworn every now and then he would smile at me. I went to go look for him but found this to be an impossible task, and got no more than 10 feet before deciding I might not make it back from that adventure.<br><br>
1:45 - Finally, I am ready to go to bed and let the drug to its real work. I lay in bed and imagine the most amazing things, flying through a world of psychedelic colors with my dog being the only one I remember. Eventually, I fall asleep and wake up only a little hungover at 6:45AM.<br><br>
Ambien is definitely not a drug that should be underestimated. It was pretty fucking intense and nothing like I expected such a high dose to be. High doses of Ambien are flat out hallucinogenic, bringing on visuals that are comparable to mushrooms and a body high that is a mix between Xanax and DXM (sort of).<!-- End Body -->
