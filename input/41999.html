My friends and I created a false penis in order to pass a drug test(s).  We used a Camel Pack or back pack water supply with a hose and valve that is usually bitten to release water.  We modified the mouth piece to look like a penis by building up a 'shaft' of tape and a head also made of tape and colored skin color(veins were added too).  When you go to take the test you leave your real penis in your pants and pull out the fake one.  The bag is taped to your stomach or thigh (it needs to be up higher or pushed on to release liquid) and the hose is run down to your crotch.  You release the urine by pushing lightly on the head (or mouthpiece) so even under light supervision it looks and sounds like you are pissing.  I would recommend taping hand warmers next to the bag to maintain temperature. The actual piss bag is going to be less than an inch thick so wear a hoodie and no one will notice.  If they suspect anything it you can be caught red handed with a bag of piss strapped to you.  I suggest you reinforce hoses, fill caps, anything that might leak.  A leak would be devastating.<!-- End Body -->
