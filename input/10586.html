I admit that I have done some pretty stupid things when in my early teen years.  But nothing compared to the time I took 4 prozacs (80mg) and got high.<br><br>
It all started when my my uncle came to Chicago to visit my grandma and me.  My uncle is big on sight-seeing everywhere he goes.  So, being the loving grandmother she is, she agreed to take him around town. I was sitting at home, alone and bored (dangerous for a curious teenager).  I was thinking about how bored I was and how cool it would be if I could get high.  But I was out of luck, and out of weed. So I thought, 'maybe I could 'robo'.  'Nah', I thought, 'been there, and done that.'  So I decided to search through my uncle's medication that he left in his luggage. Through my search I found his prozac (he's manic depressive) and thought 'What the hell, it would be pretty cool to be all 'shits and giggles.'  <br>
Well I took 4 of his pills at one time (even though the bottle noted: Take 3 pills daily.  I thought by taking 4 at once would enhance my fun time. Was I wrong. I had to go to work that evening (used to work at a fast food restuarant), and it had already been about 3 hours since I had taken the pills, and still I had no feeling of the effect. I came to the conclusion that they didn't work so I just put the experience out of my mind.<br><br>
That night me and a few co-workers went to smoke his Dub sack he bought earlier.  We went to his house and circled around his table and sparked the first joint. I had been feeling a little tired and light headed just after a hit or two, but I knew it wasn't the weed because it didn't work that fast for me.  So after a few more hits I was feeling really hot and anxious, but knew I was getting high at this point.<br><br>
But this high was very different, I felt real uncomfortable and bothered. I decided it was time to take my friend home and I would retire myself. Not wanting to duck out on free bud, we smoked one more joint.  I looked at my watch and said, 'Josh.....its.. time ....to.....g.........  I passed out landing face first on the table.  <br><br>
Everybody got a real laugh out of this, just thinking I was joking around (I was known for being pretty goofy when I was stoned).  It seemed like enternity had passed when I woke up.  I was scared shitless, I didn't know where I was, or who was with me. Josh was talking to me and all I could hear was mumbles and everything sounded like it was underwater. The only thing that kept running through my head was 'what the fuck just happened, and where am I.<br><br>
Finally I mustard up enough movement from my paralized legs to make it outside for some fresh air.  I started slowly regaining remembrance of where I was and what just happened. Anyway to make a long story short.<br>
Kids don't do prozac and smoke at the same time.<!-- End Body -->
