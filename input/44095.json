 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2002 I came across a very beautiful Datura in the Southern Pyrrenees (near the French/Spanish border)\r\nI immediately fell in love with this plant and I cut of one of the seedpods and took it with me. After returning to my camp I hung it on a tree-branch to let it dry.\r\nOnce dried I gave the pod a place of its own in the front pocket of my backpack and that's kinda where it stayed until I got home in April 2003. I gave my pod a special place on this little altar I set up, sort of as a souvenir (heck, it was more than that, she was my traveling companion for more than 6 months)\r\nI'll soon tell you what happened next but first this:\r\nTravelling is fun..or so they say. Along my way I had lost a loved one, a lot of faith in things I used to believe in and of course..a lot of money. Once back home I felt this huge gap between me and the people I used to call friends, between my life before and after embarking on my (spiritual) journey.\r\nI was not in the best frame of mind, no girlfriend, no job, no money....\r\nIt was around that time, a month or so after coming back home that the pod openened up. I noticed  this when I came home drunk one night and thought 'why the hell not?' I put the kettle on , holding the pod and all it's seeds in my hands. I then put my precious traveling companion in a cup and bathed her in the fresh-boiled water.\r\nFor about 20 minutes let it cool down and while waiting I wrote a goodbye-letter to my flatmates saying something like: 'I love you guys but I can hear datura calling me, she's a woman and she's waiting for me.\r\nI don't know what's gonna happen but she's too horny to let her walk on by.' I took my woman upstairs, into my bedroom and sat down on my bed while drinking her. She tasted o.k., just as I thought she would (I had smoked some seeds from other datura plants before and the taste was familiar)\r\nI really don't know how many seeds where in that pod but it seemed like millions of them where swimming in my cup.\r\nI drank the whole thing, including all of the seeds that weren't sticking to the bottom or sides of the cup.\r\nThis was about one in the morning.\r\nNext thing I know I wake up feeling all refreshed... there I was, in my bed with the morning sun coming through my window and a cup with something in it that was once my beloved traveling companion.\r\nI woke up feeling like I'd had a weird dream but it was too far away to recollect anything of it. No nasty side-effects, no hangover, no nothing....I just felt better then I did before.\r\nI don't know what happened, I've read and heard reports of people who took way less dried seeds than I did and going completely nuts on 'em. I guess she just didn't want to hurt me.\r\nI was at a point where it seemed like I had nothing to loose, I guess she went easy on me for taking my chances and surrendering my life into her hands.\r\nThat was the only time I tried Datura-tea. I still smoke Datura seeds quite often, it gives me a soothing feeling, almost nursing.\r\n( about 5-10 seeds per smoke)\r\nThe experience I described above is now about two years ago, sometimes I wonder whether I did really wake up from the arms of Morpheus my beloved Datura put me in that night, who knows; maybe my body is strapped to a chair in some mental institution right now.... heck...reality?. Theres no such thing.\n\n\n"
