 "report": "<p>\nWow. Never try this!! I am an idiot!</p><p>Setting: my bedroom, 10:30pm. slightly tired, but happy, and hopeful to get high. home alone.</p><p>I smoke pot very often, but was getting bored of smoking out of the same bowl all the time, so, i decided to try and hunt for parts for a new one. In the search, I found a gel pen, and a small pewter washer type of thing. I hot glued this to the pen, whose contents I had emptied. I thought I would just try and see if it hit well, or if the glue would melt, and when I lit it, the pewter started to melt slightly, and I got a fairly big hit off it. I felt high for a good 20 minutes, but had problems breathing.</p><p>After the effects wore off, i was almost gasping for air for about 5 minutes. I was coughing a lot. I felt like i had taken a big breath next to a fireplace where there was burning plastic; like i had plastic in my lungs. A pretty hard price to pay for a 20 minute buzz!!</p>"
