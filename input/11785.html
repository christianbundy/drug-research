I had been a pot head for years, and over the past year I had become obessed with 'ethnobotany.'<br><br>
Anyway, I got some HBWR seeds, and was very excited to try them. I throuroughly washed and scraped three seeds obtained from a reputable supplier, and ate them, not really expecting much. The result: THE FIRST TRIP WHERE I ACTUALLY LEARNED SOMETHING.<br><br>
The trip began about 1/2 hour after eating the seeds. It felt much like taking a small dose of LSD with a difference. Instead of the   usual sketchiness and scattered thoughts that accompany an LSD trip, my thoughts were crystal clear. I became more rational than I had ever been in my life, and began examining issues that were concerning me: School, Work, my relationship with my girlfriend, and my extremely heavy marijuana habit (I routinely smoked two - three joints a day).<br><br>
And suddenly, something just clicked in my brain. Even though I was having an amazing and fun trip, I realized that drugs had taken me as far as they could, and that it's now up to me to make the life I want for myself. And this life I envisioned did not include regular drug use, OF ANY SORT, including marijuana. It was not that I decided that drugs were bad, or evil, or even hazardous to my health anymore; I simply lost all interest in them.<br><br>
The next morning, I woke up, feeling lethargic and hazy, just like the day after an acid trip. Purely out of habit, I took a few pulls from a joint, and it was completely unenjoyable. It did nothing useful for me. And that's when the memories from my trip came back to me. I put out the joint, and sold my entire stash of weed to a stoner guy in my dorm.<br><br>
And since then, I have not done (or desired) marijuana or any other mind-altering substances, including these seeds (although they were extremely enjoyable and mild on the body). I realize that my obsession with cannabis and the hallucinogens was a desire to learn who I was, to 'get the message.'<br><br>
And that night, I got it.<!-- End Body -->
