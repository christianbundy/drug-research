 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell the night started up as I counted me out 600mg of diphenhydramine. Well, the night before I tripped hard off these pills and it was quite pleasing. But the night after I had a lot more so I decided to popped 24 more but the thing I did not know I had the medicine built up in my system which I would then overdose, bad. And to make it work I broke each pill on half and took it on an empty stomach. Then it hit me. My heart slowed down drastically and every minute I would have shooting pain that felt like electricity either going up my chest in my neck down my back or down my leg and my arms. \r\nI noticed my pulse was low and I couldnt even feel it so this is when I stumbled to the bath room and induced vomiting for I could at least get all the shit out that hadnt been absorbed. After that, I drank 2 glasses of milk which would absorb most of the shit in my stomach. I wouldnt go to sleep even though how fucking tired I knew that when people sleep the pulse slows down and if mine did that I knew I would die. I thought I would of died. I thought it was the end. I felt stupid as fuck afterwards also.\n\n\n"
