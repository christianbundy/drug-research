 "report": "<p>I had done K few times before, my favorite drugs are psychedelic tryptamines (DPT, 4-Aco-MIPT, LSD, ...). First I sniffed 10mg line to test possible allergic reaction. After one hour of very mild, but pleasant feelings I decided to go with 40mg. The onset was much faster this time and after 20 minutes I was going.</p><p>During peak, I was not able to think clearly, an effect similar to a lot of alcohol or Kratom. Body felt light, but not comfortable. Some people in other room were smoking hash and I was disgusted by the smell (at other time, I would have joined them).</p><p>Thoughts were disintegrated, I lost sense of space and laid down on the floor, waiting for it to happen. I listened to music (I tried to play, which was very difficult), but I did not find it enjoyable or interesting at all.</p><p>To me, it was much different than Ketamine, sort of pushing all the buttons, having something from opiates, from ket and from alcohol, which is something I do not prefer. I like clear mind that allows me to explore, not a state where I can hardly enjoy hallucinations and take something from it.</p><p>For me, it was just wasted time. Not enjoyable, though not 'bad' per-se. I did not feel depressed, sad or very nauseated. Just in a place not rewarding in any way.</p>"
