I have battled chronic depression since my adolescence.  Years of therapy and rigorous exercise helped little until I started taking the new-generation anti-depressants. For the last 15 years or so, I have had (temporary) good results with a series of these: Zoloft worked well for some years, then lost its efficacy.  Effexor likewise, and then Cymbalta.  A couple of years ago, rather than change to a new drug when the Cymbalta started to work less well, my doctor prescribed Provigil as an adjunct to it.  It has been great, on the whole.  <br><br>
Because my insurance will not cover the drug for off-label use (I don't have narcolepsy, just depression), the cost of the prescription drug is prohibitive, so I have been buying modafinil from overseas pharmacies, and have mostly had good luck with these sources (once, the product delivered seemed inert).<br><br>
I take 120 mg Cymbalta and 200 mg modafinil daily.  <br><br>
I find myself not depressed, have normal levels of energy (like other people, instead of feeling barely able to get out of bed), have little in the way of side effects.  I am more prone to motion sickness or other nausea than when not taking the drugs, but the problem is mild.<br><br>
The one concern I have is that I have found that cutting the dose (as I did once for several days when I didn't place the online order in time) seems to have a dramatic negative  effect.  A couple of days at 100 mg/day instead of 200mg/day had me sleeping 12 or 14 hours/night and dragging myself around feeling exhausted, and after 3 or 4 days at the lower dose, I experienced a  pretty serious bout of depression (uncontrollable weeping; ruminative, self-lacerating thoughts; generally excruciating misery).  A day or so back on the full dose put me right, but it has left me a bit nervous about the prospect of ever getting completely off the drugs.<!-- End Body -->
