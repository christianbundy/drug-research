 "report": "<p>I took about 35 capsules of benedryl. The first hour and a half I felt nothing, then all of a sudden I began to tremble and felt very jittery. I walked to the bathroom mirror and looked at my eye's, they were very dialated, almost black. I had an uncontrollable urge to move, I felt that if I stopped moving I would die. I spent the next 6 hours pacing back and forth in my apartment. My head hurt and felt like it was gonna explode. My sinuses were clearer than they had ever been, but my mouth and were extremely dry, I had absolutely no saliva. This was the worst drug experiance I have ever had.</p>"
