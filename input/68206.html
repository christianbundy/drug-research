My experience was a crazy one especially because I didn't see it coming. I never knew before that albuterol can heighten the effects of THC in cannabis. <br><br>
The night started of awesome smoking some extremely good mids. They were dro seeds grown in some liguidy manure. They were the best mids I have ever had and I smoke only dro. Anyway while I was smoking I took maybe 1 all the way to 3 puffs during the rotation of a hooka. I was fine for a long time about 2 hours had gone by before I smoked 2 js and 1 blunt (not a cigarello a full blunt). This made me super stoned and about that time I think the albuterol started to react with the cannabis and made me start to trip. not like a mushroom trip but made me literally freak.<br><br>
My friend and I left our friends dorm to walk to ours which was just down the hall. when I got outside the door to walk, I felt a wierd rush go through me and it made me freak even more. Then I fainted and woke up a second later. Then I did it again and stayed down longer then got up and fell again. Then I finally got it together and was able to run to the dorm and get to the counter and prop myself up. I was breathing heavily and was sweating. I felt like I was having a seizure and was just flippin out.<br><br>
I finally settled down but was still messed up. I kept thinking that I was going to forget to breathe but never did. When I remember what I felt when I was fainting was that I felt like my soul was leaving my body and then when I woke up my soul was falling back in. It was crazy then after I settled down I felt like I was forgetting who I am and kept telling myself who I was in my head. Eventually I was able to completely settle and I went to sleep.<br><br>
It was single-handedly the craziest and scariest event in my life. I was so relieved when it subsided and I could control myself again. I suggest to never use albuterol with cannabis. This is nothing that anyone should want to go through.<!-- End Body -->
