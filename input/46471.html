This will be short and sweet. I had a major addiction to valium (+ many more benzo/narcotics) which I kicked about two or more years ago. I bought Kanna as a live plant and have harvested some here and there as it grows and bruised and fermented the blades as tradition states. After drying it I smoked it all in one big hit from my bong and held it in for about 45sec. I has no idea what the effect would be like but it was almost 90% like smoking or eating valium. The smoke was very cool and tasted fairly sweet. I actually quite enjoyed the taste. A few seconds of breathing I noticed a very cold sensation in my throat and lungs just like smoking valium. My spirits were so uplifted I couldn't believe it. The strongest of the effects last a good hour with definite after effect for another hour. I can't wait until I get some more<!-- End Body -->
