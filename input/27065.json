 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had haerd about the pschoactive effects of nutmeg and decided to try it out. I'd previously tried smoking and drinking a tea from it with no effect so decided to try eating it. This is what happened.<br>7am - 20g of whole nutmeg ground into powder and drunk with OJ<br>8am - feeling nausious, and decided to go back to sleep.<br>4pm - woke up feeling sick and a little dizzy<br>4:30 - a lot more dizzy, alot more sick and threw up<br>5pm - a little less sick and extremely dizzy, slight visual   distortions, same for next hour<br>6pm - pass out on bed<br>11:30 next morning - woke up, still feeling quite dizzy but not sick<br>1pm - effects wearing off<br>3pm - back to baseline<br>Overall I must say I did not enjoy the experience, will not try it again, and do not reccommend any one else trys it.\n\n\n"
