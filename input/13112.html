O.k. so it all starts with me browsing looking at Datura trip reports. I noticed that a good number of people have been taking nutmeg preparations. I thought shit it must have some effect for people to try it. Anyways I go to look up info on dosage and what not but my browser sux and decided to quit cooperating. Well I went to my moms spice rack and grabbed her bottle of whole nutmeg. I then proceeded to crush it all up and ended up with between 1/4-1/2 oz of crushed material. Leaning in the 1/2 oz direction.<br><br>
So I go and take the nutmeg and cover it in lemon juice. Then I fill the rest of the glass up with water, nuked it, and let it sit for a while. At this point a batch of iced coffee I had put on was ready. I drank it and then made an iced drink with the filtered nutmeg preparation. Then I made another batch with the original nutmeg. I chugged the drink and it didn't taste too bad. I started another batch of coffee and went to go record what I had done so far. This was all accomplished by 10:13 p.m.<br><br>
It started coming on relatively fast for me to feel something. The harder effects didn't start until about 10:40 when I drank the second preparation. I then made iced coffee and started the third preparation. (Once again I am using the same material in every preparation) Anyways though at this point I am feeling slightly nauseous so I decided to smoke some herb. Not very good herb, but you can't always get what you want right?<br><br>
So I proceed to enjoy some herb and my coffee drink, afterwards it really kicked in, or at least more so. At this point I would describe feeling no sense of time what so ever and a hypnotic/disassociated feeling. (Good shit) I then ate 2800mg of St. John's Wort extract. I normally experience mood elevation off of my daily 300mg and wanted to experiment.<br><br>
So about 12am I 'come back' enough to go drink my final concoction. I then smoked another bowl and meditated. The meditation was very easy to get into. It wasn't as heightened as meditation on acid/shrooms/mescaline/etc would be but it was good. It all lasted until about 4am. It wasn't incredibly hardcore or anything, but it was well worth the effort.<br><br>
Tonight I'm going to throw some kava kava into the blend. I would definitely like to try this in combination with more powerful sacraments. All in all I'd say that from 1-10 10 being the best I'd give it a 5. I am an adamant user of psychedelics so it's not like I don't have anything more powerful to compare it to. I just wish some info were known about using it with MAOI's as I think it might be an interesting Ayahuasca additive. See you in wonderland people.<!-- End Body -->
