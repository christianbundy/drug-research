 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI decided to pick up a tea that contained herbs which had sedative and anxiolytic properties & selected 'Traditional Medicinals - Easy Now'. Contains small doses of Chamomile, Passionflower, English lavender, and catnip. Intentions for consuming were to lower symptoms of Generalized Anxiety disorder. <br>Boiled water and added herbs - steeped for 15+ minutes. Drank black and drank all of it with the span of 10 minutes.  Ate 3/4 of %55 cocoa dark chocolate ('Equal Exchange' fair trade), while sipping tea. <br>Mindset prior to ingestion was relatively neutral. Slept less than normal amount of hours (less than 6). <br>After ingestion was a significant calming.<br>Walked to campus and attended class. <br>Combination of sedative herb and prior sleepiness may have synergized as I felt quite tired during that lesson. Went home and napped of tiredness. Woke up feeling refreshed, not noticable side-effects; tea is sipped less than 4 times per day.<br>[Reported Dose: 'Chamomile 180mg Passionflower 180 english lavender flower 135 catnip 105mg rosemary leaf 105mg']\n\n\n"
