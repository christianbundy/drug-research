I am submitting this report because I didn't see too many reports on a combination like this, and I think it is definitely something worth looking into.<br><br>
A brief resume before I get to the report; I am 20 years old. I have experimented with cannabis, synthetic cannabis (terrible shit), alcohol, a few different prescription uppers and downers, MDMA, psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, <i>Salvia divinorum</i>, LSA, LSD, amanitas, and a few more entheogens and other natural highs that slip my mind. I am an all-day-every-day user of cannabis and caffeine.<br><br>
I had been given a pretty good dose of MDMA, about .2-.3 gram, and decided I needed to save it for the perfect time. I have rolled 20-30 times, and actually grew a little bored with the effects. I found it to be trippy, but not a 'trip'. I learned that MDMA is best when combined with something else, so that is exactly what I planned to do. But combine it with what? My first choice was LSD because I had candy flipped before on some weak LSD and a low dose of MDMA and had an amazing trip, and I wanted to try again with stronger stuff. But sadly I couldn't find any acid so I had to pick between 25I-NBOMe and cannabis edibles. I picked the edibles (apple cinnamon muffins) because I was in the mood for a chilled out evening, and I wasn't sure if the stimulant effect of the MDMA would mix well with the kind of speedy trip I get from 25I.<br><br>
I ground up about 6 grams of pretty good quality regular weed and broke up a few handfuls of stems I save for when I made edibles. I simmered it in a little over a half cup of vegetable oil for 20 minutes. I added the oil to the gluten-free apple cinnamon muffin mix. (I am forced to eat gluten free food or I get a terrible rash all over my arms and legs, very shitty.) I then equally put the batter in 2 mini-loaf pans and baked them until they were golden brown and smelled delicious. I gave one of the loaves to my brother, Pee, friend Enne, and girlfriend Emme to share, and split my loaf into 3 'doses'. I ate one of mine as soon as it was cool enough to eat.<br><br>
About an hour later (maybe 9:00) I began to feel the muffin. My body felt very light and pleasant, and I was in a very giggly and relaxed mood. I smoked a blunt or 2 and the effects increased in strength. I felt great and was excited to take the Molly, but I had no idea what to do with the night. I was the only one with drugs besides weed, and my girlfriend had to go to bed early because she wakes up at 5:00am for work. Just as I was thinking that, my friend Are texted me asking if Enne and I wanted to fish, and that he had dro. Fishing is my favorite thing to do sober, and on psychedelics or even just weed it feels like my own little slice of heaven, my escape from everything. So of course I got excited and told him to come get me. I rolled 3 blunts for the trip while I was waiting for him.<br><br>
Are showed up at about 10:00pm. I gave him half a muffin and popped my MDMA and we were on our way. He had a small truck so Enne and I had to ride in the back, but I was pretty baked from the muffin so I thought it was pretty fun. Our fishing spot wasn't too far away, but Are had to stop at his house to get his gear and the store to get some bait, so it took about 30 minutes to get there. Perfect. I pretty much started rolling as soon as he stopped the truck. The first thing I noticed was the body high. Usually a roll starts for me with a lingering stimulating feeling and random euphoria, and then the body feeling kicks in. The combination was doing exactly what I had hoped it would do. (Are had to take Jay to the closest gas station to use the bathroom.) I lit a blunt and Enne and I started walking across a field to get to the dock when I noticed exactly how hard I was rolling already. It was maybe 15 minutes into it and I was already full of energy and craving blunts. I was also talking Enne's ear off, telling him about my life and how psychedelics affect it. Nothing he hasn't heard me say while rolling before. <br><br>
We got to our spot and I started to set up my pole for catfishing, but I kept getting distracted. I paced around the picnic table several times just talking and talking. Are and Jay came back around 11. I included them in my blabbering. We smoked a couple more blunts and bowls of dro. I caught a pretty small catfish, but I didn't care about the size. The fight was so intense and the feeling of successfully pulling my catch out of the water made me feel really good. I was very grateful to the fish for giving me the satisfaction and carefully removed the hook and let him go. <br><br>
We fished til about 12. Are was a little jealous that I was rolling my balls off and his edible was making him pretty tired. We decided to get some 25I and left to my apartment. I ate the other half of my muffin as we were leaving. We got our blotters, and cut them in half. These were <i>very</i> strong doses and we found them best to be taken in halves. Plus Are's sister had never tripped on anything but 2C-I, and she was slightly nervous. We took our blotters at exactly 1:20am buccally. I was past my MDMA peak and my roll had slowed down, but I was still feeling great. I cleaned my kitchen while waiting for the come-up. In about 15 minutes I started to feel a little spacey head feeling. I thought it was weird because it usually takes 30 minutes for me to feel anything, but I guessed either the MDMA was making it kick in strong or I was just starting to feel the muffin I ate.<br><br>
At 1:50am, we all started feeling the 25I-NBOMe and put on my favorite movie, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I could feel my speedy roll feeling slowing down and turning into a spacey tripper feeling. Then I actually started to get drowsy. At first it concerned me a little bit because I was expecting a speedy trip, but my body has never felt so <i>amazing</i> so I just relaxed and enjoyed it. I almost fell asleep at one point. I'm guessing the tired feeling was from the muffin combined with the MDMA comedown. We watched the movie for about 30 minutes and we all seemed to 'wake up'. I was feeling more 25I than anything now, but I was still very relaxed and my mind seemed clearer. We went for a walk by the pond in my complex and decided we had to go back to the fishing spot.<br><br>
The ride in the back of the truck was intense. It was very hard to tell how fast Are was actually going because of the tracers. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> When he stopped the car, it took the world a few seconds to realize he had stopped. I was a little nervous that Are was tripping and driving but I know he had done it before with no problems. We got to our spot again and got our poles in the water. I watched the clouds for a while and noticed I have never had visuals like this before. Usually on 25I clouds, bushes, etc. seem to morph and form flowing simple patterns, but this was different. The clouds were moving very fast and constantly forming different faces that would quickly morph into a trippy complex pattern. It was incredible. I was seeing similar visuals on the dark tree line against the night sky and on the reflections on the river. It was very hard to watch my pole because it looked like it was constantly moving, so when I actually got a bite I almost ignored it. I double checked and saw that I had a very large catfish on the line. The fight was amazing. So much adrenaline. I was equally as grateful and careful as I was with the last fish. I was in awe at the fish's beauty and strength. Just tubes of muscle. I am 100% in love with tripping in nature so I felt very happy and peaceful, which is exactly how Jay described her trip. Are and Enne had a very good visual trip as well, but they didn't seem to get visuals like I did. A couple more blunts and bowls were smoked while we were here. We left the docks around 4am. I got back to my apartment, ate some more muffin, and went right to bed. I had no trouble falling asleep thanks to the edible.<br><br>
My MDMA + 25I-NBOMe + edible/smoked cannabis combo was exactly what I was looking for. The visuals were fantastic, the MDMA and/or weed really gave them a more intense edge. My body felt so good the entire night. The only negative thing about this experience was I could feel my MDMA comedown during my trip. I had hoped the 25I would just pick up where it felt off and take the lingering effects with it, but this only seemed to happen with the body high. Nothing too negative, just a slight headache and annoyance during the ass end of the trip. I hope to try this combination again, but next time take the 25I-NBOMe first.<!-- End Body -->
