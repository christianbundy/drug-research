 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active as such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See related article] </p><p>Recently I acquired 40mg of 2C-E in one bag from a friend.  This is the first time that I had ever taken a phenylthylamine.  I decided to take half the bag.  I busted it out and separated it into two lines.  So it was 20 and 20.  Taking 20mg of 2c-e orally is a hard enough trip in itself.  Not knowing how crazy it was instead of taking the 20mg orally I snorted it. </p><p>All I have to say is that this was the fastest that any drug has ever kicked in.  Approximately 3 minutes after snorting it a very strong feeling started to come over me.  The walls began to flash and I began to fry very very hard.  An extremely strong sense of terrifying fear and paranoia began to come over me.  Basically I began to wig out.  I began to become very sick to my stomach and started vomiting.  Even thought I was freaking out extremely hard, the visuals that ensued were fucking ridiculous.  </p><p>As I was staring at the ground the grass looked liked octagon shaped stained glass in sections swirling in and out of each other.  After the I stopped throwing up and freaking out approximately an hour after I had snorted it I went to sit down inside.  I was still frying very and couldnt stop shaking.  </p><p>About 4 hours into it I began to feel sane again and started to calm down.  The drug finally wore off totally about 8 hours after taking it. This was my first time taking a phenylthylamine and I obviously made a huge mistake snorting 2C-E.</p>"
