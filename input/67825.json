 "report": "\n\n\n\nI've had many experiences with psychedelics, pills, alchohol, even cocaine. I planned not to smoke weed today but my compulsive urge to alter my mental state led me to this when my parents went to an unforseen party. I expected for the booze (drambuei) to hit my harder but I wasn't feeling it so I started smokin some cigs in my basement to pass the time. Feelin the normal sluggish effects of alchohol I thought the ciggaretes would barely affect me.\r\nAbout halfway through my first cig I notice tingly feelings in my limbs and a sort of inner peace as if I could stay there for hours. By the second one I strongly felt the effects of tobacco by being sure to hold in the smoke. By the third I could barely feel my legs with the tingling up to a pleasant buzzing in my legs. I could barely stand up as I'd suddenly be overcome with my own weight and gravity forcing me to sit back down. Overall this was a pleasant experience although I did vomit towards the end from walking around too much.\n\n\n"
