 "report": "</p>\nI felt it was important to mention our findings about nausea and headaches from taking 5-meo-amt.  The nausea and headaches seem to be the only real noticeable downsides me or my colleagues have noticed about the experience.  The 5-meo-amt was administered numerous occasions with varying dosage and the general concensus is that smoking cannabis as soon as (or preferably before) the nausea sets in will usually completely alleviate the problem.  Any time we tripped and didn't smoke, we experience intense discomfort and nausea, but when cannabis was involved, it was unnoticable.</p>"
