 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAge: 21\r\nMood: excellent\r\nDuration: wait, it ended?\r\nI had an experience the other day; the day started like any other day, but was destined to be less than ordinary.  Its a Saturday, but I wake up at 8am nonetheless, eager to immerse myself in the music of my morning.  I plan that evening to ingest approximately 20mg of 2C-I and to go to the birthday party for one of my friends.  A good day is in the making, so I spend some time relaxing, waiting for the festivities to begin.  In retrospect, Im not entirely sure why I was waiting.\r\nThe evening comes and I weigh out the magic powder; my scale is only accurate to 10mg, but Ive found 2C-I to be relatively innocuous in the past and havent minded the variations in dosage.  [Erowid Note: For substances active at such a small dose, this measuring technique is particularly unwise. See related article]\r\nA certain giddiness overtakes me as I swallow the gel cap, like the first touch before the foreplay begins.  I grab my MP3 playerI always need musicand make my way out the door.  Seems like Im always passing through doors.\r\nThe thirty minute train ride to the party is relatively uneventful, as I find that this particular drug takes a while to come on.  Still, the sound of the train and the people on it, it reminds me of something.  Perhaps something Ive forgotten.  Soon, I arrive at the party.\r\nWhile at the party, I drank very little, but did smoke cannabis throughout the evening.  I find that the cannabis blends rather nicely with the 2C-I, as I almost start to forget that Im tripping.  Im surrounded by beautiful sounds and colors, even though very little has changed.  Pretty soon, I find myself drifting away from the younger people at the party and sitting with the older crowd.  I hardly move, save for my breathing, and I barely speak, but I listen.  I listen.\r\n'Third door on the right there.'\r\n'Yeah, you know, you just have to take out the trash.'\r\n'No, not that cake, the other cake.  Yeah, we sure dont want none of THAT cake.'\r\n'Dont you remember YOUR birthday?'\r\nThese people at the party, they were speaking to each other, but they were also speaking to me, to you, to anyone who would listen.  Im listening.\r\n'I dunno if Im gonna show up for choir practice tomorrow.'\r\nTheyre still talking, in fact.  I speak a few words, now, and hear myself saying the same thing.  Im listening to myself.  Im sitting, silent, unmoving, listening to myself.  A friend of mine convinced me to go to the party and I owe him my gratitude.  There are a lot of great people there and it wouldve been a real shame to miss it.  Peace to you all.\n\n\n"
