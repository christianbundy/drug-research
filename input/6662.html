Ok this is travis, i've written experiences to erowid before about my friend at the bowling alley etc.. I'm going to tell you the trip of my life that happened a few weeks after my friend had the seizure. I had been taking tussin and dramamines way too much constantly during my spring break and almost every weekend i'd trip. I guess this night it was just all built up and fucked me out of my mind. <br><br>
First thing we took all the dramamines, i was with my friend Jon. We were just chilling listening to trance music then we decided to go to sleep because we were very tired. Next thing i know i'm sitting in his living room and his mom is like Travis, are you ok are you sleep walking? are you gonna be ok do you need a doctor? all this stuff she was saying. This was after i did this and i dont remember this at all i went and knocked on his moms door and opened it and then turned the light on. i then asked for the phone. she gave it to me then i left the room. i kept trying to come in and she kept kicking me out and she blocked the door. <br><br>
After this is when i was in the living room and she was talking to me to make sure i was ok but i only remember being in the living room i dont remember going in her room. Next thing i know i was standing in some bushes and i took off running for no aparent reason and this cop started chasing me. This black dude that had said i was in his yard crawling around chased after me and tackled me and threw me on the ground. Comes to find out i had left Jons house at 3 am and was out running from the cops for 2 1/2 hours. it was now almost 6 am. I'm sitting in the cop car and i didnt know what the fuck happened. They dropped the resisting arrest charges against me and now i have two violations of my current probation and i have a court date set for them. <br><br>
Also this whole time i was barefoot and running around my feet were bleeding and they were all fucked up. Please post this experience i want people to see what dramamines and dxm can do after a long build up in your system. Normally i can handle 24 dramamines and 900 mg tussin together without problem but this time it was just unreal. I honestly say dxm is a great drug and i love doing it but if your going to do it you need to be in control and dont do it more than once a month. If you let it get out of hand you will eventually fuck up and have a bad trip or worse.<!-- End Body -->
