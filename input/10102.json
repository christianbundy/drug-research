 "report": "<p>I read about Kava Kava in a Legal Highs pamphlet I found online. After further investigation I learned how the islanders of the South Pacific used it as a relaxant. This intrigued me. I went down to my local vitamin store and bought a bottle of Kava Kava concentrated extract capsules.</p><p>I went over to a friends house and started swallowing capsules with water. I started with 5. After a few minutes a took a few more. A little while later, I took a few more. A little while later, a few more. I'd say it was a total of 12 over the course of 1 hour and a half to 2 hours. I definitely felt relaxed. They were watching some movie on television (I don't remember) but I was content to just sit there.</p><p>I did not feel 'stoned' like I have read about. I have tried marihuana on many occasions and this was quite different. I was just relaxed. There were no visuals or epiphanies. Just calm.</p><p>I think it is important to note that this calm felt very natural. I knew I was calm, but I wondered how much of it was the effect of the capsules and how much was just my normal mood. I think it is a more subtle drug than weed, or even alcohol.</p><p>We cracked open a few beers while playing some darts. I don't think my accuracy was affected negatively or positively. Like I said, I was just calm. I ended up drinking quite a few beers (for me, that can be 6). I went to bed feeling a bit drunk. Total time passed, probably about 5 hours since the first pill.</p><p>It was in my sleep that I had the most incredible, insane, unbelievable dream I have ever had. I'm not sure I want to dream that dream ever again. It was so incredibly vivid. This was the most real dream I have ever had. It took me to a number of real world places that seemed exact, right down to all the people! Even their faces! There was no supernaturalness to the dream. The insanity came when, in the dream, I couldn't stop myself from tripping (like on acid or shrooms). I would trip extremely hard and not know what my physical body was doing for these times and I could not control when or where this happened. This was incredibly scary since I thought it was real. At one point, in my dream, I was on the floor in a fetal position, at my place of employment, SCREAMING, because I thought I was insane. I ended up working out the tripping issue in the dream (after 'days' of trying), but still woke up with a sense of disbelief. For almost that entire day, I was unsure as to whether or not I was really awake. I can't say it was pleasant. When I thought I had recovered, I told my friends about it and they said something like, 'Dude, it's not over.' and I didn't know how to handle that. I was very confused and worried for about half an hour after that. Eventually, I accepted this reality as real but I must say, I had my doubts.</p><p>I tried for a lighter experience by taking 7 capsules before going to bed but I don't remember anything.</p><p>Another night, before going out, I ate 8 capsules. While out, I had a few drinks (a few, enough to get me buzzed but not drunk), and then went to bed. I had another AMAZING dream, but this time without the insanity and doubt the next morning. I remember it being extremely colorful.</p><p>So, my theory is that a little alcohol and some Kava Kava extract will really make for an exciting night of sleep. While awake, it's just good. While asleep, it's quite amazing.</p>"
