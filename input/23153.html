After reading many of the rave reviews of this mysterious herb, I got some at an online botanicals store for $15 for a whole ounce (+ $5 for ship) Dried leaves. I have tripped on acid and shrooms MANY times in the past. It's been about 2 years of being sober and married, and getting the urge to explore that other realm again. I was home alone and propped up some pillows on the bed, no music, no tv. It was still daylight out.  I smoked 2 full hits out of a glass 'steamroller' pipe. Held each hit in for 20-25 seconds. Was instantly hot, with freezing feet, highly uncomfortable. At this point I realized 'I don't like it'. Unsure if I'm too hot or maybe too cold, I lay down with my cold feet under the blankets, sweat dripping off my forehead. (been 1 minute) Then it got worse, my tank top T-shirt felt like it was brush burning down into my shoulders. Remembering stories of guys stripping naked and running in the streets, I decided to pull myself together, I took off my shirt, laid down, got up and sat in a chair, uncomfortable, laid back down on the bed. <br><br>
Minor visuals, seeing things on my desk kind of merging to whatever was next to it, with energy waves shooting between everything. Now, 'I like it' for 5 minutes it was really entertaining. For the next 2 hours my mind was SO CLEAR, SO INTELLIGENT AND AWAKE. Definetly worth the initial 2 minutes of panicky discomfort.<!-- End Body -->
