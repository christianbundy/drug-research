My brother has social anxiety and God only knows what other problems, and has a prescription to a Paxil everyday. He probably dont even take em, so I nicked a few to experiment with later on. My rule of thumb with pharms is three times the suggested dosage (yeah I live on the fucking edge), so I take three little pink pills and stick them in my wallet.<br><br>
Mid morning on a Friday, Im in trig class, doodling in my notebook because I havent got a damned clue what the teacher is going on about and dont really care. I'm just bored outta my skull, and then I remember I have Paxils. Nows as good a time as any to take them and ride out the high for latter part of of the day (which is how long I figure itll take since Im kinda full). I drop them straight down my throat without touching my tongue, trying to avoid the ubiquitous bitter aftertaste in the back of my throat where I always think that I dont have taste buds. <br><br>
T-00:03- The stuff hits like a freight train. All the sudden, I get this bizarre feeling that nothing around me is of importance or even real, and that my consciousness is the only definite thing in the universe. I dont even try to pay attention to my instructor or the problems were going over, and resume doodling in the margins of my notebook. Nothing around me has meaning, even the things I just drew. There is a widening chasm between my internal monologue and the world around me. I think at this point I could just get up at any point and leave, since this freaking school means nothing to me.<br><br>
At the same time, my eyes drift in and out of focus, and for the next 15 minutes or so, its pretty challenging to see anything straight, but I dont really need to anymore since the only things of matter in this universe now exist inside my head. Now the hard part- I suddenly get a horrible, searing stomach ache, like an alien parasite fighting its way out of my belly. I excuse myself to the bathroom because most immediately I am possibly about to vomit and secondarily since Im just loosing my shit in the middle of math class. I have the challenge of making small talk with a friend in the bathroom, but its hard to talk. I sit on the toilet for a few minutes, not really to relieve myself but just to breathe enough air into my stomach to convince myself Im not gonna throw up.<br><br>
T-00:10- Pretty soon the bells gonna ring, and the next class is not important enough to bear through like this, so I just lie down on the couch in the senior lounge. About twenty minutes after I took the pills, all the effects fade out, and I feel better. I feel a bit relieved, but a bit ripped off. My head is near totally clear, aside from my eyes periodically wandering out of focus.<br><br>
T-02:30- Im on a public bus, and I get the realization that my own consciousness is the only thing that is constant in my life and thus the only thing that I should consider. Nothing else is real. Its like Im in the matrix and Im the only one thats human. All the other effects have faded, but a lengthy, intense delusion of intense alienation has ensued. This shit can make me do pretty cool things when nothing else is real. Im usually a pretty shy dude, but I was talking to every girl that came my way. This was really creepy inappropriate shit that I didnt rehearse in my head at all. It just flowed right out. Nothing happened with them, but Ive never seen myself that way before in my life. Its a really amazing sensation. This was all on top of that elemental slightly confused-THC like high that effects my immediate perception. <br><br>
The effects lasted about thirteen more hours or so, until I woke up the next day. All in all, Paxil was (aside from the initial stomach pain) a really awesome and invigorating mood enhancer. Of course, Im just talking at the illicit recreational level, and have no ezperience with what the reccomended dose would do.<!-- End Body -->
