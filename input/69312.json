 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAs internet available drugs go, I think BZP/Tfmpp is pretty bloody effective. I've tried tennuate, and ephedra, which do compare, however tennuate mangles my innards for days, and ephedra stops me pissing. The comedown from bzp/tfmpp, is absolutely awful, but it's a physical comedown. I always felt haunted after tennuate, and ephedra the day after feels like I'm recovering from a seizure.\r\nI would have difficulty separating the effects of bzp/tfmpp, from the effects of taking mdma. It's easily as 'buzzy' in its initial stages to amphetimine, but not as crisp. I found more control also, for example with speed I tend to go full on till one dab too many, with this I still retained some semblance of tomorrow's consequences. I suppose that might be a down side to some, if it is one should stop taking drugs immediately and face your demons.\r\nI like really shitty comedowns, as there ought to be a price to pay.  Avoid drinking high congener beverages, and don't eat dark chocolate, this drug is a migraine multiplier.  \r\n[reported dose: 2x170mg bzp/tfmpp (as per manufacturer) ]\n\n\n"
