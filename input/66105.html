I heard about the stimulant and potentially perception altering effects of tyrosine, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I bought a bottle for about 10 bucks and it had 60 pills at 1000mg each. I popped one and went ahead and started my training regimen that day. I didn't feel any sort of jolt of energy but it certainly helped me. My endurance was increased slightly and I wasn't as tired as I normally would be. The crash (about 5 hrs later) kinda sucked, but after a few hours rest I was good to go. No changes in my personality or perception. <br><br>
I considered the experience a moderate success so I tried two a few weeks later. My endurance shot through the roof and I completely blasted through my training. The fatigue  on my body coupled with the crash (again, 5 hrs later) had me out for a while. I slept for about 5 hrs and woke up and ate something, then fell asleep for the rest of the day. Thankfully I didn't have work that weekend. For the cost and potential combinations I'd say its definitely worth it.<!-- End Body -->
