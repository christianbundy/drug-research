 "report": "<p>Just made a brew of wormwood tea and honey about 30 minutes ago. Unfortunately I have a horrible gag reflex, so I could only down about 2/3 of it before I thought I would throw up from another sip. The brew was pretty strong though, with a nice, finely chopped batch of wormwood. The feeling is very subtle but definitely noticeable. Right now everything seems kind of mellow, yet my feelings are definitely very happy and positive.</p><p>I've read comparisons to a pot high, although I would say that it would probably most closely resemble a pot high, it definitely is very different, and not as much of a change in normal consciousness as pot is, more of just higher energy and a glowing feeling.</p><p>I'm not sure that I would try it again, the taste was awful, and it is no substitute for good bud.</p>"
