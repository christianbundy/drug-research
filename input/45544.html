Previous mystical experiences: A feeling of pure bliss/love while meditating on mushrooms  knowing that I and everything else was God.<br><br>
Previous drug experiences: I sniffed coke about twenty times during a span of about a year/ Consumed E at least once every weekend for about four months/Tried acid once/Smoked crystal for about two weeks . <br><br>
Previous plant experiences: Ive smoked a lot of Cannabis/ Ive smoked salvia divinorum a few times in the last month (only light doses).  <br><br>
I have been mediating daily for about a few months now, and Ive experienced some pretty incredible coincidences. When I tap into this infinite organizing field of intelligence, my deepest wishes seem to manifest. But something happened today that I was not expecting. I was kind of stressed out, so I decided that I would mediate for a while. I hopped on my bed and closed my eyes. While lying down, I used the mantra so- hum (thinking the word so while inhaling, and hum while exhaling, while concentrating on the sound of my breath)(1). I also would periodically stop the breath work (every minute or two), and just lay there in silence  allowing no thoughts to enter my consciousness. When this became too difficult to sustain, I would return to the breath work. <br><br>
Im guessing that I was meditating for about fifty minutes, and then it happened. My body felt very light, and I could sense that I was disconnecting from it. I then consciously made it my intention to leave my body (although I didnt actually think it was going to happen). I felt myself going up towards the roof in a quick-like fashion  and even though I didnt look down  it was evident that I was out of my body ( I could see that I was in my room , even though my eyes were closed). I wasnt really happy or scared at first  I just 'was'. I then started to think that maybe I would die if I stayed 'out' for an extended period of time, so I tried to return to my body. I opened my eyes (which was difficult), and I laid there in amazement. An out of body experience  and I wasnt even high! This was the most amazing thing that I have ever experienced. Next time, Ill see if I can prolong the experience for a little longer.     <br><br>
