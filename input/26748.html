Let me first qualify myself.  I have been a drug user for over 15 years now and have tried almost everything, from DMT to LSD to heroin, to mj.   Recently I tried Salvia D. for the first time.  I did the 5x stuff.  Ok a little intence even a low doses but no too bad, butI perfer the body high over the mental 'fuzz'. <br><br>
I have been doing some research with Salvia Splendens Vars. Not Divinoram.  Let say without any doubt that this IS A PSYCH0ACTIVE PLANT.  Although I have not tried all varieties of Splendens so far almost all have gotten me 'there'.  <br><br>
I have about 6 varieties of this wonderful plant growing in my yard. I have dwarf, full size, purple, red, white and pink.  So far all have definate psychoactive properties.  ALL are SPLENDENS. <br><br>
I usually feel the effects after 1 bowl. A wonderful high does not do this plant justice. It is an opiate-like wonderous body high. Very floaty, with just a touch of MJ like feeling. Almost like I smoked a small bowl of opium. For these reasons I belive that it has serious potental for abuse, and possibly addiction.  <br><br>
After 3 bowls the effects are somewhat similar to a very weak dose of Divinoram with that excellent body high, that keeps growing with each bowl.  The effects last longer than Divinoram up to 2 hours depending on how much used and how long I have smoked for.  <br><br>
I have gone to work on this substance w/o any ill effects.  There is no comedown and no hangover.<!-- End Body -->
