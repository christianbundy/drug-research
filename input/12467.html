Although Soma (Carisoprodal) is unscheduled, it can be a dangerous drug, especially when combined with alcohol. I was prescribed Soma for cramping of lower back muscles &amp; insomnia at night.  One morning when I was alone in the house I took three 350 mg Somas &amp; 1 mg of Klonopin (clonazepam) so I could get a nice, long restful sleep. Soon after I blacked out &amp; somehow ended up taking 8 more 350 mg Soma tablets.  My brother came home around 5 hours later &amp; found me in my underwear, passed out on the hard tile floor of the kitchen, flat on my back.  He thought I was dead but managed bring me to consciousness.  I was extremely incoherent, speaking gibberish, and passing in and out of consciousness.  <br><br>
Before my brother could pick me up to carry me to the hospital I had a seizure (I have never before had a seizure in my life).  In the emergency room at the hospital I had two more seizures &amp; then they stuck a tube down my throat where charcoal was administered. Memory blackout lasted from 9 am the day of the overdose to the afternoon of the next day. The 1st thing I remember is waking up in intensive care with a large tube in my urethra. I was also sh*ting black charcoal for 3 days.  Finally, I was required to complete an intensive drug abuse/severe depression program at a mental hospital which lasted 8 hours a day for 4 weeks (a real drag) because they thought I had tried to commit suicide even though I was really just trying to get a nice restful sleep &amp; blacked out.  Luckily I didn't combine the Soma with alcohol because that most likely would have resulted in respiratory depression &amp; death.<!-- End Body -->
