 "report": "<p>\nDosage: 10 grams dried leaf steeped in 2 cups water for 1 day in the sun.</p><p>Mind Set: Curiosity. New experience.</p><p>Setting: Friend's Apartment around 11PM. Nice and clean environment. Good music.</p><p>Most lasting impression; this stuff tastes nasty. Both my friend and I were feeling nauseous as we imbibed the bitter brew. For me, after a brisk jog in the night air outside, the nausea passed (for the most part) and I moved into a nice, mellow space. For my friend, unfortunately, the ill feeling remained and she ended up going to bed nauseous and mildly irritated.</p><p>Sinicuichi seems quite relaxing, slightly nauseating and truly disgusting to me. I probably won't try it again unless a more potent and palatable potion produced from this plant pops up.</p><p>Take care.</p>"
