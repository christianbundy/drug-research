 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDosage: 10 grams dried leaf steeped in 2 cups water for 1 day in the sun.\r\nMind Set: Curiosity. New experience.\r\nSetting: Friend's Apartment around 11PM. Nice and clean environment. Good music.\r\nMost lasting impression; this stuff tastes nasty. Both my friend and I were feeling nauseous as we imbibed the bitter brew. For me, after a brisk jog in the night air outside, the nausea passed (for the most part) and I moved into a nice, mellow space. For my friend, unfortunately, the ill feeling remained and she ended up going to bed nauseous and mildly irritated.\r\nSinicuichi seems quite relaxing, slightly nauseating and truly disgusting to me. I probably won't try it again unless a more potent and palatable potion produced from this plant pops up.\r\nTake care.\n\n\n"
