 "report": "<p>Ive been on Zoloft for over 5 years, with a few short breaks in between. I had a lovely little nervous breakdown back in March of 2000 and was given a script of Celexa.  After six weeks I realized it didnt work, and got a new doctor and a nice script of Zoloft, Wellbutrin (Buproprion), and Lorazepam (generic Ativan).  This worked pretty damn well.  It also helped that I had massive support from my family and friends, who allowed me to completely collapse, not work for a while, and get better.  I didnt have to check in to a hospital psych ward, thanks to all these factors, and Zoloft probably played a big part.</p><p>After two weeks of taking Zoloft, I started feeling much better.  I didnt obsess (had OCD)  thoughts didnt stick in my head for too long.  And many of my thoughts werent negative any longer.  I became hopeful for the first time in years, maybe for the first time ever.  I began to take a long hard look at my life and started thinking about whether or not I was really living it right.  I finally had enough clarity of mind to do this.  Oh, did I mention I also gained 40 pounds in about 5 months?  Oh yes, and it went even higher.  During my depression I dropped to 165 pounds.  Eventually, after about 2 and a half years on Zoloft, I weighed 221 pounds. There are there side effects and weight gain may not be the worst of them.</p><p>I can take a lot of shit when Im on Zoloft.  My dose ranged from 100mg to 200mg would be during a depressive episode (had about 3 of them in 5 years, 2 major ones).  100 mg when Im at cruising altitude.  I found, after taking Zoloft (yeah, the tranquilizers probably helped a lot too) I didnt take things so hard.  In fact, I didnt take things hard at all.  Its not as if nothing matters to me, but I wont sweat the small stuff anymore.  If somebody insults me, I can smile and say, OK, whatever.  I find I dont want things I used to want  cars, girls, clothes, sex, whatever.  I look at everything long-term instead of seeing just the short-term.  For this ability, I love Zoloft.  It has made me emotionally much stronger than I ever was.  Ive been able for the first time in my life to go back to school, get a teaching credential, work in a school, and do all the things that normal people do.  Before Zoloft, believe me, I was not normal.  I was a disaster.  So, mentally  Zoloft has been a godsend.  </p><p>Now here comes the bad side of Zoloft.</p><p>I have just been diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome.  Its a condition that is a precursor to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 Diabetes.  Very dangerous, and I seriously doubt I would have it right now if I didnt take 100mg of Zoloft every single night of my life.  True, I also take Wellbutrin and Lorazepam, but Wellbutrin is a kind of speedy anti-depressant (Ive taken it alone, doesnt work well for me.  I use it to counter-act some of the side effects of Zoloft) and never seemed to make me gain weight or lose weight getting on or off it.  Lorazepam is something Ive gone on and off of many times, and my weight doesnt change much on that either.  So, I have my sanity, but I might be having a fatal heart attack along with it.  Did I mention Im 34 years old?  Im too young for this shit.</p><p>But wait, theres more: sexual dysfunction.  Sometimes I wont get it up, mainly because I wont want sex.  Ive left some poor women extremely frustrated because I refused to sleep with them.  I just didnt want it.  I doubt I would have turned them down if I had not been taking the drug.  So my libido comes to a grinding halt.  Usually. Usually?  Well, yes because there are times  few and far between  when a type of severe horniness comes crawling up on me and I have to get laid, dammit!  Usually, this happens when I just go off the stuff, and Im pretty sure its a withdrawal symptom.  Ive had some weird sexual experiences when getting off of Zoloft  premature ejaculation, hard time achieving orgasm, multiple orgasms (is that a problem?).  The first and last of these happened to me the last time I went off Zoloft  and I went slowly.  Took me about 2 months of tapering down, but the withdrawals were still awful.  </p><p>But waitTHERES MORE.</p><p>The worst withdrawal symptom and I mean the worst is this: Pure unadulterated rage!  I literally freaked out on people for no reason at all.  I almost became violent with people I didnt know.  Id snap at everybody.  Im telling you, this kind of rage is not normal at all.  When I hear about people killing people because they were on Zoloft, I hate to say this, but I can see how that could happen.  I didnt want to kill anyone, but I could not control my anger, and Im a very, very mellow person.</p><p>Zoloft is the only drug that can get me out of a bad depression.  It really is magical in that regard.  </p><p>Incidentally, there were two times I was tired of the weight gain, sexual dysfunction, etc.  So I tried to get off of Zoloft, and went through all those lovely withdrawals  I ended up having full blown depression one time  another breakdown and had to get back on it again and go through 4 weeks of absolute hell (but I did drop about 20 lbs or so).  The other time, I saw the writing on the wall (one gets good at depression after a while) and got right back on it when I realized I was going back into the hole.  My psychiatrist tells me I might have to take Zoloft, or something like it, for the rest of my life if I want to continue to be normal.</p><p>So now, Im getting off the Lorazepam (again) and doing my best to drop the weight and lower the blood pressure.  I like the way Zoloft makes me think, but I dont like heart attacks, stroke, or type 2 Diabetes. Being fat is not cool, and its certainly not helpful for somebody already battling depression.</p>"
