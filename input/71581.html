I took 220mg of DXM around 2am. I stayed up keeping myself busy. I hardly felt different and was a little frustrated so I decided to go to sleep around 4am. I had some insomnia and eventually fell asleep around 6am. I woke up at 8am and went on with my day. I had some minor vertigo and dizziness. My eyes seemed a little dilated throughout the day. At the end of the day I decided to go to bed early because I was very exhausted. At 9pm I turned off my lights and closed my eyes. I thought DXM was out of my system, but I was wrong. I was having closed eyes visual. Very spacious patterns what were black and white moving downwards and left and right. <br><br>
I grabbed my phone and turned it on. The light was trailing off from it and it looked like it was a straight line. I waved my hand passed the light and my hand seemed as if it was being shadowed by another hand. I closed my eyes again and the patterns were much different. All the shapes seemed as if they were scrunched together and they were indistinguishable. I turned my light to my room back on. Everything seemed normal and I wasn't hallucinating anymore. I looked in my mirror and my eyes were dilated. I returned to my bed with my lights turned off again. The closed eye visuals were so vague I couldn't hardly notice them. They eventually stopped and this whole hallucinations process only lasted for ten minutes!  <br><br>
I think DXM has very strange effects when used in complete darkness.<!-- End Body -->
