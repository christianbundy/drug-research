My friend had taken a fair amount of this stuff and I had done a little bit of research but only so far as to find out if it was safe. I had no idea what to expect. My friend said he had some hallucinations but having never tripped myself I did not understand the true nature of psychedelic visuals and had no idea what they even were to be honest.<br><br>
I spent the afternoon huffing nitrous and had a bit of alcohol and while I was just enjoying myself I decided to take one of my friends blotter paper tabs under my lip, just to try it out. I felt sick for 20 minutes and then put it under my tongue. The taste was bitter but bearable. After another 10 minutes I started to feel slightly strange. I felt disconnected from the world slightly.<br><br>
After an hour I needed to go to my room and chill out. I went on the net and did some reading and I felt pretty excited and happy, I guess verging on euphoric. I had to keep reattaching myself to reality and lost focus on what I was doing very easily. After 2 hours it started to scare me how I was losing focus: every time I'd look away from the computer I would get a fright at how my mind would not co-operate. But then the amazing effects set in. Complete ego loss. I saw beautiful kaleidoscopes of colors and faces in everything I looked at. I saw dragons crawling over my walls in the shadows, as clear as day. I didn't want to go to the bathroom but I needed to pee and I found the walk there was amazing, peeing felt amazing, and washing my hands in icy cold water felt amazing. I noticed in the mirror my pupils were massive and I saw how beautiful I happened to look in the mirror. I went back to my room and for another 2 hours had the time of my life. I felt connected to everything and everyone and the only emotion I could feel was love for everything around me. I wanted to share my feelings with the world.<br><br>
After 4 hours the visuals were still crazy and I was starting to get anxious. I talked to my friend on messenger because it was the only thing I felt was anchoring me to reality. I was scared I was getting sucked away into the trip, unable to think rationally and just generally freaking out. After an hour of this I started to feel ok and for the next 4 hours I lay wide awake in bed watching the lights of my laptop flash. It triggered the most insane visuals, it was just beautiful. I saw colors which didn't exist, even some reflective colors, which is weird thinking back on it. I listened to some Tool and it was the best music I have ever heard at the time, even though I'd heard the album a million times before.<br><br>
For the following 2 hours, 8 hours after first taking it, I only had closed eye visuals. I couldn't sleep and was getting a bit restless but the visuals kept me distracted.<br><br>
About 10 or 11 hours after dosing I had a 20 minute nap then I was wide awake again for the entire day. I had a 20 minute nap and stayed awake for 38 hours, I normally can't stay awake more than 20.<br><br>
It was by far the best experience of my life, except for having incredible sex with the person I love. I would gladly do it again and have some more, I'm just waiting for the right time.<!-- End Body -->
