An inadvertent and somewhat unsettling experience today...<br><br>
I work in a low temperature physics lab and most of my experiments involve the use of cryogenic fluids (ie: liquid nitrogen &amp; liquid helium).  Now, to fill my cryostat with LiqN2, I simply attach a short hose and a funnel on a stand and pour it in.  The last little bit seems to like to stay in the funnel bottom and (as impatient as I am) I decided to close the vents to the nitrogen chamber and suck on the vaccuum hose to pull the last of it through the funnel.<br><br>
I realized, of course that this meant I would be getting no oxygen for a breath or two, but I figured I can hold my breath under water for some time, so a few quick breaths should have no effect. (Keep in mind, getting screwed up was not my plan, here)<br><br>
Well, (duh) holding one's breath under water means holding a reservoir of air (and oxygen) while having a lungful of pure nitrogen means one has no oxygen at all.  So, after two quick huffs, my funnel was empty, but I all of a sudden felt a bit dizzy and noticed my lips mere starting to turn blue.   A good deep breath of air or two started to bring me back, but not before noticing the characteristic wash of 'mwow, mwow Mwow MWOW...' and other lightheaded somatic effects that I immediately associate with Nitrous Oxide!  The only thing missing was the giddyness....hmmmm<br><br>
My conclusion, especially after reading the lone report of someone experiencing 'psychedelic' effects sim]milar to nitrous from inhaling Argon gas (which is chemically inert, even more so than nitrogen and whose only function could be to displace oxygen) is that a good deal of the effects I thought were being produced by nitrous oxide were in fact symptoms of OXYGEN DEPRIVATION!  <br><br>
This is not to say that nitrous does not produce additional effects (or it would not be used by dentists as an anaesthetic) but that a suprising amount of the trip of inhaling pure nitrous (as is done recreationally) is simply the brain starving for oxygen.<br><br>
So be aware folks; nitrous is fun sometimes, but make sure billy upstairs gets his oxygen too.  Try to take a bit of air with your N2O or at very least try to hyperventilate a few times before taking the balloon.  Hyperventilating will temporarily charge your blood with a little more oxygen than normal...but not a lot, and not for long.  And don't get addicted to the stuff, it's WAY too easy!<br><br>
Peace all,<br>
