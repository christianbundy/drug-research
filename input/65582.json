 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSubject Specs\r\nHealthy teen male\r\nweight- 125 lbs\r\nheight- 5' 9'\r\nAmbien/Skullcap\r\nT-0:00- One bowl of skullcap smoked.\r\nT+0:05- Took 5mg of ambien, slight effects from skullcap noticable.\r\nT+0:10- Feeling quite wavy, but that is a normal effect from skullcap.\r\nT + 0:23 - Not really much different effects, just sort of a wavyness, felling sort of tired.\r\nT + 0:32 - Feeling very very spacey and very very tired, I got very frightened by a commercial for a scary movie. Also forgot to mention that I did a shot of straight gin about 30 minutes before the initial dosing. Considering going to sleep, school in the morning.\r\nT + 0:40 - Feel very happy, not as tired. I'm putting a movie on and laying down. Typing is somewhat of a challange.\r\nT + 1:00 -I seem to be coming down already, I'm still as tired as I was, but there is no more happyness or wavy feelings.\r\nI think that Ambien could be a wonderful drug to experiment with, but I don't think my dose was quite high enough, or maybe the skullcap or alcholol interfeared with the effects.\n\n\n"
