 "report": "<p>I have used oxycontin and other strong opiates that like before, but I have never really respected opiates as much as when I tried Fentanyl. </p><p>My night started off with chewing the 50 microgram patch and I just waited for it to kick in. I wasn't fully aware of the danger I would take when chewing the patch and getting the full dosage all at once. I started feeling really good around 5 minutes and I decided it was best if I didn't drive any longer. I tried stepping out of the car and I fell on my face, not being able to use my muscles or anything.  </p><p>The next thing I realize is that I'm in the ER with a tube down my throat and I learned that my body stopped breathing and my body was without oxygen for 3 minutes. I would not suggest trying Fentanyl unless you are smart and cautious in doing so. Fentanyl is not a drug to play around with. I</p>"
