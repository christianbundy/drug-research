This is a warning NOT to mix Tramadol/Ultram with Tri-cyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin. I was prescribed Doxepin to help me sleep, was taking normal dosage, 1 capsule/day, and took 4 Ultram/tramadol that day before work.  <br><br>
About 2 hours later, I was on a telephone conference call and started feeling jittery, then suddenly my jaw just started opening and closing and I couldn't control it, I was stuttering into my conference call.  I had to slam down the phone.  Next thing I remember, I woke up to see a complete stranger staring into my face asking if I was OK. that stranger, about a minute later, turned out to be my best friend at work. Complete  amnesia, temporarily.  There were paramedics there and I was told I had a grand-mal seizure, right there in my cubicle.  I remember nothing of it.  I went to the hospital and gradually (within an hour) remembered what medicines I had taken to do this to me.<br><br>
I will NEVER take a tri-cyclic again, and ultram maybe in very small doses.<!-- End Body -->
