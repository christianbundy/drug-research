The best that I ever felt on ecstasy was something that was not quite happiness nor euphoria, but rather a profound and perfect sense of unity of mind, body, spirit and soul; and I understood in an instant exactly what happiness and being happy involved; and at the same time I was overwhelmed by a hope that I would someday get there.<br><br>
I realised that I was looking for something that few people understand or achieve; something that I understand but haven't achieved and cannot articulate. I am searching for a state of being in which mind, body, spirit and soul are fundamentally indivisible yet each feeds the understanding of the other - a feeling that all the words in the world can only understate.<br><br>
That night I almost found it. Someday I think I might. It is not something I will find alone, but rather by a dynamic combination of factors which have to be in the right place at the right time. I don't see ecstasy as escapism but rather it helps me on my journey, shows me the direction, or perhaps it helps me to see that direction, and<br>
gives me the will to follow it.<br><br>
I personally don't believe I would have ever reached that point without the use of a psychoactive drug; which is why the 'I don't need drugs to have a good time' attitude is rather puzzling to me. I suppose the question is does it matter anyway, some people get on perfectly without either the use of drugs or reaching that state; my answer would be yes, it does matter a lot, or I wouldn't look for it, and having been made aware for the existence of such a state I don't think I will ever stop looking.<br><br>
I've been trying to understand for a long time the antipathy towards the usage of chemicals for purposes other than the purely medicinal. And failed, really.<br><br>
