This weekend R and I tried the N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine for the first time. It's always a bit exciting and a bit scary trying a new chemical for the first time. We were lucky to have G there as the sober sitter. I recommend this to anybody trying a new chemical or new method of ingestion. You don't want to become the crazy naked person running up and down the street that is picked up by the cops.<br><br>
We put the chemical in to little gel cubes, I thought that this would be the best way to insure accurate and repeatable dosage. We added 250 mg of the 5-MeO-DIPT to 200 ml of gel mixture and divided this into 64 doses of approximately 3.9 mg each. I initially took 3 cubes, which gave me approximately 12 mg of the 5meo-dipt. R took 4 cubes, for a 16 mg approximate dose.<br><br>
Initial effects were felt at around T+30 minutes. We went into the spa for the initial come up phase. The first effects felt were a bit of a stony feeling, then minor distortions to my vision. There was an increase in sensuality, touch felt sooo good. After we got out of the spa, R and G went and took a shower together. I went back to my room and laid down. I felt so alone, being there by myself. I started to experience more body load, my muscles tensed up. My heart started to beat faster, I estimate at around 105 BPM. I didn't really feel like taking my blood pressure, but I will have somebody do it next time so that I can see the correlation. I put on Nine Inch Nails - Rusty Nails II. It seemed an appropriate album, but it was very dark and it didn't help my mood at all. I was soooo relieved when R and G came back, as I had started to irrationally worry about R, him being tripping and all. Once they got back all became happy again.<br><br>
I don't recommend taking this drug alone. I really don't think it would be fun, be with your friends. I took lots of pictures and spent some very special time with R and G. This substance seemed to be very recreational and not very entheogenic at the dose level that I took. I wouldn't have a hard time interacting in a public place, concert etc. I plan to try this substance again, probably at around the 20 mg range.<!-- End Body -->
