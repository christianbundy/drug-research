Setting: My apartment<br><br>
Date/Time: Sunday March 18, 2001 5:45 pm<br><br>
Preparation: Salvia in hand rolled cigarette, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seed coats were nicked with a razor and left to soak in water for 12 to 16 hours. Seed coats were then removed with tweezers.<br><br>
5:45 pm: Ate 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.<br><br>
6:30 pm: Ate another five HBW seeds for a total of ten (10). No major effects felt yet.<br><br>
7:45 pm: Very strong sexual feelings felt.<br><br>
8:45 pm: Hand rolled approximately 60 milligrams Salvia Divinorum 5x extract into a cigarette. Have decided to smoke this while watching 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire' show on TV.<br><br>
9:30 pm: Smoking Salvia 5X extract - Words will fail to convey what took place after smoking Salvia. It can best be compared to what happens during a DXM experience (dextromethorphan). Reaching the second or third plateau of DXM is a powerful experience. Yet this shift of consciousness takes two or three hours to occur. Smoking Salvia is in many ways similar to the third stage of DXM yet a shift of consciousness takes place in only a few seconds.<br><br>
There were two distinct 'shifts' of perception. First my eyesight (of physical objects) blurred and doubled. Strange images (energy?) were visible with my eyes open. So I began to distrust my physical eyesight. It was then a good idea to sit down. <br>
While going into a light hypnologic reverie I looked down at my body. I saw two distinct layers of energy. I believe these layers to be my inner and outer auras. More noticeable was a dark blue 'rippling' pattern. Beneath that was a lighter, smoky blue energy. I could feel energy pulsate. This deep, otherworldly state lasted twenty minutes.<br><br>
It took another thirty minutes to come down from a serene transcendental state. I began to think again about my physical surroundings. Time slowed down dramatically. It seemed to be 1:30 am yet was only 11:00 pm.<br><br>
11:00 pm: Went into a deep meditative state that felt very good. I felt a strong power to be very close.<br><br>
11:30 pm: Ate two spoonfuls of nutmeg and focused on physical health.<!-- End Body -->
