After experiencing many highs off of Ritalin, I decided to write a log of my experience having a good high on this drug, and another log of having an experience with too much of this drug<br><br>
-Good Experience-<br>
8:30am, I was given one 20mg tablet of Ritalin, as prescribed for ADD. I decided to grab two more tablets, so I can enjoy a nice high. I then swallowed them.<br><br>
9:00am, I started feeling the effects, my mood is very high, since I have the whole house to myself until 3:00pm, I started to enjoy my high.<br><br>
9:05, started to feel a warm, comfortable, relaxed feeling flow through my body, sitting on the computer, I decided to listen to music and have a cigarette, the music made my mood about 3 times better than usual, I sat their with my mouth open in a trance to focus on one thing, as I puffed my cigarette, it felt purely wonderful, tasted alot better, the rush of the cigarette combined with the effects of ritalin, was heaven.<br><br>
9:30, sat talking to people in chat rooms, I felt a connection with everyone, and a sense of bonding.<br><br>
10:00, I continued to do this, my appetite was down, no desire for food at all. at there enjoying myself, let me tell you, time flies by really fast.  I decided to do homework, homework was actually fun to do, writing with a pen..it was great.<br><br>
These effects went on until about 1:00pm, after that I had mild depression, anxiety, tension,...a craving for more<br><br>
- The overdose -<br><br>
9:00am, a few days later I took 4 tablets, and a half of one, the effects came in about 9:30, for some reason I felt uncomfortable<br><br>
9:25am, I felt very uncomfortable, I felt like I was in a bad haze, felt very dumb, with a low IQ, the thoughts in my head felt a little un-real, like being half asleep..and visualizing, or saying the wrong things about a situation that doesnt exist..I felt tired, my appetite wasnt gone alot..it was very weird, and very uncomfortable, this went on for about 4 hours, after that I was calm the whole day, with anxiety, depression, and so on..<br><br>
This substance to me is very addicting, and it ruined relationships with others, I do not have the energy to give this up, so people be safe.<!-- End Body -->
