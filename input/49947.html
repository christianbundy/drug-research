Hi, I'm a young male from holland and been experimenting with drugs, mostly psychedelic and we had got our hands on some 4-aco-mipt. Sorry if my english isn't to good but I'll try.  I've had encounters with other RC like 2c-b and 2c-e but I never had a other tryptamine than 4-ho-dmt or psilocin. <br><br>
The setting: In my room, I have a hookah, pc with internet and music  of ourse, ie-bong and 2 blaklights so we would have no trouble with boring ourselfs. The dosages were about 20mg (we don't really know because an older, more experienced friend of ours eyeballed 200mg in 10 dosages and my friends did it 2 weeks before me and they didn't die or trip too hard so I thought it would be safe). 4 other friends including my girlfriend and a sitter.<br><br>
We ingested about 3/4 of the original dose so it had to be around 15mg. Just relaxing, waiting for the effects to come on rolling a spliff and listening to shpongle and sasha. After about 15 min I really started to feel and see the effects, everything was moving  and buzzing. Lots of numbers and characters in my patterns and everything is melting. Then I felt some anxiety coming up but I knew that it would vanish with the upcome and it did.<br><br>
Usually we smoke tons of mj and hash with our trips with no neg side effects but the thc had a different effect on me than usually, it seemed as if the 4-aco-mipt was getting very strong because of the thc. Thc has never had such influence on my trip as that one so I kept my thc level low.<br><br>
Full +++ now, only 1 hour and 15 min after ingestion, The room looked like it was a gel cube and we where in it and that changed to underwater vision and that changed in to animated vision (every looked like it was drawn). 4-aco-mipt made everything funny and we laughed about the most stupid things only we don't know it (like someone looks at the door and says 'wow look a door' and everybody begins to laugh, except the sitter). Then I began to have serious audio hallicunations, I heard the voices of my friends and I could hear them laugh and such. we talked for what seemed to be hours and then we wanted to go outside because outside is always different and interesting.<br><br>
By this time I couldn't explain or say something. Everytime I tried to say something that included more than 2 or 3 words I failed because I forgot what to say or just forgot to speak or just couldn't speak. Audio hallucinations getting stronger and massive time compression, only 2 hours after ingestion now. The sound of our shoes on the ground was really interesting because sometimes I got so focusd on the sound that I couldn't hear my other friends talk while I really saw their mouths move and then all of a sudden I could hear again and than picking up a word like 'wow that's really cool' and missing the whole story.<br><br>
We walked a while through the city along the calmest routes to avoid drunknuts and other people. This drug would be very interesting in nature I thought to myself and I will do 4-aco-mipt  in nature. After being outside for about 1 and 1.5 hours we decided to go to my place again and smoke. At that point the comedown had started which was very much like psilocin, it was much like I took some kind of new mushroom but that was only at the comedown. the comedown lasted for about 1 hour or so and than I fell asleep.<br><br>
I would say that I found 4-aco-mipt a commercial mushroom, everything is modified for the public, with all the accessories. It is very colorful and very euphoric but it is a strong psychedelic and should be respected, me and my friends also found that it didn't have the magic of mushroom. I'm not gonna be eyeballing again because I just want to know what and how much I'm taking so we have to buy a scale. <br><br>
Have fun exploring and don't panic<!-- End Body -->
