Methylone+Piracetam<br><br>
Set&amp;Setting:  At home at night, did 25mg of 2C-B the night before.  Feeling kind of tired but not terrible.  I really like what the MD class of psychedelics does for me.  Ive found methylone to be very lacking in the spiritual effects compared to other MD drugs as well as having a jittery effect and short duration.  I am hoping that piracetam does to methylone what Ive read of it doing to MDMA (making it deeper, smoother and longer lasting).<br><br>
Dosing:  Took 2.5-3 gram doses of piracetam at 2pm, 6pm, and 10:15pm.  Took 135mg of bk-MDMA at 11pm.<br><br>
Trip:  Started to come on half an hour after dosing (11:30).  I found this rather quick compared to previous experiences.  I spent some time posting on BL and just hanging out.  At T+1 I tried listening to music but I found music just aggravated me and was an impediment to my trip.  I was also starting to feel jittery so I figured I would sit outside, smoke a little pot to see if it would mellow out the jitter and increase the mental effects.<br><br>
I took one inhalation from my bong.  Pot often gives me anxiety and I was afraid thats what it would do.  It was starting to give me this effect but 5 minutes later the anxiety faded and I plateaued into a state of peace.  I still had some pleasant body energy so I decided to go for a walk up the road.  Along the road I met a car coming the opposite direction.  It is a very strange occurrence around here to meet a guy walking up the road dressed in black after midnight.  I felt this tension between me and the person in the car; as if there was something to fear and that being on guard was good for my safety.  I suppose this is somewhat logical as they are in a machine hurdling at me at a high speed and passing by me within 10 feet.  This was however an insight into the everyday dynamic of social fear.<br><br>
When I got back to my house I went to sit by the water for a bit.  The peacefulness of the scene was breathtaking.  The stars were out in full force, not a ripple on the water, fish were jumping, loons were calling.  My breathing was very calm and deep, incredibly anxiolytic, a profound connection to nature was felt.  This was the peak, it was incredible.<br><br>
Afterwards I smoked another bit of pot and went inside, I tried listening to music again but like before it just got in my peaceful way.  I feel that when Im having a profound trip Im most comfortable with the sound of silence and just being with my thoughts and senses.  I felt I was coming down and was a little bit anxious but nothing serious.  I started watching some Simpsons; my go-to program for psychedelic comedowns.  I Took another 2.5 gram dose of piracetam (about T+5) and 100mg of 5-HTP.  I also took one 3mg pill of melatonin, a 40mg pill of valerian extract, and a 1 ounce shot of tequila.  Fell asleep about half an hour later, woke up 7 hours after having vivid dreams and felt great.  I took more piracetam, about 2.5 grams every 6 hours and rode an afterglow all day long.  No hangover whatsoever.<br><br>
Conclusion:  Piracetam made methylone more entactogenic and MDMA-like.  It also smoothed out the side effects, extended the duration, and eliminated the hangover.  Throughout the trip there was still some jaw clenching and stimulation but nothing serious.  I usually get a hangover from methylone but there was absolutely none.  The timeline went: 1 hour to come up, 3 hour plateau, 1-2 hours of comedown, sleep. Pretty much the same timeline MDMA gives me.  I also feel piracetam made my thoughts and emotions more smooth and efficient.  Im going to continue to use piracetam on a daily basis for this purpose; it feels like a great anti-anxiety/anti-depressant.  Im also going to experiment with piracetam combinations with other psychedelics.  I feel it will probably smooth out the tension I get and help me break through to a peaceful plateau.<br><br>
I felt my methylone stash was next to useless.  Piracetam just gave it a whole new life.<!-- End Body -->
