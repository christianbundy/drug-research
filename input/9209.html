I've had a few experiences with Salvia before this one, but none quite as powerful. I met with my friend E. at his apartment, sat on his bedroom floor, and dimmed the lights.  After he had his experience, I proceeded to smoke a couple of leaves out of the hooka I brought, which I use exclusively for Salvia (I don't do pot or any other drugs anymore). <br><br>
All of a sudden, the room was covered with a fractal cell/leaf like membrane which swirled and focused  towards the space that we both occupied. It was like the universe focussed on us and was trying to communicate with me. I saw my friend, and he was a cricket, a friendly smiling hairy cricket. I wasn't frightened by the sight. It seemed quite normal. I looked at him and he looked at me with a big wonderful smile. Then I felt the Salvia entity contacting me. I've had this feeling before and I recognized the entity from past experiences. It has a definite female character to it and very loving and protecting (Although in my first couple of experiences, it was a bit frightening since she seemed to possess me, pull me off the floor and out of the room). I started to ask questions and she was answering me, but I do not remember either the questions or answers. Then I came back to reality.<br><br>
Feeling like the experience was not quite finished, I smoked some more. This time the room dissapeared and I was in black space. I saw some floating islands in this space and on the islands were children being taught by  a motherly salvia entity. Then I realized I was on one of these islands myself and the salvia entity was teaching me, answering all my questions. I was quiet this time, just listening. Then I came back...<br><br>
I was still not satisfied, there was communication but it wasn't clear. I knew there was more to be said. I smoked again and now I distinctly felt the entity taking my hand and leading me through a series of rooms. In each room I was incarnated into a different person in a different situation. They were all me, but I hadn't recognized myself. I was a college student in a dorm while somebody was knocking at my door. I was a child. I was an old man. I was an old lady. I was a young girl. It was like reality had many levels which run simultaneously and I inhabited all of them simultaneously, but was not aware of it untill this moment, and neither were my incarnations.<br><br>
After the salvia dissipated I felt a tremendous sense of happiness and well being. It was the most comfortable I had felt with salvia so far. I could trust it now and it would show me wondrous things.<!-- End Body -->
