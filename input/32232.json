 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy friends are quite taken to nitrous. It isn't a drug of much dignity, but who cares. On inhaling 7 balloons worth of gas, I grew light headed and numb. My head felt very strange but nice. On trying nitrous now, like times before, I didn't laugh. Although I felt happy afterward. I did not laugh like my friends were on the floor in complete hysterics.\r\nI find it strange (and a bit disappointing) that the gas didn't effect me in this way. Another interesting effect was that it brought back tracers. After trying acid I had experienced really strong tracers, and these diminished after the trip but still haven't gone a week and a half later. I'm not worried for it isn't a bad effect. Any drugs I take seem to stoke up the tracers however (especially shrooms, salvia as well as nitrous).\n\n\n"
