Well, I was cleaning my medicine cabinent and found a full bottle of Hydrocodone.  I decided to expiriment with the drug.  After reading reports of addiction I figured that I would not use this drug two days in a row.<br><br>
I took two pills orally about 1 hour before I left for pizza with friends.  After about 10 minutes on an empty stomach I could feel a beggining of euphoria, unlike marijuana or any other drug I have tried.  It was a very very nice day out, so I sat outside on my porch for about 30 minutes playing guitar.  All of my senses were enhanced, except for feeling which was number.  I felt slightly warm, and comforted.  <br><br>
I then decided that the weather was so nice that I would go for a quick bike ride, on this bike ride I noticed colors seemed to have a feeling.  Like, the grass seemed to give off happy waves of energy which gave me a very uplifting mindset.  When my friend came and picked me up, I found it very easy to communicate and talk to him, no one knew I was high.  I felt an extreme sense of well-being, very secure and confident in what I was doing.<br><br>
Noise seemed to connect with my surrondings.  We were listening to a light-alternative band, I don't know what it was but it seemed to set the mood for the lighting and the actions that were taking place.  It was almost like I was in a dream, where I had complete control.  I felt this way for maybe 40 minutes.  I then started to come down, and felt very very warm.  By this time a few hours had gone by since I had taken the pills, I did not feel tired but rather very comfortable.  My friends were looking for something to do, I however was perfectly content with sitting around a table just talking.  I felt as though I was wrapped in a warm blanket, and I finally went home and drifted of to sleep.<!-- End Body -->
