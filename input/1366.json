 "report": "\n\n\n[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.  We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]\r\nI have always wanted to do drugs. There was never a time when I actually believed that all drugs are bad. I also refused to seek them out. When they came to me, fine. Problem is I'm also a bit impatient...\r\nI was about 13, maybe 14. I was watching The Basketball Diaries. This was before I had smoked weed, gotten drunk, let alone any actual drugs. In the beginning of the movie they soak rags in something (I can't remember what now) and sniff. Despite them getting sick in the movie I began to search my room for something to sniff. I happened across some nail polish remover.\r\nI soaked some tissues and held it up to my nose, and I breathed in. I did this a couple of times and I got all spacy like. My fingers and toes began to tingle, this is common when people don't have enough oxygen. I got a little giddy (though I can get just as giddy hanging out with my friends, sober). My head felt light-headed. The movie was still playing but it was hard to see colors. I felt like I was moving very slowly.\r\nThis became a regular pattern for me. I started sniffing nail polish remover every night. It made it much easier to go to sleep, as I would just sniff until I passed out. After a while my mother began to question why my room always smelled like a beauty parlor. She was only going to believe I had spilled the bottle for so long. Eventually I had to move on.\r\nThe only time I will sniff now is if I'm rolling, and then just about anything feels good anyway. Sniffing is kinda dumb. Basically you're just drowning yourself. It can give you monster headaches and make you smell really bad. If you want something legal that will get you high take NoDoze or something. Most people that I know who sniff are young. It's basically something you do until you can get your hands on something else. My advice, just wait for that something else.\n\n\n"
