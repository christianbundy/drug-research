 "report": "<p>For me st. john's wort is comparable to 20 mg prozac twice a day.  I take it as recommended by the manufacturer and have tremendous results.  I was on prozac for a few years for depression, then I stopped taking it because I thought I did not need it.  Then I met my wife who introduced me to the wort and it makes me feel as if I am on prozac and it's completely all natural.</p>"
