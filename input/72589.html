A slower entry than anticipated (first effects after some 40 minutes on a fairly empty stomach). Did 20 minutes Ashtanga yoga followed by mantra, very gradual ascent until Im actually in the space. Minor body load, some abdominal full/emptyness but no nausea. Did lots of dancing using Roths The Wave  very nice can see how this material would work in clubland. Sense of the body enhanced, yes certainly an erotogenic!<br><br>
Outside some 2 hours in, perhaps a peak? Sitting in the hidden 'group ups' terrace of my garden, there is a light rain and the last light of the sun is still around. I can see all the little Deva spirits in the trees, and greet them. They smile back, elfish but in no way scary. Enjoying the rain, though Im sheltered beneath a small umbrella. After a while I decide that I should be at one with the rain, take down my brolly and it stops. There is a revelation (?!) here;<br><br>
The rain is a blessing, though on our damp little islands it's easy to forget. But the rain is a blessing.<br><br>
Sure its nice to have an umbrella, but if you take it down, you some times find the shower has already passed.<br><br>
Deep!<br><br>
Did some Horns of Baphomet yoga, very nice. This material feels like the sister to the Toad venom (5-Meo-DMT), slower but the same deep, earthy content. Very minor visual changes with either open or closed eyes. It's my body that is tripping more than my mind.<br><br>
Back in the house, send a few emails to friends, did some VIII magick (autoerotic tantra), very strong climax. Not much of the speedyness of acid, which is nice, and after a few more waves at t+4  hours after drop time Im coming down, but this is a very gentle descend. Nice.<br><br>
Overall highly recommended. Would blend well with bodywork, sex, massage etc. I can see this being a material to explore in a range of sensual conditions. The nice side of Pan.<!-- End Body -->
