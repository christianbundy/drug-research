I have succesfully aquired 200 milligrams of 5-meo-dmt for the first time in my life. Naturally I was excited! I'm waiting to get a vaporizer but I didnt have one yet - still I was way too excited to try it for first time to let this stop me.<br><br>
Measuring the dose:<br><br>
NOTE! This is by no means recommended way of measuring 5-meo-dmt.<br><br>
I first opened one 100mg gelatine capsule and made a line from the powder... Divided it into two seemingly same sized lines and continued to split lines in two until I had three ~25mg lines and two ~12,5mg lines.<br><br>
Experiment 1:<br><br>
I first tried it by snorting. I split one of the ~12,5mg lines into two ~6mg lines and snorted one - couple minutes later I felt nothing (it didnt eaven sting) and snorted the other ~6mg line. A sting in the nose, unpleasant but not unbearable was noticed. A tryptamine feeling started to slowly build up but with it came some slight restlesness. It was a bit like beeing on low dose of LSD, so low that I could talk with any problems with any sober person that I can normally talk with. Sensory input was also greatly enhanced. When I felt the effects starting to decrease I smoked a really small amount of peganum harmala and went outside for a walk - the outside world looked psychedelically beautyful and sharp. The whole experience lasted maybe for an hour.<br><br>
Experiment 2:<br><br>
I tried smoking the stuff. I put ~12,5mg's on tinfoil, heated it from under and found out that it vaporizes way faster that I had expected. Large part of the smoke was lost but I succeeded to inhale enough material for first experience - I wouldnt have wanted it to be stronger than what I was about to experience.<br><br>
The 'humming' in my head started in couple seconds and grew stronger at intense rate. Visual distortions started happening on my walls, posters jumping a bit and moving patterns - more intense (but not as beautyful) than those I've had with 2c-t-7. Intense rush of good feeling kept growing but there was also a growing fear and restlesness exactly at the same time. I didn't really know whetever I wanted it to continue or end and I had to remind myself that this is a very short lasting drug. The peak had been reached maybe in a minute or two and a rapid comedown started from that.<br><br>
Most effects wore off but an 'afterglow' was left. I went to my computer and started to write about my experience on irc. First I couldn't really say if the experience had been positive or negative but soon a much happyer tryptamine state of mind took control and I found the experience even with it's negative feelings having beeing overally a very positive experience. Much later I came to conclusion that the feeling I had was a glimpse of what it feels to experience heaven and hell at the very same time.<br><br>
Unfortunately this experience, although it was very intense and interesting had no profound mind-expanding effects on me.<br><br>
Experiment 3 &amp; 4:<br><br>
The second time I was more prepared to inhale all the smoke right away but choosed to take only ~6mg's. I succeeded in inhaling but the effects were much milder than the first time. Again there was also unpleasant side to the experience but mostly I was grinning, staring my walls and acting like I was feeling really good both physically and psychically. Again the afterglow remained for some time (5-20 minutes?) after the actual experience - a mild tryptamine like, energic, talkative and happy state of mind.<br><br>
The fourth time I smoked ~6mg's and it felt in my lungs like it had been the biggest hit so far - but the effects were even milder than the third time. Negative effects were almost gone but I had some nausea while coming down - positive effects were greatly diminished when compared to first couple tries.<br><br>
Conclusion:<br><br>
This substance is interesting and more 'studying' is needed - unfortunately with the doses (hard to say how large they really were because of the way I measured the doses and because at least small amunts of vapor escaped every time [I really wait to try this with a SmokeBubble vaporizator]) didnt bring on any profound ideas, lessons or changes in the way I look at the world and my life.<br><br>
I still have 100mg's on a capsule and over 75mg's on the drawer waiting for the weekend ;)<!-- End Body -->
