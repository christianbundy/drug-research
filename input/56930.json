 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nOkay so it was a day like any other, I went to school with a smile on my face know that the next day was my birthday. I went to my second hour class in the locker room. my friends decided to skip class, and hide out in the locker room. <br>'Ok whatever' I thought to myself<br>I get back from doing tae-bo to see them laughing ...right where I left them. They came over and were like<br>'whoa dude we are sooo fucked up right now! we took like 12 of these'<br>and she pulls out a bottle of 25mg little pink pills, benedryl, of course it wasnt surprising.<br>How many did you take? I said<br>Her being my weight made me think of how many I should take<br>12'  she said<br>Than hand the bottle over I said laughing I borrowed her water bottle and downed the little suckers 2 by 2 every one else was looking at me...but I didnt really pay much attention to it<br>So I start heading to class and about 2 minutes after taking them my eyes started to feel a little slow...it had already started taking effect, which wasnt surprising considering I had only had a bowl of cereal that morning, and my fast metabolism didnt help either.  So I get to my 3rd hour and finally I start to feel the effects.  About half an hour later I had felt like I was on a vicodin high, and I wasnt thinking too much about it then, but If I had realized that I felt like I was on a vicodin peak only half an hour in, than I was in deep shit. <br>I finally got a bathroom pass and found myself getting tripped by things that werent even there.  I came in there to find my friend who had taken the pills with me just as fucked up as me <br>Fuck dude im soo dizzy...I gotta throw these up she said heading into an open stall and she stuck her fingers down her throat...nothing came up though<br>And a girl walked in while she was trying to make herself throw up....us being extremely skinny as It is DID NOT look good.<br>I decided to keep mine in my stomach as I headed out and went back to class.  As the bell rang we had an assembly, I decided not to go, And I just sat with my other 2 tripping out friends and just sat there...completely spaced out, I had the worst cotton mouth of my life...It got WAY worse<br>I went to detention because I was late for 4th hour and sat in a room with 3 other people and I completely hit my high...or so I thought... I looked at my hands from about 1ft away from my face, if I moved my hand any closer my vision was blurred....BADLY blurred, so that meant I couldnt read or write anything.  My arms felt like weights had been strapped onto them and I could barely lift them, bending over to get something out of my backpack almost made me pass out.  <br>I went to lunch and It got way worse my speech was slurring, my body felt 200lbs heavier I could barely walk, I couldnt even hear when the bell rang.  Which was when it got THE WORST.<br>Me and my completely fucked up friend went into 5th hour just hoping for some worksheet assignment that we could just bullshit.  No such luck.  We had a journal entry that was due that day, I couldnt see to save my life, and writing was almost as bad, considering I couldnt see the pencil that was 6 inches in front of me.  The words on the paper she gave us were growing rainbows out of them, I saw people sitting in seats that werent there, people were turning into sculptures and rocks, and desks were turning into trash cans and bananas...It was bad.  <br>And it got the worst when people around me were looking at me and talking about me, because apparently someone had blabbed about us taking pills, and in a matter of minutes everyone in the school knew about it.  It was all just a mess of:<br>She only does it for the attention<br>I cant believe you would be stupid enough to do that<br>She took 25mg?  Are you sure?  Man shes fucked<br>Ect...and then my teacher asked me how I was doing and I said I couldnt see the words on my paper and I forgot my contacts so I would do it when I got them<br>But apparently it came out like I cant find the words....Ill just write about the paranoia in the crucible which made no sense at all, im surprised she didnt send me to the office then.  But she just let me go...<br>The day ended with me being still fucked up for the next day or so, the other girl ended up throwing up outside her class room, which was stupid because I told her not to eat anything.  All in all, the worst high of my life...not fun at all...dont do it kids...\n\n\n"
