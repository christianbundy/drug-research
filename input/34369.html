After a long night of raving and ecstacy use, my friend K and I borrowed a car from another friend of ours, S who felt sick and went home with another friend of ours. We ended up meeting some people there and went to an afterparty. While there, I tried to catch some sleep with little success, as the pills we took undoubtably contained large quantities of caffine.<br><br>
That morning when I awoke, K came up to me and said that someone had given him this drug that was like acid but less intense (heh). I talked to the person who gave it to him, and he briefly explained what it was, and what it was called (2C-T-7), still not thinking clearly I decided to take some of it.<br><br>
A good amount powder was wrapped in a little piece of paper towel, and I swallowed it down with some orange juice. After about 20 min of feeling no effects, I took a shower to wash off the nastiness from the rave the night before. When I got out of the shower, I felt different but was not hallucinating. It wasnt until about an hour and a half after consumtion that I started to feel the full effects.<br><br>
At first I noticed slight hallucinations, trails, patterns in the wallpaper moving, and ripples in the carpet. This was followed by a wave of nausia, which sent me to the bathroom 3 times to empty the contents of my stomach, which after the rave was just water and OJ. By the 3rd bathroom trip the visuals became very intense; light took on different colors, physical objects took on geometric patterns that seemed to move, and everything would turn a grey color in waves, which was especially creepy when I looked at my skin, because it looked like a corpse. Sounds became amplified, and I could constantly hear echos fading in and out, sort of like a hellicopter noise being echoed through a hallway. Eventually I had to leave the room where people, both tripping and not tripping, where conversing because I couldn't understand what they were saying.<br><br>
I wandered off in the big unfamiliar house we were in and found a quiet spot on a couch. Occasionally people would walk in and try to talk to me, and I had to use every ounce of brainpower to answer them. Mostly I just was staring at a book 'Clyde Butcher - Nature's Places of Santuary,' its possibly the only thing I remember clearly from this point on. I thought if I just sit here undisturbed, clearing my mind in a relaxed meditative state, I could ride it out. Unfortunatly I was not afforded that luxury.<br><br>
As time passed on, the visuals and sounds grew even more intense. I could begin to hear the voices of people I knew, even though they wernt there. At some point, the other two people who were tripping came into the room and tried to talk to me, I dont remember what they were saying, or what I said back to them, only that the owners of the house wanted us to leave. I dont remember how I got there, but somehow I was all of the sudden in the car.<br><br>
At this point everything seemed to be a nightmare to me, one from which I could not wake up. Reality seemed distorted, and seemed I was in some sort of time loop that kept repeating itself as we drove along, I thought anything I did had no consequence because the loop would repeat itself again. I became violent, I punched the windshield, sending cracks out all along it. I was spitting everywhere, throwing things, I ripped the rear view mirror off of the windshield, honked the horn, and made rude gestures at people we passed in other cars. I began grabbing things and throwing them out the window of the car as we drove down the highway; my glasses, trash, S's jacket, a cushion, anything I could get ahold of. I tried to grab the wheel of the car to make us crash and was yelling things like 'Run into the center divide! Kill us all! I want to die!'<br><br>
We pulled over on the highway and everyone in the car grabbed me out of the front seat and put me in the back seat, and restained me. From this point on, my violence subsided, but my nightmare did not. I had all kinds of fucked up thoughts running through my head, I thought I was god, I thought we all were gods, I though everyone knew something that I did not, I thought everyone in the car was gay and had kidnapped me to be a sex slave, I thought the human race would ceice to exist becuase of our decidance and materialism, I thought an airplane was going to crash into our car, and all kinds of shit like that. I was completely disconnected from reality, and at some point I passed out. <br><br>
When I woke up, I was sober, and had a headache. I found myself in the car with K and S who had met up with us at some point. I was confused as to how I got there, and had to ask my K what happened, and where my glasses went. Then I looked around and thought 'oh shit it wasnt a dream!' I felt completely awful and apologized to S for the damage I did to her windshield and for her jacket, both of which I am replacing. Mostly I am just thankful I didnt hurt or kill anyone or myself.<br><br>
I do not recommend that anyone do this drug, and if you are going to do it, make sure you do it in a familiar peaceful setting and you actually know what dosage you are taking. I did not.  I for one will never do this drug or any other psychedelics again!<!-- End Body -->
