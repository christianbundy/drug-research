 "report": "<p>I've bought this in supplement form for my mother who was going through menopause. I was a bit interested in its sedative properties, because I occasionally have transient insomnia.</p><p>So I popped one pill, and awaited its effects. The effects came on relatively quickly. I felt slightly sedated, so I plopped on my bed for a nap. </p><p>I looked at the ceiling and the walls seem to be moving slightly, and it looked like my rods and cones were more visible than usual. Just minor benadryl-like hallucinations. </p><p>It reminded me of kava kava herb which is a sedative and mild psychadelic.</p>"
