I've done AMT numerous times now in the 50-80mg range and found it to be somewhat like a mellow candyflip with a much clearer range of thought and slight visuals.  And have only experienced slight nausea at higher doses.  This particular Saturday night, we were looking for something a bit more intense.  I got off work at around 10pm and my friend D, met me at my house.  At 10:30pm we ingested 60mg in carefully weighed gelcaps.  <br><br>
Around 30-35 minutes after ingestion I began feeling a light body roll, at this point we ingested another 60mg gelcap each.  Within an hour, my stomach was bothering me quite a bit and we made a journey outside and sat in lawn chairs, in case we had to purge, we could just do it outside and be done with it.  D vomited and reported feeling quite a bit better, I stuck it out until my nausea was all but gone.  At this point conversation was flowing and easy, the visuals I was getting were comparable to 5-6 hits of decent acid, but little or no nervousness and absolutely no panic feeling, like I might experience on that amount of acid.  At approximately 2 hours after the ingestion of our first gelcap we went back inside and opened one more cap and split it up into 30mg each and took orally.  As we were watching TV, it looked like the people in the movie we were watching were made of some kind of silly putty, and they all had clear cut 3D like seams on the lines of their faces, all the points on all things I was looking at looked quite a bit sharper and totally unreal.  Within 20 minutes of taking the last 30mg, I vomitted quite heavily for a few minutes, but felt quite a bit better when I was done.<br><br>
Out comes the Salvia...<br>
D and I have both done Salvia multiple times before and Salvinorin A enhanced leaves, which is what we had this night.<br><br>
Now...Salvia is somewhat of a...'pushy' drug.  In our particular group of friends, D and I are the only ones who enjoy the harsh Salvia experience.  The only way I can think to compare Salvia to anything else is like this, all these other drugs that people do are kind of like your friends that you party with and whatnot...but Salvia is the dude who kicks down the door looking for his money.<br><br>
It's about 3am now and I'm having the most visual trip that I've ever had.  We load a bowl with 25mg of carefully weighed Salvinorin A enhanced leaves.  I offer it to D and he laughs, stating 'it's all yours, dude...'  I smile, somewhat nervous.  I hold the pipe for a minute or 2, attempting to mentally prepare myself, and I tell D to get ready to take the pipe from my hand when I'm done, then I mumble, 'here goes nothing...'<br><br>
I bring the pipe to my lips, light it and take a big toke, I feel things changing almost immediately and I quickly take another big hit, before feeling the pipe taken from my hand.  I forget about everything, I forget about where I am, I feel every bone and joint in my body wanting me to get up and tear through my home to find a way out, this isn't the way Salvia normally feels, it's never this strong, I think something is wrong, I feel panic set in as the sweat pours down my face.  I open my eyes and see a light grid colored like fire, I close them again and see brown and dark green blobs swirling too fast for my eyes to keep up, I feel like I'm turning upside down over and over again.  I look at D through the intense grid and say, 'just relax dude..it's ok, wait till I'm done, just wait a second'  and from somewhere far away I hear him laugh and say, 'I havent moved at all' and that echos a thousand times over.  I finally feel myself coming down somewhat and I'm able to comprehend what is happening.  The AMT visuals have increased 5-6 fold, Everything is swirling and moving.  I look at D and mumble, 'your turn.'<br><br>
He loads his dose and tokes, I take the pipe and watch him sit back with his eyes closed.  His eyes open, with a scared look on his face as he madly looks over my room, then at me, as if asking me for help.  'it'll be over in a minute', I assure him.  He says nothing, then closes his eyes, covering his face with his hands.  After he comes down enough to talk reasonably again, he says, '...what the hell was that all about?'<br><br>
The Salvia coming down/after affects lasted much longer than usual, around 1h - 1.5h.  We sat around having an easy and flowing conversation about things for hours, until he left around 10am.  I was still feeling the AMT until around 7-8pm that night around 20 hours after ingestion of the first capsule, I slept around 15-16 hours.  <br><br>
AMT lasts quite a long time, I would suggest taking it in the morning if at all possible and mix it with Salvia only if one has quite a bit of experience with both Salvia and AMT, or else there's a good chance that one can have an overly-intense experience.<!-- End Body -->
