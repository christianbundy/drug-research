Well, i opened the bag containing the stuff then ,eyed ball it in a capsule that i ate at 13:00<br><br>
At t+2 i noticed visuals on my comp<br><br>
At t+4 i couldnt stay anywhere so i decided so go to bed, and what i can say is that stomach discumfurt is so bad that it becomes hell. <br><br>
One intersting point about that stuff is when looking oneself face into a mirror, i was able to control the visual about my own face, focusing into my right eye.<br>
This Worked instantly and i could look like what i was feeling, sometimes dark visuals (like becoming some kind of dark monster) sometimes a beautiful boy.<br><br>
Well hard to explain, but it seemed my own spirit was sending orders through my right pupil, then receiving it and computing it into appropriate visuals ...<br>
Kinda funny no ???<br><br>
After that my brain was really tired but the effect did not go away and i really wanted it to go out of my body.<br><br>
I felt like this substance was in every cells of my body, like some kind of intoxication (not very pleasant to me).<br><br>
At t+9 it became to go out, i went to sleep after having taken 1500 mg of aspirin and at 3:00 AM a big stomach cramp woke me up: waaaah please stop that!!! I wanna sleep !!!!<br><br>
2CE said me bye bye and then i slept normally.<br><br>
Finally, this stuff is no fun, and it hurts to much to have a good trip.<br><br>
But what one can discover can be interesting, well, anyway the stuff went into toilets because i dont want to spoil a Saturday anymore like that.<!-- End Body -->
