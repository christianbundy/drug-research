I was at an electronic music festival. My friend woke me up earlier that morning, told me to pop a pill cause they were playing some really good music at the main stage. I popped and headed to dance. After a set or two, the music was cut as everybody was advised to go to the chill out area where a yoga session was about to be given.<br><br>
I changed to more fitting clothes, had a few puffs and when to the chill out area. I had dome some yoga before but never got to fully engage in it. <br><br>
As the session began, I started to peak. And with every breathe, posture and position, I felt my body relaxing in to a complete trance-like state. I probably won't be able to describe it but I have never had a clearer understanding of my body and my environment. The positions and stretches made sense and just felt so right. I reached the height of my peak when the instructor struck the sound bowl. A sense of overwhelming positive vibrations, alignment and so much more. <br><br>
After that, I realized how hard I was on myself, struggling for perfection when the truth was very simple. Love and light.<!-- End Body -->
