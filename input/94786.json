 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was feeling anxious. I was anticipating an experience. Just not sure which type.<br>I heated the three seeds in a pan until they 'popped' and then de-husked them. I ground up three seeds and loaded just over half of it into a water pipe with a little bit of cannabis.<br>Immediately I felt a headache feeling...and then a pressure that led to nausea. Then the a very familiar body feeling not unlike DMT.<br>No closed eye visuals. Just nausea and that familiar body feeling.<br>In summary, for 84kgs body weight, 2 seeds was probably not enough. Will try 3 in future and report here. Will also try combining with Syrian rue seeds, and also via snuff.\n\n\n"
