I have read many trip reports on here that talk about amazing trips that people have taken on doses of 500-750 milligrams. That much is NOTHING to me! Not that I don't get really messed up, I just like a fully dissasociative dose!<br><br>
BEFORE TRIP: I never eat anyting for at least 5 hours before my trip. I wait until I'm not jumping up and down hyper, but not falling alseep either, around 4 or 5pm.<br><br>
START: I usually take 1-1.2 grams at the start. I wait for about an hour for stomach pains or vomiting to stop. I then sometimes took another .5-.7 grams.<br><br>
MID-TRIP: I feel my body slowly dissapear into the bed. I become the bed. Being an inanimate object, I feel so comfortable in my place as though I couldn't move or breathe. I feel my body twist and turn through infinate space and time. I fall through the bed, going through the foor, and into oblivion. People occasionally stop by, match a bowl of bud, and check up on me. I try really hard to communicate, but my words are slurred and robotic. I hear voices all around besides the friends in the room. As I try to stand to see them out, I find I cannot stand at all. I am too heavy. I fall back into my world.<br><br>
END: After about 5 hours of this, I begin to gain a connection with the world again. I turn on the TV to end the trip. I smoke a bowl or two to calm down and bring the DXM up a bit. I am unable to sleep for about 4 hours after that.<br><br>
Many people claim to trip DXM a lot and are experienced, but try that dose every 4 days for... well, going on months now. The Dark Dragon will soon rise to be recognized. I am the TRIP GOD!!!<!-- End Body -->
