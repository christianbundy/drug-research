I recently switched my breakthrough pain meds from Percocet 5mg(5 a day) to Statex (Morphine Sulphate) 5 mg., 5 a day. I use the Ratio-Pharm generic Fentanyl patch (100mcg/h) as my main pain med. I find that the Ratio patches stick better. Anyways, everyone has heard of Morphine - it's the gold-standard opiate that to me I beleived was saved for the terminally ill. So I was cautious about starting the morphine, and although I have received it IV in the hospital, I didn't know what to expect taking it orally and regularly.<br><br>
At first dosing, I took my 25mg as directed and I felt nothing! This started a 24-hour panic (and pain) attack. I awoke the next morning after a horrible night, took 5 5mg Morphine pills (as directed) along with 20mg of Valium (also as directed). This I felt. I started the familiar 'nod', falling in and out of consciousness. Compared to Percocet, I found it much less cloudy - cleaner. Light was clear, everything in the room became more colourful, and although I was 'on the nod', I could snap out of it in an instant! My breakthrough pain finally went away, and I was left comfortably on my couch listening to Baroque Counterpoint music - very mathematical but extremely expressive - and I was in no pain, emotionally stable, and generally in a very nice physical, emotional, and mental state.<br><br>
What really got me were the 'Morphine Dreams' I was experiencing! I've heard all about them in novels and on TV - Sherlock Holmes (I think he preferred cocaine...), the other detective character who could see Jack the Ripper in his Opiate dreams, and many more. It wasn't until I experienced it myself!!! WOW!!!! It was as though I could lie down comfortably, close my eyes, and re-create my own environment, or World! (i.e. living room). I could move around this 'internal reality' like it was an ordinary day, read things, have phone conversations, surf the web! -- it was so real!! My Morphine Dreams are sooooooo lucid it can be difficult to distinguish from reality. <br><br>
My body was completely relaxed, similar to smoking some high quality Hashish, and again my mind was so clear and sharp, not dulled like I used to feel when I took Oxycodone(Percocet). <br><br>
For my breakthrough pain, I'm glad I made the switch, as Percocet would make me tired and groggy, and forgetful. Morphine has wonderful body relaxation properties, as well as visual and mental clarity. It takes a little longer to kick-in (these aren't continual release), but the pain control is adequate, and my ability to function as well as my quality of life has increased since the switch. And the side-effects like noding and dreaming have diminished as my body has gotten used to the drug. (good in the long-term, but not as fun anynore).<br><br>
To summarize, in my experiences with pain management medications, Morphine has one of the 'cleanest' euphorias. It isn't as effective for pain as Fentanyl, however I have not really felt any euphoria from Fentanyl before - it's probably the best for pain (fentanyl), but for Euphoria I would rate Demerol #1, Morphine #2, Oxycodone #3, Dilaudid #4, and Codeine #4. These are all the Opiates I've tried. #'s 1,2, and 4 I've received IV and IM, the rest (including Morphine and Dilaudud as well) I took by mouth. I also tried liquid Dilaudid, but felt nothing. I think you need to 'wake-up' your receptors before the drugs work as they should - I think that's why I didn't feel much the first time I took the Morphine pills. I remember too in high-school, when I smoked my first joint, inhaling, I didn't get high, where my best friend was stoned as a rock! The second time I smoked, I was definitely stoned!<br><br>
So, Morphine lives up to its' namesake 'Morpheus', the Roman God of Dreams.<!-- End Body -->
