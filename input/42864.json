 "report": "<p>I was surprised by a Laboratory urine screen in the situation I was in; I Had just used opiates about 8 hours before the test.</p><p>I figured it would defiantly be positive. But I Drank a bunch of water (nearly a gallon) ASAP and urinated twice before testing I also made sure I used a sample from the middle of the urination. I dont know for sure if that helps at all but I had heard that, and needed all the help I could get so I did it. </p><p>The test was sent in and came back negative in about a week of the test date.</p>"
