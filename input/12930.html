I'm not sure if having a morphine experience in a dentists office counts but I'm sure this was a good one.<br><br>
It was a while ago and i had to get my wisdom teeth removed. Wanting to be doped up as much as possible (I told my doctor this) I got ready for the surgery. I asked what they would be using to dope me up before they put me to sleep they asked what i would like. They gave me a list of drugs and I chose the morphine. As soon as I said it the nurse came out with a bag of a clear liquid and injected it into me. Almost instantly I was thrown into another world. It was as if my head had tilted back and I was in another dimension. <br><br>
In the distance I heard the doctor tell me to go into my happy place. And that I did. It was a lush open field of the finest marijuana one can imagine. Blocks of hash sitting on a table waiting to be eaten or smoked. A bottle of jagermeister in my hand and countless women surrounding me. I was in my happy place. Not just imagining it...I was in it. All the bad things I had heard about getting morphine were eliminated. I cant recall it completely but I was then put to sleep but I remained in my happy place. When I awoke it was a feeling of drunkness. Extreme drunkness. I am not an abuser of any narcotics but whenever I need surgery i ask for morphine. I also do not condone the use of heroin or any other injected drug for I think they are worse but it seems morphine is not the worst on that list.<!-- End Body -->
