I had an interesting experience with DXM a few weeks ago.<br><br>
To give a little background; I'v done pretty extensive eperimentation with psychedelics over the past four years.  I've tried just about all that's out there drug-wise, but the psychedelics were always my drug of choice... I felt that they gave me insight into the world around me and into myself.  Unfortunately I experienced a couple of bad trips on LSD which really shook me and made me very aprehensive about taking my experimentation any further.  I have taken LSD, mushrooms, and ecstasy since the incidents, but very less often and in smaller quantities than before.  So on to my story...<br><br>
I've heard a lot about DXM, as a member of the rave community most information I received was negative.  Nearly a year ago I purchased some pills which I assumed to be ecstasy, but which turned out, to my dismay, to be DXM.  I kept them, all three, I'm not sure why.  So a few weeks ago I guess I had a breakdown of sorts.  <br><br>
I'd started the night drinking a few beers with friends.  When I came home after the bar closed I decided to take some valium.  Unfortunately, because of my drunken state I took several... things become blurry at this point.  Somwhere over the course of the evening I found the DXM I had stashed in my drawer and took all of it.  I was embarking on quite a binge.  The experience after this was quite remarkable.  The rest of the night is severely fragmented... at some point I fell asleep.  When I awoke early the next morning I was the star player in the most intense and bewildering trip I've ever experienced.  If not for the excessive amount of sedative in my body I'm sure I would have completely lost it.  I felt as though I were thouroughly drunk, walking was near impossible.  The visuals I was experiencing were very fluid; everything seemed to be melting in and out of itself.  Also, every now and then it seemed that I was looking at the world in freeze frame!  It was as though I was trapped in a surrealist painting (think Salvador Dali) and I was skating around on jello.  The most peculiar part of the experience was that I thought it was utterly hysterical!  A friend stopped by and was alarmed at my condition.  She was so concerned about my well being, but all I could do was laugh at her.  My depth perception was so distorted that I couldn't pick up my cigarette after setting it in the ashtray... not for the life of me!  My friend thought that I had completely lost it.  But, after a good nights sleep I was fine and left with some very interesting memories.<br><br>
I'm not sure how interesting this will be to all of you... I guess I'll just say DXM is VERY intense and disorienting as well as potentially dangerous.  In fact, considering the amounts of drugs I consumed, I am pretty lucky to be okay after my experience.  I just urge people to be carefull with this one....<!-- End Body -->
