I took my 25 mg of 2ct7 orally at about 9 in the evening. I spent about 2 hours noting the slow climb of the drug - Then it hit me.<br><br>
A wave of nausea that resulted in emptying my system completely.<br><br>
Within moments, though, my mind was spiralling upwards integrating a vast array of ancient superstition, modern science and the timelessness of the explorers spirit into a spiritual kaleidescope of self discovery. <br><br>
Having been (in my own mind anyway) experienced with psychedelics (LSD, Mushrooms, Mescaline - most for a period of ten years or more) I thought I was prepared for whatever psychedelic experience 2ct7 had to offer. I was, to put it mildly, completely off the mark.<br><br>
The clouds outside seemed to tear through the night in a violent rush - while at the same time flowing quite tranquily and peacefully by - A true lesson in duality.<br><br>
Visually I could ask for no greater psychedelic. Things seem to glow with an inner light that I've never so much witnessed as experienced once removed in Huxley's Doors of Perception. I had to make the point out loud that all reality had only a 'fuzzy' core and that it was the interpreter of that reality who laid a template over it to draw the core in to focus. <br><br>
This fuzzy quality could be the beginnigs of some cartoonism as I have experienced off mescaline. (Perhaps at a higher dose)<br><br>
I've yet to detect any true auditory hallucinations, although sounds seemed to be definitely altered. The sound of my glass sliding on the table - while in reality a very subtle noise to be sure, merged together with a television commercial featuring a closing arm at a train crossing to fill the room with a train-rushing sound (the t.v. sound was off).<br><br>
Spiritually I would call it a rush. Physically it's jittery and full of energy. The urge to be in the world - interacting in this highly altered state - is almost irresistable. <br><br>
Surely I could compose myself to talk to police and explain myself away as mildly drunk. But the nature of the drug is to compound your stimuli. A room with 5 people for example seems to carry the weight of a room with a party of 15. Certainly a club could easily become an ocean of conflicting torrents and drives. <br><br>
This drug seems to draw me in to an odd perspective of seeing how my past has helped to structure my future - hence the spiriual 'blending' of ideas I referenced earlier. (i.e. the superstition of a childhood spent in fascination with the occult becomes a lifelong interest in psychedelia, etc.)<br><br>
In short - I would have to call 2ct7, in a word, definitive.<br><br>
