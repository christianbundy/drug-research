Background: Have tried countless amphetamines, phenethylamines and tryptamines over the decades although seldom at incapacitating doses<br><br>
Experience: A bunch of us were going to a masquerade psytrance party for Halloween. Zen Mechanics and Perfect Stranger were the headlines. <br><br>
8:30: At a friend's pre-party I dropped 100 mgs of MDMA and a 400 microgram 25C-NBOMe blotter was put under tongue until it disintegrated. <br><br>
10:30: On the way to the main party the 25C-NBOMe is starting to kick in which made a beer store stop seem a little surreal.<br><br>
10:45: At the main party I drop another 100mgs MDMA and a second 400 microgram blotter and quaff a couple beer. On the dance floor everything is effortless.<br><br>
11:30: Feeling the full effects now, dancing is great, good interaction with others on the the dance floor. Our group is right up front. There is some colour enhancement and visual distortion (warping, breathing, colors running) but would say a 2+ on the Shulgin scale. I can still communicate, dance and interact just fine. Eventually my costume is soaked so I peel off the top and dance topless, which attracts a lot of attention from the opposite sex and have a few good lambada style twirls with them before being absorbed by my group again.<br><br>
12:30: Not as easy to communicate as earlier but have pretty much plateaued now and as we are planning on going deeeeep into the night I decide to a little bump is in order so I go to the washroom and pull out a pre-weighed pouch with 30mgs of 2C-C and stick a straw into it and snort between 1/2 and 1/3 (10-15mgs), then head back to the dance floor, it starts to come on pretty quickly and I realize that what I am in for is more than a little boost.<br><br>
1:00 am: The lid is blown completely off; I am blasted. It comes in waves. When a wave hits, I get lost waves of insight, I can see right through everyone, I <strong>know</strong> their game even if they do not. Visual distortion is overwhelming. I would have difficulty crossing the dance floor if I had to now. Am losing contact with the group I'm with, not even sure if I'm dancing or not. I am on the verge of a freak out for a short while but realize that a freak out would do nothing to improve the situation. So I remember some good advice someone once gave me, 'When in doubt, DANCE, close to the speakers'. At one point in between songs I am standing with one of the people I was dancing with but I couldn't speak so they got weirded out and went away. Later some girls stopped me and showed me their iPhone screen. It had a picture of someone who looked like the famous painting 'The Scream', then they took my photo and showed it to me, it was the same person. But I couldn't understand that until the next day some time. My face looked <strong>completely</strong> spaced out, I've never seen anyone look like that before. HOLY FUCK! In between the waves I would get lucid again and could connect with others and my group on the dance floor again but I felt isolated somewhat for a while. Someone handed me a joint and I couldn't figure out what to do with it. It fell apart in my clumsy fingers. My friends laugh at me, I'm so messed up. People are looking at me funny. 3 - 3+ on the Shulgin scale.<br><br>
3:00: somehow I missed most of Zen Mechanics set. I look at the videos of the party and can't remember experiencing what I see on the videos. The party is over and there is a rush for the door because the warehouse after party has only 350 tickets and the main party had 500 people, so its a race to the next party. Somehow I'm on the street with my coat, still topless and I can't figure out how to put my shirt back on and I am paranoid about getting separated from my group because I don't know where I am, where we are staying, where we are going, or where I left my car.  All of a sudden though I realize that the peak is past and I am somewhat able to function. The drive to the after-party was <strong>insane</strong>. The driver was blasted on 2C-B and 2C-E and speed and he was driving by looking at the GPS on his cell phone, not by looking at the road. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> I'm paranoid we will get arrested because he is going through red lights, down one way roads the wrong way and doing lots of U turns, dear god. My pockets are full of drugs and we all look seriously bent with glow-in-the-dark make-up etc.<br><br>
3:45: We are at the after party - it is even better than the main party, Zen Mechanics is playing there too, I drop another 150 mgs of MDMA and head on in. Dancing is sublime.<br><br>
7:30: Go outside for a leak and realize the sun is up, ugggg, legs hurt sooooo much from all the dancing.<br><br>
8:30: I lost my iPhone. Bummed out, I hop a taxi back to the room, because the rest of my group is still going strong. The taxi only drove me two blocks but I was not capable of figuring out how to navigate there. My friend showed me where we were on his GPS and where I was going but I could not connect the dots.<br><br>
10:30: I can't sleep, my legs ache, I get in car and start drive back to my home town. I pull over for a bite to eat. When I get back on the road, I am going back the way I came, but it takes 10 minutes to realize that, my calves are in serious pain<br><br>
When I took the 2C-C bump I was expecting just a lift to keep on going. I had no idea it would interact like that with what I had already taken. It caught me off guard initially and because I was in strange city. It wasn't as enjoyable as it might have been if I had been expecting it or had been someplace where I didn't have to worry about navigation, etc. Knowing now that they do interact, I would like to do some controlled experiments with the two playing with varying doses of each, but think I will wait for next years festival season because it always feels safer to go deeeeeep at festivals and sunrise isn't such a drag as it is at a warehouse party. But for a while there I was roadkill. I know my experience doesn't sound like fun, but I am convinced it is simply a matter of calibration to find the sweet spot.<!-- End Body -->
