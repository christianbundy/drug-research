Ok, first some background.  I am fairly experienced with psychedelics (DPT, Mushrooms, and LSD), but I've never gotten a full-blown psychedelic experience with ego loss and whatnot.  A friend told me about Salvia, he described it as 'a 5 minute acid trip'.  That description intrigued me, so I ordered some Salvia online.  When it arrived, I got a few friends together, got a nice bong, and a torch-style lighter, and walked out to a small duck pond.  I sat down on a wooden park bench.  My friends just wanted to watch my first experience without actually trying Salvia, so they smoked a few bowls of weed amongst themselves.<br><br>
I packed a fair amount of the Salvia into the bong and took it all in one hit.  As soon as the smoke hit my lungs, I got the feeling that *something* was happening, but I couldn't tell what that something was just yet.  After I finished taking my hit, I felt an extremly strong force pushing me back, almost as if some unseen entitiy was slowly and steadily pushing me in my chest, trying to get me to lay back.  I got the hint; I rolled off the bench and laid down on my back and closed my eyes.  <br><br>
Immediately, I felt like the world was spinning around very rapidly, but it didn't feel like the vertigo you get from alcohol (no nausea, for one).  I got extremely disoriented and lost in the spinning.  Not long after that, I lost all sense of time and space.  I could vaguely hear my friends talking to each other, but I could not understand what they were saying.  Their voices seemed very slow and garbled.  There were not that many visuals, just a few prismatic patterns dancing across my field of vision.  I did not pay attention to the visuals or the voices because sight and sound seemed unimportant, they had no bearing on my mindset.<br><br>
At that point, a strange thought started repeating itself over and over in my head, it didn't feel like my own thought.  Rather, it felt like someone was saying it in my ear:  'This is the path, don't despair, you will go past the door soon, but not today.'<br><br>
After that, I gradually regained my senses, and the world came back to me.  I sat up, still unable to feel or move my arms, looked around, and managed the only word I could at the time:  'Wow...Wow.' This was the closest I've ever gotten to completely losing touch with conventional reality, and I'm definately going to try this again (maybe 10X next time ;) )<!-- End Body -->
