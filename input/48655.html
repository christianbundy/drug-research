Before this trip, I did MeO once but even though I took the same dose, for some reason it didn't hit me as hard as this time. <br><br>
I snort 20 mg, and like down next to my boyfriend. At first, everything is fine, and my body is becoming relaxed, my breathing is becoming slower and deeper. Soon though, I start becoming confused. I feel like my throat is opening and that I'm going to be sick, but I'm not sure yet. My friends and I are listening to Sublime but the music seems to be going so slow that I can't follow it and I don't know what song is playing. I start losing the concept of all things physical. <br><br>
When I touch my hands, they seem to disappear, and my face when I touch it seems to melt. I try not to touch anything because I dont like the melting sensation. For about 10 minutes (although it seems like ETERNITY), my mind is completely confused and lost. I dont remember exactly what I'm thinking but it was something along the lines of me trying to figure whats happening to me and what I'm thinking about. Reality completely slips away from me, and as I try to find it again, it slips even further down.<br><br>
My friends are all hanging out and having a good time, and I'm looking at them but I can't seem to understand anything. It's like we're on two different planes, and I barely register them. My friend comes into the room and looks at my face but I look through her, because I don't think she's real. I feel like if I touched her, my hand would go right through her. <br><br>
I start thinking that I'm freaking out (which is a bad idea because that just makes you freak out even more), and I go into the bathroom and am sick. At that point, I feel so shitty that I'm tempted to just lie down on the floor in the bathroom and curl up but I resist that temptation because in one small part of my mind I realize that's not a good idea. <br><br>
By this time, everything around me is swirling and the walls look like they're melting.<br><br>
I go into the living room and my friends realize that I'm not doing so well. At first I can't understand what they're saying and I cant say anything back. My friend holds my hand and tells me that I'm going to be alright. Snorted, the trip is only supposed to last 30 minutes and Ive gone through about 20, even though it feels like its been a lot longer. Suddenly, I find my voice and start talking to my friend and automatically start coming down. The come down is pretty pleasant and I feel calm now, but I definitely freaked out first.<!-- End Body -->
