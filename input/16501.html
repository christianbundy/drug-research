This is not a report of one experience but of how I got HPPD, and what has occured with regard to substance use since I got it.<br><br>
I have smoked dope for a number of years now, and although it often made me paranoid I suffered no serious adverse affects.  Being curious about alterating my conciousness, about a year ago I dropped 3/4 of a tab of quality acid.  I was in an intimate, relaxed setting with friends and good music, but even so I felt a little apprhensive.  However, I smoked a couple of joints, mellowed out and ate the tab.  The trip was fantastic- I saw some amazing fractals and had a fanatasic trip, although it was not particularly intense.<br><br>
I had no adverse effects the next day apart from a comedown, and decided that acid was something i'd like to do regularily.  Immediately after dropping the tab (the next few weeks) i smoked dope heavily, and about a month post-trip I started to notice fractals whenever I got stoned.  I dismissed this at first, but as I continued to smoke the symptoms worsened (but perhaps they would have naturally anyway).  Today, the symptoms are as bad as they have ever been, but since they started so mildly I can still lead a normal life, though they sure get me down sometimes.<br><br>
The interesting thing is that although most HPPDers say that even smelling pot smoke can make their symptoms permanently worse, I have smoked (and continue to smoke) shitloads of pot since getting HPPD.  In addition, I dropped small doses of acid twice after getting this syndrome, and have also done e, slavia, nitrous, heaps of alochol and I currently do speed fairly regularly (it's about the only chemical that doesn't make symptoms worse).<br><br>
Anyway, just though I'd submit this because my HPPD experience is rather different to the conventional one- and yes, I do have genuine hppd: static, afterimages, floaters, fucked up peripheral vision et. al.<br><br>
Anyway, i'm gonna go and smoke a couple of cones tonight- if I try and forget HPPD, it can sometimes forget me!<br><br>
