 "report": "<p>\nI had just talked to my friend in school that told me he had some legal drug that got him really trashed.  My experience with these so-called 'legal' drugs is that they are all scams, and none of them will get you anything but a headache.  Oh how I was wrong.  I got to his house, and he showed me the bottle.  It said 'Sage Incense'.  I laughed, and thought he must have been some kind of liar, or they were all playing a joke on me.</p><p>I took one big hit out of a dry-bog, and nothing happened for like 10 seconds.  I took another one.  10 seconds went by, and I asked him how long it would take to kick in.</p><p>He said around 5 minutes, but by the time he was done with his sentence, the entire room sank, and my vision was going in and out.  I broke out hysterically laughing, and couldn't stop.  I tried to tell him to pass me another hit, but it all came out in jibberish.  After 15 minutes of this, (which seemed like 1 minute) I got a hot flash all over my body, then I just felt high.  It was the most intense experience I have ever had off of 2 hits of anything.</p>"
