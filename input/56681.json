 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have in the past year stayed clear from mdma and sought less physically taxing ways to have a good time. I found a product called 5-htp , before taking it I did some major research and found in to be on the whole beneficial. 3 months after trying various doses, i have found out the following. \r\n1. The most important factor is stimulus. 5-htp works far better if I am having a few drinks with mates, or nightclubbing.\r\n2. Taking on an empty stomach provides more desired effects. (euphoria)\r\n3. 100mg gives a stamina boost. 200mg gives euphoria, anything higher increases the risk of nausea. \r\n4. It will never match mdma for pure happiness, but it provides a good compromise. \r\n5. Personal experience, increased audio awareness, increase smell sensitivity and light sensitivity.\n\n\n"
