I used to have access to quite a bit of Dilantin because my father suffered from seizures but didn't take his medication like he should (mainly because of its interaction with alcohol). But, anyway, when I would run out of weed and anything else and I realllly wanted to get high I wound up taking very large doses of Dilantin (Varying from perhaps 600 up to 1500mg It's been awhile it is hard to remember).<br>
The effects of this drug were very strange and my memory is kind of hazy. <br><br>
The most startling effect that I remember was an indescribable connection between sounds and feeling. I suppose this is synesthesia, but I haven't read anything about that side-effect in any of the PDR copies I've found on the web. But I remember it being extremely pronounced for the first 36-48 hours after ingesting the drugs. The effects would slowly wear off over the course of a few days.<br><br>
The initial effects are sleepiness, mild confusion (I remember feeling extremely fuzzy headed, it was hard to think clearly), and loss of coordination. The auditory/sensory effects would kick in a little while later, but they would last much longer than the other effects. While the experience wasn't very pleasant (sometimes the synesthesia was kind of unnerving) I tried it a few times. I don't recommend it at all for recreational use, and I didn't notice any cognitive improvements.<!-- End Body -->
