 "report": "<p>Many years ago (1986) I was taking lithium as a mood control drug.  I had had a manic episode and since then had had no success with the tranquilizers thorazine or mellaril to return me to normal.  Then I tried lithium, a drug that must be maintained in the blood and regulated with blood check ups.  I had been smoking pot some around this time and also had done LSD in the past, a factor which may have contributed to my unstable moods and manic episode.</p><p>One day, I foolishly took LSD while I was on lithium.  This produced some extremely fantastic, though horrifying, hallucinations.  The two drugs together caused extremely psychotic thoughts and visuals.  I kept thinking that I was out of sync with some mathematically precise method of behavior that could not be maintained unless I discovered some unknown and untenable truth.  I was sure at one point that I was communicating mentally with dead spirits and, on the visual side, saw things on the order of a flock of golden birds ascend out of a file cabinet door. </p><p>At one point I was looking for my glasses while they were on my face and actually believed I had become my neighbor.</p>"
