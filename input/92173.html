REPORT OF EXPERIMENT WITH 2-CB         <br><br>
Date:  March 11, 1981<br><br>
Place:  Ralston's Home, Barstow<br><br>
Subects:  Zeke and Holly Ralston<br><br>
Dosage: 16 m.g for Holly, 20 m.g. for Zeke<br><br>
1:25 p.m.  Start.  After ingestion, we both worked outdoors for awhile, awaiting results.  The effects came on quite slowly.  Shortly after 2, I feel a slight expansion, Holly a slight tingliness.  It was a full hour before we began to feel significant effects.  Holly observes visual enhancement, a bush beginning to grow. I feel more and more energy, some visual enhancement, a very slight nausea, some of my usual load dragging. Holly was feeling very energetic after one hour, so we went for a walk.  It was delightful outside.  A huge storm had gathered over the mountains, and we were surrounded by dramatic clouds, threatening rain.  It was very invigorating outside, Holly feeling the cold but me not, a reversal of our normal state.  Holly was responding beautifully, with much visual and color enhancement.  I experience enhancement of beauty, but am aware of a deep block. In fact, I am very surprised to feel the heaviness of the load I am carrying, as it seemed much worse than I thought it was.  however, in line with recent learning experiences, and following Kay's advice of dropping the need to understand, I accepted and simply experienced the feelings without resisting them or churning into them.  It felt much better this way.<br><br>
3:23  We have returned from our walk, light the stove.  The effects have grown steadily and are now at maximum.  While able to function perfectly, it feels best to sit. I sit on the sofa, look out at clouds.  The sky is most beautiful, and I am very taken by it, drawn into the experience.  The clouds get brighter and brighter, until a hole begins to form around the sun, so that the sun shines through brighter.  I ask  to be shown the clear light of truth, and the clouds dissipate until the sun is shining almost perfectly clear except for a light haze. I have no trouble looking directly at it, feeling the light of Truth grow.  I began to get a little concerned for the possible effect on my eyes, and a finger of cloud obligingly moves across the sun to diminish the light.  The sun shining through the wisps of cloud is fantastically beautiful, and I know this to be a very deep, profound experience.  I am aware of great energy and great love.  I tell Holly the beauty I see in the clouds, and she looks out, and immediately warns me to protect my eyes.  This creates doubt in me, and I look away.  I feel guilty that I didn't have the faith to keep looking, knowing that with complete trust no damage could occur.  Yet I realize that I am always putting myself in those situations to create a sense of failure, so I simply decided to look only as long as comfortable, and to look away when not.  I had some feeling that it was a mistake to try to get someone else to share a deep experience, as such experiences are between the individual and the Highest Order, and they are open to anyone who seeks them for himself.<br><br>
I spent a glorious hour just watching the clouds and experiencing. I would be experiencing ecstasy, and then the experience would turn sour.  I was aware that a negative thought had crossed my mind.  So I chose positive thoughts, and the<br>
experience would move in that direction.  I had an amazing time watching how what I experienced followed my thinking. I decided to create the maximum possible joy.<br><br>
I worked at this a while, and learned a lot about myself.  Then the experience began to grow thin; I was running out of energy and beginning to feel empty.  It came to me that you cannot do this alone.  My feeling at the moment was that I had deserted Holly to become wrapped up in myself, and if felt better to get back in harmony; the next day in musing over it another interpretation occurred to me, that I had gotten out of touch with the Central Source by trying so hard to get the result.  While this is going on, Holly is also having a very great experience.  We see an eagle fly before the sun, and this brings her a great feeling of feeling of the Presence, 5:00p.m. the first she ever felt.  After a while she feels this Presence in everything around her.  I am very happy for her, but am strangely blocked from her at a deep level.  She reads Gibran, and is very deeply moved.  I find it very beautiful, but it doesn't strike me as deeply as it does her.  I am concerned by my inability to feel with her.<br><br>
5:00. I walk outside for a while alone.  It is growing dark, and the storm is still dramatic.  I enjoy the outdoors very much, and enjoy the different feeling I feel. I get a deep sense of loneliness, but it passes.  Also powerful anger occurs again, and I wonder why this keeps returning.  I wonder if it is because something has happened to me in in the past.  I decide to go in and look to see.  I lie down beside Holly, and we listen to music.  It feels very good to be beside her.  What I feel from<br>
the past is my enormous sensitivity to rejection, and how painful it is.  At the  same time, I see how many little things that Holly does causes me to feel rejected. At the same time, I can see that I am doing many little things that cause her to feel rejected.  The withdrawal is most peaceful and enjoyable.  <br><br>
We finally end it to get something to eat.  By this time we are feeling enormous euphoria and well-being, which continues to grow through the evening. The aftermath is simply superb,  better than any experience I can remember.  I feel marvelous, light and full of energy, and wonderfully on top of things. We enjoy a very delicious meal, with marvelous enhancement of taste.  For the next few hours I have to complete a number of chores getting ready to go back to L.A, the next morning, like packing, shining shoes, etc.  A little tension grew because of the demand of my attention to these chores instead of freely experiencing, as I would have preferred.  But going to bed was marvelous. <br><br>
The drive to Los Angeles the next day was absolutely superb.  We are still very much in the experience, and in some ways I reach greater heights than the day before.  The scenery is beautiful, and I can let go completely to the flow of the car.  I get a number of tremendous realizations, centered in the marvelous things that happen with true commitment to the Central 'Source'.  I feel the impact of the high point of the previous day's experience of standing in the light.  But the amazing thing is how absolutely wonderful I feel, both psychically and physically. It is just absolutely great.  This enormous well-being was toned down the next few days as we interacted with others, but the drive back to Barstow, 4 days later, restored a lot of it.<!-- End Body -->
