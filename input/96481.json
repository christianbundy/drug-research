 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFirst off let me start by saying that I have had a brain/ upper spine and back surgery three years ago. All drugs I abuse have been prescribed to ME over one year ago. I heavily indulge in my leftovers several times per year. To give you perspective on my tolerance, I take at least 360mg codeine or 6-8 Percs or Vics to get high for the afternoon. I always do Cold Water Extraction on any dose that exceeds 1.5mg APAP (Tylenol) in one day. This will be a retrospective on my first experience combining a barbiturate with codeine.<br>Several days ago I found some Fioricet (50mg Butalbital, Caffeine, APAP) in my medicine cupboard. I have never taken Butalbital before, to my knowledge. One day I took one tab, and the next day I took two tabs. The effects of the Butalbital alone can be read in another entry in the Butalbital section. This overview will pick up where that entry left off.<br>45 minutes after orally ingesting 100mg Butalbital on a partially full stomach I decide to take 60mg codeine. <br>30 minutes after taking the codeine, I had a noticeable opiate buzz. As expected with such a small dose of a lightweight opiate, the codeine effect itself was mild.<br>45 minutes after the codeine I am feeling a decent euphoria, much better than I was expecting. I felt incredibly relaxed, and it felt SO good to just let my head flop around and let my body flow how it wanted. I was surprised at how the combo of Butalbital and Codeine came together to make a whole new experience that Ive never experienced before even on large doses of harder opiates.<br>Over the next two hours my euphoria intensified and I became more tired. The more tired I got the better I felt. The feeling of supreme relaxation from the Butalbital intensified the codeine, and both drugs reciprocated each others effects. I felt like my movements trailed around, like I wasnt moving as one whole, but like parts of me were dripping off and then regrouping. This experience was unique and also fun. The euphoria was less intense than a large dose of opiates alone, but I was in a far more relaxed and careless state than Ive ever experienced with just opiates. <br>As the night wore on the euphoria and relaxation continued steady without dropping off. I didnt feel like I needed to bump my dose to maintain the high. After an excellent 6 hour long experience I went to sleep, still fully enjoying the high.<br>This being such a small dose of both drugs, I was pleasantly surprised. I will try again with 200 or 250mg of Butalbital and some hydrocodone. I would anticipate extreme euphoria, but with a great twist from the extremely relaxing and body perception altering Butalbital.<br>One thing to note is that the constipation I was subjected to after this experience was worse than I normally have with opiates alone. At about four hours in I got a quick, sharp stabbing pain in my left abdomen, and I knew that it was the drugs telling my digestive tract to shut down. This doesnt concern me, and is my main side effect of these drugs. I didnt defecate the next day, but did the day after. Next time I use Butalbital in combination with opiates I will take a docusate or senna, which will negate the side effects.<br>The small dose I described didnt get me really high or smashed, but it was enough to be enjoyable. This combo is a really great way to spend an evening alone (probably not good for a group experience) if you dont want to get really wasted. By the way, I personally never felt the caffeine.<br>All in all, this is a great relaxation combo with mild euphoria and extreme relaxation from a small dose.\n\n\n"
