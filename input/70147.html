I took two 600mg Gabapentins that I bought off my friend. Within 45 minutes I start to notice some subtle changes, but I had a hard time identifying exactly what I was feeling. <br><br>
15 minutes later I feel extremely happy and euphoric. My normal social anxiety had melted away. I felt as if I was who I should be normally, or at least how I used to be. I was outgoing, excited, and talkative and not one bit nervous. I loved who I was on this drug. I have never had a drug to make me feel so normal. I was high. I was confident meeting strangers and there was no hesitation in my speech. <br><br>
This was way way different from Xanax too. It didn't make me tired or forget anything. I had a completely clear mind before, during, and after I took it. It also eliminated the anxiety in a different way in that Xanax just makes you not give a shit about anything. Gabapentin just made me not nervous while actually making me more enthused to do stuff and get up and meet people.  I want to be prescribed this drug because I believe I would be a happier person with it.<!-- End Body -->
