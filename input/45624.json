 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nT0:00 3:15\r\nI just filled up a tablespoon (about 14 grams), tilted my head back, and tossed it all in. Chugged coke until I got it all out of my mouth. Not too bad (but not good tasting by any measure). I think it would be worse mixing it with anything as it kinda clumps together (plus changes whatever the substance is too a greenish/brown mush.)\r\nT+10 minutes\r\nStarting to feel something. A little relaxed, seems to have relieved some fatigue I was feeling and I feel like my brain is a bit sharper. Nice so far.\r\nT+20 minutes\r\nStrong desire to work. Play guitar, write songs, anything creative sounds fun. Listening to music. Very clear-headed. Smoked a few puffs of MJ from a pipe to spice things up a bit.\r\nT+25 minutes\r\nWow, what a difference. I think Kratom should have MJ to go with it. It's very synergistic.\r\nT+30 minutes\r\nThe effects have gotten stronger. My body is warm and fuzzy but my mind is still sharp and relaxed. Coffee sounds really good. So off I go. Will probably sprinkle a little Kola Nut in it for a stronger cup of java.\r\nT+40 minutes The warm and fuzzy is still increasing. Feels like a low dose of MDMA body wise. Rubbing, stretching, scratching are all more pleasurable.\r\nt+60 minutes  I think I'm peaking now but it's very subtle. Feels good, I'm very talkative, more patient and understanding with people. Mind is dulled a bit now, I think from taking a tad too much, but this is enjoyable for sure.\r\n4:27\r\nI can tell this will last a while. I could take a great nap, but I think MJ and coffee will be the way to go. I'm actually enjoying playing my guitar scales ;)\r\n4:36\r\nNext time I will probably take a little less. I enjoyed the stimulant effect. I higher doses Kratom acts as a CNS depressant. Plus it's expensive :) Still felling groovy though. ANd still playing scales :P\r\n4:56\r\nKinda blurry eyed. Not really a strobe effect, but it feels like my eyes are slowing crossing and then straightening out again (slight double vision). Doesn't bother me though.\r\nOverall this felt kinda like codeine. A good body high. I doubt this will be legal in the states for long. It's by far my best bet for a legal high that is safe. A good special occassion drug. Not one to be used everyday (I imagine it could be mentally addictive).\n\n\n"
