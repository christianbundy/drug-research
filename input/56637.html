I am recovering from minor depression, I have been for quite some time.  I also used to have some 'anxiety issues'.  So, technically I have been diagnosed with 'generalized anxiety disorder/ depression'.  Effexor XR at 300 mg really helped out with the anxiety and depression, I still feel better today.  But, I felt still slow (my demanding school schedule requires me to study, study, study).  So, my psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall.  At first I tried the XR.  In a few months, I was up to 30 mg XR (2 times a day x 15 mg).  But, I was displaying symptoms of minor manic behavior (more irritable, over aggressive, eating more than usual, needing to stretch a lot more than usual).  Then, I switched to 30 mg of generic Adderall (10 mg, 3x day).  But, still had manic symptoms.<br><br>
My shrink thought I was 'minorly bipolar' which means that I get a little depressed without some stimulation.  But, I go overboard when given amphetamines or caffeine.<br>
So, I wanted to try Provigil.  I cut out the amphetamines 'cold turkey' (that was quite hard to do).  Yesterday, and the day before that, I had 200 mg.  Today, I did a little more (I still was feeling quite drowsy in class).<br><br>
I admit, I did feel very alert.  I did not feel 'restless' as with Adderall.  I did not feel the compulsive 'need to accomplish'.  I did not feel my body temperature rise and a desire to eat everything in sight.  Let's see what the results are.  That's what truly matters.<br><br>
It did not raise my IQ (mine stays the same no matter how many times I take the IQ test), the drugs did not increase test scores (I actually had a 4.0 before taking any of this stuff), and I feel more distracted when studying.<!-- End Body -->
