I'd read a lot about Kava, and had decided that it was worth a shot. I'd tried just about every other licit and illicit substance that I could get my hands on, and I'm reaching a point in my life where I'm ready for something less intense. From what I'd read, Kava was just the substance.<br><br>
I had heard about a reverse tolerance with Kava, similar to that with Marijuana. Basically, the first few times you try it, the results will be less than 100%. Therefore, I gave it several tries before I drew any conclusions.<br><br>
I ordered a pound of Hawaiian Skinless Mo'I from a popular provider, and it arrived a couple days later. Excitedly, I prepared my first beverage. *ugh* It tasted like ass...I prepared it just as the container suggested, and managed to choke it down. Not only did it taste disguisting, but I didn't notice any effects.<br><br>
After several tries, and eventually getting my hands on a more potent variety, I was able to understand what all the hype was about. <br><br>
My most recent experience involved 3 glasses of Kava, each containing about 2-3 Tbsp of Kava powder each. After each glass I can feel myself sinking deeper and deeper into relaxation. I would describe it as a mix between the effects of marijuana and alcohol, although containing NONE of the negative affects with either.<br><br>
It is relaxing like alcohol without the intoxication, and it makes me mellow like Marijuana without the anxiety or the stupidity. I get sort of a squinted eye relaxation and I just want to lay down. My bed feels like a soft cloud. I've heard of public speakers taking a glass of kava before hand. I can understand why. It definitely reduces a ton of anxiety. <br><br>
Kava is a great beverage. Granted, the taste definitely takes some getting used to. It took me a while to find a preparation that is palatable, but it is definitely worth it for someone who is looking for a nice mellow substance. It is not an intense feeling, but like someone else had mentioned, it is definitely not placebo either. Kava gets an A+ in my book.<!-- End Body -->
