 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAs an occasional recreational user of substances that enhance my sense of well-being, I'd always rejoice at the ability to obtain any type of either hydrocodone or oxycodone.  I came across several websites that offered Tramadol (or Ultram) or even Ultracet (Ultram + Acetaminophen), without a prescription, and with overnight delivery.  \r\nI started with straight tramadol since the Ultracet was much more expensive, and I figured that I could take a couple Tylenol with the Tramadol to basically replicate Ultracet.\r\nI started with a dose of 150 mg. (three 50 mg. tablets).  After about 30 minutes, I felt the initial rush that I always have felt with 'codone' family substances.  Later however, the buzz got more intense and satisfying, but I found that I did not experience the extreme itchiness and spaced out feeling that I always have with 'codones.'  Just a steady and pleasurable, happy and satisfied feeling, with my concentration levels more intense and my enjoyment of great TV and music extremely enhanced.  \r\nI like to call Tramadol 'hydrocodone light', which really means that it basically gives me the same buzz, but much better without the negative side effects.\n\n\n"
