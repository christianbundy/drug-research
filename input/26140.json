 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSo, you liked the title of the article? I bet about 90% of you are men looking to either become a desired stud or to please your significant other just a little better. The other 10% are women either curious or dissatisfied with your man.<br>Here you go  how to become a porn star overnight<br>Im sure youve all heard about Viagra (Sildenafil), and many of you have probably tried it. Yes, it makes my manhood sing like an opera star, but it doesnt do much for longevity in bed. It might be able to go again in a minute, but will shoot my load in a few minutes yet again. <br>I have the solution  Zoloft (Sertraline). If I take 100mg of Zoloft 8-14 hrs before sex on an empty stomach or 5-8 hrs after a meal I'm lucky if I ever cum. Viagra + Zoloft = a woman that will beg for more time after time. <br>Now, Viagra has a couple of side effects  flushing, stuffy nose and body aches. For the Flushing there is little I can offer as a remedy. For the stuffy nose  try a 12hr Sudafed works like a charm. And for the body aches, try 400mg advil (ibuprofen).<br>I know what youre thinking  how can I get/afford the Viagra and Zoloft. And I have the answer  but from abroad. Ive been doing it for years, have never not a shipment arrive, and have never had it take longer than 2 weeks (usually in 1).<br>P.S. If you are taking any nitrates/nitrites, you can not take Viagra! I have found that people respond well to Diphenhydramine (Benedryl) pretty well  it will give your member a lift. Be careful, though, since it makes most people very drowsy.\n\n\n"
