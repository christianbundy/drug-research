I present to you the experience report in it's unedited, raw form. I was experienced with over fifty different drugs at the time of this report and consider myself a bit jaded. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend and out of a toxic home environment that clearly affected recent experiences with 2ce. My mood was great, and my health had improved since a disastrous experience with MDPV psychosis that happened about a month ago (Report ID# 78382).<br><br>
5:00 Dose is parachuted<br>
5:28 first effects apparent. Warmth, perspiration, a feeling of excitement similar to some good rolls.<br>
5:37 Swedish girl ime, weird surprise.<br>
6:00 do a bump, doesn't burn much...<br>
7pm Bit the bullet and made pork chop dinner for g/f;s mom<br>
8:30 went out to go get acid with g/f and old friend, took another 200 mg bomb<br>
9:00 trip went from going to some guy's house to going to a bonfire in the woods behind a Days Inn, had to walk miles to get there. friend didn't know where it was or 99% of the heads there.<br>
9:30 Crappy bonfire, can't see anything. I try to introduce myself and no one notices. I dressed nicely to show my friend (who just got out of a year in jail) that I have my shit together. My dress pants, fancy button up shirt, new shoes and new 'trying to get a job and get the police off my back' haircut makes it obvious I don't belong there.<br>
9:45 Crappily built fire crumbles, flaming logs roll out onto dead leaves and underbrush. Overheard girls saying that they were 17, I realize me and my old lady are the oldest people there. 23 and 24, lol.<br>
10:00 Nobody has any acid, there is only one beer and no bottle opener. I'm left out on a rotation of low grade cannabis. Thankfully no cops came and took my dumb ass away. I laugh to myself, in a better lighting situation, they could see that I had a couple caps of mephedrone and methylone I was looking to give away. Those kids would have been like hogs in a trough. I gave it to my friend.<br>
11:00 Got back to the house, tell g/fs mom about the beat party we ended up at. I had a bigger fire at my Halloween party '06 when we all took 4-ho-det and set fire to the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn because we wanted to burn something and I already had another copy. Drunk friend pissed the fire out, but that is another tale!<br>
12: do some lines of mephedrone, talking to gimmel about stuff<br>
1:11 finally, current time. very stimulated, but enjoying myself. This blows MDPV away.<br>
6:27 AM Felt some pressure and/or tightness in my chest around 3 or 4. Relaxed in bed and had wonderful sex with the girlfriend. I couldn't get off but it was an amazing experience. Took 1mg xanax and sucked on some of the lady's spent fentanyl patches or about a half hour. A mild opiate high is experienced. Dropped a 200 mg bomb of mephedrone, reflecting on how I was better off when I knocked over my cheap knockoff energy drink while balling. This stuff is more than enough. It's not that I can't sleep, I just don't want to. I begin to work on my novel...<br>
7:02 Am what a beautiful morning! The birds are singing and all that happy shit! It's great to be alive and stuff!<br><br>
The comedown was minimal. I felt extremely good despite not going to sleep for another 12 hours after this report was finished. This is something I've never been able to say after staying up for thirty hours on various stimulant drugs. Even when I could get 'good' ecstasy, I always felt horrible the next day.<br><br>
In conclusion, methylone was a great experience and an extremely social empathogen best shared with close friends and loved ones in a private setting.<!-- End Body -->
