 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell, I read about these seeds, so I thought Id give it a try. If I did trip off of these it would have been my first trip. I have not done any drugs besides pot, beer, and pills.\r<br>Well, I went to the store and bought six 1.8 gram packages of Heavenly Blue seeds (336 seeds) and a ten dollar electric coffee grinder. Got home, chopped 'em down to powder with the coffee grinder. I didn't put the powder in water that day, I waited like 2 days until nobody was home. Well on that day, I did my daily shit, got up and took a shower and then ate some cereal.<br><br>I put the powder in about a cup of water and shook it around, let it sit for like 10 minutes, and drank it. I didnt leave them in the coffee grinder long enough because there were still a few half-seed pieces. So I just ate them. About an hour later I had a very strong euphoric feeling. My body was all numb and I was really happy (probably just because I thought I was going to trip. I went outside and sat on my step because the breeze felt really good and it was nice being outside watching the trees sway. Hours passed but my euphoria didnt increase or anything. I did not even have dilated pupils. All I found on this day was that these seeds only made me feel good, and then be really tired after that.<br><br>I didnt think (and still dont think) what little amount of food I had effected the seeds effect. Just one small bowl of cereal the whole day. Plus 10 grams of the seeds, thats a pretty hefty dose. I did not have a trace of stomach pains or anything. I did have this uncomfortable feeling in my throat that I was about to barf though. Not a pain, and surely nothing bad enough to keep me from trying them again.<br><br>Two days later my mom decided to go to the store, so I went along and bought 4 more packages of seeds (Heavenly Blue again). I got six grams of seeds, the packages were each 1.5 grams. I made sure I did not have a thing to eat before I did the seeds this time. Got home, ground the seeds; did a better job this time. I put it in some water and let it sit for a few minutes. The water was really brown this time as opposed to last time. I drank the water, along with a little bit of Coca-Cola.<br><br>Hour and a half later, very slight euphoria and that was all, no stomach pains at all, again. I was sad, I just decided to eat my sandwiches and drink the rest of my coke. Before I got done with my 2nd sandwich I started to feel sick, no pains. I went and got a kitchen pan in case I barfed. I was lying on the couch. Nothing . . .<br><br>I had to pee really bad so I went to the bathroom. While I was taking a wiz I looked at a light on the mirror. It was changing colors. Bad-ass I thought. I looked in the mirror and saw a big purple spot on my face from the light. I closed my eyes and I noticed some very light visuals. No open eye visuals whatsoever though, not even tracers. I made my open visuals with my flashlight. This wasnt too fun.<br><br>Music was a little better than usual but it seemed a little quieter too. Took another piss - pupils were dilated. bright lights were still changing colors (when I stared at them long enough). and I was really dizzy. things move kind of weird like when drunk, but not delayed as much. I noticed that things seemed further away, which I read a story on here which suggested that. well thats basically it, no trip, even with a somewhat high dose again. But it was better than the 10 grams two days earlier. when I woke up this morning I had some very slight CEVs again, wave-like patterns I guess. I could barely see them and they went away after I looked at them for like 5 seconds. Its been 5 hours since I woke up and I still feel slightly dizzy.<br><br>I wish I was one of those people who ate 100 seeds and had a nice trip. but I guess I'm not. Maybe Ill try an even lower dosage next time since it seemed to work better. I will probably do it again. Not soon though; I have other things to spend my money on. I didnt feel much of the puking and stomach pains at all, but of course, that's just me.\n\n\n\n"
