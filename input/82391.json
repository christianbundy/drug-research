 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI recently obtained four 25mg librium capsules from a friend. Here's my experience.\r\nt00:00- Three 25mg capsules ingested \r\nt00:15-Feeling of relaxation, chalked off to placebo.\r\nt00:30-More relaxation, my bed feels amazing. Finding it very hard to walk. Not a care in the world. I wanna see how far I can take this so I took a fourth pill equaling 100 mg.\r\nt00:45-Really no effect from the 4th pill. Starting to come down.\r\nt1:00-Normality restored.\r\nOverall this is a great drug for relaxing.\n\n\n"
