I am a fairly experienced user of entheogens, and I would rather save you the details and move to this experience. <br><br>
I acquired a small vial of Yarrow tincture from a local health food store, after trying 2 initial doses that were approximately 3 eyedroppers full I have concluded the effects to be very similar to some anti anxiety meds such as xanax and ativan. I took the dose in a small amount of water like the bottle suggests and the taste is bad but no where near as bad as wormwood. It mixes well with alcohol and cannabis. After about one hour the effects are most prominent and taper off gradually over two hours. <br><br>
The clearness of thought is greatly enhanced and social inhibitions seem to melt away with out having to get plastered on alcohol. And as another report said it does enhance my vision, not to point of psychedelic revelations but just noticing more around me.<!-- End Body -->
