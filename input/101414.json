 "report": "<p>Male, 22, healthy build. Take one multivitamin, 150mg-300mg gabapentin for anxiety, both daily. Stopped 1 week prior to dosing etaqualone. </p><p>Had lots of experience with all kinds of downers benzos, opiates, psychedelics stimulants. Weed, you name it. From the basic to rare and exotic.</p><p>I took 1mg etizolam and 100mg tramadol the night before this, besides that only pot smoked all week. </p><p>I smoked cannabis and cigs all through this report, as I usually do. </p><p>10:50</p><p>Swallow approx 500-mg</p><p>Its odd dumping a big pile of powder without some anxiety as the powders I handle are usually active in amounts 100's of times smaller then the pile I'm looking at now. </p><p>10:58</p><p>Yup all ready a lil high I'm pretty sure. </p><p>11:15 Initial wondering about if I just ate a mislabelled chem gone. </p><p>Now just hoping I didn't eat a bunk synth chem. Ill chalk up that 10:58 entry to placebo</p><p>11:25</p><p>Stood up. Woah, nice and uncoordinated. A bit of a content mindspace. Having fun waving arms around and rolling on floor giddy and stupid. Wish wasn't so cheap per dose or id deff be getting down on this often. </p><p>Nice euphoria too. Like a uppidy opioid. Not as lovey or solidly content feeling as opiates.</p><p>Guess I didn't get a bunk batch cause I'm high as shit. Really fun to rotate my torso and let my arms flail around</p><p>11:45 </p><p>Too uncoordinated to type notes now, Using siri to input text.  </p><p>Outside for a cig, Damn I love these things at this point.</p><p>They turn my body to Jell-O and the hardest concrete floor into a fluffy bed of feathers or cotton.</p><p>Took a good amount of time to figure out why my computer wasn't controlling my iPhone volume.</p><p>11:55</p><p>Body is so loose it feels weird to cough</p><p>12:00</p><p>Decide to go for a walk look at my board on the way out and think that would be so much fun but I'm way too any related to ride my skateboard right now.</p><p>Still feel content, a slight bit of dysphoria, Feel like my inner monologue is being narrated in the 3rd person. EX: ok so there's the clouds, they look nice to me, there's the moon, I enjoy how its illuminating the street.</p><p>I'd certainly be one of those fools playing a highly inflated price for eludes once they were made illegal kind of like what happened with that OC's and OP's</p><p>12:10</p><p>I want to take this with my friends, I want a huge stash of these, for every Friday I love them</p><p>12:20-12:45</p><p>Marked decrease in effects. </p><p>1:00 </p><p>Baseline, Play gta for a hour</p><p>2:00</p><p>Fall asleep</p><p>Got a good nights rest and woke up not feeling at all groggy from the Etaqualone. So glad I got to get an idea of why ludes were so popular. The short duration is a real bummer because it is really very enjoyable. Its an amazing analgesic. I'm usually in horrible pain in my back from work. While on the etqualone it was not noticeable.</p>"
