 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMany a time have I taken the plunge into Timothy Leary's magnificent pool.  The difference is that no matter how many times I dive into that same pond, I never know how deep it goes.  \r\nA while ago, a friend and I each had about 4 hits of high-powered blotter acid.  It was actually a birthday present from him to me.  So the day we decided to drop, we had called Matt over to babysit us.  We kept talking wonderful things about my birthday the next day, and it had put me in such a phenomenal mood.  Matt arrives and we each put our 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch square on our tongues, and wait.  Patiently we wait.  So patiently in fact that we had begun to think the worst about the expensive paper that rested firmly on our tongues.\r\nThen it began.\r\nI walked over to the sink and remembered thinking that the draining water looked more than a little funny.  I turned to Ben and at the same time, he turned to me.  We gave each other that look of intimate knowledge that this wait had not been for naught.  We smiled, walked outside, and smoked a cigarette.  The sun was setting, but that word is all too common.  The sun was no longer setting.  The sun was dancing, playing, and surrounding us with its mighty warmth.  It was embracing us with the colorful horizon.  All we could do was lie down on the porch and stare.  We stared for hours at the sky.  Stars were slowly brought into view on the backs of other constellations.  I saw Leo frolic with the hunter, Orion.  Scorpio left the big dipper in search of the next hapless soul to walk by.  \r\nI could see things move, patterns shift, and new shapes envelope the world around me.  However, this time I wasn't as interested in these beautiful visions as I normally was.  This time I wanted more, I was getting more, and wished that all could feel how happy I was, then and there.  Ben was the same way.  I thought for hours we had been having conversations and listening to the most beautiful music ever played by man.  Every word he said was in tune with mine.  Our words played off each other like instruments in an orchestra, the perfect accompaniment to each other.  Such peace, such blissful harmony.\r\nMatt came outside to check on us relatively often, but he was never really worried.  He knew the better safe than sorry rule.  Just knowing that I had a friend who cared enough to be my babysitter was enough.  \r\nBy the time the LSD had peaked, plateaued, peaked, and plateaued once more, I realized that my temporary bliss was finally coming to its halt.  The motion around me slowed to a lull.  The colors were no longer showing off their splendor, but had now wrapped themselves around me.  The music had dwindled to a muffled tune, but never quite went away.  Instead it kept repeating itself, as if searching for something yet undone, unheard.  I could hear the rhythm, and feel it's drumbeat.  \r\nI closed my eyes and thought.\r\nWords began to offer themselves to me from the mouths of great poets of long times past.  Homer added his philosophy, Faulkner leant me his strength, and TS Eliot gave me his poetic grasp of our language.\r\nI opened my eyes and found a notebook.  I began to write these words with the fervor of the great men.  They had become my muses.  They inspired me to put down all I could think to say, because otherwise it would've been lost.  An hour passes by going at D-Lysergic speeds and I read what I have written.  A smile spans the entirety of my face.  I race down the stairs and began to read aloud the poem that had just come forth: \r\nTonight, I walk the stars again.\r\nWander my way past heaven.\r\nThroughout the skies and outerspace,\r\nI step up to my lonely place.\r\nAgainst the laws, and deep within,\r\nI parlay into that wonderful sin.\r\nWhere truths are false, \r\nAnd false is true.\r\nAnd no one knows but you.\r\nWhere colors change and eyes will shift\r\nand you can watch continents drift\r\nI think, 'But is it real?'\r\nI scream, 'It seems so real!'\r\nMy tongue burning from dots before,\r\nBut I cannot taste it anymore.\r\nWe think. We feel. We breathe.\r\nWe lie awake and seethe.\r\nCan we feel it changing us?\r\nDoes it tear in half our minds' axis?\r\nThen our mouth and minds dissolve,\r\nCrying and flying and feelings resolve.\r\nPurer thoughts and clean absolve.\r\nDrive us to the point that we evolve.\r\nAnd then faces change, one by one,\r\nTo the father, the spirit, his only son.\r\n'It is a religion,' Timothy had said.\r\nAnd now the sky turns red, and walls have bled.\r\nEmily tells us, 'It is a cleaver of the mind,'\r\nSomething that excels beyond this grand design,\r\nThrough a dot, a plane, a space, then time.\r\nLet me be the first to welcome you,\r\nTo a non-linear dimension, friend.\r\nWith this one tiny droplet I can send\r\nA man to his furthest depths.\r\nAnd he will come back again.\r\nThrough the fire sermon, a game of chess,\r\nAnd a burial of the dead,\r\nOne can split in two halves, a thought in their own head.\r\n'We should listen to what the thunder said,'\r\nThomas Stearns had told us.\r\nSo the spinning ends, the light is real once more.\r\nWe can no longer see our music as we could before.\r\nAnd although we still may feel it, we still may know\r\nWe still may never discover how deep feelings can go. \r\nI hear the approval come from the two members of my audience, and a deafening applaud by the poets who had offered me the means to say exactly how I had felt for so long.  I bowed to them; they ought not bow to me.\r\nI slept hard that night with vivid, pleasant dreams, because I guess that LSD-25 is the stuff that dreams are made of.\n\n\n"
