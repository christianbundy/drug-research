 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION<br>Description of subject, the writer.<br>Subject: Male, age 30'ish, weight 80kg, height 1.78cm<br>Health:  Good physical health, hayfever, asthma.<br>Mental:  Diagnosed ADHD-PI<br>Medication taken two days earlier: 100mg valium, 8mg xanax.<br>Medication taken same day: 10mg Lexapro, bronchodilator, antihistamine.<br>Harm-reduction disclaimer<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I felt obliged to note the excessive intake of valium and xanax I took two days earlier since half-life of benzos can be quite long and I don't know if it affects MDPV.<br>Now for the MDPV, this is really important to take note of. I have read lots of reports of inability to stop redosing MDPV, fiendish! Be warned that this seems to be the standard with MDPV and a harsh come-down.<br>However I did not at any time feel any urge to redose at any time after initial dose. Neither did I experience any comedown or crash, instead just such a slow comedown to baseline I didn't notice it. Whether it was depending on the combination of Lexapro, my mood and mindset or setting, further trials will tell if any.<br>==============================================================================<br>Description of situation before intake of substance:<br>Mindset: Just home from weekend at countryside house. Peaceful and curious.<br>Setting: Home alone. I have had a full nights sleep and fully rested, and in a neutral mood and had a medium meal at 15 o clock.<br>-------------------------------------------<br>The text is written in real-time, and I tried to edit as little as possible to show the change of mind and whatever. However I had to edit away rather large stories as my mind wandered to other things in this same document as sleepyness and focus on the report was lost.<br>Description of the substance<br>----------------------------<br>Container is ca 3x2 inch ziplock brand RIPPIE, with a white label. Label has black text MPDV 500mg left side, and to right black square marking with three smaller squares upper left, lower left, upper right.<br>The contents are a white salt, a bit chunky. Smells faintly citrus. Taste is chemical but not nasty. It solves in water with some effort. Snorting it is painless.<br>Description and timeline of the MDPV<br>------------------------------------<br>18.00  \t30mg of MDPV is taken nasal and 30mg MDPV orally solved in water.<br>\tUnknown amount of snuff tobacco is consumed.<br>18:05 \tNon-placebo obscure active substance in bloodstream.<br>18:15 \tA weak stimulating body and head buzz.<br>18:30 \tNegatives:<br>\tMinor jaw-tension. <br>\tInvoluntary movement of tounge and lips when not focusing.<br>\tThis would be a chewing gum moment in social setting.<br>\tIncreased pulse.<br>\tHands tremble a bit, though barely noticable.<br>\tTiny tactile and balance loss, which I suppose would go unnoticed.<br>18:40\tBodyload a chilled out stoned stimulation.<br>\tThoughts and memory becoming light, mindfulness and peace.<br>18:50\tEyes are still like baseline, there is zero dilation of pupils.<br>\tAbove mentioned side-effects remain.<br>\tPositive effects have remained a plateau since 18:30.<br>19:00   Breathing has grown a bit more shallow but no issue.<br>\tTHe head sensations has spread, and is felt all over head, <br>\tprimarily at frontal cortex and temples.<br>19:20\tWhat is not:<br>\tSpeed, activation, euphoria, cns-stimulation, sexual arrousal, <br>\tsocial enhancement, ego-boost, and hyperactivity.<br>\tWhat is:\t<br>\tRelaxation, a calm mix of stony body/mind stimulation, mindfulness.<br>\tThe content of being is a sanctuary from impressions.<br>\tEverything just is but no name for any of that.<br>\tRelease of naming, release of words and knowledge of anything.<br>\tThe mind feels a bit like how I imagine being 2-3 years old.<br>19:30\tTaking a pause for now in noting.<br>\tI lie down in sofa and enjoy listening to the wind from the window. put on Beethoven's seventh, which I normally can't listen because the beauty overwhelms me.<br>\tHow will it affect me now?<br>20:00\tThe music is passing through me without many emotions.<br>\tMusic appreciation is not heightened, but rather disturbing my bliss.<br>\tbut it activates me for what to do next.<br>21:00\tI am now having a discussion on the net with a friend.<br>\tShe tell me I am writing a lot and inspired. <br>\tI have no problem of changing subject and being apprehensive of her,<br>\tbut only after she mentioned my intense writing.<br>\tThis means I am entering a speedy phase of mind certainly although<br>\tI didn't notice. Now the bodyload has lessened also.<br>21:30\tActivation and speedy mind now. Communicating is important. <br>\tKeeping focus on writing this report is decreased.<br>\tInteresting note, I am feeling a betterment in my ADHD.<br>\tI can focus better, switch focus between things without stress,<br>\tand I do not feel the constant wornout mental feeling.<br>22:20\tI am listening to Shakti. The speediness has lessened to a more<br>\tnormal state. I feel normal actually. <br>\tMentally I feel somewhat like when I were on Ritalin without<br>\tthe nasty nausea I would get from it.<br>\tI am not feeling any urge to redose which is odd, considering this<br>\thas been reported. <br>\tI have yet to experience any comedown and what it is like.<br>\tI am very hesitant to say this is good for ADHD even though I<br>\tpresently get this feeling - I know it is only a temporary high.<br>\tThe problem is firstly the effect now is different from 2 hours ago.<br>\tNow the bodyload has disappeared and feeling rather sleepy peripherally. Head is still stimulated but in a less speedy way. In a almost natural awakened way, if I may say so since I don't know \thow it is for normal people. I feel awake now, but thoughts are not racing.<br>23:00\tI have got some rather good things done during the evening.<br>\tI wrote a poster with reminders for making budget which is a constant<br>\tproblem for me, and also a mental reminder how to handle medications<br>\tand drugs in a way which works for me to not get addicted or abusing. <br>\tPosted it on the wall for everyday reading in the morning.<br>01:50   A very creative state of mind during the last three hours.<br>\tLoosing attention for this writing and enjoying texting online with<br>\tfriends. I got a very clear mind for expressing some important issues<br>\twith a person who I found share some different experiences of reality <br>\twhich is very lonely to have nobody share with. I appreciated it very <br>\tmuch. Focus is lost for writing more on the report in realtime, I am<br>\tenjoying texting with friends and my stoned attention is still<br>\tspinning with many ideas. Bodyload is gone and just tiredness.<br>05:00\tOh well, very sleepy.. The last six hours just passed like a breeze, <br>\tcan't believe it. Still having a alert head, but sleepy body. <br>\tThis is sure a long acting substance.<br>06:00\tBack to baseline I think. What is now is the beyond sleepyness where I \tcan get a false wakeful alertness, and refuse to go to bed although I know I would fall asleep in minutes and really need it and instead doing obsessive compulsive things. I am wary of going into a trance-like state which happen to me when underslept underfed and when the dopamine floods. <br>08:00\tI wrote a story of an life changing experience I had one year ago,<br>\tthat I always wanted to get down on paper to a texting friend on the net. <br>\tI am reminded by a person on the net to sleep now, and take the advice <br>\tbefore I enter zombie-state. I have forgotten to eat properly.<br>\tWater as needed. Sleepy time now.<br>10:00\tNo sleepy time yet, getting up now and then turning rolling in bed.<br>13:00\tI take a shower and do some business downtown. ADHD-confusion made worse by tiredness, noisy - crowded - ugly movement - aura of stress.<br>14:00\tI take my adhd-medication Modiodal [modafinil] 100mg.<br>15:00\tNow I am trying to sleep again, being pissed off so taking 2mg xanax, 20mg valium and 15mg zolpidem. but alas no sleep. I realized I should not have taken the Modiodal which actualy now is waking me up. \t<br>20:00\tI spend the rest of the evening playing online game and beeing buzzed<br>\ton valium coffee and xanax, and wondering if a lower dosage of MDPV<br>\tyields lower duration than 18 hours.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>SUMMARY OF MY PERSONAL TRIAL<br>Positives: \tvery slow comedown<br>\t\tno redosing-urge<br>\t\tno euphoria<br>\t\tmellow stimulation <br>\t\tnone to minor pupil dilation depending on dosage.<br>Negatives: \tjaw-tension<br>\t\twiggling lizards tounge<br>\t\tanorectic<br>\t\tdouble vision on high dosage/going long time<br>Neutral:   \tKept me awake for extremely long time.<br>\t\tHad many different long plateaus of varying effects<br>duration:  \t18 hours total including ultra slow comedown.<br>Combination: \t10mg Lexapro (SSRI)<br>Tolerance-build: To find out<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>POSSIBLE USES I THOUGHT OF AFTER FIRST TRIAL<br>Medicational uses:<br>* If taken in early morning in low dosage could potentialy be trialed for surrogate adhd-medication for emergency or very occasional energizer.<br>* I strongly would disagree trying to take this DAILY as surrogate adhd-medication or energizer because finding a correct dosing that doesn't build tolerance I suspect would be very troublesome and also given the generally accepted FIENDISHNESS which I however did not experience. Not to mention reaching a steady state with eye-balling or even a scale with 1-2mg diff would be impossible.<br>Best usages in my opinion:<br>* I strongly would like try a whole day at a carnival, hanging out with friends talking philosophical or rubbish topics would be proper, festival, or just relaxing a sunny day in the park would be nice. <br>* A creative tool for a fine day of painting or writing or whatever artform. The plateaus of different effects make it both a peculiar and entertaining unreliable source for varying unexpectedness in creative outbursts! AND DO NOT BRING A BAG TO AVOID REDOSING.\n\n\n"
