At the time of this experience, I was a regular cannabis user, had taken psilocybin mushrooms a handful of times and had dabbled with pills (tramadol, antidepressants, etc.) I decided I wanted to try something a little different and had been researching some possible substances I could experiment with without having to go to a lot of trouble to find or pay for them. I found out about coleus and did a little research and found that while most people seem to have success using fresh leaves, a few people claim to have had psychedelic experiences after smoking dried coleus leaves. I was skeptical, but I decided it was worth a try.  <br><br>
I bought a packet of Coleus Blumei seeds and planted maybe a dozen of them in 4 large flower pots. Only 4 came up, but they all survived and developed rapidly. After they had grown to a height of about 1 foot each I picked about a dozen large leaves from the 4 plants which I then placed them under a hot lamp in my room to dry. It took a day or two, but once they were dry, I crushed them up into little flakes and put them in a baggie.  <br><br>
I was eager to see if they would have any effect, so that night, I packed a large bowl of the dried coleus leaves and went out to my barn to smoke them. I took about 3 or 4 large hits. The smoke was pretty harsh but not unbearably so and it had a distinctive taste. After about the second hit I was feeling a slight body buzz. I guess I could compare it to smoking mids but without the mental effects. I remember sitting there, feeling very comfortable and enjoying the view of the light coming from my house that was filtering through the cracks between the siding boards of my barn. I guess I sat there for maybe 5 minutes and then made my way back to my house. I remember feeling very happy about myself and the state that I was in. It was in no way intense but it was still enjoyable. One particular thing I remember from the walk back to my house was that I looked at a car parked in my driveway and it seemed strangely elongated. I remember thinking 'wow, this stuff really works!' I went inside and directly to my bathroom to see if my pupils were dilated or anything looked out of the ordinary.  I looked in the mirror and to my surprise, I couldn't even see my pupils! It was like my entire eye was brown. I'm not sure if it was just a trick of the light or something to do with the Coleus.  <br><br>
By the time I was back in my room putting my paraphernalia away, the effects had all but worn off. However, that night I remember having very vivid dreams, which was strange because at the time I always smoked a bowl of cannabis before going to bed and I almost never remember any dreams when I go to bed stoned, but this night was different.  <br><br>
Overall, I would say it was a very pleasant experience and I have smoked coleus multiple times since this experience. The effects have never been as profound as the first time, but it's still fun. I think a someone who doesn't smoke cannabis regularly would get a lot more out of the experience.  <br><br>
A few additional notes. First, every time I smoke Coleus within a few hours of when I go to bed, I seem to have vivid dreams, making me think Coleus has a dream-enhancing effect.  Second, as far as preparation goes, here's an easier way to dry the leaves.  Just cut as many leaves off of the plants as you want, but remove as much stem as you can, as this takes a lot longer to dry than the actual leaf. Then lay the leaves out on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven at a low temperature (I used 150 F) and keep a close eye on them. Once they start shriveling up, check them, and keep checking them until the leaves crinkle and break. Now they are ready! Also, I smoked dried coleus leaves with two friends of mine and one of my friends said he definitely felt the effects while my other friend said he felt next to nothing, so it's possible that Coleus only affects certain people.<!-- End Body -->
