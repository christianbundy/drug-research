 "report": "\n\n\n\n[Erowid Note: The author of this report erroneously refers to Benadryl as dimenhydrinate.]\r\nT:00 \r\nI ingest 18 Benadryl 25mg Dimenhydrinate + 30mg sublingual of codeine for a little mellowness.  Totally empty stomach\r\nT:05 \r\nPut on Nirvana-Nevermind, which usually puts me in a good mood. I heard dmhyd makes music sound different in a weird sort of way.  \r\nT:10 \r\nFeel a bit sleepy, It's already around my bedtime anyway.  I decided to do it around when I was tired, since I didn't want to take it during the day, only to fall asleep during the middle of the day and screw up my sleeping schedule.\r\nT:15 \r\nFeeling a little more sleepy.  I already feel the subtle effects of codeine, sort of warm feelings.  I can almost feel the benadryl digesting now, it will probably be coming on soon.\r\nT:20 \r\nI grab a pepsi and start drinking it.  The music I'm listening to seems a little more hollow. I feel a slight euphoria, a little light-headed and sort of warm.  Probably just the codeine again.\r\nT:25 \r\nFeeling fuzzy headed.  Sort of dizzy now and heavy. More tired.\r\nT:30  \r\nFeel very blank headed, my thought process is very slow now.  Very off-kilter.  The sleepiness is getting worse.  Time seems to be going slower.\r\nT:35 \r\nTime is going by VERY SLOWLY now.  1 minute feels like 20 minutes now.  Feeling a new sort of euphoria rising, a very small body high, and it doesn't feel like the codeine this time. The pepsi is becoming tasteless and my tongue is moving very slowly.\r\nT:40 \r\nNothing new.  Just even more sleepy.  \r\nT:45 \r\nI have been sitting down the whole time, so I decided to walk around and see how it is.  Very heavy legs and arms.  Getting harder to type and think.  Stomach feeling sort of queasy.  A little more euphoria, I can definitely tell its not the Codeine.\r\nT:50  \r\nTaste buds are almost totally gone.  Really tired and out of it, don't know if I can continue documenting  OMG saw my first hallucinotgetic.  A flash of green on the wall for about a second.  It's getting hard to swallow.\r\nT:55  \r\nSo sleeepyy.  Very mindless.  Might fall asleep.  \r\nT:60 \r\nFeeling very fucking woozy, very tired.  A little hard to breathe now, but nothing serious.  \r\nT:65  \r\nAlmost nodded off.  No hallucinations yet except for that green flash awhile back.\r\nT:70 \r\nStill NOTHING!  I thought this would be enough time for it to kick into effect of a deleriant.\r\nT:80 \r\nIngested a 12 pack of 25mg, bringing my total too 750mg now.  I thought maybe the dose I took wasn't enough for the deleriant experiance.\r\nT:85 \r\nSleepiness has seemed to pass.  Getting more of a buzz at least.  Almost like Codeine, but a lot weaker. Thank god.  I have to wait another half an hour to see if I get some hallucinations. \r\nT:90 \r\nNothing has changed.  I'm really surprised that I didn't fall asleep.  I usually fall asleep with a half of a Benadryl.\r\nT:95 \r\nI'm surprised, but I'm getting a little more euphoria.  It feels like I took about 60-80 mg of codeine.  A warmness in my body is evident when I move around.  Feels good, but a little less pronounced than opiates.\r\nT:100 \r\nEven more opiate like euphoria.  Man I should definitely mix this with a lot of codeine next time.  As I'm writing this, I am now feeling rushes of warmth.  It couldn't of been brought up by the codeine i had earlier because I never got this kind of a buzz off 30 mg of codeine.  \r\nT:105 \r\nStill no hallucinations.  I'm defintely really fucking out of it right now.  I'm hoping to see a nude woman pop out of nowhere lol.  I was laughing at that for 3 minutes straight.  Feeling a little crazy.  \r\nT:110  \r\nVery dissapointed now.  It's not working.  And wow, I swear this euphoria is pretty good.  Uh oh, as I'm typing this i'm goin insanae.  My mind is turning into a fuzz and mixing stuff up.  \r\nT:115  \r\nNot talking like myself any more.  There seems to be milli-second of time between when I say something, and when gets out.  Its really funny to talk.  Very hollow sounding. \r\nT:120  \r\nI am WAYYY fucked up right now.  Saying weird things and doing them.  Almost no control over what I say or do.   \r\nT:125  \r\nI said lemon round pie is a pie (talking to my self) and some other phrase.  For no reason.  Oh my god, I can barely write any more, I'm in a daze of stupor.  \r\nT:130 \r\nMy mind is gone right now.  Not thinking at all.  \r\nT:135 \r\nEvery television show is sort of warping into another.  I'm losing it. I popped a 10 mg dose of valium, because I'm very ansty and don't want a bad trip\r\nLost track of time.  I am messed completely.  Its like getting piss drunk.  I'll continue with my experiences:\r\nIf I lay back, I will instantly drift out and sleep.  And I just thought that this notepad document I wrote it on was a goddam webpage, how strange.\r\nNow I'm fading in and out over and over again.  My body still has a glow.  \r\nI think I heard an audio illusion from somewhere, hmm probably not.  \r\nMy stomach is queasy, and time is passing by REALLY SLOW!  I think slower than marijuana.  I can barely cmmunicate here.  I am so out of it.  I'm wat\r\nDMX - which company makes the d   \r\n(note I edited everything but this last sentence before posting it, just to show how messed up I was at the end.  I spelled a lot of words incorrectly and my grammar was off, but at the end nothing made sense.)\r\nAfter I woke up I still had the hollow voice sound and the general Benadryl hangover.  Its a very depressing one at that.\n\n\n"
