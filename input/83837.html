Well, I developed some interest in legal (europe) ketones lately, which got reinforced by one unearthly euphoric experience on mephedrone (4-mmc). After concluding that further experiments would definitely lead into addiction, I sought for ketone-MDxx-analogs.<br><br>
So there came bk-MBDB which was said to be the ingredient of Mitseez-Party-Pills. They contain two caps for a reasonable price. So I dropped both and knew 10 mins later, that something profound was coming on. An hour later there I was, an euphoric buildup with psychedelic thought-patterns which lead to horrible crash bordering on a panic attack mixed with psychotic depression. Then it would settle, just to start over again from an euphoric introspective experience to utter hell. This was going on for 5 hours and for another one with declining highs and lows. Body was very sore after that, despite taking care of it. Next day was fine.<br><br>
Ok, my setting wasn't that great but still this was way more despair then on a bad trip on psychedelics. The panic attacks ruined an experience which was very worthwhile in between, as I worked on my setting during the good periods of the drug. It reassured me on the path I was choosing and felt like strengthening  my ego in a healthy way. <br><br>
Other people (say 20~50%) reported panic attacks or dysphoria for bk-MBDB (butylone) and mitseez, and subsequently equalize them. Others, on the other hand, reported great experiences - Hit and miss-<br><br>
good luck<!-- End Body -->
