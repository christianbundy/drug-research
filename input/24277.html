Didnt know I was going to do this today, its kind of a spur of the moment thing, but I really havent eaten anything all day. Mood earlier was mildly negative because of issues at school, but over the past week Ive been unusually positive. No other substances besides a bit of caffeine have been ingested by me over the course of the last 3 or 4 days.<br><br>
T+0:00 had previously dissolved the entirety of the original '1000 mg methylone' in 190 proof grain alcohol for dosing @ 10mg/ml, took 13 mls, roughly 130mgs, combined with a nearly equal volume of water. Tastes kinda vannilla-y, nothing like the nasty sassy taste of e.<br><br>
T+0:20 im starting to feel something now, getting the deep breath inducement similar to e, and a slight bit of loquaciousness...<br><br>
T+0:24 very slight dizziness and a definite +1 so far. Burps starting to come up, reminiscent of e again. And of course, the natural wittiness, wordplay, and humor I find myself able to access on that substance is now on tap.<br><br>
T+0:30 feel like I gotta empty my bowels. So far, practically indistinguishable from mdma. No yawning, but I expect thatll come.<br><br>
T+0:40 turned on some lords of acid. I believe the technical term for what im feeling is 'hot damn!' elevated heart rate, and my eyes feel like they want to nystagmus but arent ready yet. Stomach queasiness.<br><br>
T+1:00 it seemed like I was well on my way to a +2 or +3, but it just kinda stopped short. Perhaps I didnt take enough. Starting to get jaw clenchings.<br><br>
T+1:13 nystagmus. Houston, we have ignition.<br><br>
T+1:33 dosed extra ~25mgs or so I had sitting out to evaporate off the ethanol. It hasnt gotten quite to where I wanted to go, but the journey is fucking great anyways. This time I ate the powder from just under 3 mls that had been evaporated on a watch glass, and boy did it taste nasty.<br><br>
T+2:30 took a walk. Things are good. Feeling a little bit isolated, but im just gonna chalk it up to the fact that im alone. If I werent comfortable being as such I might begin to have problems. Took another ~30 mgs because that 25 didnt do a goddamn thing to me after the first 15 minutes or so.<br><br>
T+3:00 nearing baseline. The really interesting thing about this stuff is that I havent had any memory fuckups yet. Those are the things I absolutely cannot stand about mdma, and why I now take it so infrequently (last time I did was a year ago), this in and of itself makes this material worthy of more research. Just based on duration though (and maybe im wrong about this, or just didnt take a large enough initial dose, it seems a bit more like mdea than mdma. Ymmv, iana licensed pharmacologist, etc.<br><br>
T+3:30 baseline, perhaps slightly lower. Music is slightly dissonant, I can take it or leave it. Still got the jaw clenches. Tired, I think I'll go to bed soon, hopefully I can sleep.<br><br>
It occurs to me now, at t+3:40, that dissolving it in ethanol may have actually turned some of it into the cathinone analogue of mdea <i>in vivo</i>, as im under the impression that that's been known to happen in the case of actual mdma as well. Next time I'll evaporate it off first. This, however, is possibly a decent method of reducing the duration of substances similar to mdma (methylone or mbdb, for instance) for first-timers, or those who want the cliff's notes for a similar substance, so to speak. I'm kinda glad it happened this way, since I have a test on friday and wanted to be able to actually get some sleep tonight. Its actually lingering in my brain a little bit now, coming and going, but the bulk of its effects have faded - it got up to about a +2 there I guess, though the sudden plateau threw me for a loop. Thats what I get for basing my expectations on mdma.<br><br>
Anyways, those are my musings. Hopefully they help someone. Stay safe.<!-- End Body -->
