 "report": "<p>All my life I have been troubled with insomnia (I cant fuckin sleep) anyways my doctor prescribed me Clonidine. So one night I felt like getting fucked up. So I decided to take more then I should. I usually take about 1-2 but decided to take 8. It was a very awesome experience. I was laying in my bed when all of a sudden it felt like I was sailing on the high seas. Up and down I went for quite some. Also I got very light headed this lasted for who knows how long until I finally passed out. as I woke up I felt fine but when I stood up I got the biggest head rush of my life.</p>"
