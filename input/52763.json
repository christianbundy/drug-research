 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI am an experienced salvia smoker and have enjoyed its effects for a few years. I have used 60x salvia extract, LSD, Shrooms, and DxM and this past spring break I was very confident that I had total control over salvia. I was wrong.\r\nSome friends and I had just woken up the morning after we had all tried exstacy for the first time. I had also been using cocaine and through all the not eating and not sleeping and binge drug using I was probably fairly low on seratonin. Well I pulled out some salvia (20x) that Id had for a while and packed a bowl. I sat down in a folding chair by the fire where about 13 of my friends had gathered and took the biggest salvia hit Ive ever taken, I was especially eager to get some sort of giggly normal salvia high because I was so low in spirits due to all of the cocaine and exstacy use. Exhaling was the last thing I remember and suddenly it felt as though some higher being had reached through some realm in a different reality and ripped me out of reality as we know it.\r\nA little voice was going on in my head telling me just how bad I'd screwed up and that I was never coming back. My whole body at once felt like it was being pulled through a cheese grater and I was completely convinced that everything that was happening was real. I wanted to cry but I couldnt and I had already forgotten I'd even smoked salvia. I felt as though I was part of some huge machine of life and was part of a rubix cube of reality, suddenly I felt half of my body split in half and completely believed that I was watching as half of my body was ripped away on part of this huge turning rubix cube making up the universe. I believed that my life was over and I would be stuck between realities forever. The sensation of being ripped in half happened because, as I later heard from my friends watching, after exhaling my eyes just rolled into the back of my head, my mouth dropped open, I became very stiff and fell straight backwards in the chair.\r\nAt this point in my trip I felt a flattening sensation and had the complete visual and physical feeling of being drug just under the reality my friends were in and every now and then I would catch a glimpse of my friend's face as he watched over me and gently coaxed me into coming back. My desire to be able to cross back into our world was the most intense longing desire Ive ever felt. I eventually came to on the ground and immediately once I could move again I slipped away to be alone for a while. I was very embarrased and shaken. It was the most intense and terrifying experience of my life, no shroom or acid trip has ever seemed as real as this was. I was completely unprepared for the experience and will never again take life for granted because of it.\n\n\n"
