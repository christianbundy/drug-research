The best thing about Kanna is that it makes me feel relaxed and elevated, but stimulated too. I decided to try it for those reasons and bought the powdered form in a small 5 gram packet. At first it seemed a bit expensive for a tiny bag until I realised I don't need very much at all to get a good effect.<br><br>
Some people like to smoke it but as a non-smoker that option was out for me. So instead I tried just taking a small bit of powder on a spoon (approx 1/4 gram) with a drink. This wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I felt a little bit elevated, but nothing to write home about. Taking more didn't help either. <br><br>
I forgot about it for a few days and then decided to try again. I'd read that keeping the powder on your tongue made the Kanna absorb better. Surprisingly this worked very well and I felt giddy and elevated while still relaxed and able to think properly. It tastes a bit like dry grass but not really unpleasant. <br><br>
This got me thinking that the body must not be able to digest Kanna properly to release its compounds. So after already being quite high and happy I used the same amount of powder in a cup with boiling water and let it steep for a few minutes. If you've ever tried green tea then you can understand the taste of it. Not exactly delicious but not at all bad. <br><br>
The effect was more than I expected. Almost straight away I began to feel a bit like I was tipsy from alcohol. I was very calm and happy with a giddy kind of energy, but still able to think and work on anything I wanted. This feeling continued for the rest of the night. I did some reading, played video games, and anything else just fine. The effects did get stronger for a bit but it was very controllable and smooth. <br><br>
I take Kanna now most days as a tea with a little sweetener. I focus perfectly well at university and work, and maybe even perform a little better without feeling any stress or anxiety. Before a night out with friends I drink a cup and find it mixes well with alcohol. I drink less alcohol since the effect is heightened and the extra stimulation is great for dancing and socialising. <br><br>
There are different types of powder you can buy. I always go for pure Kanna (Sceletium) leaf powder. The powder 'extracts' only contain some of the compounds from the Kanna and don't give me the best well rounded feeling. <br><br>
Definitely the best herb I've tried.<!-- End Body -->
