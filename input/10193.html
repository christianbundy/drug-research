When the cat's away, the mice like to play, and sometimes they like to try salvia divinorum as well, since curiosity can only be kept at bay for so long.<br><br>
So a mouse found some 5X extract at a nice shop and packed a bowlful in a glass pipe. The extract came with some instructions: 'First timers, please have a sitter. Use a water pipe. Take HUGE hits. Don't drive!' The mouse broke all the rules except driving. Good thing, too. <br><br>
Inhaled the bowl in two hits and held them in for as long as possible. Not too much, nothing much, then WOW. 'What IS this?' the mouse wonders, looking around in awe as the room doesn't change but is at the same time a new cartoon world. Deep gusts of laughter and glee, lasting for years. Shimmering worlds coming in to view and then petering out again.<br><br>
Then, the mouse is back at his computer. 'Wow' the mouse thinks, and just has to laugh. There are no words more suitable. Nothing compares. That night, the dreams are like reality. And so forth.<br><br>
But now, every time  the mouse tries salvia, nothing happens. That first time was the kiss from the Goddess, but she won't even look the mouse's way any more. What a shame. But the laughter was real, and good.<!-- End Body -->
