 "report": "<p>Previous experiences; DXM, DHP, Cannabis, Alcohol, Nitrous, Concerta, Vyvanse, Pseudoephedrine</p><p>I'll caveat by saying this was the generic, CVS-brand Sudafed that cost about 5 bucks for 36 caplets. Taking 5 10-mg caplets, the effects peaks at a sort of 'wide awake' state 2 hours after consuming, with a nice comedown. Not really a crash at all, then again; it doesn't get me high.</p><p>I've got a reasonable tolerance to pharms, but nothing that'd keep one from getting a legit high. I'm guesstimating here, but I took enough in theory to make this work like speed. It did NOT. </p><p>I've taken 10mg doses of pseudoephedrine before that were enough to keep me awake for 12 hours comfortably. It is therefore more cost-effective for a body high / comfortable stimulation (like a cup of morning coffee) to just buy real sudafed that contains pseudoephedrine. Wikipedia is right. Phenylephrine is a suckish placebo.</p>"
