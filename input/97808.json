 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt was a nice saturday afternoon around 4 o clock and I had some wild lettuce tincture and passion flower tincture. I mixed both in a little water and downed it.  The effects occured in about 20 minutes. The effect was medium and very pleasant, all of a sudden I felt giddy and euphoric. Around a minute later I felt num and floaty.  The entire thing lasted around 3 hours.  It was not a very physical buzz/high but it was great. No loss of memory or bad side effects just a little bit sleepy. No hangover effect when it ended just relaxed and calm. In general the whole thing was great and I found it to be a great combination of herbs.\n\n\n"
