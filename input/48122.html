I was prescribed Clonidine to assist falling asleep, about 6 years ago or so.  I remember the first time I took one, around 7 PM and I remember lying on the ground face first, just feeling all good.  My mom was sort of laughing at me.<br><br>
Im like 'ha....I feel goooood'<br><br>
I went from 0.1 mg,   to 2 x 0.1 (0.2)  then finally 3 (0.3)<br><br>
This medication was meant for short time use, to get my sleep schedule back on track. It was intended for 1-2 weeks use, to take early at night, say, 1-2 hours before a decent bed time. Well that didn't last very long, then I just ended up staying up late, and taking it to fall asleep because I couldn't without it (as easily)<br><br>
My sleep schedule is so outta whack, on days I don't have early classes, I just stay up the night before until pretty much 5-6 am, then sleep until class.<br><br>
On weekends forget about it, Ill be up all night especially being vacation.<br><br>
I was also taking Adderal or Dexedrine at the time or methylphenidate earlier in the day, so this sort of brought down the hyperness at night.<br><br>
Well, 7 years later, I took it on and off.  I'm still just naturally wired at night time.  Must have been a cat in a past life LOL.  I will be good at the night shift if I become a police officer. I ran out of clonidine, I would like some more.<br><br>
I currently take Clonazepam 1mg.  1mg is no longer effective at aiding in sleep, so it became 2.<br><br>
I find it hard to physically get out of my chair and go to bed even when my eyes are closing on me.<br><br>
I'm going to save this Clonazepam for certain social events (class presentations this semester and next), maybe a job interview, etc etc.<!-- End Body -->
