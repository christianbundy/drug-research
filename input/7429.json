 "report": "</p>\nOne would hope that readers are familiar with the cautionary requirements of dicking around with ones MOAI's in combination with centrally active compounds.</p><p>I've had my share of scare's... pumping veins and all. Personally I havn't found very many aplications for the betacarbolines that I continue to use aside from the traditional oral tryptamine (dmt, 5meo, dpt) huasca activation.  The one harmala combination that I have yet to try and would like too is mescaline. This combo makes sense, since a large amount of mescaline is usually required and it has been fairly widely reported as being a positive potentiation.  Combinations with mdma and other stimulating compounds seem quite ludicrous to me.</p><p>The obscure rue combinations known to me are: </p><p>with shrums: defintitely intense on the body at high dosage levels, qualitatively different trip.</p><p>with 2cb: heard several negative reports, too much physical activation/headache</p><p>with mescaline: many positives, a few neggies</p><p>with LSD: several positive reports.  provides a more earthy grounded feeling.</p><p>with DPT: works well huasca style, be very careful with the dosage. Comments from a friend: 'Instead of 100-200 mg oral only 30-80 are needed.</p><p>Also the oral DPT bodyload was greatly reduced.'</p><p>with 5meODMT: increases effects, some report worrisome physical symptoms</p><p>with Psilocybin: Many people report positive work with this, but can increase darkside and increase length, intensity, bodyload</p>"
