I got the anadenanthera seeds becuase it was the cheapest and seemingly most effective source of DMT available. I made the purchase via the internet and recieved the seeds along with some dagga and salvia relativly quickly. <br><br>
The first thing I tried to do with the seeds was crush them(unroasted) and smoke them with dagga as another person on this site has tried. From this I recieved a numbing in the legs and a pain in the ears that lasted half an hour. If I was smart I would have stoped there and never touch yopo again....but I was stupid.<br><br>
The second thing I did was put a few seeds in the toaster and cooked them until they poped....deshelled them...crushed them...and snorted them. This gave me the worst headache I ever had....and still nothing particulary psychoactive. <br>
ok....so now I became even stupider...<br><br>
I took five seeds and determined to get some dmt out of them I put them in the toaster for a much longer time period...the result was that I burned them and when deshelled the inside was brown and disgusting smelling. I figured I had ruined them and threw them out but not before eating (yes I ate it!) half a burnt seed. Then I felt I was begining to trip, but it was late so I went to bed. Everything was dancing and running through my mind and I couldn't sleep for at least an hour, at which point my mind was calm and empty.<br><br>
This inspired me to be even more stupid....very stupid indeed...today I woke up bright and early and cooked about 3 seeds in the toaster until they poped. Then I crushed them, put them back in the toaster until they were near that burning point, crushed some more....capsulated...and down the hatch! 10 minutes after I got ear pain, morphing objects, dancing colors and lights eminating from everything.<br><br>
30 minutes in there was PUKEING! My body obviously did not like ingesting yopo(probably why I am one of the only people dumb enough to try it) So then I look up from the toilet and it seems to change color...and suddenly it was no longer just a toilet...but the two white circles of an infinity symbol. This struck me deep and for some reason the entire yopo experiment seemed worth it then.<br><br>
I had barfed up what I thought was the entire lot of yopo ingested. Yes I know 'yopo' actually only refers to the snuff made from a relative of the colubrina but this plant has such a long ass name just insert the scientific name in wherever I type 'yopo'. Anyway I thought the trip would end there but I was wrong.<br><br>
I felt cold and wanted to lie down. I did. But whenever I closed my eyes there were colorful images. Not the usual fun type but fast things that jumped around in brain. So I opened my eyes and real objects seemed to do the same thing buzz rapidly in place. My fan moved and my ceiling would breathe up and down. Then I had to shit, yes shit. I went to the bathroom and found that I didnt flush after barfing (deffinatly not in my right mind) then when I tried to flush it didn't seem to work. These things happen in my house, so instead I went to the one downstairs.  Long story short I think yopo is a strong ass laxative.<br><br>
But anyway the light in that bathroom was pretty bright and due to the substance seemingly getting brighter. The floor was glowing and little lights danced through the patterns in the tile. Then a voice in my mind began to repeat 'let there be light'. I relized this world was only visible through reflecting light that reaced our eyes. Then suddenly the world seemed alot stranger...almost unatural...they looked exactly the same as they always looked but I noticed the immensly alien nature of how most normal mundane things looked. <br><br>
I was still cold and getting colder so I went outside in the sun. As weird as everything in my house looked everything outside looked all the more normal. I laid in the grass in the sun and began to rediscover nature as I had when I was very small.<br>
Back inside the voice came back. I had come looking for answers and I knew that the yopo had buried them within me...the voice told me never to do any psychadellics again as I would never need them again.<br><br>
The trip lasted 2 hrs on the dot. But now after it I feel completely at peace. I think it was all worth it and I doubt I will never be the same. Deffinately not a recreational drug....IT IS NOT FUN!!! but at the same time it is a serious and worthy teacher.<!-- End Body -->
