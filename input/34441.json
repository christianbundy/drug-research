 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nId like to start off by mentioning that I have ADD/ADHD, so I get this stuff perscription. Well, actaully the Dex is my bro's, but its the same shit, no one really notices when I take some of either.  I have also lost a father and very cool friend involving an addiction to Methamphetamine, and some other family members are still hooked, so I guess addiction 'runs in my family'. \r\nSo there I stood, the medicine box before me. I had thought I of all people would be the last to fall to these depths, but tonight was not the night to huddle with principles. No, tonight I would dance with devil. I think I took the 2 54mg Concerta at around 11pm-ish, but I immediately felt sorta stupid, cause I had intended to try insuffilating them, but had forgotten and just popped them down the old throat. So I decided I would send something else straight to the big bowl of noodles. So I got 2 10mg Dex pills, and was sort of amused, because all I had to do was pull on either end, and they came apart.\r\nBut I found out later that I would have been MUCH smarter to grind the little thingys that were inside into powder. I snorted 20mg worth, then the drip came. It sucked pretty bad, and I downed about a quarter gallon of water to get rid of the putrid taste and texture of the mucus with tiny balls falling down my throat. I even brought the jug of water into the bathroom when ever I went.\r\nSome time later after the drip stopped, I felt wired, I mean Tweaked! It was actaully pretty cool, ever since the doc had lowered my dosage for concerta from 54mg to 36mg every morning, I noticed that I was not very easily at all able to stay up for days on end as I had lovingly become accustomed to. Now I was back to my beautiful night owl self. The most notable effect I observed was the awesome distortion of time. Luckily, I like night time alot, so I quite enjoyed the wonderful effect.\r\nI found that I would look at my clock, then do whatever, then, seemingly hours later, I would look at the clock, and was both amazed and confuzed to find that only a few minutes had passed!! It seems almost as if some magic has granted me all the time I could want! Tasks that would have otherwise taken about 3 hours, would turn out to take like 10 minutes. I found I could fully enjoy my hours of darkness, and do everything I wanted, and time was no object.\r\nBut that was just the beginning. You have not lived until you have 'slept' on this stuff. I decided to lay down, because it was relaxing (and about 4:30AM!) and found that I could not only lay down and close my eyes, but also allow myself to sort of 'let go' the way I do when I go to sleep, but then, I could simply open my eyes, and be perfectly awake. I did this sort of 'On/Off' thing many times, and was in utter ecstasy after realizing I could 'sleep' without losing 'consciousness.' Sort of like being able to fall into the pit of sleep but have a rope to climb instantly back up into my full alert state. I found everytime I would close my eyes and let myself drift for 'hours' of lucious 'sleep', with full dreaming and everything, I could instantly choose to hop back into my awake mode, and I would check the clock, and still be amazed at how only about 2 minutes had passed each time.\r\nI knew my brother leaves for school at 6:30, and I have to leave a while before 8. I could have sworn each time I would 'unpause', because on this shit, sleep is more like just pausing time, he would be leaving for school. I thought he left for school about 5 times, it was amusing. But the thing I liked most, was the fact that usually if I have to leave at 8, and its 6:45, I better wake my ass up, but I had found that I could just drift off still, and never have to worry about time at all. In fact, it was about a few minutes before 8 that I arose, and found that I was still ready in time.\r\nI went to school, and really felt like I was tweaking, I mean seriousley too, and I kept it up by taking another 20mg of Dex, and then yet another 40mg more later. I didnt sleep the next night either, btw.\r\nSince then, I have used Methylphenidate(Concerta) in dosages of 108mg whenever I desire to stay awake past my 'limit', and twice smoked Methamphetamine (snorted a tiny bit both times as well). A sort of ironic thing was, neither of my experiences with Meth ever came close to this single experience. I find that the Concerta doesnt quite reproduce all these same effects by itself, but I plan to try them both in combination again, and just Dex by itself, for fun, to stay amped, and to experiment.\n\n\n"
