It was Saturday 10.30 pm that I dropped one ecstasy pill. Not really unusual anymore, since Ive been taking either base-amphetamine and/or ecstasy every weekend for over 2 monthsbut the experience that followed has still shaken me, even now as I type this, 9.00 pm Sunday evening.<br><br>
Let me tell you about the mindset first. Flashback to Friday night. I scored some base-amphetamine, and got one pill. I saved the pill, did some of the base, drank a lot of beer, had some hash.<br><br>
Saturday afternoon, I woke up, felt quite ill, and a little spaced out. But not too bad. Was worth it. However, as the evening drew closer I began to feel a little exhausted, and a little paranoid (probably the a comedown from the base). I was round my best mate, Matts house. My other mates went home, and the night looked dead already. I was annoyed because I still had my pill and a decent amount of base left.<br><br>
But eventually me and Matt decided with nothing better to do, wed go to a this guy called Bens house. The plan was to just go there, get stoned in his room, and just chill and have a quiet night. When we got to Bens I was still in a bit of a bad mood because I wouldnt be taking my pill and my base, not too mention pretty tired, groggy, and a bit spaced-out. But I just shrugged it off, it wasnt terribly bad or anything.<br><br>
So, we got there about 9-ish, met Ben his mate, Nipper, and also Greg. We started smoking some bongs, etc.<br><br>
Then another guy called Ed turns up, we continue smoking hash for a bit, then Ben and Nipper announce they have some pills, and intend on dropping them this night. I had my base and my one pill on me, so I thought what the hell, might as well drop with them later. Ed was also up for it, so Ben sold him one. Matt doesnt approve of ecstasy, so he wasnt interested, and announced he was going home at about 11.00 pm. Now this, for some reason really, really got to me. I was really pissed off deep down because Matt hadnt really stayed out past 11.00pm for well over a month. I began to think how boring he was, and how all he ever did was stay in all the time smoking weed. By this time, I was pretty stoned, and my thoughts became more and more like this. But I contained it.<br><br>
At about 10.00pm we all go out and Ed, Nipper , Ben and myself drop the pills at about 10.30pm. I follow this with a small line of base. This is where it started to turn sour.<br><br>
Physically I felt fine, I wasnt tired anymore, I was quite alert, quite awake. But when Matt asked is he could gum some of my base , something just sort of snapped in my head. I told him gumming was a shit way to do base, and did fuck all with the pathetically small doses (like 2mg!) that he took. I said it in a subtle way however, masking my real thoughts. I offered him a line, and told him he could stay out if he did a line, because it would keep him awake. He refused, and just went back to smoking hash. I figured, fuck it, Ill be up soon anyway on the pill.<br><br>
At about 11.15 pm we all went into town to get some food. Now, pay attention, this is where it gets bad. On the way, I felt the rush from the pill. The buzzing in the back of the head, the increased sense etc. But the euphoria was virtually non-existent. I only felt slightly more happier. Walking through town was terrible. I felt extremely paranoid, anxious, nervous, and very, very sketchy. We went to a fast-food place, I was so paranoid I couldnt buy anything. I just sat at the table feeling really paranoid , people were getting very aggressive outside, it was noisy, lots of drunk people looking for fights. By this time its about 11.45 pm.<br><br>
Matt and Greg go home, but I was just too paranoid to go home, so I decide to stay out and hope the pill will get better, and snort some base. But it got worseIt was freezing now, and I felt so paranoid, I thought Ben, Ed and Nipper hated me, so I spoke very little, which gradually got me even more paranoid.<br><br>
Eventually we decided to go back to Bens at about 12.45 am. When we got there I felt slightly calmer, but still felt very anxious and nervous.<br><br>
I shared the rest of my base, and started to talk a little bit more. But after about 15 minutes I began getting paranoid again. From about 1.30 am onwards, we got through a hell of a lot of hash. I spoke very little, my thoughts were paranoid, bizarre, and my mind raced. I remember thinking all night about each of my friends in my home-town. I remember thinking that all of them hated me, and I thought up reasons why each one hated me.<br><br>
But the worst feeling I had was the feeling that I just didnt belong anywhere in this world, even the universe, and I was a mistake in society (I know this may sound weird but how I felt is so difficult to put into words). When I finally got the guts to leave Bens house (about 3.30a.m), I ran all the way home. I dont remember much more, apart from feeling sick when I got home.<br><br>
This morning (Sunday), I woke up, and felt very depressed. More so than my usual comedown. I still do feel very depressed now, I also (still) feel quite paranoid too. Im starting to think some of the things I thought last night made sense. I keep asking myself, what if my friends really dont like me?<br><br>
This is my first bad experience with any amphetamine, but it really has made me think seriously about my amphetamine use. Something went seriously wrong with my head yesterday, and Im still not sure what exactly caused it, which scares me. Im not sure if its the fact Ive been doing base and ecstasy for every weekend for the past couple of months, but Im sure that is not helping matters. My friend Joe (whos much more experienced than myself) said to me today I probably need a break, and sounded a bit concerned. So, Im going to give it a rest for a couple of weeks, see how I feel.<br><br>
I just want to finish by saying a couple of things:<br><br>
Firstly, ecstasy and other amphetamines (e.g.base) are hyped-up to be these crazy drugs (mainly by the media) that bring on effects whatever the mood, mindset, whereabouts etc. This is not the case.<br><br>
Dont get me wrong , ecstasy is a strong drug, as is base, but it very much depends on your mindset, and overall mental health etc. They arent as crazy as youd think, they can be more subtle, which leads to people over-doing it because they expect more due to the hype. I have to be really careful, the effects arent always that obvious. I think Ive fallen into that trap, gradually Ive become completely different; I listen to completely different music, I see things from a different perspective, and now I think its getting to me. Ive finally stopped to consider this (and my weight, Im looking increasingly thin), and now Im not too sure about ecstasy or base anymore.<br><br>
Ive had some great times on amphetamines, but I think now maybe the honeymoon is over<!-- End Body -->
