If I were to go on in detail, this would be a novel-length report. But for the folks just wanting to know about high dosages of 2c-i, i'll keep it short.<br><br>
I'm by no means a psychedelic amature. I've run the entire gamut: LSD, Mesacline, Mushrooms, DMT, numerous research chemicals, and various dissociatives, so i wasn't going blindly into this excursion. I've lost count of how many times i've done 2c-i. At least 75.<br><br>
My tolerance for 2c-i at the time of this experience was nonexistant, as this was the first time i'd done it in over a year. I drank 100mg in a glass of soda, and began feeling my first alert 15 minutes later, which is strange because i usually have to wait 30-45 minutes. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 100 mgs of 2C-I is considered an extremely high dose, see 2C-I Dose Chart]</font><br><br>
I go rent the movie Yellow Submarine. Feel extremely nauseated. After only 30 minutes trip is already passing the intensity of a 20mg dose. Visuals and Mindset somewhat similar to mescaline, with a strong amphetamine flavor.<br><br>
After 45 minutes visuals are extremely intense, walking difficult. Start watching Yellow Submarine.<br><br>
The movie is ridiculous. Time becomes meaningless, the movie becomes one with the physical world.<br><br>
I'm unsure of when, but i begin to lose control. I feel my ego dissolving. I feel like i'm dying, like i've overdosed. I fight it, but eventually accept: This is the end, I'm dying.<br><br>
My ego is peeled away in layers, my life flashing before my eyes in an instant. I'm extremely frightened, but feel death is inevitable.<br><br>
I leave my body and watch reality become a tiny sliver floating in the aether. I feel eons pass. I feel the universe aging, destroying, rebuilding. I feel entire races of life created and destroyed in fractions of seconds. I feel the birth and death of stars at an unimaginable rate.<br><br>
The peak lasts for about 3 hours in realtime, eternities in my head. Effects last for another 6 or 7 hours.<br><br>
This was the most intense drug experience i've had, including DMT. I base this on the fact that DMT's speed leaves no time for pondering, while the 2c-i had me in a transcendental state for 3 hellish hours. I've vowed never to go back to heights. Time will tell.<!-- End Body -->
