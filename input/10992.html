Me and my friends went camping.  We figured to make it a little more comical we'd bring along a handle of Jack Daniel's.  So we get the fire roasting, and enjoy some hotdogs over the camp fire.  Then we break out the Jack.  I had never drank before.  So my friend said its pretty easy to mix with Cherry Coke.  So we proceded to do about a shot of Jack for ever 10 oz of Cherry Coke.  I drank 3 of those.  Each one had a little more alcohol in than the rest.  Then I took 2 straight shots, just for the experience.  So I figured about 6 drinks total.  This was over about a 2 hour time period, and with food in the stomach.  <br><br>
Now I felt weird.  I felt fuzzy, and just plain dumb.  It basically mimicked sleep deprivation I thought.  Just a plain careless, dumb, inhibiting feeling.  So we went to bed, and upon waking up I felt like crap.  I had about 20oz of water before I went to bed to make sure I wasn't so dehydrated.  I woke up with a weird headache.  Then I puked about 10 minutes later.  I figured whatever... just remnants left over I'll be fine.  So I take some water to get some fluid in my system.  I puked again.  I tried different things to make me stop puking but nothing would stop it.  I ended up puking about 6 times.  It was horrible.  I mean I barely had anything to drink based on the amount of time I took it in.  <br><br>
I don't plan on drinking anytime soon ever again.  I don't know what I did wrong, cause I've seen guys smaller than me do 6 shots within 15 minutes and wake up just fine.  I just figure maybe my hangovers will be really bad.  It was a horrible experience though, not something I would try again in the near future thats for sure.<!-- End Body -->
