me :<br>
male<br>
40 years<br>
65 kg<br>
rather good health<br>
regular pot smoker for several years<br>
former heavy tobacco smoker, quit around 7 months ago with the help of nicotine patches (for 5 months). Eating a lot of licorice candies, which are bad for blood pressure.<br><br>
mindset : interested in trying a psychoactive product.<br><br>
preparation :<br>
About 2 g of ephedra stems (ma huang, ephedra vulgaris)into cold water slowly heated to boiling point, let boiling for 10 minutes, cooled down for 20 minutes.<br><br>
T : I drank the tea quickly. There was a brown powder in my cup, I swallowed it to. Ephedra tea had a very good taste and didnt need any sugar. It's one of the best tasting herbal tea I ever drank.<br><br>
T + 15mn : My vision seemed a little more accurate, colors were fine. In fact there was no real change but I was more concentrated on my senses. <br><br>
T+30 mn : I was feeling a little stupid. When I tried cocaine one year ago, it drove me to a stupid state of mind too, although the claims it makes thoughts fast and clear. I was feeling mildly happy. I started to make grapevine juice with the fruits I collected from my grapevine plant. Breathing was easier than ever, and very pleasant.<br><br>
T + 1 h : Time passed quick, I was deeply concentrated on my manual task. I was feeling fine.<br><br>
T + 2 h : I finished with the grapevine juice. I was feeling like having energy to spend. I smoked a very little MJ stick. It didnt change my state of mind, except I was more likely to laugh.<br><br>
T + 2 h 30 : I smoked a bigger joint with the same result. I'd like to take a walk, but I couldn't cause I was waiting for a friend. I started to worry a bit about my blood pressure because I'm a 'heavy' (5 g / day) licorice eater. <br><br>
T + 3 h : I felt something weird with my heart. My heart was pounding at a slightly accelerated rate. I was feeling something weird with my heart, but I guess it had something to do with pot paranoia.<br><br>
T + 4h / 4h 30 : At this time, the mental effects like concentration and happyness were fading, while the feeling of having a physical energy didn't change. I started to feel a little tired. Then, my friend arrived and we worked in the garden for an hour. I stopped to care about my heart and I didn't feel tired while working.<br><br>
T + 6 h : I was feeling tired. I got a slight ache in the heart area. I was a bit worried about it. I was 'wanting to take something'. Since I quit smoking, psychoactives often ended by the need, sometimes very strong, to smoke tobacco. As time has passed, it was replaced by a slighter need to take some psychoactive substance. So I smoked a cigarette of Lobelia inflata dried leaves. <br><br>
I spent the evening working on my computer and then watched a movie. There were unpleasant feelings in the heart area. I had no depression or even pessimistic state of mind when the effects were fading away. I smoked pot mixed with wild lettuce more than 10 hours after having drunk the ephedra and fell asleep very quickly. <br><br>
Next morning I woke up early, feeling fine. <br><br>
I think that the effects on the heart started 1 hour after the mental effects, a bit like with caffeine, and lasted longer. It was a pleasant experiment. The effects were mild, but long lasting. I'll try it again, but with a lower dose. It's obvious that the toxic dose is not a lot larger than the effective dose and that trying to get a massive high from ephedra could lead very easily to a major heart problem.<!-- End Body -->
