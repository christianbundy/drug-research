 "report": "<p>I've read all the reports concerning this med and they all seem to be negative.</p><p>I have a prescription for Seroquel (Quetiapine) and I just want to set the record straight. It's not bad at all. It's no vicodin, it's not very elating and euphoric, but if I just want out, if I just want to escape, this really works. If I'm depressed and bored or can't sleep and feel anxious this med is great. It evens me out and I can fall asleep easily if I want.</p><p>If I'm just going to watch tv and want to get everything off my mind I'd use this far sooner than pot. If I have easy access to a benzo or ambien then I'd go for those, they are more euphoric but Seroquel works as well.</p><p>I am mindful of the dosage, if it was my first time I wouldn't take a 200mg tablet, unless I really wanted to knock myrself out. I'd take 50mg. 50mg is enough to really feel it, it takes away the anxiety and it's a bit psychedelic.</p>"
