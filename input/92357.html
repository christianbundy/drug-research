After stopping in the local smoke shop one day and noticing Bath Salts for sale I began to do research to determine if it would be something worth trying. I have used methamphetamine before as well as cocaine and MDMA. Additionally I have tried 2CB. So I consider myself to have a decent knowledge base for stimulants with hallucinogenic properties. The bath salts I purchased were named Eight Ballz Ultra Premium Bath Salts. One gram for $25. My research seemed to indicate that this product contained MDPV. That was the most desirable chemical in my mind, since some of the other analogs are much less reported on. The package contained two vials with a slightly off white powder. Nothing like good methamphetamine. The powder was not very clumpy.<br><br>
I decided to insulflate the powder in two lines. One for each nostril. I dumped some of the powder onto a cd case (approximately 1/10th of one of the 500 mg vials) that I had cleaned and took the powder. The sting was similar to methamphetamine but not quite as intense. Within ten minutes I was beginning to feel a rushing sensation and  my heartbeat sped up. At the the thirty minute mark I was high. I felt euphoric and my mind was rushing from one idea to he next. I was talking and listening with interest to my sitters. I had a fair amount of difficulty concentrating on any one thing for very long. My mind was jumping all over the place. There was definitely some aphrodisiac effect. But even that was hard to concentrate on.<br><br>
I hit the peak high at around two hours in and felt really good for 5 hours. I decided not to do any more of the powder because all of the literature I had read seemed to indicate that more would only serve to increase feelings of paranoia with diminished euphoric effects. The paranoia that many people described with binge use of bath salts did not hit me at all. I think the fact that I was in a safe place really helped me feel at ease too. I smoked marijuana a couple of times during the experience but mostly passed on the pipe when it came to me. I couldn't feel the weed after smoking it anyway.<br><br>
I let my sitters house when the high began to wear off. At home I layed in bed during the biggest part of the come-down. I felt poorly laying in bed not sleeping. My body was uncomfortable but it was tolerable. I don't think that the come down was too different than methamphetamine. I have eaten now, and drank water over the course of the entire experience. Now about 18 hours after ingesting the bath salts I feel generally fine. I have no desire to use more. My stomach is a little upset. And my body feels a bit weak. My level of motivation is pretty low.<br><br>
In retrospect the extreme reports that I had read about this drug, in which some people report hellish pain and suffering with psychosis, seem to have been a product of either their own personal body chemistry, or excessive neglect of the body. Which is understandable as the messages that relate hunger and thirst are so mitigated while high on the drug that they could easily be forgotten.<br><br>
In conclusion I enjoyed the experience of trying a new drug, that will likely be illegal very soon here in AZ. I think that the way in which I consumed the drug was the best method for me, being one dose. Like usual, with powerful stimulants I think the high I felt was great while it lasted, but extremely uncomfortable during the comedown. The main differences that I identified between methamphetamine and MDPV were lack of concentration, or racing thoughts, and an even more pronounced heart beat speed up. The similarities included euphoria, high levels of alertness, the ability to communicate with others very easily and an uncomfortable comedown. I do attribute a very pure chemical to no bodily issues like nasal inflammation or sore throat, which are common for me when using street methamphetamine.<br><br>
