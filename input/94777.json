 "report": "<p>0:00 - I need to sleep and have a tense muscle in my neck so I crush a 10mg, put it in a capsule and punch two holes in the top, then ingest.</p><p>1:00 - feel a little drowsy, find some weed (strain unknown, but a mediocre head, with some stellar body high)in an old bag and pack it into a pipe with some tobacco rolled out of an american spirit (blue). The hit has me truly tired, very relaxed and ready for bed. My mind is clear.</p><p>1:30 - took another hit, feel asleep. perfect, woke up without hangover neck pain gone and well rested. I even functioned well at work the next day.</p>"
