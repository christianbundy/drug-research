 "report": "<p>Anon acquired 5 hits of supposed lsd.</p><p>Abt. 9:30a.m.: Drop 1</p><p>Abt. 11a.m.: A not quite euphoric high begins to build, w/ slight anxiety</p><p>Abt. 12p.m.: Rising high stalls and almost disappears until 1p.m.</p><p>Abt.2p.m.: Heavy 'stoned' feeling sets in w/o usual psychedelic character. More a narcotic, opiate-like stoned, only slightly trippy. Not dysphoric but not esp. 'happy' and lightheaded like LSD is (for anon.).</p><p>Abt. 3 p.m.: Peak. Kind of an LSA/alcohol type inebriation, w/o LSA nausea. Neither deeply meditative or fun, rather boring really. No visuals aside from subtle color variations and waving (but not exactly) effect on objects.</p><p>3-5 p.m.: Pretty even plateau. Gradual drop off until sometime after 12 a.m. Slept poorly. </p><p>Conclusion: CERTAINLY not LSD. A wild guess it was some RC, a phen maybe, tho. based on reading only, anon has no exp. aside from mesc. The blotter was unperforated and an off white color...anon pitched remaining blotter.</p>"
