Now when I first ever smoked marijuana I did not get all that high. I had nearly 10 pipes with no effect! I smoked out of nothing but pipes for the first 3-4 months of my 'stoner' period. So I used marijuana nearly daily for 3-4 months then suddenly stopped smoking it for 8 months. This one particular day my friend urged me to come smoke some dope, because I hadn't had the buzz in a long while I agreed. I really was anticipating getting stoned, the whole walk back to his place I couldn't stop thinking about it.<br><br>
We got there (this is the same place I had been getting stoned previously) and I sat down on his couch. My friend went into his bedroom, 5 minutes later he comes back with a big grin on his face and about half an ounce of weed. We sit down (Im shaking by this point, I really want to get stoned!) and I grab a little bit for myself, enough for 2-3 hits, and place it in a bowl and proceed to letting my friend cut it up.<br><br>
My friend went and got his bong, it was a 600mL glass juice bottle, but made a nice bong. He gave it to me along with a lighter, and taught me how to smoke it. I packed the bowel full, and sucked it all into my lungs. I got a nice lung-full of smoke, a lot more than I could ever handle from a pipe. As I exhaled I coughed a lot, it messed me up. Trying not to let my friend know I was already stoned, I packed another bowl full, bigger than the last one. I sucked it down like the last one, this one messed me up. I coughed and coughed. I had a sip of someones water, just a glass that was left on the table. It felt like it had put a fire out in my throat! I closed my eyes and all I could see was dope leaves with rectangles around them, hundreds of them. They were like bright metallic green.<br><br>
I felt that was enough for me. We got up and moved into his kitchen. We sat down on either side of this circular table. I remember sitting down, I was looking straight ahead of me, slightly towards the ceiling. All of a sudden I had this feeling of complete blankness, it felt like being on heroin, like noddin off. I forgot everything, I didnt know where I was, who I was, who my friend was. I thought that I was in another world, and I was trying to get back to my home world. I kept telling myself things like, Okay, this is home, remember this. Then I would forget and think Im in another world again.<br><br>
Apparently I was tripping like that for about 30 minutes, it felt like 5, 10 minutes max. My time perception was totally messed up. I looked over at my friend, he was eating some donuts and taking no particular notice of me, so I just tried to make sense of the situation. I couldnt think. My thoughts are just one big dopey haze. It felt like I was just floating, like looking at my self from a different body. Until my friend got my attention and suggested we go get some fresh air. <br><br>
I got up and looked down the hallway. It looked like it was really narrow and long. I started walking and his sister came out of her bedroom. She looked at me, with a weird expression on her face. I couldnt work out who she was. She was looking at me like something was terribly wrong. I kept walking on back into the lounge room. I know I had to go out the door, but my mind like shutdown, and I dont know why but I went and sat down. But it felt like I had walked out, my second out of body experience. I ended up getting up and following my friend outside.<br><br>
As I walked through the yard I just got a rush of pleasure, I felt so happy to be alive and tripping so well, all the colours were bright and vibrant. I suddenly yelled out at the top of my lungs, MAN IM TRIPPIN HARDCORE!! and I started laughing uncontrollably. My friend yelled at me, I felt as if I had killed someone, I felt really guilty, my mood changed right away. Walking down the street it seemed as though my head was detached and bouncing on my neck.<br><br>
We walked right down to this football pitch. We sat down on a bench and I started tripping again, same as before but this time when I closed my eyes I saw 3 big circles suspended in a black mist. They were worlds as I was calling them. Some how I start getting this feeling of looking at my friend and me though my mind, we were in one of these worlds that I was looking at. We decided to walk around the oval. I was fascinated by everything, it seemed as though it was the first time I was doing anything. My friend start joking about how trashed I was. He instructed me to pickup a pinecone, I picked it up, I started walking towards him and he ran away. I was confused, apparently I picked up a piece of dog shit, I swear I thought it was a pinecone.<br><br>
From there me and my friend went our separate ways, I got home ate some food and crashed out on my couch. My peak came pretty early on, about 15-20 minutes after the last hit. Lasted a good 2 and a half hours, I was pretty much down before falling asleep. One of the nicest trips Ive ever had.<!-- End Body -->
