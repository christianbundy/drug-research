For the following experiences the setting is my bedroom, a comfortable and safe environment, and my mindset is that of seeking relaxation and peace. Im not on any meds, and any other drugs besides the one of concern are all listed as taken. <br><br>
Friday night<br>
1:00 Smoked small amount with equal amount high-grade pot in ceramic bowl. The bowl was the diameter of a dime, and I used enough high grade to cover the screen, then used enough opium lettuce to cover that. Noticeable coordination impairment and only slightly lessened pain reduction, both discovered when I banged me knee into my desk. And did I laugh. Everything was humourous for once. This lasted approximately 15 minutes. Around twenty minutes later, unsatisfied with the results so far, I put enough high grade in the bowl to just cover the bottom and smoked, which made me a little high (obviously) but didnt do anything for the opium lettuce. <br><br>
Monday night:<br>
A bowl of pot about an hour before hand, and then:<br><br>
2:05 I have approx. three quarters an ounce of opium lettuce in the form of a gram of 20x opium lettuce extract from a bouncingly reliable source of such interesting botanicals. I mixed a third of it (equivalent to roughly six and a half grams of raw dried opium lettuce) with a half cup of boiling water and let steep for 15 minutes, then drank at once. I didnt bother to filter since the extract completely dissolved in the water. It didn't taste like much of anything, a slightly bitter taste is all.<br><br>
4:00 the tv box is funny.<br><br>
From around 3:30 to 5:00 I talked online with an ex-girlfriend about a lot of emotionally sensitive things, and from around 4:30 to 5:30 I cried intermittently. I believe the opium lettuce helped me to express my emotions, most particularly by feeling them in my body. My anger became a nauseous, roiling boiling in my stomach lining as if my stomach was covered in goose bumps. My sadness and anxiety manifested as a feeling of being ripped apart at the seams, my bones felt like they were collapsing at the joints and I was crashing, imploding inwards and downwards. A very skeletal feeling, accompanied by pressure and heaviness behind the eye orbs which corresponded to the sadness I felt, heavy dragging-down-weighted sadness which solidified into tears. <br><br>
This increased sense of self-awareness lasted till around 5:30, and at 6:00 I took a hit of high grade pot and went to sleep.<br><br>
Wednesday night:<br>
12:45 two shots vanilla vodka in 8 oz generic chocolate ensure. damn tasty, too. <br><br>
1:00 smoking a bowl of 1/3g opium lettuce and just enough high grade pot to cover the bottom of the bowl. <br><br>
Around 2:00 I put in more high grade, stirred around with remains of opium lettuce and smoked.<br><br>
2:30 Feeling relaxed, things are funny. Music is nice, which is rare these days. I imagine this would synergize very nicely with nitrous. (and the musical entity Mystical Sun.) Must try this next time. The relaxed feeling and mild sensory enhancement lasted till around 3:00, when I went to bed. <br><br>
Monday morning:<br>
8:30 I took about 3 shots of vodka, a T3 (300mg APAP + 30 mg codeine, from the makers of Tylenol) and smoked the other 1/3 gram of opium lettuce extract. Havent really eaten anything since yesterday afternoon, so around 16 hours ago. No pot for this experiment either. <br><br>
8:45 I can already feel mellow and my hands are dis-coordinated from my brain. Yea. <br><br>
10:10 Feel relaxed and mellowed out and all, but it was the most intense right after I started smoking, around and before 9. I wish I had more opiates. <br><br>
10:40ish I was only feeling the mildest of sedation, as if I had smoked pot about 5 hours ago, so I had myself three more shots of vodka. Now at 11:00 all there is is a liquor-on-an-empty-stomach feeling. <br><br>
FINAL ANALYSIS: I need to smoke more than a third a gram at a time (equivalent to roughly 6 grams of lettuce). Significantly more. A better extraction process for oral intake is suggested, and/or smoking perhaps half or two-thirds a gram of the extract next time.<!-- End Body -->
