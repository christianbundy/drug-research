I tried a fairly large dose of kava Kava the other night and found it to be surprisingly pleasurable. So here is my little synopsis on the experience:<br><br>
5:00pm -On an empty stomach I ingested the contents of 8, 425 mg capsules of a store bought Kava supplement. I mixed the kava powder with cold water and a little sugar (the taste really doesn't bother me that much).<br><br>
5:20 - I began feeling the effects: mild sense of well being, stimulated but relaxed. My mouth is a little numb from the kava.<br><br>
6:00 - This was probably the high point of the kava experience. I felt mild euphoria: very much at one with the universe, relaxed mind, extremely clear thought process, mild head and body buzz, bodily relaxation, and increased sense awareness. Visual perception was enhanced significantly: objects with sharp contrast and great detail looked exceptionally beautiful. some slight peripheral 'pulsing' as I like to call it. Very mild and natural visual effects. My hearing was also more enhanced...music had more intensity and was more profound...very beautiful<br><br>
7:00 - 'The plateau' still feeling the effects, very nice! my body feels heavy...walking and bodily activity really enhances the 'buzz'.  I have urinated 2 times since I ingested the kava...definitely irregular. (kava induces urination) Mild stomach discomfort.<br><br>
8:00 - The obvious effects have waned significantly, and my body is starting to feel very tired. I think this is the after-effect.<br><br>
9:00 - Definitely more tired than I would be had I not ingested the kava. Still feel mentally relaxed.<br><br>
Overall, I really liked the experience. It was mild but still obvious. Don't expect to get really blown out of your mind...it isn't like that. It's very mellow but it's still fun<br><br>
To summarily describe the effects its like a caffeine buzz (without the jitters and the tense feeling) and mild cannabis buzz(not full-blown 'stoned') mixed together...alert but relaxed and added with a very mild hallucinogenic effect. <br><br>
Next time I think I will up the dose a bit for more intensity!<!-- End Body -->
