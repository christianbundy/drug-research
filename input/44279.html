Used water extractions, 12 seeds smashed with a hammer. Remains of half (6) in 1.5 oz water for 8.5 hours.  The other six were added for the last 2 hours. Frequent agitation, about every 20 minutes.  Water was filtered in coffee filter and drunk. Seed remains were masticated and swallowed.  I had done a test with a single seed a few days earlier to confirm no fungicide present.<br><br>
Within a few seconds the same kind of dull headache electrical feeling as from the single seed came on.  5-10 minutes into it a rush of hot energy went through me, maybe from fear.  After that I laid down expecting some visionary phenomena.  There were almost no visuals at all.  The most suprising thing I experienced was about 45 minutes into it I heard what sounded like a loud hand clap on the right side of my body.  Other than that, the dull ache, almost like a 10% migraine behind the eyes, lasting for hours, is not the type of experience I would want in trying for 20-30 seeds.  <br><br>
My past experiences with Ayauascha were much more visual and pleasant than this.<!-- End Body -->
