 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter having recently found myself drinking two liters of 'cola' every other night to alleviate depression symptoms I decided to go right to a natural source and purchased some ground kola nut.  Attempting to put them in a coffee maker resulted in disaster, but putting one part cola and 4 parts water in a sauce pan turned out a fragrant, pleasant tasting decoction which provided effects not unlike caffeine.\r\nThe major difference from tablet caffeine and caffeinated beverages is a distinct 'body buzz'.  I know the Kola Nut has kicked in when my back muscles start tensing up.  Not mentally stimulating at all.  I can understand why kola nuts have been chewed by laborers for hundreds of years.  Also dubbed and aphrodiasic, which doesn't surprise me at all. \r\nKola nut turns the brain off and the body on.\n\n\n"
