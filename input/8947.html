 2 reports for the price of one!<br><br>
 Around October of 2000, some friends and i were going to have<br>
a typical smoke session. Maybe 5 people, some high quality<br>
weed. Well, i had a bunch of mushroom shake left from a party,<br>
and i threw it on top. Why not? I had to work in an hour and<br>
a half and figured the weed would be fading by then. <br>
 So we toked it all down. Pretty soon i felt totally stoned<br>
out of my gourd. And more, it had the definate feel of mushrooms<br>
too. Great i thought, its really nice. But by the time work<br>
rolled around, i was still feeling like dancing through happy<br>
land. I had to call in with a lame excuse.<br><br>
 Now, Aughust 2001, im sitting in japan (mushrooms are legal<br>
here by the way). I just packed a bowl full of mushroom shake<br>
and burnt down. Well, its definately giving some effects. Mild<br>
visual changes, sound and tactile perceptions are slightly mushroomy. Nice feeling.<br><br>
 So, i can say mushroom smoking has an effect. However, the taste is rather bad, and usually causes a mild headache. Definately interesting though. If you have only 1 or 2 caps, or a bunch of shake, id say smoke the stuff, but use some weed to kill the taste.<!-- End Body -->
