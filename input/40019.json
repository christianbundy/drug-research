 "report": "<p>I was prescribed viocodin for an injury 3 months ago. After the pain was gone, I began abusing vicodin on a nightly basis. Gradually, my nightly dose increased. Eventually, it got to the point where I had to snort Vicodin pills to get high... because I would feel hungover if I took enough vicodin orally to get high (I assume this is from the damage caused to my liver from acetaminophen). Be careful with vicodin, and use extraction methods if possible.</p><p>My supply ran out, and the withdrawals kicked in. It was diffcult to sleep, and my stomach and sides would hurt. Plus, I got very depressed. I found kratom one night while searching online for a way to deal with withdrawals. Tonight, I took 3 grams of Kratom 'Super Powder', which is approximately equal to 36mg of Kratom Alkaloids. I mixed the powder with some hot water and sipped the drink down in about 5 minutes.</p><p>15 minutes later, I began to feel edgy. I felt like something was about to happen. My throat and mouth was numb. Then I began to feel numb... numb in the mind. Similar to opiates, but slightly different somehow. I layed down on my bed and tried to enjoy the ride. I sorta felt spacey... and I felt very warm and content just laying there. It was almost pitch black in the room and ocassionally the little bit of light I could see from the window would dissapear... like my vision was blackening. It almost felt like I was about to slip into a dream, but then everything would snap back into place.</p><p>This continued for awhile and then I decided to report my findings. I feel content right now. I took the kratom about an hour ago... and everything seems fine. I am okay with life... very similiar feeling to low doses of vicodin.</p><p>Kratom (at the dose I consumed) did not blow me away like I had hoped. But it definetly cured my withdrawals. I plan on trying a higher dose to see what will happen.</p><p>[Erowid Note: Replacement of one drug for another, although it can be medically beneficial and effective, should not be considered a 'cure' for a dependence or addiction.]</p>"
