 "report": "<p>20mg flexril</p><p>0.5 mg xanax</p><p>1 rockstar energy drink</p><p>Started off around 10pm, dosed pills, went driving (I was passenger).</p><p>T + 20 min onset, bought energy drink, feeling definiate head change. </p><p>T + 60 reclined in seat, eyes half open, extremely relaxed and calm, a bit disociated, but not in a bad way. Listening to music, hearing/focusing on sounds I haven't heard before with a familiar CD (smashing pumpkins-siamese dream) and really getting into it.</p><p>T + 90 arrive back at apartment, talk with other roomate, feeling like I'm ready for sleep</p><p>T + 120 in room, unusually horny, masturbate to porn. Unusually long orgasm.</p><p>T + 140 sleeps like a cadaver.</p><p>Slept for 12 hours, woke up, still lazyish, get up, still feel calm, body feels relaxed & 'loose'. Meditation feels good.</p><p>I suggest doing this after a long hard week, and when you have at least 24 hours of free time and no responcibilities, next time I will try this combo with cannabis.</p>"
