 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n20mg flexril\r\n0.5 mg xanax\r\n1 rockstar energy drink\r\nStarted off around 10pm, dosed pills, went driving (I was passenger).\r\nT + 20 min onset, bought energy drink, feeling definiate head change. \r\nT + 60 reclined in seat, eyes half open, extremely relaxed and calm, a bit disociated, but not in a bad way. Listening to music, hearing/focusing on sounds I haven't heard before with a familiar CD (smashing pumpkins-siamese dream) and really getting into it.\r\nT + 90 arrive back at apartment, talk with other roomate, feeling like I'm ready for sleep\r\nT + 120 in room, unusually horny, masturbate to porn. Unusually long orgasm.\r\nT + 140 sleeps like a cadaver.\r\nSlept for 12 hours, woke up, still lazyish, get up, still feel calm, body feels relaxed & 'loose'. Meditation feels good.\r\nI suggest doing this after a long hard week, and when you have at least 24 hours of free time and no responcibilities, next time I will try this combo with cannabis.\n\n\n"
