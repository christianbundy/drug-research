I'm 34 years old and 10 years ago I was a user of Ecstacy, LSD and cannabis. Not heavy, but enough to have some good times - and some bad. I still dabble very occasionally but recently I was prescribed Tramadol for severe sinus headaches which have always been a problem for me. The Tramadol eased the pain a little but the main feeling I got was 'hey!.. this reminds me of something..' and I then realized there was more potential for recreational use than actual pain relief!<br><br>
I initially took the suggested 100mg but soon increased it to 150mg for recreational use, beefed up by a couple of shots of whisky. Tramadol comes on so very very slowly and it's not until 2 or even 3 hours have passed that I am fully aware of being under it's spell. I like because it's a mild feeling - no teeth grinding or anything - it just simply promotes a feeling of warm, cozy well-being and makes me want to curl up in front of a fire on a sheepskin rug, close my eyes and listen to music. Which is exactly what I do! It does make me slightly dizzy but quite enjoyably I find. If I take 150mg early evening then, even if I go to bed at 2am, I'll still feel it's effects - and being in bed is a great place to be on this stuff. Sleep is good too. Not that it makes me horny though! And this leads me to my main point.<br><br>
Tramadol, like some other substances, makes it hard to get erect and stay and erect and very hard to reach orgasm. However - and here's the crunch - If I can manage to get to climax somehow (preferably from sex rather than just a quick hand shandy) then wow! The post-coital feeling is amazing! In this state I really do feel as if Ive had a proper does of opiates, if only for a short time. I lay for half an hour listening to music in the most blissful post-sex state I've ever experienced. It was truly wonderful.. and the best thing is there's no real hangover because all Ive taken is slightly over the recommended dose of a prescribed substance and spiced it up with a perfectly natural (and very hard to reach) orgasm!<!-- End Body -->
