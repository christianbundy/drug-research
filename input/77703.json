 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHaving some time to myself and no weed, I decided to try smoking some household stuff which I had lying around, cloves and sage. I saw some articles on these two spices online, so I decided to give them a shot. I rolled approximately 1.5 grams of each substance into a joint, smoked the Sage first then the cloves. I felt little to nothing, and woke up the next morning with my throat feeling more sore then it has ever been. Not recommended, buy ganja instead.\n\n\n"
