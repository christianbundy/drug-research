I was bored one night, I was sitting at home.. had nothign to do. I smoke weed for already a year, I also tried LSD once - thats about it. I decided to try some.. I was sitting alone in my room, Took 1 hit and became very dizzy..then took another hit and my vision was all spinning.. I was hearing a loop..took one more hit and I saw people all over telling me to inhale more.. took another hit and I saw a boxing ring with mickey mouse standing in it..I'm like what the fuck.. another hit and my heart started beating extremly fast. <br><br>
My vision started going all grey..then my heart stopped beating, I couldn't breathe. I fell on my bed, then I stood up and I saw a friend (who wasnt there) run to phone ambulance. I was chasing him, then I told him I'm okay but he didn't hear me. I couldn't see his face at all, it had shade all over it. I didn't know who it was. So yeah, I ran up to him and tried to grab phone, but I couldn't. Its like it was air. He threw phone down and ran out of the house, I tried to follow him but once again I couldn't open the door! He ran back in to my room and as I followed him I saw myself lying on bed passed out, not even breathing. He started trying to wake me up, then when I felt my body again I stood up and I didn't see anyone...but the thing that freaked me out was that I had fucking marks on my body/shirt as if someone touched me for real!<br><br>
From this trip, I now believe that theres another world with ghosts, and god himself saved my life when I was lying dead on the bed.<!-- End Body -->
