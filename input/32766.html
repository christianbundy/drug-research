The other night I found a bottle of the SSRI Zoloft. I found info from various websites what this chemical does to you, how much to take, etc. Normally I dont take Zoloft.<br><br>
At around 9:50 I took one 50 mg pill of Zoloft. I downed the pill and went out with my mom to do random shit: got lunch, returned some clothes, etc. I noticed around 45 mins to an hour later when we were in the car, I started getting much happier than I was the previous two days. This doesnt mean I was EUPHORIC it just means that I wasnt sad, angry, mad or anything. I got home and I decided this was just a feel of it. at around 1 pm, I downed 4 more pills; I total of 250 mg in all now. Within Id say about an hour I was very JITTERY, which I still am 6 hours later. I had a little difficulty focusing, but then I realized the fun. I closed and my eyes and got some awesome closed eye visuals. I opened them and stared at the window with the sunlight coming in, and I closed them, and I suddenly saw a large bright colored, intertwining square; due to the window panes Im assuming. <br><br>
It is now 4:30 and I just began to eat something, but suddenly I became struck by a nausea that was VERY aggitating. I went to the bathroom and threw up what I was eating. But now heres the cool part; even though I didnt like throwing up, I didnt hate it. It didnt make me mad, or agitated, nothing really. This feeling of emotionless is kinda cool but very odd. I do feel happy. Not euphoria like I said before, not even a well being, but the previous 2 days had been extremely stressful with SATs, and an incident at a friends house; with the Zoloft it was gone. I dont feel that pressure or weight. Its very peculiar.<br><br>
Another thing is my body feel. I feel slightly different, in terms of body weight. The way I feel when Im just coming on to a dxm trip. My thoughts are basically the same except very fast. Im guessing that this is some sort of stimulant in one way or another, because my typing is about 2-3 times as fast, and Im doing small things that I normally dont do, such as tap my finger against the desk, or shake my foot.<br><br>
One last thing that Im noticing is that music is affecting me alot, without my knowing. Ill explain: about to minutes ago I was playing Ott - splitting an atom, which the music, I feel, sounds like an end to something, like a conclusion. Its almost depressing. Well without my knowing it made me slightly unhappy, which I just picked up on. I changed the track to infected mushroom - spiritual trance, to see if I get slightly amped up, and if my Idea of the music affecting me is correct.<br><br>
9 minutes later: Yes, I was right, it is very powerful, I feel almost immortally strong I think. Im getting slightly nauseas again not sure why. My eyes are immensely dilated, but not blood shot. CEVs are still present and Im getting tracers of bright lights. I feel unbeliveably hyper. I read today that Zoloft stays with you for a few days, but Ill wait it out and see if it wears off. I dont plan on taking Zoloft again. Im feeling SLIGHTLY depressed, Im trying to fend it off and get happy; I dont want to crash like fucking adderal. I feel tired. I want to get to sleep but I dont think its gonna happen for a long time. Im not sure why but I think somehow I hit the peak just now, 7 hours later. my thoughts are different, but not amazing. Im starting to feel lonely but I dont want to be.<br><br>
Zoloft is very powerful, and very potent. Not something to be fucked around with. I dont perticularly like it because I have that Im gonna be like this for a while' feeling. Well Im gonna go. I hope my report was helpful, but I dont think I can write anymore. I feel like Im about to crash.<br><br>
Afterword (2 weeks after 'trip'): I had a strong pang of depression because I let bad thoughts get to me but that was soon washed away, after I finished writing. Im not sure if it was after affects or the come down of the trip, but for the next few days I still felt it in my system, fairly strong, but waning every day. Sometime last Friday it was completely gone. I had waaay to much trouble sleeping. Its like a cross between low grade acid and speed. I do and I dont recommend it. It kept me up for 2 days straight and my eyes were dilated to full dilation for 4 days. Very weird body buzz, and easy to get depressed, but very impressive for the CEVs, although no open ones. Its got its downsides, so it wasnt really my thing. Think Ill stick to dxm =)<!-- End Body -->
