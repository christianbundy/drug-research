 "report": "<p>I have read as many articles if not more than the average consumer of the green fairy, and come to the conclusion that most of you folks have yet to procure a first rate sample of a true absinthe.</p><p>I have tried Swills (Hills) absinth and at first, thought this was a good find, however upon further tests and comparisons I have come to the conclusions that Sebor is head and shoulders above the rest. NO, I am not a sales rep for Sebor, however I have been a fairly steady consumer and patron of this outstanding liquid for about three years now. It truly is a mellow buzz, not like getting hit over the head with a club, like a lot of you seem to like your departures from the every day. </p><p>I suggest that a 2 oz dose of Sebor added to about 1 tsp. of sugar dissolved in a little water, than topped off with about 6 or 8 oz very cold water will make an ideal drink.</p><p>As I sit and type this, I am on my second glass. I find the effects to be quite similar to a small toke of decent herb. But with a very pleasant over tone of anise and other subtle herbal undertones.</p><p>The addition of the sugar takes a bit of the edge off of the bitter under pinning of the wormwood. But even that is not over whelming, but adds to the complex nature of the whole experience.</p>"
