I have been reading about legal/natural highs for a few years on the net but when I actually have a few days to experiment I usually don't think about it.  Today I saw some Kava tea bags at my sister's place and since I had no plans till the next week I decided to try some.<br><br>
9:30 PM<br>
The tea says '25 mg per bag' so I decided to rip open 4 of them and dump them directly in the water rather then steep them to make sure I get all of the Kava, I figure 100 mg is as good place as any to start. So I drink down the whole mixture not leaving any grains in the bottom of the cup, really overpoweringly nasty.<br><br>
9:40 PM<br>
I sit on the couch and start watching TV, I don't feel anything at first but soon I get a mild buzz and feel a little 'off', I notice the TV show is much easier to laugh at then usual. I started to think this might just be a placebo effect but going out to smoke I felt slightly wobbly, and I got a HUGE buzz off of the cigarette which isn't normal for me.<br><br>
I go back in and my sister asks me why I was smiling so wide, I hadn't even noticed I've had a huge grin for the last few minutes.  <br><br>
10:40 PM<br>
The buzz remains, it feels like coming off of weed or having a weak hit, but with happiness mixed in, very mellow and not bothered by anything, I had been having a boring day but I find I am totally satisfied with watching TV at this point.<br><br>
11:20 PM<br>
I have also wanted to try Nutmeg and I figure, what the hell, I have a whole week to sleep off any ill effects so why not? I dig through the pantry and find ground Nutmeg that hasn't ever been opened, I have no idea if this is the right form of nutmeg to get a buzz off of but I figure I will try it.<br><br>
I have one tsp of it and, holy shit, the stories about the taste are true, go dump an ashtray in your mouth and now you know what nutmeg tastes like.<br><br>
12:20 AM<br>
No effects from the Nutmeg yet, I still feel odd from the Kava though, but it isn't really intense, I decide to drink 4 more bags to enhance the effects, also to try more nutmeg, I take 2 more tsp and wash it down with the Kava, I almost puke the whole disgusting mixture back up.<br><br>
Decide to go play some Half-life on the net.<br><br>
12:45 AM<br>
Now THIS I like, not only do I feel great but my game playing skills aren't affected at all.<br><br>
Also, music sounds better then normal, not in the 'I want to sing every song I hear' way I can get on weed but definitely boosted appreciation, I flip through a bunch of Autechre, Moby, Plaid, Nine Inch Nails, and Aphex Twin every song sounds cooler.<br><br>
That second cup is having an effect, slightly more buzzed , feel slightly drunk but still clear headed, I wish I was at a party, I would be having a blast.<br><br>
1:00 AM <br>
Checking my email and all of the sudden I start to get a headache. Damn. <br><br>
Not unbearable but it is bringing me down a little, I think it is the Nutmeg since almost every Nutmeg trip I have read about involves a headache, wish it was actually making me feel something else. [Erowid Note: Kava is also associated with headaches upon come-down.]<br><br>
Thinking about drinking some alcohol but I am worried it will kill the euphoria.<br><br>
2:00 AM<br>
Decide to see how much of a buzz I can get, use 5 more teabags in a cup, drink it as fast as possible only stopping to breath.<br><br>
Don't really notice any effect, I am pretty exhausted at this point, and my headache has gotten worse. I sit down on the couch and start watching some murder mystery and trying to notice any new effects.<br><br>
10:00 AM<br>
Wake up on the couch, go to my room to sleep on my bed.<br><br>
2:45 PM<br>
Wake up, no headache and no ill effects, actually I feel great, slept a long time though.<br><br>
All in all this was a great experience. Not as good as weed but better then booze by a long shot.<!-- End Body -->
