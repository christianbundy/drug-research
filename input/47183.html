PLACE: My apartment with very few distractions except for the roadwork outside. <br><br>
PEOPLE: Me, myself and I at 6'2' 240lbs.<br><br>
I am starting in the morning at 10AM I have 6 hours before I have to goto work.<br><br>
I am writing myself notes that say 'YOU HAVE TAKEN PROMETHAZINE IT'S NOT REAL' and  put them at various places in my apartment. I have not eaten anything for 8 hours my stomach is empty.<br><br>
T- 0:00 60ml of Cough Syrup 120mg of promethazine 75mg of codeine measured in a pyrex measuring cup. It is a Pink/purplish liquid which I though was kind of odd. Smells and tastes like regular robotussin though ((BLEH!!)). Some of it stuck to the bottom of the cup so I filled it with cold tap water and drank that as well. It looks very clean and I am pretty sure I have gotten most of it.<br><br>
T+ 0:02 Small visual trails and a slight 'buzzy' feeling, very mild happiness all over. It might be the medication or just my mindset, as I really love day tripping, either way this seems like it will be a good experience :)<br><br>
T+ 0:10 Making some fries, being that I took it first it should have no real affect on the medication and I haven't eaten since last night. (NOTE: I don't know how much more I will be writing 'while tripping' as I have the overwhleming urge to lay down.)<br><br>
T+ 0:15 Still the slight buzz from before, my stomach feels a little sick but it should pass once I eat something. Going to watch some old Starcraft Speed Running Movies.<br><br>
T+ 0:24 The ding from my deep fryer scared the shit out of me, but the smell is SOOOO GOOD. The buzz is getting bigger as well. I am debating on whether to take 1 shot (2oz) of vodka to pollenate the trip, as one report on codeine said it would.<br><br>
T+ 0:42 Decided not to drink the vodka, simply because of the need to see the full effects of the drug by itself. I am VERY relaxed now and watching Starcraft makes me even MORE relaxed. Hands are slighty numb and it is hard to pick up my food. The fries also have very little taste. Body buzz is coming along good as well no visual or audio halluciations as of yet.<br><br>
T+ 0:47 Very very NUMB haha and slow. Feels alot like weed but without the headiness of the mind fog. Extremely clear headed like I have not taken anything at all. I cant drink my water either. Can't tell whether it's hitting my mouth or not very cool.<br><br>
T+ 1:00 Finished eat and I am going to lie down. No itching has come on as others have experience but I seem to be peaking as of right now.<br><br>
T+ 1:25 Feeling like I am going to throw up, probably from the codeine. Did not want to get up and type this because it hit me HARD when I was laying down. Mild Color shifting and audio hallucination but the relaxing was ecstatic. Going back to law down and listen to Fischerspooner.<br><br>
T+ 2:02 Some Closed Eye Visuals, very faded. One of a chick shaking her ass, some wavy lines, a monster face, and me looking at myself. Found that my imagination is under my complete control and anything I think about appears inside my mind with crystal clarity.<br><br>
T+ 4:30 Whoa passed out for awhile, one minute I was relaxing on the couch the next my alarm is going off (really glad I set that ahead of time). Feels like I am steadily coming down from the peak but still relaxed.<br><br>
T+ 8:00 Basking in the Afterglow effects of extreme relaxatation hard to concentrate at work and very hard to move, feeling very sluggish while walking almost floating.<br><br>
T+ 10:00 Back at baseline again, just got off of work and going to finish the rest of the bottle :).<br><br>
CONCLUSION: It was a nifty little trip, could have been better if the Promethazine did not make me goto sleep. I do feel like I just came back from a vacation. Maybe at a higher dose I will break the psychadelic threshold that I seemed so close to. The drowsiness is problematic as I may have missed the peak because of it. I would gladly do it again as the afterglow refreshes my mind and body to the point that I am ready to tackle anything. But overall it was a very mild experience, soothing but unexciting. One of those things that makes me say 'yeah this was kinda coool, but not GREAT!!!!'.<!-- End Body -->
