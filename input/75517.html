I was at a party,and had brought a gram of bud and my bong along with me. I smoked all my bud on friday night, and proceeded to pass out (I was also drinking). Luckily, I stayed at my friends who had the party. A friend of mine offered me some straight damiana, about a 3rd of a shot glass. I went outside and smoked a cone. I didn't really feel anything, but I loved the taste of the fragrant, almost fruit tasting smoke, so I had the entire 3rd of a shotglass. I still wasn't really feel anything, except maybe quite chilled. I went inside, and sat around with my friends. We were talking about movies, and decided it would be a good idea to watch Labyrinth stoned. We proceeded to smoke a few cones mixed with damiana. For some strange reason, I could now feel the effects of the damiana. Mostly it was a desire to cuddle and be generally affectionate, which I never get from smoking weed. It also felt like a much smoother, almost warm high, if that makes sense. I'd highly reccomend this mix,if for the taste of damiana alone!<!-- End Body -->
