 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt makes you feel perfect. They say.\r\nThey say, It makes you pick that expressionless\r\nnodding head up off of the cement and view\r\nNature. See the wonders of the world unfurl\r\nbefore your very eyes in the pattern we call fate.\r\nThey beckon, Come with us. In the world where\r\nwild fields of poppy bloom. Where the mystical \r\npot plant grows in the wild, dripping with fresh\r\nhoney-like residew.\r\nBut have you all missed for sure the intense heart beats?\r\nThe ghastly-white clouds blown out of your mouth \r\nlike your spirit screaming for escape?\r\nHave you missed the opressions? Depressions?\r\nSoul sessions?\r\nHave you missed life as we know it? (Melting into \r\nthe past, future, and never the moment?)\r\nHave you missed the restrictions? Addictions?\r\nCrucifixions?\r\nThe butt-naked bluesy beats of the blacks?\r\nWondering why they would write of which?\r\nI know I have.\r\nAnd like a vodka-drunken schoolgirl, \r\nI cant help but to say\r\nthat Im loving every minute of it.\n\n\n"
