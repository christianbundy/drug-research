See the wonders of the world unfurl<br>before your very eyes in the pattern we call fate.<br>They beckon, Come with us. In the world where<br>wild fields of poppy bloom. Where the mystical <br>pot plant grows in the wild, dripping with fresh<br>honey-like residew.<br>But have you all missed for sure the intense heart beats?<br>The ghastly-white clouds blown out of your mouth <br>like your spirit screaming for escape?<br>Have you missed the opressions? Depressions?<br>Soul sessions?<br>Have you missed life as we know it? (Melting into <br>the past, future, and never the moment?)<br>Have you missed the restrictions? Addictions?<br>Crucifixions?<br>The butt-naked bluesy beats of the blacks?<br>Wondering why they would write of which?<br>I know I have.<br>And like a vodka-drunken schoolgirl, <br>I cant help but to say<br>that Im loving every minute of it.\n\n\n"
