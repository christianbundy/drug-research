When ingesting about a third to three-fourths of a teaspoon (ordered as a veterinary supplement, because it's not available over-the-counter in the U.S.), I almost immediately felt a, well, 'whoosh.'  Definitely much like the moment where you first notice a serious drug-taking effect.  A bit dizzy, a bit light, and definitely some relaxation and some euphoria, I feel a slight disconnect from normal reality.   Everything is pretty funny, but definitely not 'giddy.' <br><br>
This is where it plateaus.  <br><br>
I've also found that taking more after 'peaking' (if you can call it that)will not really work.  There is definitely a sleep-inducing element to this substance, but I've seldom found it overwhelming.  If I take too much I do become a bit disoriented physically, though I can still think straight if I want to. <br><br>
!)One disturbing thing is that I occasionally feel as if my heart is beating differently, though it doesn't feel dangerous. <br><br>
No ill effects the next day.  Perhaps a small bit sluggish, but this must just comes from the deeper sleep. A normal dose of caffeine in the morning leaves no trace.  Much safer than taking chemical sedatives, in my humble opinion.<br><br>
However, tolerance does grow rather quickly.  After a couple days of usage, the euphoric element is much lower, though it is still relaxing and helps sleep. I have no certain idea about its effects on dreams, as I take a B-50 vitamin pill just before bed, which does increase dream vividity.<br><br>
I have not tried 5-HTP so I cannot compare.<br><br>
Overall, I find it a worthy substance when used on occasion to help unwind, mitigate depression, sleep and a small amount (800mg?) can help me when hungover.  But it should not be used daily, as the benefits decrease.<!-- End Body -->
