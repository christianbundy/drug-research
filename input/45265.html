One of the problems with the Kratom market is that quality is massively variable. I have taken 6 grams before and it's been a stronger experience than another batch of 12 grams. I have stuck solely to the powdered kratom going round the UK at the moment. There seems to be a lot of discrepancies about whether it is stronger in powdered, resin or leaf forms. No suppliers seem particularly concerned with clearing up any of the confusion.<br><br>
I strongly recommend starting on a low dosage. Many headshops sell it in packets of 6 grams. Sometimes this hasn't done much, sometimes it has been quite powerful. I've knowingly taken 12 grams of this. Recently however I was sent some from a friend and didn't actually check the weight. I thought it was a few grams; turned out it was more like 16 grams! I didn't find out till aftewards and what followed was unpleasant.<br><br>
The usual opiate-like effects came on, but I was more euphoric than usual. The problem was I couldn't urinate; I had what they call 'billy willy' in the UK where you take speed or E and can't relax your bladder muscles because of the serotonin rushes. This was pretty bad. I tried to relax for ages but couldn't piss and had to go back to bed. Very painful and distressing. I later woke up to find blood in my boxers. I had pissed out blood. By the morning I had come down and with the help of a diuretic (tea) managed  very long piss, normal piss.<br><br>
Naturally this was very disturbing. I wouldn't recommend high doses; check the levels. This drug is similar to codeine in effects. We don't know anything aout the toxicity of kratom. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it isn't dangerous.<!-- End Body -->
