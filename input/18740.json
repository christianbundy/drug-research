 "report": "<p>\nBack in the earlier days of my drug career drugs were hard to come by. So one day my friend and I were trying to find a way to get cheaply blitzed.  Freon came in to the conversation and my curiosity peaked.  So we went out back and hit up the neighbors A/C unit with a pen and a bag.  So simple i thought why didn't we think of this before?  I soon found out time has a way of answering stupid questions. So we went inside and took a seat on the couch.  I huffed a lung full of the 'sweet' gas and held it for a about 7 seconds.  As soon as I exhaled the darkness started creeping into my vision.  All I could think of was to not close my eyes.  </p><p>Thinking and doing are two totally different things of course. The next thing I know I'm waking up in a dark room with a fog all around me. Where the falk am I? I hear this wa-wa sounding voice like the teacher on charlie brown which turned out to be my friends g/f. I suppose my brain couldn't comprehend language anymore.  So I'm sitting in this fog which seemed like forever and it starts to really suck so I wake up on the floor back in reality.  My friend told me I passed out and wiggled off the couch. How can I do anything after I pass out I wonder.  I blame it on siezures. Anyway this shit is stupid. Talk about brain damage.  Crush up morning glories if your bored.</p>"
