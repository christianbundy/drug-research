This substance is a miracle drug.  Even at very low dosages, not even enough to feel anything physically, it greatly reduces anxiety and depression.  In fact, I have never taken any prescription drug that does as good of a job.  I like to keep a little in an e-cig in my pocket for emergencies.  Any time I get a panic attack, unable to focus or get anything done, just one quick puff on my e-cig and I can immediately function again.<br><br>
Depression and anxiety aren't the only problems it solves for me.  It can also be used to reduce the many migraines I usually get, especially to remove the nausea I get from the migraines.  I have nausea problems quite frequently too, often serious enough to make it difficult to get any work done.  All of these medical problems I have had long before I tried any JWH.  I never want to give it up, because I am loving being a functional person again.<br><br>
It is also great recreationally, but recreational amounts are not good during work.  I especially love taking it on my time off because it makes an hour feel like an entire weekend.  It sure is nice to have a weekend in the middle of the week.  It makes life so much better.  Life is wonderful now.  I have been doing this for about a year.<!-- End Body -->
