 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI have horrible insomnia, and I hadn't slept in four days. \r\nThat in itself was painful. On top of that, I was getting pretty damn stressed. I kept passing out at the wrong times during the day. \r\nI came home and tried to sleep for about an hour, but it was all in vain. Over the summer, I used to pop a few pills to 'knock me out' so I could sleep. I thought of it more as pills easing me into sleep. \r\nI usually think about things before I swallow them, but I was horribly desperate and most definitely wasn't thinking when I popped 6 350mg Somas--at once. Now, I'm pretty tiny physically, and even though I did pills frequently, I still had a pretty low tolerance.\r\nThey kicked in 10 minutes after I took them. I was on the phone with my friend, and he said that he had to go, and hung up--when in all actuality, he hung up and took a cab to my house!\r\nI was seeing double by then. I went outside to greet him, but couldn't really see him enough to hug him. He went inside and called the ambulance.\r\nI spent six hours in the hospital. I had to DRINK charcoal. I threw up a lot of it. It was a horrible, miserable, disgusting experience. Somas are fun, but take them in stride. Taking a lot of Somas is VERY DANGEROUS, especially if you are a lightweight, like me.\n\n\n"
