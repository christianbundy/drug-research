I've always been curious about the effects of nicotine, as I thought it must produce a good high for so many people to take the risks of smoking tobacco.  Not wanting to smoke tobacco myself, I went to a pharmacy and bought a 6 pack of Nicorette brand 10mg nicotine inhalators.  I prepared the inhalator, and began inhaling.  The packaging claimed 10 inhalations was equivilant to one inhalation from a cigarette, so I inhaled rapidly and deeply to try to get the same effects as a cigarette.  At the time I was with an experienced cigarette smoker, in safe surroundings.<br><br>
The initial effects were very subtle, a vague sense that something was different, but no 'high'.  I was feeling slightly apprehensive, but I continued to inhale, and began to get more effects.  The feeling is very much like caffeine side effects with none of the mental stimulation.  Jittery feeling, mild nausea, but I noticed no mental effects at all.  About 15 minutes later the nausea had built up enough that I stopped inhaling.  The cartridge is supposed to last 20 minutes, so I estimate my dose at about 7.5mg.<br><br>
The feeling of being mildly poisoned continued for a few hours, but it was easily tolerable.  I noticed a significant appetite suppression effect.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this drug.  My expectations were for a much better feeling, but I only got side effects and no high at all.  Despite having 50mg left, I don't plan on taking this drug again.<!-- End Body -->
