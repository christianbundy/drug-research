 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of my friends have done lage doses, (up to 100mg, which I dont recommend, although they love it), of AMT for the last half year or so off and on. I myself have been on the SSRI Celexa, so I could not try it myself. I decided to take myself off the medication. I got off the meds for 5 weeks and decided to try a low dose of AMT.<br>About 15 mg, i can't be exactly sure, but i had a 33mg pill, at least thats why my friend that sold it to me said, ad i split it in half into another gelcap.<br>T = 5:15 p.m. <br>Setting: Alone at home, music in background.<br>T + 1hr     Nothing yet, nothing but anticipation, almost everyone <br>            that i have read about said they got tweaked out. Not me<br>            I really had anticipation, i was nerveous, not tweaked.<br>T + 1.5hr   I feel a lightness to my step as i walk. It is very fun<br>            and intresting to just walk. And when i sit, i feel like<br>            i'm not quite touching the chair. This is quite fun.<br>T + 2       This is when i start to feel the results EXACTLY 2 hours<br>            after i took it, (to the min.). Many reports say that <br>            AMT crept up on them. This was not so with me, as i said<br>            i felt somthing different gradually, but the real effect<br>            came on like a switch in my brain. I found that every-<br>            thing that was once simple is now complex and <br>            wonderfully intresting, like i've never seen           <br>            it before. The shadows that my pen made as i worte down my<br>            thoughts as beautiful. I never did experience visuals,this <br>            disapoints me very much, but it was still fun. I did alot of  <br>            writing when i first felt the effects. <br>I wrote:<br>'Its like being high without the sense of confusion, everything is so clear' <br>Then i put down under that,<br>'Look at me, i'm quoting myself think, like i'm a reporter talking to my own brain'<br>I found a great sense of control over the amount of intoxication i felt. By focusing i could channel my thoughts into creative things, or just dream away into nothingness. This is a great feeling. My eyes were VERY dialated...very odd looking. i had hardly any color in my eyes, there was a huge pupil, and a small circle of color around that.<br>After the 2 hour mark it stayed like this for a half hour or so, and very gradually declined over into the morning. The only problem i had was a mild headache and a pain over my left eye. A frontal headache to be exact. I plan to try AMT at a higher dose nextime, maby 25mg, because i did not experience visuals. Talking on AMT is another thing i wish i got to do more, because i was alone i did not get to, but i did get a phone call, and i loved it. Talking to people is easy and you have great insight. I highly recommend AMT, but make sure you do not have conflicting medications.\n\n\n"
