Dose:  20mg.<br>
Application:  Crystals dissolved in tap water.<br>
Onset &amp; Duration:  In 15 minutes a distinct tingling sensation throughout my body. Within 40 minutes consciousness changed totally without visuals only light appeared brighter and after about 3 hours all the effects were gone and I found myself at baseline .<br><br><br>
I decided to take this compound on a nice warm evening at home while feeling very relaxed. This was the first time I tried this substance Ive had some other closely related substances and really enjoyed myself on them. To decide what dose I should take I whipped out the good old Tihkal and looked it up, after some reading I made the decision to try 20mg which seemed to be quite intense. I took out the vial with the compound and weighed it out precisely. The compound is quite sticky so it was hard to weigh without making a mess. After dissolving the powder in some tap water I drank it and the taste was really bitter; it reminded me of some medicine I had to take as a child. <br><br>
After about 15 minutes I felt a distinct tingle throughout my body it was very enjoyable and I put on some music at low volume on my headphones. Around the 30 minute point I felt the need to dance so I started dancing on the music alone in my room. My thoughts were flowing with great ease and I was having some interesting associations. After about ten minutes I sort of lost myself in the music and it felt to me that my whole body was pulsing and flowing with the rhythm of the music it became synchronized. <br><br>
I lost track of time at this point I continued the dancing for some time, after the dancing I wanted to drink something so I went downstairs and poured myself a glass of buttermilk. The taste of the milk overwhelmed me the intensity of the acidic taste gave a very nice feeling which ended with a shiver along my spine. I then sat down on the couch and started concentrating on my breathing. After taking a few very deep breaths I started to  feel how the oxygen was getting into my bloodstream and the carbondioxide leaving my body. <br><br>
The music changed from Celticcross to some rhythmic drumming with a background of forest sounds this was the point when everything changed and started to gain in intensity.<br>
I felt the urge to lie down on the couch so I did I experienced no visuals with opened eyes but after closing my eyes my inner world lit up. I started to get deeper and deeper into my own conscious- and unconsciousness both intertwined with one another and I found myself on the border of both seeing into both sides with a lot of clarity. <br><br>
I went deeper and deeper until I finally reached the core the true self. I visualized this as an Asian temple with a bright burning cone of energy in the middle. This I found quite awkward because Im not really involved with anything Asian but it felt as if I reached my core. I communicated with the core self through thought, the core was without all the baggage Ive gained over the years it was without my insecurities without my fears just the pure me. <br>
While staying in that place I learned a lot of things about myself. I saw how the death of my mother at a young age tore me up on the inside, before I thought that I was already over my mothers death but that wasnt true I just pushed all the emotions deep inside which left a lot of insecurities and fears.<br><br>
I had the visual of a symbolic burial of my mother putting her in the ground without blocking all my emotions and all the pain surfaced I cried for what seems a long time but it felt wonderful as if a huge weight was lifted of my chest. After this settled in I realized that I was deeply in love with a girl Ive been involved with for several years. I didnt want to accept all my feelings towards her what I think was the fear of loosing a person close to me so I acted like a asshole for the last couple of years. But I lost that I now accept that I have very deep feelings for that person and I stopped being afraid of the consequences.<br><br>
Ive lost a lot of fears and insecurities from this experience it has left a changed person I now feel that I have changed my look on life its such more open now more in contact with myself. I feel that I can now start with a new sleight without all the problems from the past just concentrating on my life and what I want to make out of myself and I also gained a new look on the way I relate to other people and my feelings towards them.<br>
I feel like I grew up a lot from this very intense experience I have gained so much and I can say now 2 weeks after the trip that it really did change me. This experience taught me  the true value of a psychedelic compound.<br>
This trip would be a ++++ experience on the shulgin scale and I can just hope to experience something as deep, personal and life changing like this trip.<!-- End Body -->
