Thanks to depression, anxiety, and an overall addictive personality, I can now say that I am addicted to caffeine, nicotine, cannabinoids, and now the novel antidepressant Effexor.<br><br>
I started taking Effexor in 2000 after a total depression/anxiety freak-out that resulted in my being referred to the day program at the local mental hospital. The docs gave me Effexor XR, 37.5 mg/day to start. <br><br>
It was evening when I took the first one. The next day I felt like a space cadet, almost as if I had been smoking hydroponic nuggets, but without any trace of buzz. Smoking just a little marijuana, regular-grade, blasted me in a big, big way. Over time I realized that it was more difficult to be negative about things, and that my mood was better in general. The pot-amping effects wore off, however. So far, so good, despite the fact that my shrink was a disinterested bonehead and my counselor was judgemental.<br><br>
Then I lost my job and insurance and therapy due to aftereffects of the freak-out, and hence went off the pills (75 mg/day by then) cold turkey after being on them for almost two months. Despite what I had heard of withdrawal issues, I experienced nothing of the sort. I then managed to deal with my problems on my own (and with caffeine, nicotine, and cannabinoids!) for a year and a half before going on St. John's wort, which worked a little bit.<br><br>
One doc I had tried me on Wellbutrin/Zyban for depression and smoking, but that wass like a speed rush, hence it did nothing for my anxiety or smoking. Back to St. John's....<br><br>
After a while my functioning kept decreasing, and I was getting more and more prone to extremely black fits of depression and sometimes panic attacks. So at the urging of my girlfriend, I went once more unto the breach of the American mental health system. I saw my internist and he gave me Paxil. After three days of zombie-like semi-consciousness and utter impotence leavened with an irrationally good mood, and having read horror stories of terrible witrhdrawals, ruined sex lives and massive weight gain, I got off the stuff. The doc then gave me Effexor, which I felt good about since I had no problems the last time I took it....<br><br>
Now I'm on 150 mg/day of the stuff. It does help my depression somewhat-- it's not perfect but I don't expect it to be. It does seem to exacerbate my anxiety though, so my doc suggests reducing dosage-- which then makes me depressed. Re-upping the dose makes me anxious and constipated. <br><br>
When I recently moved, I misplaced the meds. I didn't think it was a huge deal. The first day was fine. Towards the end of the second day, I began to feel strange. I can't describe it any better than that-- just a strange, half-mental half-physical feeling of something going rather awry. I was in a grocery store when the electric shock feelings started-- the spasm, the momentary disorientation, all that, just without the actual electrical feeling. They increased in duration and frquency and severity, and I realized that all the horror stories about Paxil apply to Effexor as well!! (No surprise that I gained almost 20 pounds since being on the stuff. At least I'm not impotent.) I ran home and frantically searched for-- and found-- my meds. Taking them relieved the electric and strangeness symptoms entirely.<br><br>
Now my depression and anxiety are worsening again. (Ever feel like killing yourself over not having anything in the fridge you want to eat? Now that's irrationality for ya!) I don't want to increase my Effexor dose, and I don't want to go off it as I'm afraid of the withdrawals. I don't want to switch to another med and have yet another bunch of side effects to get used to. I seem to be slowly losing my emotional connections to things (one of the reasons I went on meds in the first place!).<br><br>
Anti-depressants can be miracle drugs-- but I would reconsider taking them if you aren't suicidal. For me these are stronger drugs than they seem.<!-- End Body -->
