This report documents my experiences with a small dose of dxm, standard dose of paxil (paroxetine), and a large dose of depression.  I am a typical 18 year old psyconaught and had been going to a job corps trade program for 2 months, in an attempt to obtain my high school diploma and a welding certification.  I was very motivated and ambitous about starting a good life, until I got terminated from the school (yesterday) for providing a less than perfect urinary analysis.  I was depressed despite my paxil perscription which was, most likely, the only thing that kept me from entering an oblivious depressed insanity.  I noticed that there is a drug interaction between paxil and Dextromethorphan;  being intelligent on the topic of chems I note that both chemicals vastly increase levels of seratonin.   <br><br>
I am sitting home by myself the day after I am termed when I decided to eat 18 robo cough gels (dxm only).  Turned out to be 270mg of DXM.  I expected to have a siezure or have a repulsive, horrific seratonin syndrome experience.  But to my avail; I had a very euphoric, mind boggling rush of happiness much as marijuana gives you while on an SSRI like paxil.  It was as if everything was in it's place and I was making the best of my everything.  As I type this document 4 hours after the initial ingestion I am blatently striken by the ability to type while in this euphoric wormhole of dreams.   <br><br>
T+ 4:05   I run to the window and stare in amazement and extreme interest as a tow truck rids our parking lot of a drunk womans car (whom I just remembered can find some high grade MJ in this god-forsaken town) just before returning to the computer to finish my experience report.<br><br>
T+ 4:20   I would like to type more about my fading trip however I had a black out.  The last thing I remember is downing those lil red pills.<br><br>
I had robotripped 11 times in the past, but never on paxil.  I give the combination a 9 (due to seratonin syndrom potential).<br><br>
2 days later - for some valient, appreciative reason my depression seems to have been permenantly deleted scince the experience and I feel happy as I did before I even needed paxil!<br><br>
I recomend paxil for anyone who is depressed -- paxil/DXM for anyone who wants a complete and utter seratonin excape.<!-- End Body -->
