One day I was sitting at home and I realized I forgot to take my pills.  I am on 300mg Wellbutrin per day, and have been for about four months.  I was looking at my pill bottle and said, what the hell, I've snorted Wellbutrin before, smoking it would probably provide even more of an experience.<br><br>
WRONG!<br><br>
I take a certain pride in my artisanship towards drug paraphernalia, as I have made many a bong and been proud to use them.  I felt my inner artisan screaming to get out, so I went to my tool shop (my kitchen) and made an aluminum foil spoon by wrapping the foil around the spoon and molding it so it would be easy to hit.  I then removed the spoon, and I had a replica of the spoon that would transfer heat quicker and is also disposable!  <br><br>
After I made the spoon, I carefully loaded a weighed 20mg from the crushed 100mg pill I had onto the spoon.  I put my pen tube in my mouth, and fired up my lighter.  The Wellbutrin powder baked right away, and produced more smoke than I expected.  The powder turned a putrid black right away, and as I inhaled I could smell the smoke.  It smelled awful, like I just took a hit off of the smokestack of an oil refinery.  In fact my first instinct after smelling the smoke was to turn on the fan, as I knew others in my house would agree that it smelled horrendous!<br><br>
So, figuring I was smoking it, I thought the onset would be short.  So I waited.......and waited.........AND waited until I gave up hope.  One hour later I deemed the experiment a complete failure.<br><br>
It tastes horrible and provides no noticeable effect.<!-- End Body -->
