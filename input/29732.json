 "report": "<p>Well I must say that as usual the FDA is well off the ball about Piracetam. Even with a doctors prescription, CVS, (and all others) didn't even know what it is. So I went online, found a place in Belgium, and am feeling fine.</p><p>Back in 1999:</p><p>I used to love Mondo 2000, and when I was in Asia, I saw a box of the stuff, in 800mg tablet form. I bought it, and remembered reading 'High First Dose', and so took about 8 pills, the first time, and I must say wow. My sensory perception has always been good, but never so refined. I could pick up, and understand, the jist at least, of conversations in multiple languages. I now attribute my abilities in Laotian, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese to these little creamsicle color pills. </p><p>Now:</p><p>I now take a lesser dose about three times a week, more or less regularly and when it is working, 30-60mins. after ingestion, it just lifts me to a new playing field. I have always been a pretty creative guy, but once again, holy cow, this stuff is brilliant for making one think, or rather letting one think and following the thread of an idea consciously.</p><p>It really works for me, and have since experimented with other prescription nootropics, but Piracetam is my all time favorite. I have put the more adventurous of my freinds onto the stuff, with generally beneficial results.</p>"
