 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMade tea from 5 grams of voacanga africana root. I let it steep for an hour. Smells like ginseng, tastes fiery, awful. \r\n1:00 - Finished drinking the tea.\r\n2:30 - Mild stimulant effect, similar to caffeine. Not much else as far as I can tell.\r\n5:00 - Still feel the effect. It's not a bad caffeine substitute if not for the flavour.\n\n\n"
