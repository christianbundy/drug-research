I haven't done any drugs in quite some time. On my way to work, I bought a gram of Spice Gold from my local tattoo/head shop, which only ended up being 20 dollars. I wanted to try it, but I didn't want to be too ripped before work. So, during my lunch I pencil packed one tiny pinch into my Black and Mild. I thought it was just enough to get me a small buzz (I read reports it's like weed). I smoked 5 really big hits before I tasted the B&amp;M.<br><br>
20 Min. passed and it finally started to kick in, but once it started... it didn't stop. 10 minutes later, I was completely stoned (Extremely difficult for me to work with customers). I experienced mild delirium, time space distortion, major body tingles (mostly in the hands and face), the giggles, I spaced out alot. I honestly couldn't tell you it wasn't pot (aside from the fact it obviously wasn't). I also experienced some minimal paranoia, confusion, and extremely bad cotton mouth (gum and water come in handy).<br><br>
My inital high lasted about 5 hours. My come down was slow and almost minimal. I woke up the next day and after about 3 hours of light headedness, my high came back (although much milder), and did so about 3-4 times that day. When it would comeback, it would last 20min-1hour.<br><br>
It is an awesome legal high (and fairly inexpensive). I want to try Spice Diamond after I have finished my Spice Gold (Spice Diamond is 2x potency of Spice Gold). As a suggestion Do not drive! Do not use at work! (until you are confortable with it) get gum and plenty of water! Use responsibly! If you are too stupid and irresponsible with this, you'll ruin it for the rest of us (my state already outlawed Salvia bc of you morons!!!). Have fun! And remember, less like a rocket ship, and more like a balloon!<!-- End Body -->
