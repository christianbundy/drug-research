I had read that babies were given 65mg of liquid morphine to treat teething pains, and my friend had morphine from when his tonsils were removed, but never took the stuff.  I being the curious cat that I am begged him for it.  I used the baby dosage as a guide and decided to add a tad more.  I did some conversion, which I checked like 20 times and had mixed about 75mg of morphine to a glass of water.  I drank it slowly, for it had no real bad taste.  I waited about 30-40 minutes and then my body started to get a Vicodin buzz.  Very nice so far... loved it.  Then another 10-15 minutes and I was rolling back and forth on my bed holding my chest, for it felt as if someone had shot a bowling ball into my chest (sorta what that fat guy who got shot with a cannonball was feeling).  For the next hour it felt as if someone was hitting me in the same spot with a sludge hammer.<br><br>
This was the worst pain I had ever felt, and I've taking tons of pain in my life, being a skateboarder who breaks himself daily.  I then got a quick onset of nausea and bolted to the toilet just in time to puck until I started dry heaving.  I instantly knew that this was not the first time I would be praying to the porcelain god, so I got a pitcher of water and a glass, drinking cup after cup, with a puking session every 5 minutes or so for the next hour.  Finally I exasperatedly stumbled back to my bed where the chest pains continued to plague me.  I debated calling 911, but I didn't want to get in trouble for I was on probation.  I am sure that if anyone else was there (No one was home), they would have called the ambulance in the blink of an eye.<br><br>
I learned a few things from this experience:<br>
1) I should never try new drugs without a sitter<br>
2) I should start out with tiny amounts of new substances<br>
3) I should thouroughly research dose levels before testing them <!--and if you must try this or know better directions, be prepared and be careful!--><br><br>
You couldn't pay me to do that shit again!<!-- End Body -->
