 "report": "<p>I took Tramadol several times early 2001. I initially started with a dose of 100mg to see what it did. I felt some mild effects, but they were barely noticeable.</p><p>Over the course of the next few weeks, I experimented with doses of around 200 to 300 milligrams. The effects were mostly pleasurable, including light sedation, relaxation of the body, and a general pleasant buzz. </p><p>However, I noticed that the more frequently I took Tramadol, the more frequently negative effects would appear. These negative effects included nausea, severe insomnia, trembling, and occasional vomiting. I also noted an increase in irritability while on Tramadol. Other mild side effects included itching, a cold nose, and decrease in appetite.</p><p>On a couple occasions, I took 400mg doses, and this turned out to be VERY unpleasant. I immediately experienced acute nausea, twitching, and incredible insomnia, with episodes of momentary lapses in consciousness. The effects lasted usually around 18 hours. All in all, very disphoric.</p>"
