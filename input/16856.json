 "report": "<p>\nI had a fairly nasty ride on Adderall and Wellbutrin the other day for a good 24 hours or so. (120 mg time-released Adderall + 2 weeks@300 mg/day of wellbutrin)   It was like your garden variety amphetamine psychosis, I suppose.  </p><p>But I've never before been that convinced I was having a stroke and a heart attack simultaneously, while someone was following me around collecting my skin and hair fragments as evidence in proving my guilt for a misdemeanor of some sort I haven't committed yet that will be a felony in 5 years. A recent visit from a 'special agent' regarding the titles of some school projects I e-mailed to a teacher didn't help to assuage my fears that I was the target of some conspiracy during those 24 hours, nor the news headlines announcing plans for 4% of Americans (truck drivers, waitresses and such) to be employed as snitches.</p><p>I don't smoke anything illegal, and I'm trying to quit the legal stuff, but I reccommend against taking Adderall and wellbutrin together.</p>"
