So I've had trouble remembering dreams for years... don't know exactly when it started.  I've wanted to do something about it, but wasn't really sure how... So, I figured that I'd give the Calea a whirl.  I simmered 1 1/2 tbl spoons of calea plant matter in 1 1/4 cup of filtered water for aproximatly 18 minutes and filtered the plant matter out with a standard strainer.  The brew was the most bitter thing ever.  It was like drinking the essence of bitter.  Gods but it was awful....<br><br>
I watched a movie and drank down the draught in the process.  When it was finished, I was quite tired and laid down to go to bed.  Immediately, I noticed the effects.  I began to see extremely colourful geometric patterns behind my eyelids.  I would even call it psychedelic.  <br><br>
I fell asleep quickly.  I had several dreams which I only half recall, and one that I vividly recall that was quite long.  Strange things happened like one of my friends suddenly sprouted wings... and at another point, there were odd stripes of colour over another friend's face.  All very vivid.  I am interested to see what happens when its smoked, and will try that tonight I believe.<!-- End Body -->
