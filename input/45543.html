Before my ambien experience, I hadnt taken any pills. I smoke Marijuanna moderatly (weekends) and salvia on a few occasions.<br><br>
I took one 10 mg pill of Ambien, waited 20 minutes and did not feel very much except for tired so I took my second. At the 50 minute mark (50 minutes from the first pill, 30 from the second) I was extremely messed up. The setting was my computer, lights were off and I had a nice big bottle of cold water next to me. I was in comfortable clothes for sleeping and made sure I was as comfortable as could be. I put some Dave Matthews (chill, relaxing music). Pretty much I was perfectly prepared, but that still didnt save me from what was going to happen.<br><br>
I was on nothing else that night (sober for 5 days). I started rocking back and fourth in my chair. I was hallucinating quite a bit. I was talking with a friend on the computer at the time. And while talking to him I had the impression that there were many people in my room. I realized that I was just tripping, but the hallucinations were getting pretty strong. I looked through my monitor, to my wall to see an old man opening a Religious text. So you'd think everything was well, my computer appeared to be moving... And I thought there were people hiding in my closet.<br><br>
Nausea set in. The nausea was very unpleasant, and I began to throw up so I ran to my bathroom holding my mouth shut with both hands and threw up a brown/purple color vomit. I regretted taking the pill that day only because of the Nausea. Shortly after throwing up I decided to go to sleep. I closed my eyes, and with my eyes closed the hallucinations were extremely strong and artistic. Pianos, monkeys, religious texts, and martial arts all appeared in my mind. I fell asleep and found it hard to remember anything for about 7 hours.<br><br>
Ambien is a hell of a drug. Strong and vivid. I dont think i'll be doing it for a while, maybe next time i'll snort it.<!-- End Body -->
