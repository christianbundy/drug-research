I've got this trip report on my chest for a some time, and I think I have to share. It is a few months old.<br><br>
So, I'm alone at my home, nobody's around, I feel pretty good and decide to test for the second time some 2c-I. Little aside: I've taken 15mg about a year ago with some friends strolling around the city at night and it was amazing and very fun.<br><br>
T+0:00: I wasn't really hungry, had eaten some chocolate cake, had a Tennent's Super beer about a hour before, and dropped 14mg.<br><br>
Come up was nothing special, reminded of shrooms, yawning, feeling cold and a bit of muscle tension. Nothing unbearable. Got myself under the bed sheets when the curtains in front of me start to get very complex patterns. Cool, it's getting up. I decide to listen some music.<br><br>
T+2:00: I put on Maggot Brain by Funkadelic. If you don't know this album, you have to listen to it. I already discovered in the past trip that 2c-I gives a totally new dimension to music. The difference is like looking to a painting of a scenery compared to seeing the scenery with your own eyes.<br><br>
I'm a musician, so I'm quite mentally active while listening to a piece, and in this psychedelic state, I would notice that dissonant chords or sad phrases would actually make me sad, while tonal resolution put me at peace and joy.<br><br>
Let me explain that: during the trip I passed quickly from being a bit uncomfortable to being totally ecstatic, all in sync with the music and the consonance/dissonance of the music. It seemed like my thoughts were music and music was my thoughts. It was totally amazing.<br><br>
T+4:00: Trip is at full force. Cannot stand still due to the little muscle tension. The only way to feel physically amazing was to dance, which I love, and I did. Now the musical resolutions were giving me full body orgasms, very similar to MDMA waves. I caught myself rolling on the bed astonished by those pleasant feelings. I think I had them for a couple of hours, about 50 different times.<br><br>
T+6:00: Still tripping, but a little less extreme. I decide (bad idea) to fire up the vape with some very good hash (not used to quality pot, but I've been smoking this kind for a few days). Funny aside, sucking from the whip felt like sucking something very dense, like melt chocolate, instead of vapor.<br><br>
I feel a bit tired, so decide to stop the music and try to close my eyes to sleep. Upon stopping, I start to think 'maybe it is not the correct moment to stop this music now, I have to wait for the right chord progression which will leave me feeling good'. I start to panic, because I can't find the right moment or songs, and everything goes downhill from there.<br><br>
T+6:30: Anxiety at 100%, questioning my own sanity (will I ever return normal?), can't stand still and I feel my heart is going to explode. I get palpitations when smoking, I try not to care but I get uncomfortable. I do not know if I'm going to be insane forever or I'm gonna die this night, and there is no other option in my mind at the moment.<br><br>
I call my best friend, explain my situation, he tries to calm me down but every question he makes me (are you ok?) are not questions, are riddles which only one answer will save me. My anxiety gets worse at every phrase, every question. I start to think I have to let myself die. I drop on the floor, nothing happens, this is not the correct answer, panic.<br><br>
I call the ambulance. I show them the powder and hash, they ask me some questions and I feel they are unreal, I'm actually dying, what I'm seeing is all in my head and their voices are saying 'don't give up now, stay awake' (like when someone is dying or getting into coma). I can't get out of the though loop.<br><br>
They drove me to hospital, I ask for a some sedative which they give me, and slowly my split personality start to rejoin: the sober one which wants to live and get over it, the other one which thinks I'm dying. Actually at this point I do not care if I'm gonna die or not. I've accepted it. I finally calm down, get a cab and go home. They returned me the 2c-I. Great people.<br><br>
Sorry for this <i>huge</i> report, but I think there are two things worth noting:<br><br>
- I've read that 2c-I is not particularly mentally psychedelic, only nice colors. Huge bullshit.<br><br>
- Be careful with weed, it is very potent and many forget this. I really think weed made me enter that thought loop, because I've been tripping 6 hours and felt over the world.<!-- End Body -->
