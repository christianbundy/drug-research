 "report": "<p>Started out smoking 2 grams of the dream herb followed by ingestion of 5 grams in tea. I waited one hour after ingestion to load the spice pipe with freshly washed and dried spice. Burnt most of the spice up.</p><p>The experience was way more intense than I expected, colors were brighter and there were more of them than I have ever experienced on other trips.  The whole trip lasted two hours, the first hour very intense the second far less, only visuals came with the lights off.</p><p>Went to sleep soon after only to wake up from numerous dreams at least I thought I woke up, but each time I awoke it was just to another dream state. Crazy dreams really bad nightmares with disturbing bloody images.  I was lucid to the point, I knew I was dreaming, but was afraid I would never wake up. Will try again soon.</p>"
