FEW QUICK NOTES<br>
Ive noticed the last time I submitted a report for Quaaludes that I was only the second submitter. I wanted to change that. There arent enough reports on methaqualone. Especially, there arent any reports for methaqualone alone [INTRODUCTION + PART 1].<br><br>
I came back home from college, and I was feeling good about being back. I had 2 finals earlier in the day, so I wanted to relax at home. I didnt prepare for the experience at all, except I put out a piece of paper and a pencil on my desk to start writing. The [] marks indicate what Ive added to the report after Ive awoken from the dream (came out of Quaaland).<br><br>
PRELUDE<br>
I understand that it isnt as common as your house fly, but its around. Canada has it. Other countries have it too. If its still being made, someone can bring it into the United States. Im talking about methaqualone (Quaaludes).<br><br>
As I remember from all of my past experiences, I passed out. This is one of those drugs that knocks me out, and I dont get to enjoy your experience. HOWEVER, its like acid, in that I always have an interesting story to tell. Just the mention of Quaalude, and I've got the attention of the room. Its something people dont hear much about, but its not as if its a substance thats awaiting its rediscovery.<br><br>
Date: 5/10/03<br>
To Room: Quaaland [and beyond]<br>
From Room: Sober City<br>
TimeLv: 12:13am<br><br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
12:22_A minor ache has been accentuated [manifested] within my brainial cavity [brain]. My heart has also begun to battle for its own attention. A noticeable skip in my palpitation, and Ive dropped. As I continue to descend, the external environment is dying out. My system is shutting down, which is causing an experience of becoming a dream. I am a dream, and the events that are about to follow this introduction shall be considered purely driven by imagination. [Quaaludes put me in a state of extreme sleepiness; therefore, everything seemed like I dreamed it the next day. (Thats why Ive decided to write this report while under the influence.)]<br><br>
DO NOT think you understand my dream. I continue with my memory. I am aware of who I am. This causes my concern to unfold, and my worry to elevate. My dream is real. However, I refuse to believe that I will finish these words while managing a hold over my controlled processes. Sooner or later, Ill be forced to let go.<br><br>
12:41_My scalp has begun to tingle ever so innocently. Still insignificant at this point, I divert my attention to something that would [hold my] interest upon my awakening. What could that be? Certainly not tingles.<br><br>
12:50_Nicodevil. Cancer pal. The death stick. [Cigarette.]<br><br>
PART 1<br>
1:42_The past hour can be illustrated with an explanation of further plummet. As the digital clock counts down to my demise, I progress into the negative state of conscious[ness]. Tiredness and fatigue continue to manifest within my being, as I fall deeper into nothingness. The indicator of primacy was the strong inclination to close my eyes [and the burning pain in the eyes associated with the pain of waking up from a night of sleep with contact lenses in]. As I lied down to relax, my body tended towards the point of death [(figuratively speaking)]. Standing back up became problematic due to the body weight increase [brought on my the loss of muscle strength]. In addition to the effect of drowsiness, Im losing focus, memory, and jogging along the path towards sleep deprivation [(feeling that I havent slept in days)]. Whats next? A possible strong desire to drop to the floor and bring about my own existence to a stand still [sleep]? [Thats what happened the last time I took 2 Quaalude pills at once.]<br><br>
2:30_Car. Demontine, suffocation by tar [cigarette]. Wawa. Classic turkey BLT.<br>
The plan.<br><br>
Once I got up (2:07), I could not maintain my balance. I hope I hold enough power to accomplish my goals. Why am I making this (disastrous) decision? My fears have dissolved into the unconscious. I am not fully aware of my current state.<br><br>
DOWNERS. Youre rushed to the ground, and you dont have enough of what you need to bounce back. Hopefully, the tobacco chemicals cancel out some of my imbalance and partial deadness.<br><br>
[On my way into Wawa, I realized that I couldnt walk straight. I was swaying back and forth, left to right, like I was drunk as fuck. Although, people wouldnt make that assumption. They would rather assume that I was under the influence of drugs, seeing as how my other characteristics didnt hint at the fact that I was drunk, nor high on weed. My face was straight. My eyes were open. The only other difference that I myself have noticed, besides the imbalance effect, was that my voice has been suppressed. When I approached the counter, I could barely even hear myself say hi. Before I walked away, he asked me if the drink on the counter was mine. At that point, I got the chance to experience firsthand that I was capable of understanding other human beings. What also fascinated me was that I was able to reason a response automatically, and I answered no. Afterwards, I got into my car. Before I drove away, I lit up another cigette and took a moment to enjoy the relaxed state I was in.]<br><br>
PART 2<br>
3:00_I opened a bottle of Carib Lager. Plan 2: down it, and then go outside for a cig and a piss. Then its back inside to catch the rest of SNL and snack on a Butterfinger. [I could reason at the time that I wouldnt be able to do much after I downed the beer, so I didnt make too many plans for afterwards.]<br><br>
Objective: get more fucked up and drop down further below Quaaland [not satisfied with methaqualone alone in my system because its not euphoric.]<br><br>
3:32_[I came to a conclusion:] popping a Quaalude + waiting over 2 hours + drinking a beer = F UC KK E D U P. The Quaalude is a cemetery, and Im a tombstone. [Meaning, if I got lost in a forest, Id walk around the same tree for a few minutes and then pass out onto an anthill. Meaning, Quaaludes are capable of leading you to do some of the stupidest shit you could never imagine yourself doing.]<br><br>
I cannot keep balance. I cannot keep consciousness. I will now [under drug-induced obligation] fulfill the rest of my necessary storyline.<br><br>
I think I may have lost reasoning. I am death. Hear me snore.<!-- End Body -->
