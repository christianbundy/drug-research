 "report": "<p>Bored at my house, my buddy and I decided to get drunk. We sipped from a bottle of Smirnoff and achieved something of a buzz. The liquor was fun, but my friend reminded me that I had a 200 mg Seroquel pill in my wallet. I ground the pill up, and snorted half of it, my friend finishing the other half. We left my house to walk around, at which point I started feeling disassociated from my brain. There was no euphoria, just this empty feeling. We bought cigarettes, and returned home, where my friend proceeded to fall asleep on my bed. I stayed awake, but wrestled with fatigue until a few friends came over to behold our dead-end night. My friend woke up and tried in vain to socialize. Everything he said seemed random. Everyone left 20 minutes later. I fell asleep instantly, waking up once to rinse my parched throat. </p><p>The next day, I was extremely irritable. Anything that had the potential to piss me off did. This drug is no fun.</p>"
