 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nJust a quick note to contribute my experience with this substance which spans over a year now.  I do not have an addiction and while I enjoy the pleasant effects of alcohol and other items, I never feel any withdrawal or cravings. <br>Here's what I have observed:<br>First effects: About T+20 minutes.<br>Full effects:  About T+60 minutes.<br>Daytime usage: OK.  Able to function just fine.<br>Evening usage: Very pleasant. Relaxed. Well-being. Comfortable. Great for web-surfing, reading, listening to music.<br>Night usage:   My most frequent usage.  I believe usage makes it more difficult to fall asleep. I do feel very relaxed and pleasant while Im trying though.  Once I fall asleep, I tend to wake often.  While this usually bothers the hell out of me, I feel absolutely wonderful when this happens on Ultram.  Euphoric, relaxed, slight fingertip numbness.<br>Aftereffects:  Even if I had trouble falling asleep or awoke several times during the night, I rise feeling great, relaxed, and well rested.<br>Side Effects:  Slight but noticeably increased itching.<br>Overall:      A really pleasant, relaxing experience with little or no downside and no withdrawal or addiction danger (at least with me).<br>Other:  I tried to experiment by adding a Soma to the mix and found the experience to be very satisfactory.  Helps reduce the tendency to lie awake when first retiring.\n\n\n"
