My friends, whom I will call E and A, convinced me one day to go out and smoke some hookah with them. While we were sitting around smoking strawberry tobacco, I ingested two 100mg Seroquels. Around thirty minutes to an hour later, I began to feel the effects.  I had done my research on Seroquel, and surprised to see that it also doubled as an antipsychotic, and not only a tranquilizer, which is what I had recieved them for.<br><br>
Around 9 PM, I got up to go out and have a cigarette, and realized that I couldn't lift my legs easily. It felt weird, but mostly good.<br><br>
Around 10:39 PM, I started to feel really drowsy, sort of the drowsy-euphoria I get from Xanax. After a while, these effects usually get stronger, as they caused me to pass out in the early morning (1 AM), but up until then, I was actually having a good time. Most of the time, I got this weird sort of tunnel vision, in which I could only see directly in front of me, and everything else appeared to be simply out of focus. While watching TV, I bumped my head into it when I forgot how much closer I was moving to get a better view. <br><br>
All in all, Seroquel has an amazing trip, albeit the shitty aftertrip, but hey, by then it'll be morning.<!-- End Body -->
