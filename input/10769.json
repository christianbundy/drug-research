 "report": "<p>\nI had done a little reading about this wonderful herb on the internet but found no information about it here on erowid.  That surprised me as this is probably my favorite resource.</p><p>I am still high on Sceletium as I type this.  Its been about half an hour since I finished smoking.  This is a pretty subtle plant, comparable to a mild pot high, with a bit more euphoria and a bit less body high.  I have yet to try ingesting it orally, I'll save that experiment for next week.  This is a good recreational substance, and would be great for relaxing after a long day or hanging out with friends.  Not much more than that, but definitely fun.</p>"
