 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nOne day I was bored, so I decided to check our medicine cabinet to see what drugs we have. I found a bottle of caffeine pills, so I downed 7 pills. I had read up on it, not expecting anything special, just some energy.\r\nBit of energy.. right. I spent the next 9 hours in my bed shaking and feeling sick. It felt like constant panic attacks. I finally fell asleep and felt tired the next morning.\r\nAnd yes, I'm skinny, so 700 mg affected me. To think that I almost took 15 pills (about 15 cups of coffee). Caffeine's good and all, just don't take too much.\n\n\n"
