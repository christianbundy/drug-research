Shortly after 2pm, my friends and I pulled into the park. Three of them had taken 10mg of moxy about an hour earlier, and two of those took another 10mg while I took two capsules (20mg total) concurrently. <br><br>
We walked around for around an hour before any of us really started feeling anything. At first, I felt something that was very similar to being high. I was slightly lightheaded, everything was funnier and my heart was beating just a little faster than normal. Shortly after these effects started, my friends and I decided to smoke some weed to help 'kick-off' the trip. As soon as I took a hit, my visuals starting increasing tremendously along with some amazing audio distortion. After several more hits, I was legitimately tripping. My mind was racing, my heart was beating and I was beginning to feel absolutely amazing. <br><br>
After about another half hour of walking through the trails, I began to trip so much harder. From this point on, I was shaking almost uncontrollably. My heart was now beating at almost twice its normal rate, and I was rapidly becoming dehydrated from being in the sun all day. I drank a water bottle, and then another. I tried to eat a nature bar, but my mouth was so dry that I couldn't. My friends noticed that I was struggling and told me to lay down. I did, for a while, but the drug made me have an urge to do something, so I went for a walk to find some of my other friends. <br><br>
By the time I found my friends (which I later found out was only a few hundred feet away), my shirt was completely drenched in sweat. My friends were talking about laying in the stream, so I joined them. Unfortunately, I was laying directly in the sun, and this is where things get worse. <br><br>
One of my friends had brought a camera with him and had been filming intermittently. After laying in the sun for a while, my friend came up to me with the camera, and I asked him how I had gotten there. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was having a heat stroke. I became incoherent rapidly. I lost control of most of my body and if my friend hadn't been holding my hand and guiding me, I would have fallen down or gotten lost.<br><br>
At this point, the combination of the heat stroke and the intense moxy trip caused me to black out entirely. The next three hours were a blur of feelings, emotions, colors, memories, patterns, dreams, hallucinations, etc. Basically, everything except what was actually going on. I could only occasionally see reality, but those moments were few and far between.<br><br>
Eventually, the sober person in our group noticed how badly I was doing. I couldn't respond to questions, I couldn't remember where I was, or how I'd gotten there. For a while, I couldn't remember who I was at all. I lost all sense of time, meaning, attachment and basically everything else. When she realized how bad I was, we started heading back toward the car. The next 45 minutes was an absolute blur. The few things I remember from the car trip are these: 1) We were in my car. 2) I wasn't driving. 3) I had extremely intense sexual feelings toward the driver. 4) I forgot that I wasn't driving, so I tried to grab the wheel repeatedly.<br><br>
When we got back to my place, my brother tried to talk to me, but I couldn't even speak. He called my other brother who told him to rush me to the hospital. I'm a little hazy on the details, but the next thing I knew, I was in the hospital. <br><br>
I was still tripping in the hospital, but not very hard. After I had a saline drip and a few glasses of water, I was almost back to normal. I talked to my mom about my trip, and she seemed disappointed, but she was just glad that I was okay. I had come really close to dying, apparently. <br><br>
Even though all of that happened, I still had a good trip, however. The visuals were amazing, I had a positive feeling about life, I knew that my friends and family really did care for me and I somehow broke my aversion to touch. <br><br>
I can't really describe what it was like, but I will try. Have you ever seen the painting of the infinite staircase? Well, that's exactly how my life felt. For about three hours, I was tripping so hard, that I had entirely tripped out of reality and I was stuck in some sort of time-loop that somehow intersected with brief moments in reality. Every 30 seconds or so, my mind would flash through the last several hours and I would be wondering what was real and what was purely imaginary. <br><br>
Personally, I think moxy is a good drug, but you have to be prepared for it. I unwisely decided to take two at the same time, without ever using this drug before. I also have a history of problems with the heat / sun, and a history of heart issues in my family. I will be using this drug again, but in a smaller dose and a much safer environment. Moxy is an interesting drug, but don't underestimate its effects.<!-- End Body -->
