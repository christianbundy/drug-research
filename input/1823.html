&gt; What is the possibility of ending up in a psych hospital from using either of these? <br>
&gt; I have a friend that took a handful at the NV testsite this summer. He <br>
&gt; experienced thre days of intense delirium. On his third day he showed up<br>
&gt; at my doorstep in Salt Lake City and proceded to tell me the story with <br>
&gt; full hyper-metaphoric-spiritual insight detours over the course of about<br>
&gt; three or four hours (it might have been more--the memory, y'know).<br>
&gt; Anyway, this winter he still insists that he has not fully recovered. <br>
&gt; Apparently this is the deal: the seeds are *HEAVY*DUTY* If you <br>
&gt; are seriously into fucking with (remapping) your head in seriously chaotic <br>
&gt; ways--this is your 'vehicle' if you think you can survive it (my friend <br>
&gt; probably almost didn't). A much milder version of this trip (one that is, <br>
&gt; so I have heard, relatively safe) can be had by making a tea with the<br>
&gt; leaves. I have not tried this and do not specifically recall anyone else <br>
&gt; who had first-hand experience. My friend threw the remainder of his seeds <br>
&gt; out the window, so perhaps in the spring.... <br>

I can confirm the validity of the description above from my own experience. This was from a TEA made out of the leaves of Datura Stramonium. If you want hallucinations this is your drug. However 'you' are not there to experience them. This stuff takes over completely and irreversibly for at least 24 hours. Stupidly, I went out while the effects had not yet fully started. After having been thrown out of a bar, where I was desperately searching for my briefcase that was suposed to be there someplace (but which i hadn't even with me ) I found myself in a city that i did not recognize. I did not remember where I came from, where to go, what do do, who I was, let alone what I was doing there at this time of night, nor did I have any clue how to get 'home' as far as there was still a conception of what home might be. There was complete retrograde amnesia: no access to any knowledge at all. In the mean time I had encounters with people I knew that were able to do a disapearing act. Just by standing behind a light pole they could make themselves invisible. (This must be the 'witches sabbath' hallucination , which seems recurrent in this type of delirium: the very very real hallucination of speaking with people). Also I was constantly hallucinating that I was smoking a cigarette, which whould suddenly disappear leaving me searching the street, thinking that i dropped it. Witches are actually shrubs growing in front yards (they live underground, the branches are the hairs) Lots and lots of little bugs hand each other berries along branches. I must have walked the same street 50 times back and forth Wanting to get somewhere, forgetting were i was going to or were i was in the first place. A small statue of a child alongside the road started laughing and laughing harder and harder every time i passed, it was a ridiculous sight to see this idiot come by for the 40th time, even for a statue. And so on . For 24 hours. It was a really interesting experience, not a nice one, I could not see straight for a week (due to anticholinergic parasympatholytic effect of atropine/scopolamine.)<br><br>
Only for those who want to be able to say that they tried EVERYTHING.<!-- End Body -->
