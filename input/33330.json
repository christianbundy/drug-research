 "report": "<p>After reading about DHEA for a while I decided to try it. I noticed an increase in concentration ability within an hour or two, and was initially very impressed with the results. By the second day, I noticed my body temperature had gone up a small amount.</p><p>The third day the concentration effects had gone away, only to be replaced with a nagging headache. Nothing bad, I could ignore it, but it was very annoying. This usually signifies a bad reaction of some sort. I tried several combinations of vitamin/mineral supplements to see if the headache was caused by some deficiency, with no result. </p><p>After 1 week, I stopped the use of DHEA as I only noticed marginal results, and plenty of side effects. Within a couple of days, the side effects listed below have disappeared. </p><p>Pros: Increased mental clarity (marginal) </p><p>Increased stamina/strength to some degree. </p><p>Cons: Headache</p><p>Poor sleep quality resulting in being continually tired.</p>"
