One night me and my girlfriend were sitting around and we were about to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas so I busted out my shrooms and began munching away. About 30 minutes later I was already in the full swing of my high. While I was tripping out my girlfriend and I started messing around and I began to eat her out. While I was eating her out I began to see a rainbow of colors all flowing towards me. They started out slow but gradually got faster and faster and the colors got brighter and brighter except for a circle in the middle of all the colors, this was just a black sphere. Soon enough this black sphere began to take different shapes and the shapes seemed to change every time my girlfriend moaned. I saw a dog chasing his tail at one point. All of a sudden these images stopped but the colors kept going. Just as my girlfriend was about to orgasm, Jesus showed up in the black sphere. He had his arms out and he had a huge smile on his face and it seemed as though he was nodding at me with his approval and sure enough as soon as my girlfriend orgasmed he disappeared.<!-- End Body -->
