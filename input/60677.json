 "report": "<p>I am writing to voice my positive experiences with Wellbutrin.  I became addicted to Adderall in senior year of high school in order to make straight As.  I did, and went on to a great college, but that's not the point.  My addiction was so bad that I started taking it from friends and I even got arrested for it once.</p><p>Anyways, Wellbutrin has made the appeal of uppers literally non-existent.  I have no desire to obtain directly or otherwise stimulants of any kind, aside from a free line of yay.  I am SO happy that's amphetamines are OUT of my life. The quality of my life has improved so greatly.  So I am now a few months into Wellbutrin, and aside for an occasional rash on my arm or something it has done MUCH more than it is prescribed for. It gives me a natural boost throughout the day, no jitters or euphoric high, just a pleasant natural energy.  It helps me concentrate better than amphetamines because I am not so easily distracted like I used to be when I was wired.  It also completely eliminated any pleasure from smoking a cigarette.  I was only an occasional smoker, but I literally could not get any buzz or relaxation from them and as a result I cut them off entirely.  It does a mildly satisfactory job of curbing my appetite.  It also increases my sexual pleasures.  In summary, Wellbutrin is a miracle drug!</p>"
