 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSo I was perscribed trazodone, after returning from overseas as a sleep aid. Well it says only to take 25-50mg for sleep, but hey lets be honest, I was looking for a high. Anyways, I ate a fairly large dinner, and then I took 4 50mg pills of trazodone. After 15-20 mins, started feeling the drowsy, sleepy feeling. NO real mood change besides being relaxed, What really suprised me the most is that the next day (at a job I despise) I was happy, looking on the bright side of everything. Felt good! It slightly wore off around noon, but none the less I had a nice sleep and a little groggy wake up, but a nice day and no bad after effects.\n\n\n"
