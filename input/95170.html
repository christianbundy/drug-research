I had first heard of K a long time ago, and had been curious about it ever since, in large part because of the experience reports that described it as having a lot of spiritual potential. However, for whatever reasons, I have almost never encountered it.<br><br>
Recently however, I came across a friend who was telling me about their experiences with it, and after hearing that I had never been able to experience it, we worked something out. I have a good deal of trust in this person, and when I was told that it was more or less pure, I believe that. I have heard others make this sort of claim about other things, when it is clearly not true, but in this case, I believe it was fairly pure. Maybe not 100%, but probably in the range of 90-95%.<br><br>
After spending several days reading up on the substance and a lot of experience reports, I decided to give it a try. I have tried dissociatives before, specifically DXM and nitrous, so I was expecting something similar. However, it had been a long time since I took a higher dose of DXM, so I think I was expecting something a little less psychedelic and a little more intoxicating.<br><br>
It was a weekday, and I did have responsibilities the next day, so it may not have been the ideal time to try something like this, but I was pretty excited about trying something new, so I ignored the part of me saying to hold off. I had eaten a few hours before, so my stomach wasnt complete empty, but I also wasnt hungry. I was alone in my apartment, and it was around 22:45h that I decided to do it.<br><br>
What follows is a combination of notes taken from during the experience itself, and my recollections and reflections after the fact.<br><br>
22:45 (+0): Took a large line (estimated at between 80-120mg), which burned more than I thought it would, but wasnt terrible. I had prepared some relaxing music and turned a visualizer on the TV. I had also prepared a bag just in case I needed to vomit, and a piece of paper to take notes of the experience on.<br><br>
22:48 (+3min): Feeling relaxed, as though I had just drank maybe 2-3 beers. My perception of motion seems to lag slightly. Turned on the music I had prepared, which was very relaxing, mellow, and enjoyable.<br><br>
22:51 (+6): Right now I feel as though Im pretty drunk, and noticing momentum right now. Once I get up and start moving, its easy to stay moving. If I stop though, I feel very lethargic and slightly heavy.<br><br>
22:54 (+9): Thinking a balloon of nitrous would go really good well right now.<br><br>
23:00 (+15): The balloon hit me hard, and I seemed to temporarily dissolve. By that I mean I went from inhaling to returning. Somewhere in between, I had lost nearly all awareness of myself, my surroundings, and everything else. I guess you could call it a very brief black out. I noted here that it felt similar to the combination of DXM and alcohol. The visualizer on the TV is very hypnotizing, I find myself staring at it like an idiot, and getting lost in the kaleidoscopic imagery. I got up briefly to change the music, so I am still able to move around, but it was not an easy task. I found myself stumbling quite a bit and being mostly uncoordinated.<br><br>
23:04 (+19min): I feel as though Im sinking into my couch. Feels very cosmic  life &amp; deathy  not that Im in any way near that gate but just a very all-encompassing perspective. For some reason the mysteries of life and death crossed my mind. Its not that I felt for even a second that I was about to die or anything like that, but I became very aware of mortality  something that often happens during psychedelic experiences for me. This spawned an interesting chain of thoughts about how change is an integral part of reality. Reality is change. Inevitably I will lose all of those who are close to me and that I care about, even myself. This got me to start thinking about what I am doing with my life, and how I am spending every precious moment that we have. Suddenly I found myself heavily under the influence, and felt kind of guilty for messing with my ability to simply experience life (after all, its hard to be very aware when youre bordering on a k-hole). I reflected like this for a few minutes, before other thoughts came up.<br><br>
23:11 (+26): Near the peak here. I feel quite content and happy. I had a weird experience with moving. Its as though there were reverse echoes of me moving in space-time. What I meant by this was that I felt almost like I had already gotten up to do something before I had actually done so. I'm not sure if that makes much sense, but it made sense at the time. I was also aware of the neural impulses to move (if that's even possible). I felt them getting stronger until they reached a certain level of intensity at which point I almost involuntarily got up to adjust the music. I felt very heavy, and noted that aside from writing these notes, moving took a lot of effort and energy. I changed the music back to something very relaxing and minimal, as anything more than that was too stimulating and made me uncomfortable.<br><br>
23:17 (+32): I noted that the experience at this point was very similar to the feeling I get after taking a few hits of nitrous, except very prolonged. I also felt some resistance here to letting go and really immersing myself in reality and my experience. I realized this applied not only to my altered consciousness, but also my day-to-day consciousness and life as well.<br><br>
23:28 (+43): Time is doing weird things. I was able to go all the way to the bathroom just now (which involved some stairs, so my coordination must have been returning slightly). I also decided that wearing a belt was entirely too uncomfortable, so I threw it off. Problem was now my pants kept falling down, but since I wasn't moving around much, I didn't really care, and it was actually much more comfortable without a belt.<br>
I decided to do another balloon here. It was a chore to fix it up, and it didn't seem to have that much of an effect on me. Afterwards, I found it helpful to remind myself that I was going to come down eventually. Since time was still doing weird things and dilating, this was actually helpful, since a few minutes would sometimes go by really quick and other times really slow.<br><br>
Throughout my experience so far, I got the feeling here and there of being watched. It was a weird feeling, and was probably just me being paranoid.<br><br>
23:45 (+60): Definitely coming down  everything is way slowed down  thinking, motion, perception. I feel very relaxed though. Just laying on the couch, having a daydream about my dream girl. My mind is all over the place, but I have a few interesting insights about myself and my life, that remain relevant even after returning to baseline.<br><br>
00:40 (+115)  Ive mostly returned to baseline, though I still feel quite spacey and very relaxed. I decide to do a far smaller line (probably around 30-60mg). I didnt take any notes on the experience this time around, so Ill just try my best to remember it. The drip was more unpleasant than last time, but it came on pretty quickly again, within 5 minutes.<br><br>
I turned on a video of a live music concert, but quickly lost interest and went to my bedroom. I felt uncoordinated and heavy again, and even though I wanted to stand up and move around, when I did that I felt uncomfortable and just wanted to lie down, so I lay on my bed and stared at my ceiling for a while. My visual field seemed to warp a little  the flat ceiling looked like it was coming downwards towards me, but when I looked right at it, it returned to normal. At one point, I remember feeling like my eyes were looking in two different directions, kinda like a lizard.<br><br>
I felt distant and disconnected, but not completely. It wasnt a very good feeling or a bad feeling. I felt more or less neutral, if you can imagine that.<br><br>
Eventually I made it to the floor and helped myself to another balloon. After coming down from that a few minutes later, I concluded that I didnt really enjoy dissociatives all that much, and decided that I would stay away from them.<br><br>
I went to sleep about an hour after this, and had some vivid dreams until I woke up the following morning.<br><br>
The next day I felt tired and did not have much motivation to do anything. My throat felt a little sore, but that eventually went away. In retrospect, the experience was certainly more psychedelic than I expected. Dissociatives do have the potential to allow you to explore parts of yourself that you may not under normal circumstances. Some people use them at clubs and raves, but I cant imagine that being that much fun. Even at a lower dose for me, I found myself without any desire to move. All I wanted to do was sit/lie down and stare off into space.<br><br>
The experience overall was alright, though after reading others report of out of body experiences and other sorts of very cool phenomena, maybe I was expecting too much. I do not think I would repeat it, mainly because I did not find it very fun or enlightening. It mainly just knocked me out of it for a while.<!-- End Body -->
