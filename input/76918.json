 "report": "<p>Rivea corymbosa Seeds, the food of the gods, from Inca/Aztec culture...</p><p>1st I got ahold of 1000 seeds of Rivea corymbosa AKA: Ololiuqui. 2nd I got ahold of a fifth of EverClear, Vodka or Mescal Tequila will do, or any other alcohol will work, even wine.</p><p>3rd I ran the seeds through the coffee grinder till they were powdered. 4th combined in a 1/2 pint jar the powdered seeds first, then covered with alcohol approx 1 inch above the mass of powdered seed. Shake. Let stand.</p><p>Next day - shake twice, next day shake twice</p><p>By the 3rd day, I began to enjoy the harvest.  This recipe made about 25 doses.</p><p>This is very clean, although I am told several shamans would use addages to mix with the seeds, (hemia sacafolia), (calea calatechichi) (gaurana) (kola nut) for added bells and whistles.</p>"
