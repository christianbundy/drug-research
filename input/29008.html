I had tried weed before with some girlfriends, but it was rather lame as none of us really knew what we were doing.  All that happened was that we got the munchies and, based on my later experiences, I know that our supposed munchies were really just an excuse to eat without feeling guilty.  A few months later, I impulsively decided to smoke weed with my boyfriend, a seasoned smoker from way back.  Under his guidance I smoked two cones of decent weed, and sucked the smoke back into my lungs rather than swilling it around in my mouth as Id done with the girls.  As an ex-swimmer, I held my breath for quite a long time and didnt actually exhale any visible smoke when I breathed out.<br><br>
Anyway, I got fucking stoned!  The effects were immediate.  I looked in the mirror and my eyelids were drooping and my eyes were red as a mutherfucker.  (Fortunately, my boyfriend had eye drops  naphazoline hci 0.12mg / ml  they worked a treat).  We went for a walk through the dark streets.  One of the most significant things I remember is that my vision was all screwed up.  It was like every step was a still frame, as if my eyes were a camera and every time I blinked a photo of my surroundings was taken.  This staccato vision was very different to normal fluid vision and made walking quite a challenge.<br><br>
I also experienced a rather unreasonable fear that the trees were going to come alive and eat me, but it passed.  The other main thing I noticed was that my sense of touch was significantly heightened.  I felt very aware of my body and the way it moved, and I could actually feel gravity pulling my feet back down to the ground every time I took a step.  The slightest touch on my skin made me gasp, and my first stoned kiss with my boyfriend was amazing.  My mouth was incredibly sensitive and I felt intensely horny.  Now when I smoke, I tend to focus more on thoughts and feelings, but Ill never forget the overwhelming physical sensations that arose from my first (proper) smoke.<!-- End Body -->
