 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nOver the past month I have smoked salvia extract about 12 times. Since I began I've noticed symptoms that I can only describe as HPPD perhaps it is because I smoked a lot of it in a short period of time or maybe Im just susceptible to such things. Anyway the symptoms are Objects seem much bolder and brighter especially at long distance, when I look at blank white surfaces I can see a pattern of little spots and shapes that are very noticeable, (I see this much more strongly when I trip), in addition I can attain a sort of high/tripping state simply by focusing on objects-something I could never do before. I don't know if this is just me or something more common although there is one other report describing much the same thing. While these symptoms dont bother my they are definitely noticeable. \r\nIt may have occurred because I smoked rather often for a short period of time trying to attain a true breakthrough because I have fairly high tolerance. Either way its still a great herb and my last trip was an incredible one.\n\n\n"
