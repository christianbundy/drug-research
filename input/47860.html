We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
Ethyl chloride is a haloalkane with a chemical formula of C2H5Cl. It has an ether-like odor, but is not an ether (some describe the odor as chloroform-like, but I've never smelled chloroform). Ethyl chloride is sometimes used as a local anasthetic because it deadens tissues on contact. But it is also used by some as an inhalant with effects similar to extreme alcohol intoxication.<br><br>
As a student of organic chemistry, I'd heard of ethyl chloride and a little about its psychoactive qualities. A friend of mine had a can of the substance and sprayed a very small amount on a rag. I inhaled deeply, the odor was not terribly unpleasant. In a few seconds, I felt a deep relaxation and a sense of euphoria. That was about to change. <br><br>
I believe I entered a state of anasthesia (my friend said I just closed my eyes and continued to inhale). My next recollection is of a sub-visible purplish flash (I know, purple is visible but its my hallucination). A sound commenced in my head that was not unlike the recharging of the flash on a camera, but a million times more intense. The sound quickly became sub-sonic and continued in intensity with subharmonics adding to the chaos.<br><br>
I believed that I had blood dripping from my nostrils and ears. My thought was that someone had developed some new weapon that could kill with sound. I asked myself, 'Who would do this?' I had the distinct thought that I was going to die and felt sorrow that everyone in the world was experiencing the same horrible death. I was sad that I couldn't say goodbye to friends and family before I died. Then I remembered the ethyl chloride...<br><br>
I was relieved to come out of that. My friend and I went out and had a few beers and the rest of the night was uneventful. I was, however, deeply shaken by the ethyl experience. I would not recommend inhalation of ethyl chloride to anyone. Yes, the early part of the experience was pleasant - but the end of the experience was nightmarish and had elements of psychosis.<br><br>
The problem with huffing is that dosage can't be reliably regulated. I took way too much, saw no reason to stop until it was too late and I'm not sure that stopping was in my control at that point. I think I was probably lucky to have regained consciousness.<!-- End Body -->
