 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI started with 50 seeds, decided to keep 5 to see if I could grow them as houseplants.<br>10:00 - I begin by eating 2 seeds. The flavour is strange, the bitterness is too much. I decide to crush the remaining 43 seeds and make tea from it.<br>11:10 - Finished drinking the tea.<br>12:00 - A very mild change in awareness.<br>2:00 - Nothing much is happening so I go to bed.<br>The next day I vomited when I woke up. Felt weak. Partially incapacitated. Got some gut aches and hot flashes. Around 6:00pm I vomited again after only drinking water all day. It was green.<br>Gut pains persisted for days.<br>Conclusion: this is poison.. not worth trying.\n\n\n"
