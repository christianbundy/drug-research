 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAge 48, 130 pounds\r\nIn bedroom, wife sat opposite\r\nCalm & prepared\r\nNo prior drugs - except light MJ use\r\nSmall bowl\r\n5x extract\r\nOne small but deep breath. \r\nSlight burning.\r\nResist the urge to cough.\r\nHeat quickly fades.\r\n10 seconds later - outer time stops.\r\nBut thoughts keep on going.\r\nMy inner dialog seems so lonely.\r\nNow the outer world has stopped.\r\nA steam roller is crushing my insides fast.\r\nOr is it a kind of super gravity force?\r\nI really did not expect this intensity.\r\nNot these physical effects.\r\nNow I know where we go when we die.\r\nSweat falls everywhere out of me at once.\r\nI'm cold.\r\nIt feels like I've been shot\r\nBut before the pain hits you.\r\nYou know you're going to die.\r\nYou're resigned to it.\r\nSo this is where we go\r\nBut I can't quite see where I am.\r\nIt's all behind me.\r\nI'm not there yet.\r\nIt's just a short visit.\r\nNo one is there to lead me in.\r\nJust me alone and waiting.\r\nSo now I'm being sent back to reality.\r\nI try to look back to see where I'd been.\r\nI notice my hands are soaking wet\r\nAll of me is.\r\nDefinitely trying this again...\n\n\n"
