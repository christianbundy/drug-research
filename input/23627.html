Last fall I found myself with about 6 ripe poppy heads on the stalk, grown from Persian White seeds.  I took a razor and made shallow incisions on the heads, and later that day scraped up the partly dried, clear but brownish tar.  I put all the scrapings together and let them dry for a few days.  What I ended up with was several very small chunks of a crystalline, amber to dark brown material.  When I say small I mean the size of the tip of a pencil lead.  <br><br>
I put one of these in glass pipe, lit a candle, and slowly heated up the pipe.  Once the smoke started I took it off the heat, and gently inhaled what came.  <br><br>
The taste and smell are unforgettably divine!  It's unmistakably 'poppyish', yet very sweet as well.  <br><br>
After several hits I began to feel it.  A spreading comfort that started within and moved out to my limbs.  For about 2 hours I continued hitting the pipe approx. every 15 minutes.  I had a glass of wine and was also smoking cigarettes.  I would get euphoric rushes and have to hug myself because the feeling of positive love was so strong.  The skin on my arms got a little itchy but not too bad.  Mentally I've never had such clarity.  I was able to ponder a subject methodically, turning it around to see all angles clearly and with precision.  This was my favorite part of the experience, although the physical effects were nice too!<br><br>
At about 2hrs, I started getting the nods, and got ready for bed.  I slept like a baby for about 10 hours, and had some pretty intense dreams.  The next morning I had quite a bad hangover, definitely not an alcohol hangover, this was more like my nerves were all in slight pain.  My skin hurt, my eyes hurt, my joints hurt.  My foolish brain immediately cried out 'more opium'.  Wisely I abstained.  I craved it for weeks afterward!  Luckily I smoked all I had that night.  This is the most addictive substance (more so than speed) I have ever encountered.  Be careful with it!<!-- End Body -->
