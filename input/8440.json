 "report": "<p>On a Saturday night, I decided to go buy some Robotussin and robo-trip.  I sat down at 10 o'clock and took shots (the little cup they provide) with chasers of water.  I have hated the taste of cough medicine since I was little and never used it to cure a cold.  After the bottle was down I felt good, I played some computer games and while I did this my stomach felt a little uneasy.  I figured I would be ok because I read that DXM makes users a little nauseous at the onset.  </p><p>I got into my bed and lay there feeling sort of like I was stoned but with a bad stomach ache.  It was the first time in about 4 years where I felt sick to my stomach and felt like I was going to puke (besides being drunk and puking etc).  I went into the bathroom and put my head over the bowl for about 10 minutes and the puking sensations kept coming and going.  </p><p>After I thought it was over with, I went back to my bead but decided to put a trash can near it in case I puked.  5 minutes later, I puked my guts out into the bag, after I was done I was sweating all over and just closed my eyes and went to sleep, I woke up 5 or 6 times during the night with the gross vomit taste in my mouth and went back to bed.  </p><p>Finally I woke up at 8am to go to work.  I felt ok except I was very hungry and when I drank a glass of water it felt very thick in my mouth.  My taste sensations were WAY off the rest of the day and </p><p>I just started to feel better as I write this at 9pm after my day of work.</p><p>This experience definitely put me off of DXM.</p>"
