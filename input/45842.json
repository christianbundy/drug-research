 "report": "<p>I had horrible depression when I was about 16, thoughts like I wanted to kill my self and such. So I went to the doctor and they decided to put me on Effexor XR because that is what my mom was on at the time. </p><p>I was only 16 when they gave it to me. After only a few days of taking it I still felt the same I mean it does take a few weeks to kick in. Then one morning I woke up to go to school after having horrible nightmares of my family being zombies and me killing them, also my entire family and friends were dead and decaying. </p><p>Then when I got up and started to walk around I started to hallucinate and see dead people and body parts everywhere and I got really scared. So I got back in bed and called the doctor. All he said was that I guess thats not a good medicine for me to take. I never even knew about those kinds of side effects.</p>"
