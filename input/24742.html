First of all, what we did was incredibly stupid.  While we all had a grand old time, I think that was largely based on environment (we were at Burning Man), and the combination of drugs we took is not recommended to anyone.  The story goes as follows.<br><br>
I had brought a bottle of ayahuasca with me to Burning Man, and was saving it for burn night.  The morning of the burn word got out that I had it, and many people in my camp expressed interest in trying it.  I unfortunately only had about three good doses in the bottle, and was planning on giving one of the extra ones to my best friend K. One of my campmates offered a compromise.  He would throw in a quarter ounce of mushrooms, we'd combine them in a tea, and then the three of us would split it.<br><br>
We got the tea brewing in a french press one of my campmates had brought, when I figured, what the hell, and threw in my supply of LSA and Blue Lotus too.  Throughout the course of the day various campmates (our camp consisted of about 100 people) wandered by to throw drugs into the mix in exchange for a glass of the resulting concoction.  As far as I saw, four hits of acid, two pills of MDMA, one pill of MDE, and two pill of MDA were added to the pot.  <br><br>
About a half hour before burn time we divided the mixture into six cups and downed it.  I would like to state that this is the absolute foulest tasting thing I've ever ingested.  I left a bit at the bottom of my cup, and I'm not the sort who wusses out with drugs ever.  Me and K also had a pill each of E, so we downed those about five minutes later.  My buddy R then produced some opium, and we smoked that on top of some cannibis.<br><br>
Our group decided we'd better walk out to the burn before we were too fucked up to get there, so we headed out with a megaphone, lots of water, glowsticks, cameras, and a few bottles of 'shambles' (champagne, red bull, and vodka).  I was (stupidly) chugging down the shambles most of the walk there. The vibe was incredible.  I was in a group of about 15-20 of my friends, and my other half K was there.  To this day I truly believe that nothing bad can happen to either of us so long as we're together.<br><br>
I started feeling the effects of the 'tea' right as we got to the burn site.  I was having fun, talking to people, giving out Flintstones vitamins, and yelling strange things into the megaphone (i.e. 'there's some bad red rope licorice going around. Do not eat the red rope licorice).  I turned around and noticed K puking, but when I asked if he was okay, he just grinned real big and gave me the thumbs up before commencing puking.  <br><br>
About ten minutes later I felt a bit nauseous, and puked once, but only a little.  K later told me that he booted five times over the course of the night.  The festivities were incredible.  I remember right as it started being a bit disappointed because I'm only about 5'3', and I couldn't see the fire dancers at all.  Just then someone in the back, who also had a megaphone, said 'Burning Man is not just for tall people, would everyone please sit down.'  And just like that, every single person in earshot sat down, and within two minutes, everyone out of earshot had taken the cue and done the same.   I post this just to show how unbelievably wonderful the vibe was.  Everyone wanted everyone else to be able to see.  It was beautiful.<br><br>
Anyway, the man burned, and we all ran around a bit, then sort of wandered off.  I lost a good portion of my group at this point, but K was still with me so I felt fine.  Walking along the playa I bumped into a girl I sort of knew (she dated my roommate for a while), and she gave me a really nice ganja brownie.  I then ran into a girl named S who knew me, even though I couldn't remember her (not from drugs, this happens to me a lot. I'm kind of infamous in my little town).  Me, K, S, and another girl L all started wandering around the playa.  <br><br>
The entire time I was walking I kept seeing these 'ghost people'.  I couldn't tell if they were real until I got right up to them, but even when I knew they were spirits, I still felt they were real.  One of these spirits walked up to me and handed me a pipe, which I took a hit off of and instantly felt the effects of, even though neither he nor his pipe were really there.  Have I mentioned that I was tripping BAWLS at this point?<br><br>
Anyway, me and K got seperated, but I wasn't too worried about it.  S, L, and myself decided to head back to home base, although this proved to be incredibly difficult as we had no idea where we were.  Our camp was pretty huge, so S suggested that we just walk around the inside of the circle until we spotted it, but we were so distracted by all the pretty colors and interesting people (S and L were both trolling), that we walked past it twice.  The third time we were heading back, K came bounding out and led us back to the community tent, where there were many comfy couches and cool people to chill with.  <br><br>
My good friends P and G were inside and gave me big hugs.  I sat on the floor, leaning on K, and P handed me a bottle of Jagermeister (my all time favorite booze).  I took a swig, but was at least thinking clearly enough to know that I shouldn't be any MORE intoxicated.  P then handed me half a pill that she had left over, and I took that with a little water.  Another girl gave me a ganja cookie, which I downed. We hung in the tent for a while, then me and K decided to go lay down on the giant trampoline around back.  Staring up at the incredibly bright starry sky, all the stars were purple, green, and red, and the moon was shooting off blue rays.  Me and K saw a couple dozen shooting stars that I'm pretty sure were real, and they left some wicked tracers in the night sky.<br><br>
We spent about another two hours just wandering, and then around 8:00 am finally went to sleep.  I woke up the next day feeling amazingly well.  I ate, helped clean up the neighboring campsites, hung out with my friends, and had a grand old time.  While I have nothing negative to report from this experience, I would like to reiterate that we got VERY lucky.  What we did was STUPID, and no one else should ever do it.  We had fun, but you might end up in the E.R.<!-- End Body -->
