Between May and August of this summer I smoked Calea on average about twice a week.  The dosage was one joint, which I usually didn't finish.  The first thing I would notice was that it instantly relaxed me, which was the main reason I used it.  There is also a slight loss in your sense of touch.  As far as dreams are concerned, there was a definite increase in dream recall.  I would say I remebered at least one dream 80% of the times I smoked Calea.  Without smoking, I usually remember dreams about once a week.  It did increase the frequency of lucid dreams, but I would say I had less than 10 lucid dreams during the summer.  On average I am lucid about once every couple of months without Calea. <br><br>
Auditory hallucinations also occur from using Calea.  For me they consisted of waking up hearing someone telling me to do something.  Once I heard a knock on my bedroom door in the middle of the night, when I knew no one else was in the house.  I've heard that the auditory hallucinations can be worse, but the knock on the door was the worst I heard.  For those who try it, my advice is smoke it, and don't expect results every time.<!-- End Body -->
