A friend of mine was just prescribed Wellbutrin pills for depression. Out of curiosity I was reading the pamphlet on it and I saw that large doses cause hallucinations. Of course my dumbass ignored the side effects and dosed as high and I could.<br><br>
I didnt hit me for a couple hours, but when it did I had uncontrollable vomiting. I would try and get some sleep, sleep for 3 hours wake up fucking 3 min later. I was difficult to sleep as well due to the large amount of spiders crawling on me, and the guy with no face at my window. I finally got up and moving at 5:00 am, I was still puking every 15 min, and I couldnt sit anywhere on account of the spiders that would crawl on me (I fucking hate spiders just for the record).<br><br>
The hallucinations got worse, when I went to puck a hang came out of my toilet and waved at me and quickly went back in. I sat down in front of the TV, which was turned off, this however didnt stop me from watching a movie anyways, lots of Dinosaurs playing on my blank TV. Finally when I was all alone I started seeing people, I could see them in the mirrors, when I waved they waved back. However when I turned around they were gone although I could still hear them moving. One of them was wearing stilts in my living room, I could hear him walking around, and shaking my furniture. <br><br>
Altogether my trip lasted 16 hours, I had one minor seizure, and the whole time my heart was pounding like I was running a fucking marathon! The vomiting lasted just as long, it was painful and retarded.<!-- End Body -->
