The duration of effects described however, is more consistent with MDA] </font> <br><br>
I have read much about ecstasy for many years and have always wanted to experience it for myself.  After research online, I decided to try some MDA powder that was available to me.  <br><br>
I took about 100ug or .1g about 10 am.  For about an hour I didn't notice much of an effect, but gradually I felt a blissful energy start to take effect.  <br><br>
I was very talkative with a close relative and I really enjoyed interactions with those around me.  I had the feeling that there were profound insights into everything said to me and by me.   <br><br>
I reached a plateau about 3 hrs after ingestion and noticed a comedown around 6pm.  Not as intense as acid, but a very enjoyable time.<!-- End Body -->
