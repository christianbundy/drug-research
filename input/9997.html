Writing this to add another insight on the Temazepam experience.<br><br>
A bit of background for you<br><br>
I was prescribed Restoril (Temazepam) for sleep, after trying numerous other drugs, and amazingly enough this one worked, but I found that it produced a nice euphoria at the 60 mg level, whereas I was prescribed only 15 mg.<br><br>
So the outlay of a 60 mg Temazepam experience is this:<br><br>
After forty-five minutes of taking the pills one starts to feel a bit wobbly, as if his axis has shifted from the middle of his body to some where way above the head.  So everything that is needed for moving is quite difficult to achieve,  the feeling is like that of too much alcohol, yet without the dizziness or nausea.<br><br>
Next comes the stoning feeling, nothing seems to really matter or get through to me,  people are talking, the television is on, yet the words all seem to be some foreign language. While this may seem frightening on any hallucinogen, it is not on Temazepam, with this drug I seem to be perfectly content to just turn into my benzo jelly and drip into the fabric of the couch or whatever I may be laying on.<br><br>
So this continues for about 4 hours or until one falls asleep, it is quite a soothing experience, although trying to communicate is easy it is not something that I recommend, just be content to be one with the world, and relax.<!-- End Body -->
