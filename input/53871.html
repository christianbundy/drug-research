I managed to procure some from the doctor.  In all honesty, I regret the lies necessary to do this.  I'm someone who has pretty tried every high nature and labs can produce and at this point in my life, I can stay sober for the most part, so long as my insatiable curiosity is satisfied.  So when I saw Lyrica, I had to try it just so I wouldn't have the prospect of a novel experience on my mind.<br><br>
Well, it's not like a benzo for the most part.  It kicks in after about 2 hours, and all of a sudden I found that the simple act of seeing was, well, a chore.  <br><br>
The two times I did the 450mg dose as described in the prescribing information, I happened to be putting Ikea furniture together.  Strange coincidence.  Both times, I was not taking any other substances.  And damn, both times, screwing those little things in with Allen wrenches was like doing multivariable calculus.<br><br>
So here's the deal on Lyrica.  It doesn't feel as good as a benzo.  It sedates me just as much.  I can't walk very straight, and I talk like Im drunk.  This lasts about 3-4 hours.  Does it feel good?  Well, if I have some good music and I can sink into a chair, and have absolutely nothing to do (not even having to play with the remote), it's quite a nice relaxation.  But otherwise, it just seems to get in the way.  Thinking is hard.  Walking is hard seeing is hard. I can see this being a great thing for a lazy Sunday when the girlfriend is gone and I have nothing to do.<!-- End Body -->
