 "report": "<p>This is not so much of an experience on cocaine, rather how it affected me. My friend and I went to pick up about a half-gram of cocaine from a trusted source good quality stuff.</p><p>Once we received the product my friend proceeded to IV around 250 mg of the cocaine. He got pretty messed up off of it because he rarely does cocaine. I then dropped my friend off and headed back to my place.</p><p>Once I was there I took about 200 mg and dissolved it into water and put it in the needle. Once I had injected it I was just kind of waiting for it to hit me, but nothing happened. I know it was good stuff but it just didn't make me feel anything at all. I have heard of a few other people that it did not affect either, but none that I read IV'ed the substance.</p>"
