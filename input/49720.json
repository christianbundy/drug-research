 "report": "</p>I just want to say what a really great conference it was. I found it truly inspiring and nourishing---felt like Woodstock again, but instead of bands there were presentations--same vibe but with a wizened maturity.Plenty of fascinating sessions and I particularly enjoyed Robert Forte's gathering on Leary with Joanna(?) Leary and Nick Sand, the former underground chemist.</p><p>There was a lot of heart, warmth and sincerity in the session, connecting to the essence of the 60s psychedelic revolution (without which the conference wouldn't have happened).  </p><p>It was also great to hear other veterans like Metzner (who turns out to be a vaudeville performer too---God bless him and his Bardo blues!) keeping the flame alight.</p><p>Thanks a million to the organisers and let's have another one next year on psychedelics in general.</p>"
