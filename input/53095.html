When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I had an episode of what people call 'night terror' or 'pavor nocturnis'. I do not know if I had that more frequently or if this was the single episode.<br><br>
I fell asleep and had a dream. <br><br>
In the dream, I was paralyzed in my bed, panicking and looking around. I heard steps, and then, out of thin air, a pair of hands appeared, one carrying a tablet with a bottle and a glass on it. The free hand poured liquid from the bottle into the glass. I knew this was poison, and that it was meant for me. Even more, I knew that I would have to drink it, without being able to resist. I was terrified. Awaking halfway, I screamed loudly, still not being completely back in reality. The time to drink the poison was drawing near.<br><br>
Then my mother came in, and I snapped into reality some more. I was rolling around in my bed, and thrashing some. I was rather confused and couldn't fully separate dream and reality, but I somehow realized that I was dreaming. My mother calmed me some, and I almost immediately fell back asleep, still confused.<!-- End Body -->
