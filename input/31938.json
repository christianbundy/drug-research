 "report": "<p>I had read that Buprenex had the same effects as morphine, without the horrible withdrawals.  In addition, it is more difficult to OD from Buprenex than it is from Morphine.</p><p>I used one sublingual by grinding and snorting it. Purchased from the fine purveyors on the net. It took 45 minutes to really kick in.  It was not as strong or powerful as my Morphine or oxycontin experiences. It was a smooth warm continuous glow. Further, it has a unique anti-depressive effect that I love.</p><p>This drug is more refined than other opiates.  Essentially, a kinder gentler opiate. My entire body was ache free, great for the days after tough workouts.  My eyes were pinned, and my face very relaxed, almost looking goofy. It seems to do more than just stimulate opiate receptor sites.</p>"
