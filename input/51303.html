I was recently prescribed a box of Zopiclone tablets in an attempt to treat my chronic insomnia.  In England, Zopiclone is available in red/orange 3.25mg tablets, or white 7.5mg tablets. I took the recommended dose of 7.5mg (two 3.25mg tablets) at about midnight. Usually I manage to get to sleep around one or two in the morning, but recently I've been unable to sleep until 6:00 or 7:00am.<br><br>
I decided to sit up and read a book until I felt tired, but after a while I found it extremely difficult to take in information. My eyes scanned the words, they were repeated in my head, but they failed to connect with any real meaning - this is very similar to experiences I've had with amphetamines, both Base and Ecstasy.<br><br>
Overall, the general reaction of the drug was not unlike a mild dose of Ketamine, or a pleasant Myristicin experience. There was a small increase in the luminescence of my visual field, which I've come to associate with an increase of the sympathetic nervous system, coupled with high beta/gamma brainwave production. However, I quickly began to feel drowsy, rather than energetic, and my limbs felt incredibly light.<br><br>
It was maybe an hour, hour and a half before I fell asleep. Normally I have a very limited capacity to visualise (my assumption is that since I have quite good vocal/logical/practical skills, most of my vocabulary is stored in my occipital lobe), but on Zopiclone I found myself experiencing very intense Hypnogogic imagery. In particular, I saw many geometric patterns, as well as images of hands (symbols more closely related to the brain's sense of self than the face).<br><br>
The most intense aspect of Zopiclone was, by far, the affect it had on my dreams. I've been practising lucid dreaming techniques for about a year now, with moderate success, but on this drug I found I possessed incredible lucidity.<br><br>
I was totally aware that I was dreaming, and the dreams themselves were incredibly intense. There was absolutely no difference between my sleeping world and the waking world - if anything, I'd say my dreaming seemed more real than reality.<br><br>
My thought processes whilst asleep were absolutely no different to when awake. I could think logically, weigh up my emotions, use my imagination. I also noticed that I had the same song stuck in my head that had been in there all day. <br><br>
My dreams seemed to last all night, far longer than the number of hours I was actually asleep, in fact. People have told me that Marijuana and LSD help them gain lucidity, but I've always found Marijuana puts me in too deep a sleep, and I found it impossible to sleep on LSD. Zopiclone is BY FAR the best drug I've found for achieving control of my dreams.<br><br>
My doctor was initially unwilling to prescribe me anything for my insomnia, due to the fact that it's a lifelong condition, and she didn't want me to become dependent on drugs for sleep (a very good point, I felt), and I think she only gave me the Zopiclone to get me out of her office.<br><br>
One negative side effect I did notice was that my muscles wouldn't tense properly - when I tried to flex them they remained partly soft.<!-- End Body -->
