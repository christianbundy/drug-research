At a party and decided to try the Benzo fury that I had been given as a free sample. Not my usual substance of interest as I prefer perception expanding substances. Was expecting that I would drink less ! Anyway, had the pill in two doses broken in half and taken with about an hour between doses.<br><br>
All was well and I enjoyed the effect which was easily managed. However, jaw tension started and I really wanted to bite my teeth together, it was uncomfortable and made me feel self-conscious.<br><br>
This was not a problem at first, but after a week the jaw tension and desire to chatter and grind my teeth was quite alarming. Also I had to consciously relax my mouth when talking, one person actually thought that I had my tongue pierced, because of the way I was speaking (this was quite amusing).<br><br>
The positive did not in my opinion outweigh the negative. Wont be tempted to try this substance again.<br><br>
13 days later and I am still feeling the uncomfortable jaw effect, although it has diminished greatly!<br><br>
I'm sure that I have had an unusual reaction, however, this has not happened to me before and I have tested many psychedelic substances.<!-- End Body -->
