I heat the bowl with the lighter flame to melt the 5meo, then place the flame above the bowl, drawing the heat down to vaporize and inhale the 5meo.  After a few seconds I lower the flame to the salvia and finish the bowl in a single inhalation.  Its a delicate process and I had a tough time finishing the dose because I hadnt thoroughly exhaled before starting.\r\nFrom here until the conclusion are my notes from the experience, starting with a journal entry that leads up to the dose, which serves to capture my set and setting.  Annotations are within brackets.\r\n-- start realtime notes --\r\n9:33am\r\nVery excited this morning, and rather stimulated after a cup of strong coffee\r\nI knew I wanted to try another experience this morning, to find the time, but in addition to finding the time, it feels right, and it is not often that both opportunity and the right time come together\r\nIts a Sunday morning; clock was turned back an hour.  ***** and *****  are hanging out in bed.  I told them I was going in to my office to meditate and should not be disturbed, and that Id be out in about an hour.\r\n***** knows what that mean; she still doesnt like it.  Last night over dinner I told her my idea for a business based on providing a safe environment for people to have such experiences.  She said it was the dumbest idea I ever came up with and that she didnt even want to talk about it.\r\nSo what do I want to accomplish this morning?\r\nIm trying the salvia and 5meo-dmt combination, but this time with 50mg (2mg salvinorin) salvia  last time was half that much.  The amount of 5meo is in the ballpark of 10mg, but could be + or  50% due to my eyeballing method of dividing up the 250mg lot.\r\nDuring my last experience, or in the reflections, it occurred to me that salvia plays with the fabric of human experience while 5meo plays with the fabric of reality.  Lately, Ive been fond of saying that my two heroes  Joseph Campbell and John Lilly  are two sides of the same coin; it feels, somehow that salvia is like Joe while 5meo is like John.\r\nWhile the 5meo experience is, by itself, interesting, it may not be as useful as others.  Playing with the fabric of reality means that ideas do not really exist  their playground has been obliterated.  And I like ideas.  Salvia plays with ideas  particularly the sense of self.  So by combining these two molecules I am, perhaps, trying to see if a sense of self can exist within the realm of the 5meo chaos  I guess you might call that a transcendent consciousness.\r\nI suppose this all sounds simplistic, but to me, naming things and categorizing things are just methods of organization and have no real basis in reality  whatever that is.\r\nOther than what I have just written I have no intentions.  Take me where you will.  I feel good, excited, and feel that I am doing something that feels very right for me.  I am open to arguments that it is wrong but havent really heard any.  (Ive heard declarations  this is bad  but not arguments explaining why)\r\nI dont like the vision of a future where widespread pharmacological manipulation is daily fare  unless we find/synthesize some new, particularly useful tools.  Instead, for now, such experimentation simply provides glimpses of many typically unexperienced slices of human conscious experience.\r\n9:51am\r\n53 (time of actual hit, 9:53)\r\ntry\r\ntrt\r\nyes\r\nplzy\r\ntry\r\n9:55 AM\r\n9:55 AM\r\n9:55 AM\r\n9:55 AM\r\n9:56 AM\r\n9:57 AM\r\nTRY\r\nHOW\r\nPERFORM\r\nYOU\r\nA PERFORMA NCE\r\nPERFORMANXCE  \r\nPERSOBNA\r\nperformance\r\nfuchj spekkuj g  \ntye4\r\n9:58 AM\r\nbrealbrouthrouygh\r\ni8ve had a breaththrouggh\r\na had a breath\r\n9:59 AM\r\ncreature\r\nplaying witgh realty\r\nperfvormanc3e\r\nreal\r\nreakl\r\nyou need realtime captiurds\r\naudfio visdual\r\nfor fuck sale  \n10:00 AM\r\nyou nee4d to do it  for real\r\npefvormance\r\nasc art\r\nreligion\r\nscience\r\nexperience\r\nrealit5y\r\nfuck the economy\r\nwwow that brought me dowbn\r\npossss \n10:01 AM\r\nnice middle groound\r\nfun ctioning but out there\r\nneed other met6jhody  of capt ure\r\nfor fuck saudke\r\npercurt5iove\r\nkeyborad\r\npercurssive\r\nkeyaboprd\r\nperfcuieovie\r\nkeybaors\r\npeercfuelcvkws\r\nfjcieklxir\r\nfujcie,cdufg\r\nperfvjkciekcvjd\r\nperc34uwsivek\r\nekfjksdolxjmd\r\nfjkdklsx\r\ndcj ;\r\ndrumming\r\ndrumein g\r\nasc\r\ntbhought\r\nthinking\r\nthigngi\r\nthgouht\r\n]fdrumming\r\r\nyoue,sdkfgjkdolerikd\r\nI get the idea\r\n10:03 AM\r\nyes\r\nthere\r\n10:03 AM\r\njust try captuing it.  \nor making it useful\r\nthats sober you up  \nok\r\ntry\r\nwhat do want to do with this\r\ndown  \nperformance\r\nreality\r\nart\r\nexoeruience   \nfuck  money\r\nfucky mo ney\r\ndown\r\ndown\r\n10:04 AM\r\nabstraction of money\r\npsychologyy of spending\r\nstandard of lioving\r\nwhat it realy means\r\nhow you could live\r\nextreme version\r\ncave of neccesities\r\nwow.\r\n10:05 AM\r\nwhat it means to be ok\r\nabsense of pain\r\nhealth\r\npsychological security\r\nphysiologic securioty\r\nhealth and safety and secutriotyy\r\nyou self and family\r\nultimately self.. because youre so fucking selfing  \nyou are\r\nhey be yourself\r\nat least be honest about it\r\ndo not hide for cukke\r\nsake\r\nwjhat is there to hide\r\nfear same  ofld fucking fvear\r\nsame old\r\ninhibitions\r\ndown\r\nfears of what!!!!?????\r\noh its you\r\nyoure bad\r\nyoure less\r\nyour silly\r\nyou have shit all over you\r\nyoure diurty\r\nyou smell\r\nyoure vbad\r\nyou smell\r\nshit\r\nmaking in your pants\r\ngreat just what i want to talk about\r\nmaybe thats a connection\r\nto the shame\r\nand inhibitions\r\nbizarre\r\nMy fear of people is fear that I am being seen as someone who they do not like because I just shit my pants and they want to run away from, like they did, I tried to play into the game to cover my pain and confusion and shame\r\ncovering over shame\r\nplaying the game\r\nI said, in effect, I am going to get you\r\nIm the monster\r\nthe ugly one\r\nthe one you want to avoid\r\nyes, try, marshall\r\n10:11 AM\r\nwhat is worth doing\r\nyou must be prompted  remember that\r\nprovide for health and safety so you and others can explore\r\nthats all that matters\r\nhuge implications\r\nwhat is genuinely worth doing other than that?\r\nhuman evolution\r\nhas gotten to where I am so healthy and so safe that I can do this\r\nsurvival is secondary\r\ndangerous thought\r\nperhaps tghats all humans can do\r\nexplore\r\nand work toward health and safety\r\nall of this business and economy\r\nis it all required for health and safety and security??\r\ni just dobn;t understand it enopuigh\r\nthe pricioples\r\nthe dynaimics\r\nof econoinmy i guess\r\nif the goals is ONLY health and safety and security\r\nand that should perhaps be the only goal?

I think the caffeine ahead of time contributes as well; hard to know how much.  The space in which I was immediately propelled lasts only a minute or so, but of course it seems like a much longer time  as though the experience reaches completely past the idea and the perception of time.\r\nI have read, if I recall correctly, that chocolate (a MAOI?) might increase the duration of that first level.  (Found it: Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.  Perhaps I will try a cocoa-coffee mixture in the future.\r\nThe positiveness of the experience matched the positiveness of my set and setting  very self-fulfilling I suppose.\r\nWhat did I get out of this experience?\r\nI have a very busy life, and these experiences  including this one  remind me to consider other paths and other possibilities.  They remind me of my dreams, of things I would like to do with my life.  They help me take stock of where I am, what Im doing with myself, where my head is.  It is all too easy for the months and years to go by so quickly.  Im fortunate to have an interesting career and it pays the bills, but there is so much more; there is the wonder of what existence and reality and consciousness are, and of what is possible to experience.\n\n\n"
