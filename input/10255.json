 "report": "<p>\nOctober 28, 2001</p><p>salvia + 5meo-dmt + caffeine</p><p>--- Introduction ---</p><p>Earlier today I had an incredible experience  perhaps my most profound (whatever that means) to date.</p><p>Here are the basics.</p><p>Subject:</p><p>male, 38 years old, 225 pounds</p><p>Substance/Dose:</p><p>approx. 150mg caffeine (strong cup of coffee)</p><p>then, 30 minutes later</p><p>simultaneous dose of:</p><p>2mg salvinorin (via 2, 25mg doses of enhanced salvia)</p><p>about 10mg 5-meo-dmt (eyeball divided from 250mg lot, so + or  50%)</p><p>Technique:</p><p>Like in my last experience combining salvia and 5meo, I load the waterpipe with the salvia and sprinkle the 5meo on top.  I heat the bowl with the lighter flame to melt the 5meo, then place the flame above the bowl, drawing the heat down to vaporize and inhale the 5meo.  After a few seconds I lower the flame to the salvia and finish the bowl in a single inhalation.  Its a delicate process and I had a tough time finishing the dose because I hadnt thoroughly exhaled before starting.</p><p>From here until the conclusion are my notes from the experience, starting with a journal entry that leads up to the dose, which serves to capture my set and setting.  Annotations are within brackets.</p><p>-- start realtime notes --</p><p>9:33am</p><p>Very excited this morning, and rather stimulated after a cup of strong coffee</p><p>I knew I wanted to try another experience this morning, to find the time, but in addition to finding the time, it feels right, and it is not often that both opportunity and the right time come together</p><p>Its a Sunday morning; clock was turned back an hour.  ***** and *****  are hanging out in bed.  I told them I was going in to my office to meditate and should not be disturbed, and that Id be out in about an hour.</p><p>***** knows what that mean; she still doesnt like it.  Last night over dinner I told her my idea for a business based on providing a safe environment for people to have such experiences.  She said it was the dumbest idea I ever came up with and that she didnt even want to talk about it.</p><p>So what do I want to accomplish this morning?</p><p>Im trying the salvia and 5meo-dmt combination, but this time with 50mg (2mg salvinorin) salvia  last time was half that much.  The amount of 5meo is in the ballpark of 10mg, but could be + or  50% due to my eyeballing method of dividing up the 250mg lot.</p><p>During my last experience, or in the reflections, it occurred to me that salvia plays with the fabric of human experience while 5meo plays with the fabric of reality.  Lately, Ive been fond of saying that my two heroes  Joseph Campbell and John Lilly  are two sides of the same coin; it feels, somehow that salvia is like Joe while 5meo is like John.</p><p>While the 5meo experience is, by itself, interesting, it may not be as useful as others.  Playing with the fabric of reality means that ideas do not really exist  their playground has been obliterated.  And I like ideas.  Salvia plays with ideas  particularly the sense of self.  So by combining these two molecules I am, perhaps, trying to see if a sense of self can exist within the realm of the 5meo chaos  I guess you might call that a transcendent consciousness.</p><p>I suppose this all sounds simplistic, but to me, naming things and categorizing things are just methods of organization and have no real basis in reality  whatever that is.</p><p>Other than what I have just written I have no intentions.  Take me where you will.  I feel good, excited, and feel that I am doing something that feels very right for me.  I am open to arguments that it is wrong but havent really heard any.  (Ive heard declarations  this is bad  but not arguments explaining why)</p><p>I dont like the vision of a future where widespread pharmacological manipulation is daily fare  unless we find/synthesize some new, particularly useful tools.  Instead, for now, such experimentation simply provides glimpses of many typically unexperienced slices of human conscious experience.</p><p>9:51am</p><p>53 (time of actual hit, 9:53)</p><p>try</p><p>trt</p><p>yes</p><p>plzy</p><p>try</p><p>9:55 AM</p><p>9:55 AM</p><p>9:55 AM</p><p>9:55 AM</p><p>9:56 AM</p><p>9:57 AM</p><p>TRY</p><p>HOW</p><p>PERFORM</p><p>YOU</p><p>A PERFORMA NCE</p><p>PERFORMANXCE  </p><p>PERSOBNA</p><p>performance</p><p>fuchj spekkuj g  \ntye4</p><p>9:58 AM</p><p>brealbrouthrouygh</p><p>i8ve had a breaththrouggh</p><p>a had a breath</p><p>9:59 AM</p><p>creature</p><p>playing witgh realty</p><p>perfvormanc3e</p><p>real</p><p>reakl</p><p>you need realtime captiurds</p><p>audfio visdual</p><p>for fuck sale  \n10:00 AM</p><p>you nee4d to do it  for real</p><p>pefvormance</p><p>asc art</p><p>religion</p><p>science</p><p>experience</p><p>realit5y</p><p>fuck the economy</p><p>wwow that brought me dowbn</p><p>possss \n10:01 AM</p><p>nice middle groound</p><p>fun ctioning but out there</p><p>need other met6jhody  of capt ure</p><p>for fuck saudke</p><p>percurt5iove</p><p>keyborad</p><p>percurssive</p><p>keyaboprd</p><p>perfcuieovie</p><p>keybaors</p><p>peercfuelcvkws</p><p>fjcieklxir</p><p>fujcie,cdufg</p><p>perfvjkciekcvjd</p><p>perc34uwsivek</p><p>ekfjksdolxjmd</p><p>fjkdklsx</p><p>dcj ;</p><p>drumming</p><p>drumein g</p><p>asc</p><p>tbhought</p><p>thinking</p><p>thigngi</p><p>thgouht</p><p>]fdrumming\r</p><p>youe,sdkfgjkdolerikd</p><p>I get the idea</p><p>10:03 AM</p><p>yes</p><p>there</p><p>10:03 AM</p><p>just try captuing it.  \nor making it useful</p><p>thats sober you up  \nok</p><p>try</p><p>what do want to do with this</p><p>down  \nperformance</p><p>reality</p><p>art</p><p>exoeruience   \nfuck  money</p><p>fucky mo ney</p><p>down</p><p>down</p><p>10:04 AM</p><p>abstraction of money</p><p>psychologyy of spending</p><p>standard of lioving</p><p>what it realy means</p><p>how you could live</p><p>extreme version</p><p>cave of neccesities</p><p>wow.</p><p>10:05 AM</p><p>what it means to be ok</p><p>absense of pain</p><p>health</p><p>psychological security</p><p>physiologic securioty</p><p>health and safety and secutriotyy</p><p>you self and family</p><p>ultimately self.. because youre so fucking selfing  \nyou are</p><p>hey be yourself</p><p>at least be honest about it</p><p>do not hide for cukke</p><p>sake</p><p>wjhat is there to hide</p><p>fear same  ofld fucking fvear</p><p>same old</p><p>inhibitions</p><p>down</p><p>fears of what!!!!?????</p><p>oh its you</p><p>youre bad</p><p>youre less</p><p>your silly</p><p>you have shit all over you</p><p>youre diurty</p><p>you smell</p><p>youre vbad</p><p>you smell</p><p>shit</p><p>making in your pants</p><p>great just what i want to talk about</p><p>maybe thats a connection</p><p>to the shame</p><p>and inhibitions</p><p>bizarre</p><p>My fear of people is fear that I am being seen as someone who they do not like because I just shit my pants and they want to run away from, like they did, I tried to play into the game to cover my pain and confusion and shame</p><p>covering over shame</p><p>playing the game</p><p>I said, in effect, I am going to get you</p><p>Im the monster</p><p>the ugly one</p><p>the one you want to avoid</p><p>yes, try, marshall</p><p>10:11 AM</p><p>what is worth doing</p><p>you must be prompted  remember that</p><p>provide for health and safety so you and others can explore</p><p>thats all that matters</p><p>huge implications</p><p>what is genuinely worth doing other than that?</p><p>human evolution</p><p>has gotten to where I am so healthy and so safe that I can do this</p><p>survival is secondary</p><p>dangerous thought</p><p>perhaps tghats all humans can do</p><p>explore</p><p>and work toward health and safety</p><p>all of this business and economy</p><p>is it all required for health and safety and security??</p><p>i just dobn;t understand it enopuigh</p><p>the pricioples</p><p>the dynaimics</p><p>of econoinmy i guess</p><p>if the goals is ONLY health and safety and security</p><p>and that should perhaps be the only goal?

I think the caffeine ahead of time contributes as well; hard to know how much.  The space in which I was immediately propelled lasts only a minute or so, but of course it seems like a much longer time  as though the experience reaches completely past the idea and the perception of time.</p><p>I have read, if I recall correctly, that chocolate (a MAOI?) might increase the duration of that first level.  (Found it: Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.  Perhaps I will try a cocoa-coffee mixture in the future.</p><p>The positiveness of the experience matched the positiveness of my set and setting  very self-fulfilling I suppose.</p><p>What did I get out of this experience?</p><p>I have a very busy life, and these experiences  including this one  remind me to consider other paths and other possibilities.  They remind me of my dreams, of things I would like to do with my life.  They help me take stock of where I am, what Im doing with myself, where my head is.  It is all too easy for the months and years to go by so quickly.  Im fortunate to have an interesting career and it pays the bills, but there is so much more; there is the wonder of what existence and reality and consciousness are, and of what is possible to experience.</p>"
