I heat the bowl with the lighter flame to melt the 5meo, then place the flame above the bowl, drawing the heat down to vaporize and inhale the 5meo.  After a few seconds I lower the flame to the salvia and finish the bowl in a single inhalation.  Its a delicate process and I had a tough time finishing the dose because I hadnt thoroughly exhaled before starting.<br>From here until the conclusion are my notes from the experience, starting with a journal entry that leads up to the dose, which serves to capture my set and setting.  Annotations are within brackets.<br>-- start realtime notes --<br>9:33am<br>Very excited this morning, and rather stimulated after a cup of strong coffee<br>I knew I wanted to try another experience this morning, to find the time, but in addition to finding the time, it feels right, and it is not often that both opportunity and the right time come together<br>Its a Sunday morning; clock was turned back an hour.  ***** and *****  are hanging out in bed.  I told them I was going in to my office to meditate and should not be disturbed, and that Id be out in about an hour.<br>***** knows what that mean; she still doesnt like it.  Last night over dinner I told her my idea for a business based on providing a safe environment for people to have such experiences.  She said it was the dumbest idea I ever came up with and that she didnt even want to talk about it.<br>So what do I want to accomplish this morning?<br>Im trying the salvia and 5meo-dmt combination, but this time with 50mg (2mg salvinorin) salvia  last time was half that much.  The amount of 5meo is in the ballpark of 10mg, but could be + or  50% due to my eyeballing method of dividing up the 250mg lot.<br>During my last experience, or in the reflections, it occurred to me that salvia plays with the fabric of human experience while 5meo plays with the fabric of reality.  Lately, Ive been fond of saying that my two heroes  Joseph Campbell and John Lilly  are two sides of the same coin; it feels, somehow that salvia is like Joe while 5meo is like John.<br>While the 5meo experience is, by itself, interesting, it may not be as useful as others.  Playing with the fabric of reality means that ideas do not really exist  their playground has been obliterated.  And I like ideas.  Salvia plays with ideas  particularly the sense of self.  So by combining these two molecules I am, perhaps, trying to see if a sense of self can exist within the realm of the 5meo chaos  I guess you might call that a transcendent consciousness.<br>I suppose this all sounds simplistic, but to me, naming things and categorizing things are just methods of organization and have no real basis in reality  whatever that is.<br>Other than what I have just written I have no intentions.  Take me where you will.  I feel good, excited, and feel that I am doing something that feels very right for me.  I am open to arguments that it is wrong but havent really heard any.  (Ive heard declarations  this is bad  but not arguments explaining why)<br>I dont like the vision of a future where widespread pharmacological manipulation is daily fare  unless we find/synthesize some new, particularly useful tools.  Instead, for now, such experimentation simply provides glimpses of many typically unexperienced slices of human conscious experience.<br>9:51am<br>53 (time of actual hit, 9:53)<br>try<br>trt<br>yes<br>plzy<br>try<br>9:55 AM<br>9:55 AM<br>9:55 AM<br>9:55 AM<br>9:56 AM<br>9:57 AM<br>TRY<br>HOW<br>PERFORM<br>YOU<br>A PERFORMA NCE<br>PERFORMANXCE  <br>PERSOBNA<br>performance<br>fuchj spekkuj g  \ntye4<br>9:58 AM<br>brealbrouthrouygh<br>i8ve had a breaththrouggh<br>a had a breath<br>9:59 AM<br>creature<br>playing witgh realty<br>perfvormanc3e<br>real<br>reakl<br>you need realtime captiurds<br>audfio visdual<br>for fuck sale  \n10:00 AM<br>you nee4d to do it  for real<br>pefvormance<br>asc art<br>religion<br>science<br>experience<br>realit5y<br>fuck the economy<br>wwow that brought me dowbn<br>possss \n10:01 AM<br>nice middle groound<br>fun ctioning but out there<br>need other met6jhody  of capt ure<br>for fuck saudke<br>percurt5iove<br>keyborad<br>percurssive<br>keyaboprd<br>perfcuieovie<br>keybaors<br>peercfuelcvkws<br>fjcieklxir<br>fujcie,cdufg<br>perfvjkciekcvjd<br>perc34uwsivek<br>ekfjksdolxjmd<br>fjkdklsx<br>dcj ;<br>drumming<br>drumein g<br>asc<br>tbhought<br>thinking<br>thigngi<br>thgouht<br>]fdrumming\r<br>youe,sdkfgjkdolerikd<br>I get the idea<br>10:03 AM<br>yes<br>there<br>10:03 AM<br>just try captuing it.  \nor making it useful<br>thats sober you up  \nok<br>try<br>what do want to do with this<br>down  \nperformance<br>reality<br>art<br>exoeruience   \nfuck  money<br>fucky mo ney<br>down<br>down<br>10:04 AM<br>abstraction of money<br>psychologyy of spending<br>standard of lioving<br>what it realy means<br>how you could live<br>extreme version<br>cave of neccesities<br>wow.<br>10:05 AM<br>what it means to be ok<br>absense of pain<br>health<br>psychological security<br>physiologic securioty<br>health and safety and secutriotyy<br>you self and family<br>ultimately self.. because youre so fucking selfing  \nyou are<br>hey be yourself<br>at least be honest about it<br>do not hide for cukke<br>sake<br>wjhat is there to hide<br>fear same  ofld fucking fvear<br>same old<br>inhibitions<br>down<br>fears of what!!!!?????<br>oh its you<br>youre bad<br>youre less<br>your silly<br>you have shit all over you<br>youre diurty<br>you smell<br>youre vbad<br>you smell<br>shit<br>making in your pants<br>great just what i want to talk about<br>maybe thats a connection<br>to the shame<br>and inhibitions<br>bizarre<br>My fear of people is fear that I am being seen as someone who they do not like because I just shit my pants and they want to run away from, like they did, I tried to play into the game to cover my pain and confusion and shame<br>covering over shame<br>playing the game<br>I said, in effect, I am going to get you<br>Im the monster<br>the ugly one<br>the one you want to avoid<br>yes, try, marshall<br>10:11 AM<br>what is worth doing<br>you must be prompted  remember that<br>provide for health and safety so you and others can explore<br>thats all that matters<br>huge implications<br>what is genuinely worth doing other than that?<br>human evolution<br>has gotten to where I am so healthy and so safe that I can do this<br>survival is secondary<br>dangerous thought<br>perhaps tghats all humans can do<br>explore<br>and work toward health and safety<br>all of this business and economy<br>is it all required for health and safety and security??<br>i just dobn;t understand it enopuigh<br>the pricioples<br>the dynaimics<br>of econoinmy i guess<br>if the goals is ONLY health and safety and security<br>and that should perhaps be the only goal?

I think the caffeine ahead of time contributes as well; hard to know how much.  The space in which I was immediately propelled lasts only a minute or so, but of course it seems like a much longer time  as though the experience reaches completely past the idea and the perception of time.<br>I have read, if I recall correctly, that chocolate (a MAOI?) might increase the duration of that first level.  (Found it: Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.  Perhaps I will try a cocoa-coffee mixture in the future.<br>The positiveness of the experience matched the positiveness of my set and setting  very self-fulfilling I suppose.<br>What did I get out of this experience?<br>I have a very busy life, and these experiences  including this one  remind me to consider other paths and other possibilities.  They remind me of my dreams, of things I would like to do with my life.  They help me take stock of where I am, what Im doing with myself, where my head is.  It is all too easy for the months and years to go by so quickly.  Im fortunate to have an interesting career and it pays the bills, but there is so much more; there is the wonder of what existence and reality and consciousness are, and of what is possible to experience.\n\n\n"
