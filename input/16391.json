 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have enjoyed kava for a while now and living in New Zealand it is quite easy to get hold of. I have even brought it from a local super market.\r\nToday I mixed 3 large teaspoons of kava powder with water and then added some lime juice to take away some of the earthy taste (which is not nice)  I downed the glass in one on an empty stomach and imedeately felt my mouth and lips go numb.  After about five minutes my head was happily hazy and I felt totally relaxed but still focused enough to cook dinner.  As I was cooking the effects grew stronger and focusing on cooking became harder but still manageable.\r\nI felt very relaxed by now an quite talkative, which was tough luck on the sales person who came to the door.  I ate dinner without any problems and went to my computer for a spot of gaming.  My head wasnt focused enough to kill people so I spent the next hour or so reading and listening to music, which sounded clearer and much more interesting.  I guess it is similar to being slightly stoned but rather nicer.\r\nAfter about two hours of feeling very good the effets have begun to decline and I am toying with the idea of having some more.\r\nI have always found Kava to be a useful relaxant with no adverse side effects (apart from the taste) and Im sure I shall continue to use it when I feel the desire.\n\n\n"
