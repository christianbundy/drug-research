 "report": "<p>I have enjoyed kava for a while now and living in New Zealand it is quite easy to get hold of. I have even brought it from a local super market.</p><p>Today I mixed 3 large teaspoons of kava powder with water and then added some lime juice to take away some of the earthy taste (which is not nice)  I downed the glass in one on an empty stomach and imedeately felt my mouth and lips go numb.  After about five minutes my head was happily hazy and I felt totally relaxed but still focused enough to cook dinner.  As I was cooking the effects grew stronger and focusing on cooking became harder but still manageable.</p><p>I felt very relaxed by now an quite talkative, which was tough luck on the sales person who came to the door.  I ate dinner without any problems and went to my computer for a spot of gaming.  My head wasnt focused enough to kill people so I spent the next hour or so reading and listening to music, which sounded clearer and much more interesting.  I guess it is similar to being slightly stoned but rather nicer.</p><p>After about two hours of feeling very good the effets have begun to decline and I am toying with the idea of having some more.</p><p>I have always found Kava to be a useful relaxant with no adverse side effects (apart from the taste) and Im sure I shall continue to use it when I feel the desire.</p>"
