As a chronic sufferer of cluster headaches for the past year I was desperate to find a way out of the random pain prison. I lost 2 businesses, a commercial building, and countless nights of sleep. Preventatives dealt with symptoms (miserably I might add) and I needed to get to the cause. The following is a brief report of limited success with psilocybin mushrooms.<br><br>
Ordered spores and bag for sterile growing. <br>
Harvested and dried.<br>
Detoxed on all medication for 2 weeks prior to ingestion.<br><br>
Began with 2 grams dried and got slight hallucinations with a mild attack at the end of the evening. This was unusual since all attacks for me are severe and last &gt;20 minutes. After this first dose I was H/A free for about 6 days with minor shadows. From my reading I decided to do a follow up dose again with 2 grams. Almost identical response occurred with a mild attack at the end of the trip. <br><br>
I got a typical severe attack about 5 days later. Being chronic I attempted to raise the dose as 2 grams provided some relief perhaps 3 would provide a bit more. Basically, I was looking to break the cycle and find the least amount of discomfort (the ride) in amount of mushrooms as possible. The 3 gram trial went on week after week for about 4 consecutive weekends with similar patterns of end of trip Headache and shadows between dosing. <br><br>
Finally I tried a 4 gram treatment about six weeks ago and have only had a handful of attacks with the same characteristics as before the mushroom treatment. That would be an attack almost every day the very second my eyes opened in the morning. <br><br>
In summation I have had mixed results with psilocybin treatment as a chronic sufferer and will re-visit this therapy if/when I detect a change in the manifestation of the headaches. Clearly this therapy has a direct effect on the neurophysiology of our condition and I'm very grateful to those who have helped to amass knowledge on this subject.<!-- End Body -->
