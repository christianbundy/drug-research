 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was trying to get the hallucinogenic effect of hyoscyamine on this trip, I took 25 tabs of .375mg. After 20 hours I figured nothing was happening then I realized that I was on a powerful anti-psychotic. It appears seroquel will arrest any hallucinogenic episodes, schizophrenic or drug induced.\n\n\n"
