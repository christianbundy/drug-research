 "report": "<p>Read a little bit about this stuff online, decided to pick some up at a local head shop.  Pretty pricey.  </p><p>First try -- smoked 8 hits out of a standard MJ metal pipe.  Smoke was a little harsh, not too bad.  Noticed no appreciable effects, other than a somewhat funky taste in my mouth.</p><p>Second try -- pulled out 7 grams.  Steeped it in boiling water, strained the tea into a cup, added some sugar.  Tasted pretty decent.  Steeped the material again, drank another cup of weaker tea.  Ate all of the plant matter, washing it down with cold water.  Felt very little effect, perhaps a bit of euphoria, but might well have been placebo effect.</p><p>Not worth the money.</p>"
