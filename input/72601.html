mCPP down the hatch... bad taste... almost sour and bitter at the same time. Not bad if mixed with Gatorade.<br><br>
T:15<br>
Light nausea onset, not unbearable but uncomfortable. Pupils beginning to dilate. Everything seems bright. <br><br>
T:30 <br>
Strong nausea, vomiting. There goes a good lunch.<br><br>
T:40<br>
Hunched over the toilet vomiting again.<br><br>
T:60 <br>
Nausea has completely subsided and now I am beginning to finally enjoy the experience. <br><br>
T:80<br>
Pupils highly dilated. Everything seems to be moving slightly. The farther away the object of focus the greater the movement. Looking outside provides an almost earthquake like feeling. A mild paranoia is also beginning to set in. It feels like someone is in the room with me when no one actually is.<br><br>
T:100<br>
Earlier regrets and feelings of why did I do this have completely gone out the window. It feels great. I feel happy without a care in the world. Its incredible. <br><br>
T: 2 hrs <br>
Beginning to worry as I have to be at work in 30 minutes and I have still not come down. Paranoia greatly increased by this worry. Still feeling good over this worry/paranoia.<br><br>
T: 2hr15min<br>
Time to head to work and still flying. Everything outside looks amazing as I walk through the grass, looking down into the grass, everything seems to become greener as I progress, eventually becoming a glowing neon green. 2 cigarettes help to ease any worry about going into work. <br><br>
T: 2hr30min<br>
Arrive at work. To my surprise the only symptom that I am unable to control is the incredible dilation of my eyes and some occasional jitters. Other than that work actually became quite enjoyable in this state (by saying this I do not recommend that anyone goes into work after taking mCPP or any other drug, ultimately I regret doing it).<br><br>
T:3hr30min<br>
Finally coming down. Euphoria less noticeable. Mild headache coming on. <br><br>
T:4hr<br>
Effects of drug, other than eye dilation, have all but disappeared. Headache strengthening. <br><br>
T:5hr <br>
Eyes back to normal. Headache almost unbearable. A few advil taken to ease the headache. After I got past the initial nausea it is all worth it.<!-- End Body -->
