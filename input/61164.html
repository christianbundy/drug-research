I'm not sure as to why I decided to do it. Anything for a high I guess. But anyway one night near the end of the summer I took a bunch of my welbutrin pills. At first I didnt feel much. I got a little drowsy after about fourty minutes and I lay down and watched tv. I started to see little things on the floor and they looked like spiders but I knew that it was just in my head so I didnt care. And then I felt sick so I got up and tried to walk to the bathroom. It felt like the world was flipping violently from side to side. And I couldnt even make it out the door so I had to crawl the rest of the way. <br><br>
The rest of the night is extremely hazy to me but the things I do remember are that I spent most of it by the toilet and the rest lying on th floor out side the bathroom because I couldn't seem to get any farther than that. I remember thinking that I was going to die and hoping I would because I have never felt that bad in my entire life. My mother found me the next morning lying on the carpet in a pile of my own vomit. And the next couple of days were spent in my bed I was unable to walk properly for days and I chewed the skin off the insides of my cheeks. Im pretty sure I had a seizure (welbutrin is known to cause seizures in high doses) and my memory's been pretty messed up ever since. <br><br>
It was without a doubt the worst experience of my life. Trust me its not worth it.<!-- End Body -->
