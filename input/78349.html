I bought 2 grams of JWH-018 and me and my friend decided to give it a try.  I placed a few little crumbs in the pipe on some ash and proceeded to hit it, not a bad taste.  My friend hit it with a few new crumbs.  I put a piece on that was probably 2 or 3 miligrams and hit it, wow really tasted it that time.  My friend hit a piece about the same size.  <br><br>
I started feeling like I had to move constantly, I started tripping balls and my friend said he was too.  I started thinking that I had severely ODed on this stuff it felt like ketamine and salvia hit me both at the same time and lasted 45 minutes if not a little longer.  I threw up hardcore like 6 times but my friend did not believe because he had not eaten, and every time I threw up I would still be tripping.  The only thing I could do was drink plenty of water and hope it would end shortly.  <br><br>
I am finding the legal stuff is far stronger then what is illegal.  What is going on? I wonder how long until someone dies on this and it is made illegal, because I seriously think if someone took over 50 or 75 miligrams of the stuff I had they would not be in good shape.  All I have to say is those who are not careful when dosing will regret it severely.<!-- End Body -->
