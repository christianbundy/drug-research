Being the eldest male of five siblings from a divorced parent background, I've had my share of problems. I was about 19-20 at the time I tried Transcendental Meditation, but before this, I was spiralling out of control - mainly from all the college day drugtaking ( downers, alcohol, beer, and the sheer joy of peer pressure ) - but also from failure to face day to day facets of real life problems on even keel. So I basically had two problems  the drugtaking and living in an impenetrable eggshell. The drugtaking was basically an MTV-influenced reward and punishment lifestyle  and the eggshell life prevented me from seeing problems  both good and bad  as they really were. Instead I had warped up all psychological defense and offense mechanisms for dealing with real life situations.<br><br>
I decided to try Transcendental Meditation and began saying Ohhhhmmmm 15 minutes a day. Sometimes twice daily. Sometimes more. After about two weeks of this, there was a certain lucidity to my thoughts. Problems could be separated from emotion. And I started smiling more, becoming more calm  for a moment, there was some window of lucidity from all the turbulent and neurotic experiences a shy college boy faced. <br><br>
Now I am 43. The TM experience was particularly significant on hindsight because medical findings have documented meditative experiences as bringing a healing dimension to overall well-being. I guess brain circuitry is rewired with meditation, and traffic of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters are manually controlled by the individual for the first time.<br><br>
I have used meditation from time to time  but never with the diligence used during those days. I find that controls Ive imposed on myself twenty years ago in a meditative state, still hold today. Two decades ago, Ive ordered myself to be transported into the Alpha level when joining my thumb and two index fingers together (Silva Method of Mind Control )  I find the same still holds true after 20 years. Amazing.<!-- End Body -->
