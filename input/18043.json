 "report": "<p>\nI was in car accident 2 weeks ago and I broke my femur and hip and had to have intense surgery.  In the hospital I was on all kinds of pain medicine, morphine, toradol and something begining with a d.  But when I was sent home the doctor sent me home with percocet 5/325 to take 2 every 4 hours as needed for pain.  I was in extreme pain my first few days so I was taking 2 pills every 4 hours faithfully for about a week.  The pain has gone down alot and I really dont need the pills anymore but I feel like I need them...like I'm addicted.  So I came back to my favorite site Erowid to see what my percocet pills were all about.  I find about that the 5 is 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 tylenol (acetaminophen) so I have been taking 60mg of oxycodone a day.  I am now goin to take one every 4 hours and then half every 4 hours and try to get my self off these pills.  I feel physically addicted to these pills and a little mentally.  A little warning to people going to take percocet for pain...be careful!</p>"
