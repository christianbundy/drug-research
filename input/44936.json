 "report": "<p>After learning of its obscure existence, I ordered a supply of 98% pure yohimbine from a body building supply website (very inexpensive). Appearance was a fine white crystalline substance; very fluffy material. I would estimate my total insufflated dose at around 80mg, a considerable amount. Within about 10 minutes I felt extremely energized, effects very similar to amphetamines. Effects stayed strong for a very long time. It was a good 14 hours before I was physically able to sleep. </p><p>While I myself have not had the misfortune of combining it with alcohol, friends who have tried them simultaneously have always gotten very, very sick, and then been stuck with staying awake in their condition for another 8-12 hours.</p>"
