I had my urine test last tuesday.  I drank plenty of fluids and took 40 mg of lasix. I don't do serious illegal drugs (I'm 52 and was raised in the flower child era and did my share of weed, acid, mushrooms, pcp, coke, etc. about 25-30 years ago).  I do sometimes take Metabolift, Sudafed, and occasional phentermine (as close to illegal as I get now a days) to help me thru busy days and my 12 hour schedules.<br><br>
I was especially nervous due to my being a Registered Nurse and the scare stories we hear. 'Rumors' alone could screw a nurse up at work. One of Gary Null's books recommended Adranifil, as part of an anti-aging program, so finally figured, I had documentation of my belief of it being 'ok' to back up any problems.  I took in a list of all my rx's and herbals, to test, I took two Adranifil that morning and all the initial tests came back negative. I noticed that they used a cut off for amphetamine of 1000. Nothing had to be sent to secondary testing.<!-- End Body -->
