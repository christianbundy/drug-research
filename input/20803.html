We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
This is a journal entry from last year:<br><br>
'I had a very powerfull experience tonight. I started off by eating around 600mg DXM. We went out and purchased a bottle of ethyl chloride (maximum impact), and two 24 count boxes of whippits. I started filling balloons for my friends and watching them enjoy the wonders of N2O. Then I decided to inhale some of the magic myself. I filled one balloon, placed it in my mouth, and filled another. I inhaled both balloons, one right after the other, then proceeded to inhale ethyl chloride. I blacked out. I was starting to gain consciousness and everything was echoing. All the people around me where laughing. Finally I was 'baseline' well, conscious at least. I thought I had enough so I called my girl friend and told her to pick me up from the gathering. I decided to voyage one more time. So I did the same thing again. <br><br>
I completely blacked out and was placed into the awareness of myself as a child. The same imagery and memories kept repeating. I usually see pictures of my childhood while on nitrous but not this vividly and not this far back. I heard a voice say 'is this what it takes to wake you up!?' A bright white flashed and I was tunneling and spiralling back to a semi-aware state. I heard the other people at the party trying to wake me up. I thought I was dying. I screamed really loud then started crying. i finally came to awareness. It felt like being pulled out of a pool after nearly drowning to death.<br><br>
The spirit of nitrous oxide told me that its time to retire. I've learned a lot from these substances and to continue to use them would be dangerous for my psyche. It's time to move and put faith in myself. <br><br>
I would like to add that the use of inhalents is very dangerous alone and in combination with other drugs. I learned this first hand tonight. I feel as though I completely shut off air flow to my brain and it literally turned off. Please be carefull when utilising such tools.<br><br>
The thought of that experience really creeps me out. Just the thought that I was so careless and ignorant about those drugs angers me. To this day I still haven't (ab)used inhalents. Please be cautious when ingesting any substance.<!-- End Body -->
