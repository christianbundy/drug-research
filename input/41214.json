 "report": "<p>All times 24-hour clock</p><p>(5-MeO-MiPT @ 25mg/ml @ 67% Ethanol)</p><p>(Syrian Rue 4x extract, powder)</p><p>This is a log of all food, and etc.</p><p>17:00 fish sandwich, French Fries, sugar-free cola.</p><p>21:00 1-2 cups kettle corn</p><p>22:00  1/3 of a 1/4tsp measure of Syrian rue put in glass.</p><p>0.125ML 5-MeO-MiPT solution added.</p><p>1/2 oz 99% ethanol added and mixed well.  Soak 1 min.</p><p>Added 2-3 oz Maker's Mark brand Whiskey.</p><p>4 OZ Sweet and sour mix added.</p><p>2 US standard tray-style ice-cubes added.</p><p>22:10 begin drinking slowly.</p><p>23:00 Finished not too long ago. Slightly giddy.  Some visual after-effects.  Similar to camera-flash blips.  Slightly woozy. Rush comes fairly quickly.  It feels like it takes 30+ mins, but it was more like 10.</p><p>Peak was different than last time.  Rather than a fast spike, it was more like a slow flood, waters rising to a little bit lower level.  It was much more enveloping.  Speech became difficult for a while.  Subjective time was another 30-40 mins.  Real time was probably about another 10 mins. Body load was VERY noticible during peak.  Vibration and a feeling my arms, hands, etc. just weren't right.  I get this from time to time IRL, and from other weak trips, and this was the same but amplified.  This might not make sense to everyone.</p><p>25:53 OMG, It's not even been an hour!?!?  It felt like it had to be at LEAST 2 hours.  Everything's manageable and good.  Having lots of fun with friends-on-pot and SO-on-alcohol.  We're talking about all sorts of things, from sex, to poop, to the internet.</p><p>01:43 99% baseline for a while.  This 99% baseline contines for a while also.  Faint recurrances at 25% for a few seconds, off and on.  We all went to sleep not too long after.</p><p>Sleep was good.</p><p>Stayed in bed late.  Woke up normal.  Happy mood, normal appetite.  No impairment whatsoever.  Normal day activities followed normally as normal in the normal manner, normally.</p>"
