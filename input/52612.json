 "report": "<p>45 mins after ingestion of this drug, in the form of powder in a pill, I ate a small amount of cold pizza, I left with my friend to smoke some marijauna of high potency. when we stopped i felt queezy. I vomited, shortly afterwards.</p><p>I experinced a strange high, ive never felt before, almost uncomfortable, because lights were flashing to me, only a hallucination. I smoke the marijuana, then drove home, as i arrived home and stood up out of my car, the trip hit me [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]. It was another 20 mins of so when i started peaking, i peaked for a little over 20 mins, periodically i smoked a hit or two of marijuana, it enhanced the hallucinations, it was a good overall trip lasting 5 to 6 hours before i slept.</p><p>Periodically afterwards, when i smoke pot i can feel the residual affects of the 2C-I. it is not a very healthy hallucinagen and ill never do it again, though it was fun, ill stick to the naturals, like psilocyban mushrooms.</p>"
