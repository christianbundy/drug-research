 "report": "<p>Its 8:44pm and I have just ingested 12 Benadryl pills containing a total of 300mg of the active ingredient diphenhydramine HCL.  After reading all of the information about the effects of the drug and all of the experiences with all of the negative feedback of the drug I decided to take it and find out for my self what this drug is really all about.  I have done a good amount of drugs in my time and I consider my self to have a very strong mind so what ever may happen I think I will be able to keep control of myself. Or will I be able to?  We will soon find out I suppose.</p><p>It is now 9:14pm nothing so far. Im just listening to music waiting.. </p><p>Its 9:44pm I feel a little bit dizzy and sleep sounds like a good idea but I will be fighting it.</p><p>10:04pm I am really dizzy, pretty tired things and just kind weird like not real, my arms are a little bit heavy and eyes are really heavy.</p><p>11:00pm I just smoke a cigarette and drank a Coca-Cola to help fight the tiredness. Seemed to work.  I am no longer tired. However I have not seen anything or felt anything special yet and so far it sucks, I feel like I have a little marijuana buzz, and absolutely no hallucinations what so ever. </p><p>11:44pm Im dizzy very tired again and I have no visuals and this is really boring trying to stay awake. Maybe it's because I didnt have an empty stomach when I took them so maybe it will take longer to set in but so far its nothing like anyone has described to me.</p><p>12:22pm this is not really any thing to stay up for. No visuals, no auditory hallucinations, just dizzy, and tired.</p><p>1:00pm Nothing this sucks Im going to bed.</p><p>This drug isnt even worth trying. I didnt believe all of the reports on how the drug wasnt any fun; well its definitely true. I didnt even have any hallucinations.  Also when I woke up this morning at 11:20 I felt completely normal no hangovers like others have described.  I think the reason why I probably did not hallucinate was due to the fact I didnt take enough, I weight 190lbs.  However Im not even going to try this drug again it just didnt seem to be enough fun to try a larger does next time.</p>"
