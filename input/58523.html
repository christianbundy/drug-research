I'm a certified pharmacy technician in a hospital with rather shoddy inventory control, at least with unscheduled substances such as Soma. Occasionally I'll also come across a stray controlled substance -- in this case, 1 mg clonazepam.<br><br>
I suffer from major depression and panic disorder, and take 40 mg Prozac a day, plus the occasional mg of Ativan as needed.<br><br>
One fine evening, I felt like shit. Really, really depressed. I had to do something to cheer myself up before I just crawled into bed and cried all night. I figured this combination could only help. I'd used Soma in the past, but this was my first experience with Klonopin. After eating something to prevent stomach irritation I tend to get, I took two 350 mg tabs of Soma. As for the Klonopin, I started small, approximately 1/4th the tab, crushed and snorted over the course of several minutes. Not unpleasant. Shortly after, my nose felt very cold, almost as if I had snorted snow. Odd, but not painful or worrisome. I would guess it was local vasoconstriction, and thus would not recommend snorting this regularly. Any drip was virtually tasteless.<br><br>
From my original, unexpurgated report at the time, approximately 45 minutes post ingestion:<br><br>
'Dancing to Goldie. Feel great. Getting a nod of sorts.hard to stand up. whee. spinning on my chair is a lot of fun. Felt the urge to put on some makeup, so I did. basically random scribbles around my eyes.' <br><br>
Then my sister and her boyfriend came over to take me to a party I forgot about. Was a relatively boring party, but I had fun. I'd definitely call this a party drug combination. Not overly sedating, felt like dancing, everything silly. I probably wouldn't attempt to drive under the influence, but otherwise, I was normally coherent and cognisant. I felt very inspired, artistically, and probably would have ended up painting or drawing if not for the party. <br><br>
I wouldn't recommend this as a chronic treatment for depression, but it snapped me out of a near-suicidal mood. Similar to good marijuana, life was magical and interesting, the world my canvas to create upon.<br><br>
I took another .25 mg of the Klonopin days later, when I went bowling with some people and had to be surrounded by rude, prissy teenagers and their horrid music. The Klonopin quickly erased any anxiety, and I felt more outgoing and cheerful. I'm a benzo fan for life and recommend them highly to anyone who needs them.<!-- End Body -->
