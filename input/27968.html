In the last few weeks, I have been totally burnt out. I have had insane amounts of work to do and been very tired. Just as I finished one set of hurdles, I came to the realization that I had exams in three weeks. I regularly drink Korean Ginseng, but this does not significantly elevate me. I decided to try Ginko Biloba, having heard good things about it from genuinely scientific sources, in particular that it stimulates ATP production. It sounded like just what I needed. I began taking two 60mg capsules every day - one in the morning and one in the evening. That was two weeks ago. <br><br>
Now, I should tell you that I am usually a person who requires a lot of sleep, a fair amount of relaxation time, etc. in order to be in an energized, mentally clear and alert state.<br><br>
Well, for the last week I have been living on four hours of sleep per night and I am hardly tired. Relaxation? I have no relaxation. Every waking moment I am doing something constructive. My mental clarity is as good if not better than it is when I have optimal lifestyle conditions, and I have enough energy to do whatever I want to do.<br>
I also noticed that my appetite seems to have dropped: I only eat a small serve for breakfast, lunch and dinner yet am not hungry at all during the day.<br><br>
In addition, I have noticed a general elevation in mood and have had the will to face any problems that approach me, instead of mentally avoiding them or needlessly worrying.<br>
The effects of the drug are not acute, I do not feel like my head is under any sort of pressure, or like its raised a foot above my body (a strange point I know, but somehow I unconsciously presumed this is how one would feel when using nootropics). I just begin to notice a dramatic improvement in overall state after about one week.<br><br>
Thanks to Ginko Biloba I have been able to live like I never thought possible. I feel like Napoleon Bonaparte, the legendry French general who allegedly achieved what he did seldom sleeping and constantly 'on the go'.<br><br>
Ginko Biloba is a wonderful herb. It has fulfilled all of my expectations and more.<!-- End Body -->
