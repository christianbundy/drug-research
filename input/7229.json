 "report": "<p>\nFirst off, I was did not know what I was getting when I took these pills. I didn't know how potent Xanex was or anything (i have since learned to KNOW about the drug you are about to indulge in). BUT, since I did not know that the dosage that was given to me was a lot, I didn't worry about how much alcohol i was consuming.</p><p>All that I know is that I took the first Xanex pill at about 7pm, the 2nd one a half hour later and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up the next afternoon not knowing what the hell happened. I have never blacked out before so it scared me shitless. The even crazier thing is that I was at work (at a bar) when i took the pills and so I have no idea how I worked, how much I drank, how I got home, nothing. I am much more careful now, but I don't know if I'll ever take Xanex again.....</p>"
