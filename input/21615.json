 "report": "<p>Opiates for Anxiety</p><p>Ive been using opiates regularly for almost a year.  Am I an addict?  Probably.  Though I solely use them in social settings (rarely by myself) to enhance my own level of social interaction and beat down anxiety.  I have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, among a few other things.  I have found that the Klonopins, Lorazepams, and Xanax just dont cut it.  The only thing I have found to be completely affective in warding off my panic attacks, nervousness, etc. is opiates (primarily Hydrocodone, but Ive done lots and lots of Codeine and Percocet, and when Im lucky Ill come across some Oxycontins or Morphine).</p><p>I am aware that regular Acetaminophen doses are extremely hard on the liver, so for about the last 4 or so months Ive been using a cold water extraction technique to alleviate this problem when Im dosing with Hydrocodone.</p><p>So, every morning before I head out the door to class I measure out a dose of Hydrocodone.  I typically measure 45mgs worth of pills from a valid prescription I received for some severe migraines I was having, crush them up, soak the powder in approximately 4ml of 39 F degree water for every pill and wait 20-30 minutes as the solution sits in the refrigerator (while stirring every 5 minutes).  Also, I usually drop a few ice cubes in the mix to drop the solutions temperature much faster.  (Hydrocodone is soluble in water while Acetaminophen is only slightly so).  After the time is up I proceed to pour the liquid into a bleached coffee filter, allowing it to drip (filter) down into a small glass or cup.</p><p>I enjoy dosing this way more then any other way due to a couple of factors. 1.  Its safer and healthier.  2.  In liquid form opiates tend to hit (effect) me much more quickly.  The only really downside to this method is the taste of the liquid, its terribly bitter.  To counteract this I have used Crystal Light or Stevia (a natural sweetener found at most health food stores).</p><p>This account is of my most recent Opiate (Hydrocone experience).</p><p>T 0.0m  I dose down 20mg of liquid Hydrocodone (half of what I prepared), before I go to the store, and then on to school.  I hop in my car and get going.  I am aware there are precautions about driving on opiates but I myself have never felt unable to operate my car.  In fact I rather enjoy driving on opiates.  Its very relaxing.</p><p>T 10m  I feel a warm tingle originating from the base of my spine shooting the slightest bits of euphoric impulse all throughout my upper half.  </p><p>T 20m  The same tingling sensation is causing moderate euphoria at the moment.  I am very relaxed.  I feel comfortable and appreciative of every person who is around me. </p><p>T 45m  Im absolutely intrigued by everyone, the future seems so completely clear.  I am able to conceptualize the exact tasks I need to accomplish in order to reach the future I desire.  I feel excessively euphoric and a bit itchy around my nose and eye brows.</p><p>T 120m  Im starting to feel the lovely opiate euphoria decrease.  Ill probably redose in about another 30 minutes. </p><p>T 150m  I redose.  At this point Im feeling somewhat irritable and uncomfortable.  That feeling almost instantly went away due to the fact that I know the opiate will soon be affecting me once more.</p><p>T 220m  I feel great!  I know the high will last me throughout the rest of my classes.  I dont mind being sober for the remainder of the night, though I know Ill be irritable and sort of pissed off.</p><p>I strongly recommend you dont get involved with Opiates.  They havent damaged me in any perceivable manner as of yet but I can foresee the road they are leading me down, and it isnt a happy one.</p>"
