*All doses taken 1/2 hour prior to sleep on empty stomach<br><br>
Night 1: 500mg Valerian root, 50mg B-6, 6mg melatonin<br><br>
Nice dreams, situations in dreams were quick to change as I couldn't stay focused in one dream or another for very long.<br><br>
Night 2: 500mg Valerian root, 1g B-6, 6mg melatonin <br><br>
The increased B-6 helped to realize I was in a dream, but outside influences (namely my baby sister) kept me up and awake most the night.<br><br>
Night 3: 2g Valerian root, 1.5g B-6, 6mg melatonin<br><br>
By far the best experience yet, I actually dreamed I was up and walking around my house getting ready for the day when I got into my car I heard a ringing noise, looked to my left and then realized I was starring at bed side table with my alarm clock ringing loudly. The dream was very real and accurate. The best part was realizing everything I had just seen was just a dream and not reality. I heard my foot steps, I saw and heard the tv on, I heard outside noises, everything was in it's place like normal, and it seemed too real until I woke up and then jumped for joy realizing I was just dreaming.<br><br>
I will continue large amounts of all Valerian root, B-6, and melatonin to see what happens. I want to get to that reality point in my dream again and see what I can control or manipulate. I also want to see how many of my senses I can affect at once. I will keep you all informed.<!-- End Body -->
