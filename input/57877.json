 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMe and a friend went up north to see Foo Fighters play. The plane left at around 12 30pm so I got up around 10 30am. When we got up there we walked around the city and got a bite to eat then headed off to the concert. It was my first big stadium concert and I was extremely physically tired afterwards.<br>We met another friend who went and decided to go back to someones place for drinks. The original idea was to have a couple then grab a taxi back to our motel but we ended up staying up all night, getting drunk and sobering up all while awake. <br>It was after about 12 30pm on the second day that I started to feel funny. Whenever I sat down I would hear people talking really loudly to the side of me, and would see people running flat tack at me only to disappear when I looked at them. As we sat in the airport lounge on the way back I sat on the seat staring pretty much into space. I thought everyone in the entire airport was looking at me.<br>I really want to try it again, but for longer periods of time. I read somewhere that Mike Patton wrote the Faith No More song Caffiene during a sleep deprivation experiment, hopefully I can do something as cool as that.\n\n\n"
