I have bipolar disorder &amp; have faithfully been taking Wellbutrin XL 450 mg every morning for the last 4 years. At the time I was not on a mood stabilizer &amp; was in the midst of a major depressive episode. I dont believe that had any effect on the physiological symptoms, however.<br><br>
After drinking enough to be fairly inebriated, I thought it would be a good idea to take approx. 9 tablets of 150 mg Wellbutrin XL because it was the only drug that ever worked for me; if it didnt improve my mood Id hoped it would at least kill me or knock me out for a long long time. I took the pills around 2 or 3 am &amp; went to bed immediately after. <br><br>
Around 6 am I practically jumped out of the bed extremely disoriented due to the incredible nervous energy radiating throughout my body &amp; mind. I was twitching, uncoordinated, &amp; had slight difficulty choosing words. I snuck out of my apartment without waking bf or friends &amp; hopped on a bus to get to a train station which would take me to a hospital I knew fairly well.<br><br>
I definitely blacked out on the bus &amp; probably looked like I was overdosing on something. At this point my sense of time was non-existent &amp; I knew that Wellbutrin can cause hallucinations. I was terrified that my heart was going to simply stop from beating so fast, and incredibly paranoid that I was seeing &amp; interacting w/ things that werent there (or failing to register important information like oncoming cars).<br><br>
30 ft from the bus stop I had a seizure &amp; fell down all the stairs leading into the subway. I have no idea how long I was unconscious or whether it was because of the seizure or my head making the acquaintance of each &amp; every stair. I woke up feeling very strange &amp; all I could think of is Why is my face so cold? Why do I feel like Im lying down when Im not? Why is my face so cold? That went on for a while &amp; then I realized there was a man standing over me. He asked me if I was ok. I definitely was not ok but I nodded on post-seizure autopilot. I kept laying there on the ground &amp; he walked away w/out another word. That was a fairly strange interaction so Im not sure if he was real.<br><br>
I was growing more &amp; more disoriented, incoherent, &amp; I knew my auditory, visual, &amp; tactile perception was distorted. I eventually made my way onto the train &amp; wound up getting off at the wrong stop &amp; having no idea where I was, where I was going, or if the people I was seeing everywhere were real. I kept hearing very fast footsteps all around me, hissing whispers in male voices &amp; gentle muffled feminine voices, almost like singing. After I saw there wasnt a living soul on any of the blocks I could see, my thinking was a little less realistic. Instead of suspecting a rapist or mugger I thought maybe they were demons &amp; angels arguing &amp; coming to escort me from this world (but they were definitely auditory hallucinations lmao). I had lost my phone when falling down the stairs &amp; had no money or ID. Thankfully I remembered the word, hospital &amp; my heart palpitations, increasingly fast pulse rate, higher &amp; higher blood pressure, &amp; terrifying confusion kept reminding me of my mission. I believe I found my way to the hospital myself because thats where I wound up.<br><br>
By the time I got there, (rough estimation 10-11 am) I was so incoherent that I insisted it was the year 2006. (But I did know who the president was!) When they asked how many pills I took I said A multiple of 3...like 3 or 9 or 12. Well, it obviously wasnt 3...lol &amp; for personal reasons it makes a lot of sense that I would take a multiple of 3 so 9 or 12 is what Im sticking with.<br><br>
11 to noon is when the barfing began. It wasnt cathartic in any way. I was afraid my heart was going to come out my mouth. Literally everything felt like it was shaking &amp; twitching including my heart &amp; other organs. It was probably exacerbated by my frantic &amp; incoherent racing thoughts and distorted sensory perception. That went on for hours. It was impossible to sleep or rest because of the terrible nervous energy &amp; thudding heart. They kept me in the cardiology unit for three days hooked up to IV, mad electrodes &amp; just so many wires that I couldnt get out of bed w/out help. After about a day &amp; a half my heart slowed down enough that I could sleep fairly well. After 2 days I felt mostly fine &amp; eager to get out. They gave me some more brain scans &amp; sent me on my merry way. Throughout the entire experience, I felt incredibly guilty, terrified, embarrassed &amp;, later, belittled by understandably insensitive hospital staff. <br><br>
I do NOT recommend taking Wellbutrin recreationally. I have experimented w/smaller dosages (750 mg  900 mg) &amp; the effects are the same only a bit less intense. None of them are enjoyable because there is an overwhelming sense of paranoia &amp; any visual hallucinations are usually terrifying or startling at the least. From my personal experience...<br><br>
EXAMPLES:<br><br>
Male voices hissing &amp; female voices singing which are quite disconcerting when alone. <br>
Seeing movement &amp; shadows in my peripherals which disappear rapidly the second I turn to look. <br><br>
I once saw an overturned bowl in my kitchen w/two wasps flying around inside &amp; buzzing clear as day. I didnt understand how they possibly could have gotten there so I had a friend come over to verify. There were no wasps &amp; amusingly there was no bowl either...<br><br>
Very convincing footsteps EVERY time I have overdosed or even taken one or two extra. The creepiest part is that when I stop to turn around &amp; see if someone is following you, the footsteps always stop too. I thought maybe I was hearing my own steps but theyre always the same - Id hear heeled boots hitting concrete even when I was walking barefoot on carpet. Pair that up w/the sneaky shadows &amp; movement in the peripherals &amp; you have created a nice little nightmare for yourself that can last up to 24 hours. <br><br>
There are so many better things to do recreationally than Wellbutrin. Do yourself a favor - never take more than 450 mg, &amp; only use it for its amazing depression-ravaging properties!<!-- End Body -->
