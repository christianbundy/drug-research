 "report": "<p>I cant remember most of it I kinda blacked out for a minute but what I do remember is its fucked up, its unexplainable; it was great until I took a huge toke of salvia and it just knocked me on my ass like a someone hit me in the face with a weapon with mind destroying power. I couldnt understand anything anyone was saying but I thought I understood. I thought it was over for my mind at the time during this hit then I calmed down and realized it was just the drugs. Then I felt great for another 6 hours then I blacked out and woke up around noon and smoked more salvia with friends. She got pissed off at me cause the high wasnt what she was expecting, she said it felt like she was falling off a cliff. I describe my trip as a acid frenzy with mellow cool waves. But damn that salvia.</p><p>I had great sense of nirvana and floating up and falling down again and again time and space seemed to be at my finger tips but didnt seem to amazed as I was so many times before but hey its been 17 hours since and Im still felling the seeds: but most vision where at my control such as colors red blue = neon of every</p>"
