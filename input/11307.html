This happened smack down in the middle of a week of constant pot-smoking.  My parents had left for the week and one night I went around the house and picked up all the leftover joints.  I smoked the whole thing to myself and waited.  Just as I was finishing up my brother came home.  <br><br>
The trip started out to be fairly good, but about 20 minutes in I started to feel disoriented and restless.  I ran around my house, from room to room as if I was trying to find something to latch onto.  Finally I came to rest on my parent's bed.  I lay there for a good little while, and my thoughts became twisted against me.  I felt extreme guilt.  My view of my familial relations became sour, I felt as if my family were accusing me of something, as if I had let them down.<br><br>
I had a few convulsions.  I leaped out of the bed to get away from the dark thoughts.  I started to feel anxious.  Everything around me was moving downwards.  It was like that effect I get when I look up at a building when the clouds are moving.  It looks like the building is continually falling.  I was like those buildings.  I started to feel extreme anxiety.  I ran to my brother's room and asked him to talk me down, but it did no good.  I started slipping and had the sensation of imminent death.  Finally, I started to come down.  I tried to play a video game and suffered a form of sensory overload...<br><br>
For a long time after I had the same feelings of anxiety  every time I smoked up.  I'd completely brain boxed myself.  I've managed to pin down the source of my problem as being one of mindset.  I learned that if untrained as I was, any 'psychoanalysis' done whilst on marijuana is a recipe for disaster.  I found that everything I thought about myself and my relationt to other people was twisted and dark.<br><br>
Worst is, I believed my own negative thoughts, sometimes for weeks after I came down.<!-- End Body -->
