 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis proved to be a very pleasant mix.\r\n1.5g of P Cayanescens Mushrooms\r\n2 Yellow Jackets [each contains 25mg ephedra alkaloids and 200mg caffeine alkaloids]\r\nT + 00:00  I eat 1.5 grams of the mushrooms, and swollow the two yellow jackets\r\nT + 00:10  I feel very good, euphoria.\r\nT + 00:30  Euphoria has grown quite a bit, beginning to get some visual distortions, with objects stretching and bending a bit.\r\nT + 01:00  Experience peaks.  Good closed eye visuals, no nausea, feel very very good about myself, feel very energized and a very strong euphoria. \r\nPeak lasts for about 3 and a half hours.\r\nComing down - the effects simply trail off.  No negative after effects whatsoever.\r\nAfterward, I get a good nights sleep and wake up the next morning feeling wonderful.\r\nProvided for a very pleasant experience lasting about 4 to 5 hours with no negative side effects experienced.\n\n\n"
