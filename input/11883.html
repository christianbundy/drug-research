After doing some extensive research on smart drugs/nutrients, I decided to experiment with whatever I could find over-the-counter.  I tried various substances over the course of about six months, with various results (usually a mild energized feeling).  Of everything I tried however, DMAE certainly left the biggest impression.  I purchased DMAE capsules from GNC and started on a dose of 200mg per day.  The first week was incredible, with a marked increase in energy and what I percieved to be greatly improved memory.  The downside to this, and I had read some warnings of DMAE's effects on muscle tissue, was that after the one-week point my shoulder went from tight to sore to downright painful.  I lowered the dosage to 100mg per day but the effects persisted and I stopped taking the supplement completely.  I now take a multi-supplement pill which contains 160mg of DMAE, but have yet to experience any tightening of the muscles, or such a profound effect as I did with 200mg of DMAE alone.<!-- End Body -->
