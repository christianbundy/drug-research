Well, I read about Splendens on the interweb (where else?) and was immediately intrigued by its non-scheduled-ness and its readily-availability. I was further delighted to know that it was growing just down the street from my school, naturally, I had to pick some. Please note that what I did could be considered 'stealing', but I'm sure there has been far worse documented without the use of a disclaimer, so I will continue without further delay. I have had a fair amount of experience with substances, ranging from Marijuana to Codeine, to benzos, to Propylhexedrine, to Addy, etc etc etc. However, I have never had any experience with any of the Salvia-family plants, such as the ever-growing-in-popularity Salvia Divinorum, and reading that Splendens was less intense the aforementioned, I was quite comfortable with this experimentation.<br><br>
Anyway, to make a long story short, I picked ~20 leaves and chose a medium-sized one to use sublingually. I tore off the stem, rolled it up, and shoved it under my tongue as best I could. I just let my saliva run up into the ball of plant matter and get washed down my throat as I swallowed. After about five minutes, I  could begin to feel a slight anxiolysis coming on. At about 20 minutes, the effects peaked. The only thing I could really compare it to was, perhaps, subling-ing ~1-2mg of Clonazepam, minus the dis-coordination. HOWEVER, I will say that it produced this sort of 'clarity'. I don't believe in a lot of this spiritual mumbo-jumbo that many people tie-closely to substances, but the feeling it produced was like lifting a dark, translucent film from  my train of thought, a film that most likely came from my recent  over-indulgence in marijauna. After the general backdrop of anxiolysis fell away (after about 1.5 hours, I 'buccal'd' it for about 25 minutes), I was left with this 'clarity'.<br><br>
I thoroughly enjoyed this experiment and will soon be re-visiting this very interesting plant.<!-- End Body -->
