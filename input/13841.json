 "report": "<p>Simple way to get off on kava: Take 15 pills of 110mg kava extract standardized to 55% kavalactones so that each pill is 60mg kavalactones OR 15 pills of 200mg extract standardized to 30% kavalactones so each pill is 60mg kavalactones.  Just be sure it all adds up to about 900mg kavalactones.</p><p>In 30 minutes or less, you should feel something sort of like an alcohol buzz but more in the direction of codeine.  I find a hit or two of MJ works well with Kava too.  Alcohol, valerian and St. johns wort tend to make me fall asleep, but a good 10mg of melatonin gives it a sedated trippy feel.</p>"
