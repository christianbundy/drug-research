 "report": "<p>Prior to my first outing for the world famous Camp Bisco, I had entertained maybe a dozen occasions of suspected encounters with 2C-C-NBOMe. I say suspected because, until Bisco, I had only ever had it on blotter, and it had been sold to me as LSD. Having numerous experiences with LSD, however, I was able to clearly tell the difference, and 2c-c NBOME was the only chemical whose description matched the effects I had observed. Well, considering how inexpensive 2C-C-NBOMe is compared to LSD on everybodys favorite global free market website, I decided to invest in a dozen capsules of 300ug 2C-C-NBOMe.</p><p>T-0.00; 3:00 p.m.</p><p>150ug insufflated, 150ug administered sublingually. A rise in energy is noticeable immediately, and within five minutes a markedbut manageableconfusion has set in. I am at Bisco by myself, but I have tripped by myself in the past without problems, and am confident that I will eventually run into one of a dozen or so friends who I know are here as well.</p><p>T-1.00; 4:00 p.m.</p><p>The music I am witnessing at the festival is beginning to take on an extra dimension to it. A rising euphoria is gripping me while I make use of my moderate increase in energy to dance to my hearts content, feeling as though I am a swaying part of a crowd that is all one unit</p><p>T-3.00; 6:00 p.m.</p><p>I make use of a brief break in the music to return to my campsite and reload on water and food briefly. With the lack of music, the extent to which I am tripping sets in, and at this point I would estimate that level to have been a low +2. I am aware at the time that it is the peak of this dose, and it has been a pleasantalthough not incredibly intenseexperience up to this point.</p><p>T-6.00; 9:00 p.m.</p><p>I feel as though the trip from the first dose is almost entirely over, and as I am watching an incredible set from the Disco Biscuits and know that I will be up listening to music for another 9+ hours, I decide to redose. Because of the overall lack of intensity in the first trip of the day, I decide to insufflate another full 300ug dose.</p><p>T-6.05; 9:05 p.m.</p><p>Again, I can feel the effects of the 2C-C-NBOMe nearly immediately, but something feels markedly different about the comeup on the second dose; it is much speedier, almost cocaine-like, and there is a rapidly growing feeling of disorientation. Around this time I recognize a friend of mine in the crowd, and take comfort in seeing a familiar face.</p><p>T-6.30; 9:30 p.m.</p><p>The Disco Biscuits opening live set is incredible. I am fully enveloped in their state-of-the-art visual show as well as their amazing musical chemistry. There is some sort of growing unrest inside me, however, which is causing me to want to wander to a different stage. As it turns out, I had reason to. One of my favorite artists was about to play on another stage, but I simply was too confused to remember. So, unsure of my motive but trusting my judgment, I left my friends side and departed for the dance tent. I was on my own again, but I was not worried. I reached the dance tent just before Kill The Noise was set to play, and secured a front row spot for what would become the most insane hour and a half of my life.</p><p>T-8.00; 11:00 p.m.</p><p>The music is in total discord, so jarring and unsettling, but at the same time so perfect for a trip. The heavy hitting sounds seem to conduct through my body like waves, pulling me back and forth, and I am seeing an undeniable beauty in pure chaos. I am beginning to have intense closed eye visuals, and open eye distortions. I can tell that I am not yet at my peak, and fear that I may end up tripping much harder than I anticipated. I find myself over and over again returning to the thought that the second dose may have truly kicked-in the first dose, as the initial trip was weaker than expected. Almost out of nowhere there seems to be an insufferable heat bearing down upon me. I had noticed that the dance tent was rather hot, but suddenly I got the sensation of being trapped in a sauna. I am beginning to remember that in past experiences, while tripping very hard on 2C-C-NBOMe, I had encountered very intense alternating chills and heat flashes, and I am hoping that my mind is just momentarily playing tricks on me.</p><p>My mental state is very erratic, and I am almost entirely caught in my own mind. I am entranced by the sensation of playing puppet master to my own body, at various points seeming to fully exit my physical body and control is from some vantage point above. I am very quickly losing a sense of self, and this is even more disorienting as I have never experienced an ego loss so rapidly or so intensely. I am, simultaneously, having a complete and coherent dialogue with a nameless, formless entity which I cant help but describe as God. From moment to moment, I am occasionally able to break through my confusion in order to calm my growing panic at this surprisingly intense trip, knowing that this was, in fact, what I had desired to happen in the first place. I am still being guided comfortably by the incredible music and atmosphere, although peoples faces around me are beginning to distort and appear almost menacing.</p><p>T-8.30; 11:30 p.m.</p><p>The amazing set by Kill The Noise has ended, and taking his place are two well-known Electro-House DJs. Initially, despite my yet intensifying trip, I am comforted by the feeling that my mind is being chauffeured on a journey by some of the most talented artists in the world. This is quickly replaced by panic, however, as I realize that the music has become repetitive, boring, and sloppy, and I have fully forgotten that I have the capability of leaving this stage to go to another. I take a small amount of MDMA (no more than 50mg) in the hopes that I will like the music more, and that it might pull me slightly out of the trip, which hasnt yet peaked. This seems to give me a small amount of energy, but does not alter the trip at all.</p><p>T-9.00; 12:00 a.m.</p><p>This is the peak of my experience, without a doubt. I feel as though I have a fever blazing hotter than the surface of the sun, only to suddenly feel freezing cold and stand in the middle of a crowd clutching my body for warmth. I am desperately trying to recognize a familiar face anywhere in the crowd, and I believed I had probably a dozen times before realizing that I was projecting faces I knew onto people I didnt. I am at a strong +3, being in a completely distinct reality upon closing my eyes, and having distortions and warping with my eyes open. I am afraid that my body may be overheating, which is causing me to panic more, and I also cant shake the feeling that Im sweating out too much water, even though I knew full well I was plenty hydrated. I still havent remembered that I have the ability to leave this stage, although the performance is becoming more and more unsatisfactory. </p><p>The voice of God is pelting me with questions, telling me that this was the experience I had asked for, that I had played around with powerful substances for too long without consequence. At the same time I have completely lost a sense of self, which is actually somewhat calming as far as a fear of death goes. The sounds of whispers are beginning to rise to a deafening level in my ears, and auditory hallucinations are setting in.</p><p>T-9.30; 12:30 a.m.</p><p>I am so frightened, on the verge of full panic when, suddenly, it finally occurs to me that there are other performances that I would enjoy better. Unsure of my ability to navigate the grounds, but determined to regain myself, I set out for another dance tent. After staggering along for a few minutes, I find myself in the most beautiful, calm place with the most amazing, chilled-out break beat electronic hip hop music playing. I sit down in the sparse crowd, feeling an ineffable sense of serenity, and pure contentmentnot ecstasypasses through me in waves too powerful to contain. Tears of joy stream from my eyes as tranquility erupts from my entire body. During all of this, I notice that I have miraculously managed to take a seat next to one of my closest friends, and a final sigh of relief washes over me.</p><p>T-15.00; 6:00 a.m.</p><p>Although the trip had been gradually decreasing in intensity since midnight, no real significant changes had occurred since I had found inner peace at around 12:30. I am now fully exhausted and ready to fall asleep, knowing that I have overcome one of the most jarring experiences of my life.</p><p>All in all, this trip was incredibly valuable in terms of spiritual content, but its mechanism of operation was far too fickle for my liking. 2C-C-NBOMe is incredibly powerful, but also has quite a propensity to turn dark on me at a moments notice, in a way that pure LSD or mescaline does not. One of my major motives for writing this report was to make note of an effect which I have not seen anyone else note anywherethe alternating intense chills and hot flashesbut which I have experienced multiple times on 2C-C-NBOMe. This substance can be enlightening, beautiful, tumultuous, and terrifying all at once.</p>"
