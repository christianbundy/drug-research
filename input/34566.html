On a recent occasion my girlfriend was able to obtain some fungus from a stranger for about 30% of market price. They looked like authentic little brown mushrooms, although very moist and rancid-smelling. She ate a 3.5 gram bag (a week before this experience) and felt 'a little giddy' and not much more. Based on this evidence I was not expecting much from my bag of the same volume (from what appeared to be the same batch). So, I decided to boost them with my newest research chemical acquistion: 5-MeO-MiPT.<br><br>
I put some water on the boil to make some mushroom tea. I find tea helps the experience come on quicker and reduces some body load for me, by not ingesting all the fiber from the mushrooms. Your mileage may vary. I broke the fungus up and put it in a teacup, along with a teabag and some sugar. While the tea was steeping, I weighed out 7.2 mg of Moxy. This is a dose that normally doesn't bring past a ++ on the Shulgin scale, and one I felt might bring out and enhance any psilocybin in the mushrooms. <br><br>
I dumped the chemical in some juice and drank it quickly. I then proceded to sip on the tea over the course of 20 minutes or so. By the end of the drink I knew my world was about to be twisted.<br><br>
For the next 2 hours I felt that funny, not good, not that bad come-up buzz I get with psychedelics. At +2 hours I felt I had plateaued when a friend offered me a chance to smoke some cannabis. On a whim I decided to, it's not something I do regularly, and especially not when tripping, as I usually can't feel anything. I took 2 bong rips, and within 5 minutes my friend's face started morphing and breathing. I started to get tracers off of the air that the ceiling fan was blowing and I began to get worried. <br><br>
I'm usually very comfortable when I trip, it takes a lot to freak me out. For some perspective, I'd like to say I have experience with LSD, mushrooms, San Pedro and Peruvian Torch Cacti, a few ayahuasca analogs, LSA, DPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, AMT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 4-Acetoxy-DiPT, 5-MeO-DET, MDMA, 2C-I, 5-MeO-MiPT, plus some of these mixed with harmine and harmaline, and also some DXM and Ketamine experience, for what its worth. Anyway, after smoking the bong, I began to worry that my heart was beating too fast and I was overheating. I checked my pulse and found that while slightly elevated, was nowhere near dangerous. I also could not feel any abnormal temperature on myself. I felt no physical discomfort, surprisingly little body load considering the intensity of the experience. I began to think I was going to blackout any second and wake up the next day not knowing what happened, or not wake up at all. I then had the thought, 'You're trapping yourself into a negative thought loop,' and realized I would be OK, in one way or another. <br><br>
After I assured myself, I stayed on the plateau for another 2 1/2 hours. There was no clear 'peak' but rather there were several cycles of intensity and cooling off, although it was ALWAYS intense.<br><br>
I felt that the Moxy signature was what I was feeling much more distinctly than the mushrooms, but the intensity level was unlike anything I've felt with Moxy, more like 5 grams of mushrooms with an MAOI.<br><br>
Music euphoria was in full effect for this. Music I usually don't care for tugged at my heartstrings. Good music blew me away. I was laying in the dark, listening to Tool (always good tripping music) and watching Milkdrop visuals. Suddenly the room became more interesting than the computer screen. Elaborate lattice patterns began to float in the air, and jewels were in the spaces.  The jewels began to rotate in time with the music until the end of the song, when the visuals disappeared. I then closed my eyes and began to see molecules of Moxy and Psilocybin as anthropomorphized airplanes kamikazi'ing into my brain, shattering the 'normal' serotonin and tryptamine molecules, which were unable to compete for brain receptors. By the way, I know this is *not* the way psychedelics work, but it seemed pretty cool at the time. I had a few more episodes of these types of dramatic hallucinations, but you get the idea of the kind of stuff I was enduring, and, besides, you really had to be there.<br><br>
I was surprised at how quickly everything dropped off after my plateau (+2 hours-+4 1/2 hours). Sleep was found at +8 hours, which is shocking because these kinds of drugs usually keep me up all night. I went to work the next day (today) with no hangover and no physical problems, although I kept thinking 'DAMN, I was messed up' throughout the day.<br><br>
I probably would have had more fun if I hadn't been worrying about dying off and on, but that's part of discovering new synergies, I guess. I wouldn't take the Moxy up any higher, but might consider adding more mushrooms. Definitely more than I bargained for :)<!-- End Body -->
