Last night I felt the beauty of Salvia for the first time, and I decided to submit my own report because I'm tired of reading people's horror stories about this plants powers.  <br><br>
Prior to my experience I had read up a lot about Salvia and its effects.  I decided to use raw leaves, as it would give me a more gentler experience.  I found a file online about a good method of smoking the leaves (you can find it at the lycaeum) and decided that I would give this a shot.  I put on some music (I thought that Sigur Ros' new album () would be nice) turned down all the lights a loaded a pretty hefty bowl into a bong.  My girlfriend agreed to watch over me during this trip and I'm glad she was there.  While I didn't exactly need a sitter I was comforted that she was there in case I did.  And I always enjoy when she's around.  <br><br>
I was pretty apprehensive about doing Salvia (due to some of the horrible reports) and so I sat breathing deeply for a few minutes, trying to calm myself.  Finally, I took the plunge and took two relatively large hits, holding them for about twenty seconds each and then lay back.  My girlfriend agreed to take the bong so I could lay down and go with it.<br><br>
Almost immediately I started feeling the effects.  By the time I was done with the two hits my arms felt extremely heavy and I was happy to be able to lie down, and then nothing more seemed to happen.  Behind my closed eyes I saw streaks of colors that seemed to meld and flow with the music but it was nowhere near what I expected.  Instead of giving up on the experience, however, I lay down and tried to discern the subtleties of Salvia.  I slowly gained the feeling that a spirit of the plant was talking to me, and telling me that everything was ok.  As long as I respect the plant she will take care of me.  After that all anxiety was erased completely.  <br><br>
Soon after this I felt strange little tugs on my body.  Behind my closed eyelids I could 'see' (it was as though I was seeing through another part of my body, not my eyes) little fairies flying above my body.  They had little strings attached to me at various places, like I had become a marionette, and were pulling my body with the music.  It was incredible, these fairies were making me feel the music.  <br><br>
After this I was eager to try Salvia again, but this time try and achieve greater effects.  After about an hour of trying to clean up bong water I had spilled (argh!) I tried it again.  Exact same conditions, except this time I took as many hits as I felt that I could.  <br><br>
Around the fourth hit I handed the bong to my girlfriend and then lay down.  I knew immediately that I was travelling further into the Salvia space this time.  When I closed my eyes I again began 'seeing' things but this time it was millions of tiny beans rushing over my body.  I could feel them and see them.  My body was black while the beans were tan, black, and a deep red.  They formed intricate designs over my body (reminded me of Native American art) while tickling my skin.  And again it seemed to fit perfectly with the music.  I remember thinking whether it was the music that colored the experience or that my Salvia experience was dictating the music that I was hearing.  After a while of this, a heard of voice in my left ear saying, 'this is just for you'.  I giggled a little bit and then my Salvia journey moved on.  <br><br>
Now I felt as though I were in the middle of the ocean.  I could see sunlight trickling down through the depths creating a beautiful turquoise color.  There was a man and a woman swimming around in the ocean.  They were both a pretty green color with long flowing hair that resembled seaweed.  They swam past me and the man looked at me and gestured for me to follow him.  I then looked around my immediate surrounding and noticed that I was in a giant kelp-like plant that sprang from the sea-floor.  I was in a pod of this plant and as I emerged from it I noticed that there were many others just like me escaping their own slumber and heading out into the ocean.  It was our birth from this giant mother plant.  <br><br>
I then opened my eyes and attempted to tell my girlfriend about all I had seen and felt.  These were both beautiful trips and I feel very special to have been provided with the experiences.  People need to respect Salvia, not use it haphazardly expecting cool visuals or a legal high.<!-- End Body -->
