I'm always up for something new, especially where stimulants are concerned.  After reading a few moderately positive reports regarding adrafinil, I ordered a box of 40 tablets &amp; gave it a go.  <br><br>
I ate my first tablet after work, a time when I am usually on the tired side.  I noticed a slight 'something', best described as being slightly more alert, approx. 30 minutes after.  This was a very subtle, fleeting feeling, possibly even a placebo effect kind of thing.<br><br>
I took another 300mg the following morning, followed by 300mg more around four or five hours later.  I felt a slight headache-y twinge that went away quickly &amp; nothing more.  A 200mg dose of caffeine afterwards got me a tad more jittery than usual, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I continued using 600mg a day for around a week, then I stopped as I felt it really wasn't doing much of anything for me.  <br><br>
This stuff has the side effect of making my urine smell sort of funky (or funkier than usual).  I also developed a real bitch of a backache, not sure if this is the 'inner tension' some people have reported or even if it was related to the drug at all.<br><br>
All in all I thought Olmifon was disappointing, I'd prefer ephedrine or even caffeine as a stimulant.  It may work well for others, but for me it did next to nothing.<!-- End Body -->
