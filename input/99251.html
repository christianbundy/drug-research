I had acquired something like 107mg of 4-HO-DET. My girlfriend (S) and I found a nice day to trip and decided we'd each take 25mg (as we had read that lower doses can lead to a slightly more uncomfortable experience) on an empty stomach. I have a fair amount of experience with most psychedelics while S is relatively new and has only tried shrooms once before.<br><br>
I got off work at 5 PM and arrived at S's house. We attempted to weigh out the doses with little success. The powder was so fluffy and light, my scale had difficulty getting a solid reading. I eventually gave up and landed on a dose in the 30mg range. We didn't have any capsules handy, so we placed the powder in a strip of toilet paper and washed it down with water.<br><br>
T+0:00 - The toilet paper gets caught in the back of my throat and immediately dissolves before I fully swallow it, exposing the bitter chemicals to my tongue. It reminds me of MDMA and I immediately wince. Shortly after my aunt calls me and asks me to grab her a lottery ticket while I'm in the area. S hasn't yet taken hers and is working up the courage. I measure her out something closer to 20-25mg and set it aside.<br><br>
T+0:30 - We decide now would be the best time to head out to the nearby 7/11 before I start feeling the full effects of the drug. S swallows hers and we head out.<br><br>
T+0:35 - I start to feel slight effects as soon as we get in the building. Things suddenly become very odd and I feel scattered and slightly overwhelmed. I try to focus on purchasing a lottery ticket but can't comprehend what's going on. I look around at nearby people in the store and everyone looks menacing and intimidating. I'm flooded with anxiety and all I can think about is trying to find an excuse to get out of there. Thankfully, S had not yet started tripping and handled the situation. We left and the anxiety subsides as we walk back to S's house.<br><br>
T+0:55 - We go back to S's room and I pack a bowl. After smoking, we go back to S's bed and lay down under her blankets. I note a pretty warm buzzing feeling throughout my body that is stimulating without being too energetic. The visuals consisted of complex breathing patterns emerging in walls and textures. It reminded me of an amplified version of what I get on MDA or something similar. While I'm talking, S starts to feel disoriented and says she kind of feels nauseous. She can't help but keep her eyes closed but is frightened by the intense CEVs and feels overwhelmed.<br><br>
T+1:15 - I try to get S's mind off of the drug by playing some music. She starts to cough and suddenly feels like she needs to throw up. I get her a trashcan but the nausea quickly passes and her mindset completely shifts. From this point on in the trip, she starts to feel much better, though she mentions that lights are extremely bright and asks that I dim the room (her eyes are visibly dilated).<br><br>
T+2:00 - There are moments where we mention that the effects feel like they're diminishing, only to get up and realize things are still going strong. We spend the next hour or so in bed looking at a star projector shining on her ceiling. The stars twinkle and glow and everything looks as though it's producing an aura. The edges of various things seemed to vibrate. We occasionally start to feel like we may need a change of scenery or a light on/off, but then dismiss it. There's a really strong urge to converse and we both can't stop talking about some fairly deep concepts. We think hard about human nature and the way the world works. There's the occasional pause where I start to get lost in my own thoughts and space out. I get the urge to smoke another bowl and suggest that we go to the other room, only to get distracted and start talking again.<br><br>
T+4:00 - S notes that she definitely feels as though she's coming down. Her pupils are still dilated and she mentions some slight effects, though at this point for her they're mainly mental. I'm still experiencing visuals though they've become even more similar to MDA. It's hard for me to focus on a computer screen and texting on my phone requires a substantial amount of my attention (I even end up getting distracted and not finishing the text I worked so hard on). I lose track of how much weed I've smoked and continually pack bowls. S says she feels as though she could take ridiculous hits and is actually able to without a single cough (she's a small girl and has sensitive lungs, usually making her choke at larger rips). At this point it's rather difficult to gauge how much the weed is affecting me. We head downstairs and warm up a bowl of leftover chinese food which I don't find extremely appetizing. I grab a poptart instead which is much more satisfying.<br><br>
T+5:30 - S and I begin to feel the weed catching up to us. We're still pretty talkative but agree that we feel as though we could sleep if we tried. We decide to smoke one final bowl and head to bed to lay down.<br><br>
T+6:00 - We turn off all the lights but the star projector and get under the blankets. Feeling S's body against mine becomes impossible to handle. We start to fool around, which leads to some of the longest, most passionate stoned space sex ever. I slowly drift off to sleep thinking about everything that had just happened.<br><br>
The next day we felt great and even had a bit of afterglow. There was no real hangover in any way.<br><br>
Overall, I would say the experience was a positive one. The visuals were interesting but didn't feel chaotic like they sometimes do on shrooms. There was definitely a stimulated feeling and a nice body buzz. Thoughts were abstract and deep and it was easy to communicate without getting too lost. I definitely would be interested in trying this chemical again (perhaps at a festival or a park during the day).<!-- End Body -->
