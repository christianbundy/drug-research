During the second week of 2004 I decided to ingest some MDMA. I had not used any for over a year. During the previous 7 years I had taken way too much of it. I stopped using it because it didn't really do much to me any more. After about 1.5 hours nothing had happened so I took another 130mg. After 3 hours I realized that nothing was going to happen. I had given some people some of this X at a NYE party recently and knew it was very very good. I was simply burnt out.<br><br>
All I got was a coffee-like buzz and it was late, so I decided to take some DXM to relax a little and get high. I watched a movie and felt pretty good after it. Then I went to do some things on the computer. Well, I looked at the screen and it was filled with strange alien symbols. I tried to check my fonts but I couldn't read them. Then I looked at a magazine and it had the same symbols instead of the good ol' alphabet like you see here.<br><br>
I never really felt the MDMA or the DXM, but wow, this was some freaky effect! I looked at a few more books and newspapers but could never make out anything. I also had trouble looking at the pictures. It took a long time to piece them together and figure out what they were. Somehow, I think my brain was short-circuited in a specific way, like the symbol recognition capacity had gone away for a while. I watched another movie and fell asleep. The next day I felt fine. Oh... and the symbols were back to their normal shapes and positions.<!-- End Body -->
