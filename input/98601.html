I got a hold of 250 mg MDPV from a reliable source and did some experimentation. When I first got it, I did a few small bumps with 15 minute intervals. I was pretty stimulated, and was still able to get to sleep after taking some etizolam. No serious cravings for it the following day, but still took a small bump in the morning to 'wake up.' Then I left it alone for a few days, until I got invited to go drink at a friends house. I was tired, but thought that after a bump of PV I'd be right as rain. So up the nose it went and I arrived at the party, shining. <br><br>
It got late and most of the people left, but there were a few more there. I convinced the person I was closest friends with to come back to my place and try some 'stuff that's kinda like speed,' I said. He told me he didn't want to do bath salts, because he'd done them before and hated it. I assured him that it was something else (which was a lie, but I knew that since I had pure PV he probably wouldn't know) and that he'd like it. So we started doing small lines every 30 minutes or so until sunrise talking shit all night like we were sharing our life stories with a best friend. Then the comedown started. I took a regimen of supplements for the comedown and forced myself to eat and then braced myself. There were demonic dreams, paranoia, depression, etc. I almost flushed the shit down the toilet. But my friend told me I should keep it around in case I wanted it again. So I did, and didn't touch it for a month or two. <br><br>
Once I randomly tried smoking it off foil but I have no technique so that was a bit of a failure. And one other time I took a decent bump before going out to a bar since I was tired and didn't think I'd make it through the night if I didn't. And most recently, I took a bump to get me through one more day of college. <br><br>
My conclusions on this drug is that it is only useful if used sparingly. Like once or twice a month, separated by at least a week or two. The comedown can be somewhat harsh, so I take phenibut shortly after the peak to help keep away the crazy feelings. It's not the cleanest stimulant, but if used in small doses, it can help me stay awake and be productive. Never done meth before, but this seems like a dirty version of that. The only time I really experienced any kind of euphoria I could enjoy on this drug was the time I binged all night, but that euphoria in no way was worth the comedown and aftereffects. This is a good pick-me-up for emergency situations when the dextroamphetamine tolerance is too high and you've got shit to do. If I redose more than one time, I'll feel especially shitty during the comedown.<br><br>
I'd describe the comedown as feeling like an empty, used shell. A slight sinking in the heart, tiredness, hot hands, maybe flushed face as well. Phenibut or a benzo helps smooth out the comedown a bit, but I still have to be prepared for it. If I've got PV, then this is the way I use it effectively. Still haven't even gone through half of the 250 mg bag yet. If you're thinking of acquiring it, I say don't bother. Find some good clean meth, since I've heard it's alot smoother and clean feeling than PV. Or just find some prescription dextroamphetamine. <br><br>
Here is a quick guide I put together to help people with a binge comedown. I have heard this is a good guide for meth binges as well, though I would not know first hand. Here goes:<br><br>
I would advise not redosing at all. I find the best way to experience this drug without a major crash or comedown is to just do one or two small lines or finger dabs (15 mg MAX) and put it away. I enjoy the effects for 4-6 hours and I feel a little tired but I'm fine after that. <br><br>
However, I will not deny that there is significant pleasure and fun in redosing every 30-45 minutes for a few hours. Drink plenty of water during this time! I cannot stress this enough. I would advise stopping after the third hour. Let that last hit ride and as soon as you start feeling that sputtering comedown, follow these steps:<br><br>
1. Eat if you can. Preferably something healthy with vegetables that's not greasy or something with whole grains. If you can't eat, just make a quick protein shake with milk instead of water. Then go to step 2. If you can't do either of those, skip to step 2.<br><br>
2. I take the following supplements:<br>
-1000 mg L-Tyrosine (to replenish dopamine)<br>
-1200 mg omega 3-6-9 (for my poor thumping heart)<br>
-200 mg 5-htp (to help mood and sleep quality)<br>
-Complex B vitamins (to help energy production)<br>
-A multivitamin (to give me what my body has been using up in its overdriven state)<br>
-Magnesium<br><br>
3. After a short binge (compared to some 48-hour binges that seem pretty standard) of 3 hours, I wanted not just a sleep aid but an antipsychotic, and I've never taken one before. But the idea of having the dopamine in my brain shut the fuck down sounded really nice. I've read somewhere that seroquel is helpful here. Not having that available, I took .5 mg of etizolam but next time I'd do 1 mg or more depending how stimulated I am still.  Sleep is the most important part of the recovery process. I also took 37.5 mg of tianeptine (aka 3x Stablon tablets) to help with some of the oncoming depression. <br><br>
4. I continue drinking lots of water. If I wake up or can't sleep, I drink water. Lay down even if I know I'm not going to sleep, just let my body rest even if my mind is still going. Alot of it is in my mind. Those nightmare visions I'm having? See if I can turn the woman eating a man's eyeballs or the zombie hordes dancing in fields into little kids pushing shopping carts. Don't know why, but MDPV can cause some weird shit to happen in my head when I come down. It was really violent and negative for me. But it only really lasted for an hour, maybe an hour and a half.<br><br>
I hope these thoughts help people thinking of trying or people using MDPV. It's a drug that can be fun and can be helpful but it's also a drug that's really easy to overdo. Please be careful with it and take care of yourselves if you decide to experiment with it. It seems to be much more powerful than amphetamines and is definitely more powerful than cocaine. <br><br>
My personal opinion on this drug is that it's not worth the time or the comedown to do with any kind of regularity. The comedown really is hell if I don't prepare properly and even with all the supplements it's still rough. <br><br>
Take care of yourselves, be safe, spread love.<!-- End Body -->
