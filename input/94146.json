 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy BF and I took our first dose of 2cp at about noon. I snorted 5mg. And lemme tell ya, it was a STUPID idea because it burns like a motherf*cker!!! For about 30 minutes I was pacing and stomping around the room waiting for the pain to go away. (The only other thing I've ever snorted is MDPV, and this was 50 times worse than that.) The drip was horrible. It burned my throat and nothing made it better. About 5 minutes after I took it my BF said my pupils looked like saucers. His did too.\r\nAbout 15 minutes after snorting it I could feel the effects starting. Sort of like blinds closing and opening slightly on the side of my vision. Then everything started to look more colorful. Everything had a colorful halo-haze to it. If I wasn't in so much pain from snorting it, then it would have been enjoyable. Then almost as suddenly as the pain started, it stopped. But my head felt slightly pained. Like, that lingering pain you get after a migraine. \r\nAbout an hour after taking the stuff we put the movie moulin rouge in and zoned out to that. OH MY SHIRONA that movie is AMAZING on this stuff! Everything is so colorful and vivid. After about 2 hours from first snorting it I noticed everything started to look like there was an emboss filter covering it. It was a little weird. And shadows and colors started to move in a rolling/wave-like manner. It was really interesting to just look at a blank wall and see these things.  \r\nI had no desire to do anything except lay there and watch TV. Sex for me was impossible because I felt like a pile of mush. It wasnt a bad feeling. I just didn't feel like doing anything.\r\nI had only been on the stuff for 3 or 4 hours, and yet it felt like I'd been on it for 3 times longer. Time goes veeeerrrryy slow while on it. About 5 1/2 hours after I first snorted it I noticed I started to have my normal feelings and worries coming back. So the fun was pretty much over. I had no urge to redose at all. Though I still felt like mush. It was a bit of a struggle to do anything. I did managed to drive a short distance so we could get food after about 7 hours. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  I was perfectly fine behind the wheel. I would never recommend driving immediatly after taking a dose though! That would be very unwise.\r\nIt took about 11 hours from first snorting it to feel completely normal and clear-headed again. Throughout the day my feet and hands felt very cold, and by now they felt normal too. I had no problem going to sleep after the effects disappeared. I felt totally normal the next morning. Like nothing had happened. No hangover-like feeling or anything.\n\n\n"
