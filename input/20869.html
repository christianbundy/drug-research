It was a pretty normal night in my apartment.  I was having trouble sleeping, so I took one 10 mg ambien pill and 2 somas but for some reason I could not get any sleep so I started drinking some beers.  After a couple hours of buzzing I decided that sleep was impossible that night and I should just give up and take a trip.  In my inebriated state I pulled out a vial of 5-MeO-AMT, a substance I have never tried and poured out about the same amount that I would ingest of 5-MeO-DiPT, about 12-15mg.  <br><br>
Unfortunately I didn't know that 5-MeO-AMT is considerably more potent than 5-MeO-DiPT and I certainly paid for my own stupidity.  After a couple hours of coming up I finally passed out.  I woke up at about 7 am finally realizing that I had made a huge mistake.  I had ingested about 3 times the amount recommended in TIHKAL and I was suddenly tripping harder than I ever have in my life.  The only hallucinogens I have ever taken are mushrooms and 5-MeO-DiPT so I was very freaked out by the effects of this substance.  The whole room was swirling and dissolving before my eyes and everything I saw seemed to shift and breathe.  There was no way I was getting back to sleep so I just lay in bed and stared at the ceiling for hours trying to keep the trip under control.  I was still having massive visuals until about 2pm, and minor visuals until 10pm that night, about the same time I took the substance the previous night.  Everyone I looked at seemed to morph and distort so I just stayed in my room all day.  I had an irrational fear that I would get HPPD and never stop tripping but finally the effects started to wear off and that night a big slug of nyquil knocked me out.  <br><br>
I definitely learned a lot from this experience.  Never take a new chemical when you are drunk or high on something, and never underestimate the power of 5-MeO-AMT.  It could be the LSD of the next generation but must be used with extreme caution.  Just because something is temporarily legal does not mean that it is safe or healthy.  I probably will take this again in the future but I will definitely take it sober and ready for 24 hours of solid insanity.<!-- End Body -->
