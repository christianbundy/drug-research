Let me start with some background.  I'm 19 now... at the time i was 18.  My girlfriend and I had just left Reggae on the River in Humboldt County California by rafting down the river.  We had taken acid previously but its effects were minimal.  After reaching Garberville a few days later we were hitchhiking out when we were picked up by a rabbi.  We got into the back of his truck (the bed) because another hitchhiker was up front.  Down the road we noticed a man looking very frantic and waving his arms on the side of the road.  The rabbi pulls over to pick him up.  He runs up to the back of the truck where the other hitch hiker is letting him in, saying his friend has just been shot in the face because he was doing a drug deal.  He gets in the back and is rambling to my girlfreind and I.  He was 26 and used to own a glass company, which was recently shut down due to operation pipe dreams.  Also, he was saying he has a huge house, wife, a kid, a crop of medical marijauan, LSD, DMT and says we can come and stay there.<br><br>
At this point the rabbi is saying we have to take him to a police station and i thought the that would be the end of our little fantasy world that just fell into our lap.  Luckily for us we see a police officer parked on the side of the road.  The rabbi stops and the man gets out to talk to the cop.  Other officers were already on scene, he took J's (we will call him j) statement and surprisingly let him go.<br><br>
The rabbi continues and with this new passnger takes my girlfreind, the other hitch hiker, J, and i miles out of his way to j's house.<br><br>
We get out to find j's young wife at home by herself, their child was with their parents down state.  She welcomed us and j told his story again.  That night we smoked excellent weed and went to bed.  The next day the hitchhiker took off, leaving my girlfreind and i at j's house.<br><br>
Later in the afternoon we start our acid trip.  2 hits.  an hour later 2 more.  A couple after that two more.  I was walking around the house and property looking at the plants and feeling excellent about life, but not too many visuals.  We stayed to help clean up the drug filled house in case the police payed a visit which they didn't because they invited j down to the station the next day after this.  After tripping for a few hours, maybe less, j offers the DMT; 'The deemers' he says.  and i begin asking a little bit about it.  the conversation appears in my memory as mostly... on DMT? on DMT? on DMT?  He tells me i have a galactic connection with the band sound tribe sector 9, which he puts in for the trip and says this experiance was given to me by my higher self.  I am the first to go.  I am sitting on the couch with my legs pulled up to my chest.  <br><br>
It was an orangeish crystal sitting on top of some dank buds. j lights the lighter, brings it near the crytal but doesnt touch it to it, it melts, I take the hit, which is in a pipe the used only for DMT occasions.  At this point I can only say I instantly found myslef in nothing.  Again rather instantly i found that the nothing filled up very quickly with everything.  All my emotions and feelings were looping over themselves.  I would look around see fractals and events unfolding in the room occuring on what seemed to be nanoseconds, I could see everyone for who they were and felt a communication occuring that was happening only in my mind.  Its common to (at this point what was being said cannot be englished) on DMT... on DMT.  I would look at everyone, going from person to person hearing their unique lingiustic signature and trying to translate it, feeling confused.  As I would look away form the people i would understand what they were saying to me and feel very intense joy and would be laughing very hard, going through long periods of deja vu and feeling time dilate into what seemed eternity.  I would look back at the people and hear the communication again and time would flow a little more and I would look away and time would be still again and i would be laughing and feeling the 'deja vu'.  This repeated for a long while, while i was just sitting on the couch, laughing and not moving.  <br><br>
Looking back, now I am anxious to take DMT again.  It has profound implications and meanings in my personal journey which are much much deeper than this story leads one to believe.  The synchronicity in my life both before and after the dmt trip were simply amazing.  All based around consciousness.  2012, galactic awareness...  I hope this story affects someone.<!-- End Body -->
