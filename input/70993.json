 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt does help sometimes with my insomnia, but the most interesting thing is that sometimes when using valerian root extract I get a huge erection, and I am certain after many tests that it is because of the valerian.  We might have in our hands the next viagra, or maybe I'm just weird.  I'm only 24 so I don't use it for erectile dysfunction, but it might be a good idea.\n\n\n"
