This is an account of my second experience with Salvia Divinorum. After inhaling three blasts of regular strength leaves, I started feeling like the particles in my body were rubbing against each other and causing a slightly uncomfortable friction. This has always been the background feeling of my experiences of SD. It is very similar to the feeling I have on the comedown from LSD; like the particles of my body are made of chalk, and wearing each other out. Now for the good stuff...<br><br>
The following experience was about 30% as real as 'everyday reality'. I was holding the bong in front of me, and I suddenly felt like my body was crossing over itself; turning into the shape of the letter 'X' (on LSD I usually turn into the letter 'P'). My arms twisted round each other in a double helix and spiralled off to infinity. An enormous tree appeared in front of me, the size of the galaxy. If one imagines the galaxy as being relatively flat like a flying saucer, the tree went up vertically through the centre of it. I was lying on my back, and my legs started going up up and up into the tree trunk, merging with it. My head started going down into the roots, until I was almost completely merged with the tree, except for the very top of my head. At this point the effects started wearing off.<!-- End Body -->
