These are my only slightly edited notes taken while on 4-HO-DiPT.<br><br>
11:28 am<br>
I had a sample of 4-HO-DiPT of known identity and purity. Butter-white fine crystals, 8.5 mg hydrochloride. I dissolved these in a small glass of Diet Coke and drank the mix down in one gulp. The beverage did a good job of moderating the somewhat nasty flavor of the drug. Im kinda scared - I Did It Now. Id had two previous brushes with this drug - the first time at perhaps 4.5 mg was awful - five hours of formless terror while my body felt All Wrong. The second time (10 mg) I had a cold, so perhaps the difficult nature of that experience had an excuse. This was try 3 at a dose chosen to push me past the unresolved terror state but still be manageable. In theory anyway. The striking feature of the 10mg event was its duration - in at 6pm one evening, and still quite intoxicated at 1am that morning, when a stout dose of alprazolam was used to get some rest. The day after that I was still off baseline for most of the morning!<br><br>
I cleared my mind and asked whatever God was inclined to oblige to see to my safety. Okeydoke, here goes.<br><br>
11:40 am <br>
Poss first alert? The feeling in my lower gut along with barely perceptible pink&amp;green in a white surface.<br><br>
11:52<br>
Mild somatic wave - definite alert. Doing chores. Still not +1. <br><br>
12:20pm<br>
Persistent Feeling in my lower gut. Pleasant. Hand on a cushion breathes a little. Smiling a lot. So far, so good! +1<br><br>
1:16<br>
Lying in bed. Still going in! Strong waves of ideation - somewhat disorienting. The feeling of having entered the Place frivolously, uninvited, cant be shaken. You really didnt want to be here. But youre here now for sure.<br><br>
Visual is near-normal - mild breathing of edges, maybe a bit of blue&amp;gold in surfaces. Im not completely coordinated.<br><br>
1:25<br>
Even at this modest level, the experience is flatly indescribable to those who dont know psychedelics. Hypnagogy is an inadequate surface metaphor. When I move about, the body sensation can be quite pleasant. At other times, it flirts with an alarming poisoned! quality.<br><br>
1:50<br>
Still very much in a dual state, but maximum reached and repair under way? Very ambivalent. Would like to try this one deeper, but not alone. <br>
I dont acess anything animistic (the tree outside is and remains just a tree) or mystical/cosmic, and I have an inkling that the price of enduring the necessary dose would be quite high. Even now Im yawning and shivering moderately. <br><br>
2:35 <br>
It was a false repair. Still definitely +2. Waves of sensation/ideation - Im riveted still in my bed, realizing that communicating the most basic blocks (cognitive glyphs) of the experience eludes. ... Its like a panic anxiety that has been transfigured, rendered OK, into a feeling that alternates between disconcerting and occasionally beautiful - the barest hints of inner light unfolding Out.  ... And the remarkable thing is that the Observer is intact to write this down in mundane language.<br><br>
2:40 <br>
Went into a near panic when I Couldnt Find the Toilet Paper. Reasoning ability is getting hit: spent some time staring at a box trying to decipher the writing into (slowly breathing) words, then spent some more time realizing that the words made a message that didnt match the contents of the box. I can still pull it together, but its a real effort. No sign of effects subsiding.<br><br>
2:47<br>
I found the toilet paper - behind the (temporarily displaced!) toddler bed. Felt more profound relief than I really ought to have. I solemnly carried six rolls (two stacks of three) to their berth in the bathroom cabinet. <br>
Checked Shulgins Plus Scale - this is still a +2, even though at times the rational mind/Observer is overwhelmed. My ego is just barely intact and continuous.<br><br>
2:54 <br>
So far Ive managed to decline a Valium. My mind understands that the anxiety (if it is even that!) is chemical and thus transitory, inconsequential. Bbbbut Im still far off baseline. I am well and truly Dipped. <br><br>
3:25<br>
Ive had a shower (washed the fight-or-flight funk from my armpits) and did some dishes. I am gently but unyieldingly pressured to realize that tryptamines arent for me. The Other is a damned good host - considering I barged in uninvited. But I must acknowledge that, having come to them so late in life, I have been guilty of romanticizing the psychedelics. They are not toys. They are not pleasure rides nor well-suited as discretionary intoxicants. I hope I have the courage and emotional memory-integrity to not come back without an invite or other extenuation.<br>
I will trust myself to sweep up out front now. Im starting to get hungry.<br><br>
3:40<br>
Internal dialog. Sensation of wisdom/great sadness. So this is what it means to grow up. Hope I can remember. Perhaps that is the internal tragedy of this whole class of compounds. A sense that knowledge is dispensed only for that interval when it cannot be used, i.e. denied when Im sober again. I cannot remember the Basic Truth of this state when not in this state. And I am powerfully advised not to visit casually.<br><br>
And yet there is tremendous peace in knowing that the underlying fabric of the cosmos abides, whether I Know or not, despite history and tyrannies and angry priests and entire generations sleepwalking. Even they fit with their own beauty into the whole. Gardan borders still breathing a little.<br><br>
3:47<br>
A migraine keeps nagging at my right temporal area. Drug body load seems diminished. Rational Observer seems better.<br><br>
4:20<br>
I walked to McDs. My Observer took a big pie in the face when confronted with the reality of talking to a stranger. I used all my internal resurces keeping it together and maintaining an inconspicuous energy signature. I got through about half the meal at a table before packing up and going home seemed like a Really Good Idea. I ran into (neighbor) on the way back and really worked at normal conversation. Im repairing, but with remarkable leisure. I wonder if duration and level of involvement isnt more typical of the normative 4-HO-DMT experience. This is no miniature of psilocin, not in me anyway!<br><br>
4:25<br>
The process of receiving a sensory stimulus - checking the internal catalog - deciding its not a problem - relaxing - starting the startle-chech-relax cycle over abd over again is very tiring. Whats it been - five hours paying full fare?<br><br>
5:20<br>
Killed some time surfing the web. Still solidly +1. Body load (a pushing feeling in boweld and backs of thighs) is frankly annoying. The pleasure/learning part of this is over and Im just paying the bills now. I still wouldnt be comfy answering the phone.<br><br>
5:45<br>
Small residues of objects breathing, apparent 10 minutes ago, are now gone. Repair under way at last. <br><br>
5:50<br>
Or not? I set up the stereo, but I cant seem to properly listen to the music. Still +1. Extraneous sounds are still not getting automatically processed and dismissed.<br><br>
6:07 <br>
A wave of physical pleasure-feeling. So its not ALL bad. But my overall conclusion is becoming: On balance this is a difficult, demanding experience.<br><br>
6:45<br>
Consistently near but not at baseline now. Im somewhat euphoric; I got through unharmed and with a story. Now to just try to remember that even this gentlest by reputation of the serious psychedelics. Is. Not. A. Toy.  Youve been advised.<br><br>
8:00<br>
Still not out of it. Waves of dislocation disabuse me from saying its over. I want baseline back.  Im very selective what Im watching on TV. I have no tolerance for harsh vibes. Watching spiders mate was horrifying. <br><br>
9:20<br>
Very chilled - put a jacket on. Calling all clear; nearly ten hours. Short-acting, yuh right. <snort> DOB would probably kill me outright. <br><br>
11:30<br>
Twelve-hour mark.  Still tailing. Trying to sleep is difficult, even after 30 mg temazepam. Am taking 5 mg Valium to simply disengage.<!-- End Body -->
