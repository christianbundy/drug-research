 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had 5 medium sized bowl packed hits layed out ready to go. I started with the first and the feeling hit me almost instantly. I remember standing up to blow the smoke out of my window and feeling a bit woosy and light-headed, not uncommon while holding your breath and standing up, so I loaded up another bowl. The second bowl brought me further into the experience. I couldn't even stand up to blow the smoke out the window. It's what's called 'salvia gravity' or so I've read. My body felt like it was being pulled in all directions, but the only comfortable one that I could go was straight down onto my bed.\r\nI then proceeded to load a third bowl and I put on 'Thirteenth Step' by A Perfect Circle. Wow. I remember feeling as though I were drawn into my MP3 player and infused inside the music. Find the song 'Halo' and 'Vanishing' if you can and imagine being thrust inside the music itself. I then took the headphones off not wanting to experience just a good musical trip. I took the third bowl and held it in for a good 40 seconds or so. My entire body began to buzz and vibrate and felt as though my limbs were drifting away from me. Then, I watched as the books on my bookshelf started to breathe and the words on their spines vibrate and move in small circular motions. \r\nThen that's when the Dali-esque visions started to occur. The bookshelf and wall started to melt like wax or paint if you will. I have wood paneling in my room and the grain of the sections started to ripple like water. Have you ever seen the movie 'The Cell' with J. Lo? Well, there's a part where a cow is dissected by glass then stretched apart revealing its sections. That's what the paneling did in my room. The sections all spread apart and dissected the room into about 40 'pieces' with nothing but black space in between. THAT was trippy. I didn't see god or 'Sally' or what have you, but I did feel a presence that I can't quite explain. The shadows of my poem would be the best description I could give of it.\r\nThis all lasted about 20 minutes or so. Then there was a time, ~45 minutes or so, that I felt like I was still between reality and whatever place I had come from, but I was aware that I was in my room and all was ok. That's when I decided to write the experience down in an attempt to make sure I remembered it. Here it is:\r\nSalvia Divine\r\nMy hands dance upon the ceiling,\r\nas I lie in my bed, \r\nslowly swirling puddles,\r\ncascading in my head.\r\nIve become two dimensional,\r\nfloating water,\r\ndripping wet,\r\nthis feeling - non conventional.\r\nI float among angels,\r\nI listen as they sing,\r\nwhat horrible thoughts,\r\ndo these tones bring.\r\nI witness my body,\r\nas I float above,\r\nI feel my limbs,\r\nbeginning to buzz.\r\nthe books they laugh -\r\na concerning defeat,\r\nmy legs fall to the sky,\r\nchasing my feet.\r\nI feel this metal,\r\nwithin my soul,\r\nI watch intently,\r\nas my body, again - becomes whole.\r\nI swallow the air,\r\nit comforts me so,\r\nas my throat clenches,\r\nnever to let go.\r\nmy heart races -\r\nfeel this thump,\r\ngoddamn my feet,\r\nresemble a stump.\r\nmy arms branch forth,\r\ncollecting a cool wind,\r\nmy fingertips blistered by the sun,\r\nonce again.\r\nIm pinned to the floor,\r\ncircles - stars - blue,\r\noh, goddamn,\r\nI shouldnt have tried to move.\r\nI dance amongst the shadows,\r\nthey caress my skin,\r\n'come...' they whisper,\r\n'come on in...'\r\nI find the path,\r\nI tremble - I fear,\r\nI hope that I dont,\r\nleave myself here.\r\nI drift from reality,\r\nthis current of color,\r\nmy body in stasis, \r\nabove it I hover.\r\nI descend rapidly,\r\nI writhe and spin,\r\nmy mind and body,\r\nwhole - one, again.\r\nI settle down,\r\na blank stare on my face,\r\nI did not move,\r\nyet I left this place.\r\nI blink my eyes,\r\nI glance at the time,\r\ndamn what a trip,\r\nSalvia Divine!\r\nI smoked all 5 bowls within a 35 minute period, but had very minimal effects after the third. It just made the lights and shadows a bit softer around the edges.\n\n\n"
