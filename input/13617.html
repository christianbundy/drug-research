Why the fuck did I even do this drug again? I popped 3 60mg pills of Actifed around 9PM. I figured I wouldnt be going out, so it was ok. I usually like to experiment with drugs when Im alone. It gives me the chance to find out what drugs do, while I dont act like an idiot in front of other people.<br><br>
For the next hour, I would feel a constant increase in drowsiness coming on. After that, it only took 30 min To knock me out. I saw a friend online, and I wanted to hang out; unfortunately, it wasnt going to happen. If I hung out, Id smoke weed. This would make me feel 10x worse. Instead, I laid down on the futon and tried to relax. I wouldnt get up from that point on.<br><br>
I noticed myself getting dizzy, and that did it. I was gone, and it was only 10:30.<br><br>
I woke up at 530AM to a head that felt like it was cooked on the inside, so I went outside to smoke a cig. I could feel the hangover. It does feel bad. It feels like Im at the verge of a headache, but not there yet.<br><br>
Standing there, I couldnt really pay attention to everything around me. Id either have to pay attention to the sound of the wind blowing, or getting some eye visuals. Cigarette smoking took a back seat to this. Simple things would amaze me as well. A plane flew over, and I found myself staring at it until it disappeared into the clouds.<br><br>
The hangover the following day isnt pleasant. Ive had much better drugs. Acid doesnt even have this bad of a hangover. Fuck it.<!-- End Body -->
