Last night, or I suppose this morning, I had my first psychedelic trip. Im an 18-year-old male whose previous drug experience was pretty meager: marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, DXM and hydrocodone. Psychedelics had always been the ones that interested me though. Until recently, I had never had the slightest idea where to buy them. When the opportunity presented itself in the form of 2C-C-NBOMe, I leaped upon it. While I had set out for one of the classic psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms for my first trip, Im glad I took the chance to experiment with this research chemical when I did.<br><br>
At around 11 PM, my friend A and his friend H arrived at my house to meet my boyfriend, J, and me. A brought some marijuana which we smoked in my basement. H had never gotten high before and it was a lot of fun to watch her experience that night. We had just been smoking, talking, laughing and listening to The Avalanches, when A pulled out his wallet to show us a tiny tab over paper with ink on it that apparently was Marge Simpsons eyeball. He announced that it was 2C-C-NBOMe. Having unsuccessfully sought out psychedelic drugs for several months, I immediately offered to buy it from him, saying I would take it right away. A sold me the tab and I placed it between my gums, where I left it for about 15 minutes before swallowing. Very quickly, numbness spread through my mouth and I got a burst of energy. Unfortunately, A and H had to head home around 12:30 leaving me alone with J. I was definitely coming up when they left, about 20 minutes after taking the tab.<br><br>
The very early effects were uncomfortable. My heart was beating at an alarming rate and I would get sudden bursts of energy in different parts of my body. All the weed I had smoked probably wasnt helping. I felt confused and afraid. When I looked at Js face as we lay on the couch, it assumed a bizarre and frightening look, but this quickly passed. After this, the drugs effects hit me very quickly. I understood why the psychedelic experience is so often called a trip: I found myself drifting off, feeling as though I were walking around and exploring other worlds, only to find that I still hadnt left the couch. I walked upstairs to use the bathroom and ended up staring at myself in the mirror for a while as my faces reflection bent and warped. I felt as though the part of my brain that recognized faces was malfunctioning; I didnt have the normal associations one has upon seeing a face, much less that this was my own face. Giggling, I walked out of the bathroom, and here I got very confused.<br><br>
I have the strange feeling that I walked in and out of the bathroom many times in a row. Sometimes J was standing outside of it in the hall, sometimes he wasnt. I have no idea how long this went on or if it even happened. When I returned to the basement, things got even weirder. I sat at my computer and looked at dumb YouTube videos for a while, taking them completely seriously and not understanding how silly they were. Every once in a while I would look back at the couch. Sometimes J was there, sometimes he wasnt. He suggested I play Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I opened the game and decided it was a terrible idea. I just wanted to do fun, positive things. At one point, J announced that he would go upstairs to make a sandwich.<br><br>
It felt like he was gone for an eternity. Time ceased to mean anything at all at this point; I looked at a clock and saw an array of hands all pointing at different hours. I believe it was around 3 by this time. I started listening to some Dan Deacon and the music euphoria was incredible. Every note became intensely meaningful and it nearly brought me to tears. Later I listened to Godspeed You! Black Emperors album 'Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven' which was probably the greatest musical experience of my life. The iTunes visualizer was spectacular. I felt sorry for J who was tired and mildly stoned and just wanted to sleep as I blasted music at top volume from my computer. He was too tired to interact with me very much but I felt very playful and I laughed and hugged and cuddled him. My vision at this point was very wavy and everything had a geometric rainbow corona around it. While the visuals were fun and interesting, on the whole the trip was much more categorized by my headspace than by visuals. Trippy things were not very interesting and I mostly wanted to look at everyday things like the floor. However, I do remember watching the video The Minds Eye 08 - Leaving the Bonds of Earth, a collation of 80s CGI shots of space and flying strung together with pretty music.<br><br>
Something that I had worried about was the body load. I had heard complaints about physical discomfort after taking 2C-I-NBOMe and I hoped I wouldnt run into any problems and spoil my euphoria. Fortunately, all the negative feelings from early on left pretty quickly; they may have had more to do with the cannabis than with the 2C-C-NBOMe anyway.<br><br>
The peak of the experience was the greatest moment of my life. I felt as though countless things were happening in the universe with every passing moment and by taking a psychedelic drug I had enabled myself to experience all the things I had overlooked. I no longer cared about anything at all. The thought struck me that whatever the universe/life/God wanted me to do, I would do it. I was at one with the universe/life/God. I dont know the words to describe this feeling. After puzzling for some time over how to describe the experience, I gave up and embraced it wholly. Words can only do so much. It felt as though I were in paradise, completely free from pain, from fear, and from negative thoughts. I was not feeling particularly introspective. CEVs were pretty much nonexistent and I mostly wanted to listen to music and dance. I have heard 2C-C described as an entactogen which is pretty consistent with my experience.<br><br>
When I started coming down I started to feel sorry for J who obviously just wanted to get some sleep and had tired of my laughter and excessive affection. I told him I was leaving, and in his groggy state he didnt question the wisdom of my actions. I walked out of my house and headed towards a small nearby forest. I was still tripping a bit at this point and along the walk there along a local boulevard I felt wonderful. I skipped and ran much of the way, feeling incredibly good about myself. None of my problems mattered. It was around 4 or 4:30 in the morning at this point and the streets were deserted. I was a little bit scared to enter the woods in near total darkness, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. The silhouettes of leaves and branches resembled birds as I ran by them. It felt as though I was in the woods for the first time, although I had been there hundreds of times before. The woods led me to a somewhat large river. I sat down on the rocks next to it and decided to watch the sun rise. This proved to be a highlight of the experience.<br><br>
Although the drug had worn off almost entirely by this point, I was left with a lovely afterglow, and phrases like Wow! constantly flashed through my head as I tried to understand what I had felt during my trip. The river was absolutely beautiful: as the sky prepared for sunrise, all the colors reflected upon the slow, serene river and I noticed they formed a rainbow, which felt simply perfect for the occasion. I heard the first bird songs begin and a pair of geese swam up very close to me, apparently not noticing my presence. A loon called. A few artificial lights blinked far away. I looked at the stones in the river. A few of them together almost spelled out acid in lower case letters, and with great joy I realized that what I had taken as my first psychedelic was not even one of the stronger ones. I had yet to try LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT...the possibilities were endless.<br><br>
The sun itself appeared and rose very quickly, and I decided to head back home at that point. By now, the drug had worn off completely and I felt tired and hungry. I walked home, ate some cereal and took a short nap. J fell asleep shortly after I left and he continued to sleep until nearly 2 PM. I tried to read and while I felt I understood characters emotions and motives very well I found it very hard to focus on my book.<br><br>
This experience was the best introduction to the psychedelic experience I could have hoped for. After less than stellar experiences with other drugs (except weed, which after tripping seems like a silly toy), I had worried that there was something wrong with my body and that I wouldnt be able to have the same experiences with entheogens that I had read about. I nearly cried with joy when I realized how wrong I was. This experience was both a grand declaration of the beauty of the world and an invitation to pursue advanced studies of that beauty in the future. It wasnt too much of a headfuck—at least after the weed wore off—and I feel I experienced a little bit of everything this wonderful class of chemicals had to offer.<!-- End Body -->
