 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a poem about mushrooms written by me while coming down from an intense trip. \r\nDream Psilocybian \r\n===================\r\nWhat man can fathom the dreamy angles psilocybian \r\nThat arise from the earth in sickly-sweet parade\r\nTo make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded? \r\nElectric is the parade of cascading absurdity \r\nThat claws at the soul with talons of flame\r\nAnd turns things once cherished and familiar \r\nInto gargantuan monoliths of alienation and paranoia \r\nFor beyond the wall of dreams lie dismal fields eternal, and a sun that never rises\r\nThrough the silent desperation of twilight skies \r\nFrost bitten by undying winds and darkness eternal\r\nAnd shrouded with the depraved laughter of a million madmen\r\nLurks the dream psilocybian\r\nTo make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded\n\n\n"
