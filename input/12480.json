 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a poem about mushrooms written by me while coming down from an intense trip. <br>Dream Psilocybian <br>===================<br>What man can fathom the dreamy angles psilocybian <br>That arise from the earth in sickly-sweet parade<br>To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded? <br>Electric is the parade of cascading absurdity <br>That claws at the soul with talons of flame<br>And turns things once cherished and familiar <br>Into gargantuan monoliths of alienation and paranoia <br>For beyond the wall of dreams lie dismal fields eternal, and a sun that never rises<br>Through the silent desperation of twilight skies <br>Frost bitten by undying winds and darkness eternal<br>And shrouded with the depraved laughter of a million madmen<br>Lurks the dream psilocybian<br>To make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded\n\n\n"
