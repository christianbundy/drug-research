 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nStudying engineering. Particularly interested in psychedelic substances especially tryptamines, which I really like for their profound new vision they give. It has always been a benefit for me to take psychedelics, it really had open my doors of perception and helped me to discover my true self. I think if taking them in the right way psychedelics can be extremely good but if not they can cause hell that's why it causes so much polemics. Substance should not be blamed for misuse but the user in case of problems. I am experienced with mushrooms, 4-aco-DMT, 4-aco-Dipt, 2c-I and never had any kind 'bad trip'.\r\nLately I was looking for a tryptamine which could be interesting to take with my girlfriend. So I was looking for something relatevely soft on the body load and a tactile substance. From what I have heard the 5-meo-Mipt was a good substance for this kind of use, I have read that it gives sexual enhancement and the sense of touch was enhanced. So I ordered a 100mg sample to try this compound.\r\nMy girlfriend was not experienced with psychedelics, but she was with coke, mephedrone any other stimulants. I wanted to show her that psychedelics are way more interesting for the mind that this drugs. For her first time we took 8mg each in a glass of water. The taste is indescriptible, it feels weird, indeed very chemical. We put on a mix of Osunlade a very nice deep house artist, which made the ambience very relaxed, we have lighted some candles to soften the luminosity, we had prepared oils for massage and incense. The setting was perfect, it was for me a totally new experience to take tryptamines with a girl, and for her too because it was her first time with psychedelics. We took this at 11pm the substance took 10 minutes to be felt, the first effects were threshold. We were feeling very relaxed all our muscles were relaxed, walking was felt differently from usual it felt like walking didn't need any effort and was completely an unconscious action.\r\nIt began to really affect us at around midnight, I hate the sensation of come up with tryptamines but it was ok for me because I am used to it but my girlfriend was cold and uncomfortable, we were having a discussion and we felt at the same time difficulty to express ourself so we lied down stop talking and accepting the come up while listening to Osunlade. She was experiencing the ego loss as described by Leary. She was cold, uncomfortable, felt her nothingness faced to the infinity of the world and began to act like a little girl. That was very cute because she usually has a strong character. I had finally found the chemical to calm her, and making her a bit more docile. We were thinking how sex would be like, in fact our sense of touch was incredibily increased feeling the a physical contact with her was very sensual more thand usual, I was feeling all my energies flowing in my body, then hers and it was like melting our energy in a so beautiful way, me and my girlfriend have personalities completely opposite but I felt how we were attracted to each other the harmony of the nature, the yin yang took all his sense at that moment. I really recommend this substance for psychedelic sexual experiences, it is perfect! At 8mg 5 meo mipt was not visual, the colours were a bit sharpened and a sort of grey veil was constantly in my vision, it gave warm colours to things aound me, I experienced slight CEVs while doing sex but nothing spectacular. I think this compound is good for feeling the energies of the body and everything around you. After having sex her come up has gone and she was feeling very well, relaxed and enjoyed the rest of the experience. I really felt conscious during the experience, I was coordinated and was capable to think correctly even if my thinking patterns were slightly changed. The substance is felt in waves, sometimes I was really affected and sometimes I could barely feel to be tripping. We smoked 2 bowls during the experience it gave a hit to the effects and the taste of weed was really enjoyable I was capable to determine exactly every suble nuances in the smoke. We really shared something special this night, we discovered each other more profoundly, my relationship has improved since.\r\nThe come down was really nice it was coming back on earth floating on a cloud. But sleep was impossible, we felt asleep at around 6 am. Unfortunately I had class the next day at 8 so I nearly didn't sleep. The next day was ok, I was a bit tired but felt very little side effects of the drug, I even could perfectly concentrate in class even if I was a bit disorientade and was feeling a stomach ache.\r\nBad side of the substance: sometimes it feels dark, and it gave me during an hour a stomach ache.\r\nGood side: Very easy on the body, no anxiety at all, sexual and music enhancement.\n\n\n"
