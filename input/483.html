Well, the experiment was an absolute success.  The LSA alkaloids did do as advertised.  However, I still find it to be a better idea to go and purchase LSD-25.  The fact of the matter is that the materials are about twice as expensive as the LSD-25 ($9.00), a tenth as potent, nausea isn't a problem with LSD-25, and it (LSD-25) doesn't require preperation.  But, the LSA alkaloids do produce LSD like effects with some intresting additions to that; i.e., tiredness, lethargy, nausea, slightly increased physical stimululation in comparison to LSD-25 (can be attributed to other alkaloids present in seed material), visual stimulation(hallucinations) to a lesser degree than LSD-25, 'afterglow' is quite pronounced (greater day after effects<negative> than LSD-25).<br><br>
LSA EXPERIMENT: <br>
13.5g Morning Glory 'Heavenly Blue' <w. altee burpee co.> Seed Material<br><br>
12:30 PM EST:  Seed material washed three times using dove liquid detergent and fine screened metal strainer.<br><br>
12:45 PM EST:  Seed material ground to a fine powder via coffee grinder<br><br>
12:55 PM EST:  Seed material mixed with approx. 10oz. of carbon filtered cold H2O.<br><br>
01:55 AM EST:  Seed material strained into 12oz. glass using fine screened metal strainer.  Resulting in thick seed pulp-like material in strainer and a heterogeneous mixture of seed and water inside the glass.<br><br>
02:05 AM EST:  Liquid material refridgerated (approx. 30 degrees F.).<br><br>
02:15 AM EST:  Half of the liquid material consumed <nausea test>.<br><br>
02:20 AM EST:  Approx. 1 gram of marijuana smoked to ease the nausea. <br><br>
02:25 AM EST:  Remainder of liquid material consumed.<br><br>
02:28 AM EST:  Vomited<br><br>
02:31 AM EST:  Very slight LSD-25 like onset symptoms. <br><br>
02:45 AM EST:  Pulp-like seed material consumed on toasted pumpernickle with butter.<br><br>
02:51 AM EST:  Intensity of LSD-25 like onset symptoms increased.<br><br>
03:45 AM EST:  Approx. time of LSA trip peak.<br><br>
04:46 AM EST:  Mild trip(equivalent: 1 good paper dose of LSD-25), very physical trip(numbness &amp; tingling of limbs and body), Head is suprisingly 'clear'(thought and articulation of sentances), visuals, audio is only lightly affected, slight nausea is present.<!-- End Body -->
