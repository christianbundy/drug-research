T-0.30: Two bowls of Marijuana<br>
T+0.00: 60 mg 10x Salvia<br>
T+0.00.30: 1 Whippet<br><br>
Im an 18 year old incoming college freshman. Over the past year I started doing drugs and have tried a pretty decent number of psychedelics since then. I have experience with Shrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MPT, DPT, DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-C, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, DOC, Ketamine, Nitrous, and Salvia. Im in as good health as you can be without exercising regularly. Im 6 and slender, weighing in at 135 lbs. I can easily walk ten miles, run one, or bike twenty, however I only frequently walk long distances. I smoke weed a few times a week and tripped three times in the week prior to this experience on 2C-T-2, 5-MeO-MiPT, and 2C-C. I last did Nitrous a few days before. Typically when I do Nitrous I do somewhere from 1-3 whippets.<br><br>
A few nights ago, after a fantastic Flaming Lips concert, I planned on doing Salvia concurrently with Nitrous while high. I hadnt smoked or done anything else at the concert. The reason for this experiment was to see if I could find a more enjoyable way of doing Salvia. By itself I just feel stupid and confused, see fractal based visuals, and feel an uncomfortable prickly body high. Id tried Salvia three times before, once at 30 mg, another at 50 mg, and a last at 100 mg. Nitrous when combined with weed propels me into an empty space where I am incredibly grateful of all the good things in my life. I have done Nitrous at least 20 times. I figured the weed and the Nitrous would be enough to overpower the annoying body high but not too much as to take away from the visual and mental oddities.<br><br>
I had just split 2 deep bowls with 4 other people, I was pleasantly stoned and looking forward to what I was about to do. A few of my friends hit their whippets and I waited for the spot in the hammock to clear. While doing this I packed a bowl with 10x Salvia, two pinches, around 60 mg. I was using a homemade wooden chillum that burns very hot and cherries very easily.<br><br>
I got everything ready and moved to the hammock. I had Erol Alkans rework of Tame Impalas Why Wont You Make Up Your Mind queued on my iPod, a comfy hat, one balloon of nitrous, my chillum, and a desire to lose my mind. I hit the salvia: spark the lighter, put it to the herb, breathe in the harsh earthy smoke and then a small gasp of air. I checked the bowl and saw it was still lit, and took another toke without letting my first one out. In the next 20 seconds I had transitioned from the rather benign weed high to a supremely stupid salvia one. As I reached for my balloon I began to feel the uncomfortable body high that salvia produces in me. It is very prickly, like my skin is too tight or my muscles are segmented like citrus and trying to move. Each part of my body feels as if is tugging on another, whether I move or not. The weed high dulls this some and it is bearable.<br><br>
I know that in the next 10 seconds Ill be unable to hit the balloon so I exhale after about 30 seconds total and quickly inhale the entire whippet. I hear a whoosh as Im propelled into the void. For the first minute the nitrous overpowered the Salvia, I was no longer. Life was no longer. Nothing was or ever was. The concept of nothing didnt exist as there were no concepts of anything at all. The state that was (for I could not be in it) was not anything; there was no fear, no happiness, just emptiness. As I came back I began to remember the people I love and why I should be happy about the life I live.<br><br>
Then the music hit me. I love the song I was playing, it is one of my favorites. Im still feeling the pure rush of euphoria from the Nitrous and now the Salvia is regaining some control. I start hearing notes that I know dont actually exists in the song, the song is sparkling and glowing as the music forms into what I would call a music video in my head. I was seeing a quickly moving sunrise made out of different colored images of sunrises in the fashion where certain images make up a larger image. A collage of sorts I guess you would call it.<br><br>
I felt like I was being pulled through this music video. The pulling sensation was like playing a rail shooter, you can look around but never really control where your body takes you. I saw people I cared about moving in circles like a pin wheel (with tracers of their bodies) while walking upside down on a grassy surface. I know I had other visuals but I cant remember them a few days afterwards. I might have had a visual of people doing flips and leaving tracers of rainbows behind them but that might have been a dream from that night. It was very fractal oriented, due to the Salvia, and also contained many nature aspects.<br><br>
Nearly four or five minutes after first hitting the salvia I managed to get up off the hammock. Lucid enough to walk around without stumbling but still having some trouble moving, I headed over towards my friends. Sitting up and down was one hard motion and I landed on a wooden seat more heavily than expected. I zoned out for a few more minutes feeling great and stupid before telling my friends a bit about what I had experienced. After another 30 minutes I was only feeling the tale end of a weed high.<br><br>
The combination was great; it was intense, both visually and mentally. The body high from the combination was very pleasant, no prickling noted. I certainly prefer it to Salvia alone because of the abolishment of that annoying body high. Compared to solely Nitrous it was much weirder. When I get visuals from Nitrous it is always very realistic situations. The visuals themselves were realistic and not cartoony but the things I was seeing were not. A few days later I noticed that the Salvia did lead to some extra light alteration in my HPPD.<!-- End Body -->
