My doctor recently gave me a bunch of samples of this, saying it would be helpful with my anxiety disorder and insomnia, which has been unresponsive to many long term drugs, such as SSRI's, BuSpar, Serzone,etc. The only drugs that have worked are benzodiazepines, and neurontin (gabapentin) to some extent.<br><br>
The pills were 2.5, 5 and 10mg. I took one of the smallest doses (2.5mg) at 10pm. I got sedated in a spaced out way, it wasn't at all pleasent like benzodiazepines. I couldn't think clearly and had no energy, so I laid in bed watching tv. I fell asleep around 12am, which shows this is strong stuff, no matter what the earliest I go to sleep is around 3am. <br><br>
I woke up at 3pm, getting approximately 15 hours of sleep. I felt lousy, like I had a hangover, but this could be from simply oversleeping. I will never take this drug again. It is an antipsychotic and I can see this would be a good drug at treathing psychosis, but not an anxiety disorder (neurosis). It is very sedating, which could work for severe insomniacs, but for moderate anxiety and insomnia, I would not take this powerful drug.<!-- End Body -->
