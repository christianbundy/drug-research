We have chosen to include this report to help document the dose range, but its inclusion does not imply that this dose is safe.]</font> <br><br>
I have taken Pregabaline in doses around the 1000mg mark many times now, and had a very enjoyable experience. After recieving my parcel I thought it would be interesting to see what happens at even higher doses. <br><br>
It all began well. I had taken 3 packs of 750, adding up too 2250mg. My mate turned up a few minutes later to take me to a dubstep night in a nearby club. We journeyed over, and began partying. It wasnt long before I began twitching and having mini blackouts. I'd had a similar feeling, although not this intense, on smaller doses of pregabaline, so i didnt think much of it to begin with. As the night went on the twitching got worse, as did the blackouts. When I say mini blackouts they seem to last only a fraction of a second, but towards the end of the night it was like they where lasting for longer. I was still standing up ok, so tried to ignore them whilst I carried on dancing.<br><br>
It wasnt till the end of the night when things went wrong. We where just leaving the club, when all of a sudden... I was sitting on the floor with a concerned bouncer and 2 very concerned mates. 'What happened, why am i on the floor?'<br><br>
It turns out I had fallen to the ground and began fitting [seizing]. I'm not sure how long I fitted for the first time, but I found out later that I'd been fitting for about 5 minutes in total.<br><br>
I got up, everyone was concerned and talking about phoning an ambulance. 'I dont need an ambulance' I said, 'Look I can walk in a straight line' Boom. And once again I woke up to see lots of concerned faces. Now including the ambulance crew. <br><br>
I was taken off in a stretcher, fully conscious. My heart rate was taken. 150 beats per minute. Very very high, but it was going down (apparently they had taken it just after I had fitted, I didnt remember). <br><br>
The rest of the night was spent in hospital, where I slowly recovered. I was released at 7am that morning, still with a slight twitch but other than that fully recovered.<br><br>
I've learned my lesson about doing high doses of drugs, when I'm not certain about the effects. I had recovered from a serious overdose. A few mg more and I dont want to think what could have happened. What would have happened if I was alone that day? <br><br>
I was lucky.<!-- End Body -->
