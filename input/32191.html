I have tried powder form speed twice in my life. The first time left me with nothing more than a sleepless night and half the next day. The second, left me with a fear that I may never lose.<br><br>
I had just gotten out of the Army after 6 years and I wasn't too happy about it. I was devastated when I hurt my back and was unable to continue my career. So I came home after being gone for so long and everyone was gone. I only had my wife's two brothers to hang out with. I knew that they had a friend who made meth in his house, but I had no idea that they themselves used it until a late night of helping said friend move. I let them talk me into trying it and nothing happened. I had absolutely no effect from it at all. All I did was stay awake, just as if I had taken a couple of my ephedra pills. <br><br>
A couple of months late, the younger brother and I was up running around and he pulled out a bag. I was not feeling all that splendid, to put it lightly, due to a ton of stress. I let him talk me into doing it again, and this time I had everything I have read about. My entire world was clear and happy. And this was from dipping my finger in it and licking it off. I could only imagine the possibilities!<br><br>
Now, their friend had this method of using the tea filters he used to manufacter the speed to also brew tea through. He called it his 'happy juice'. I downed three tall glasses of 'Happy Juice' within a half hour. I felt on top of the world. <br><br>
Later in the day, we were driving over to the friends house when out of nowhere, my heart jumps from a normal rate to irrate. It was beating out of control and I felt this huge pressure on my chest as if there was an elephant stepping on me. I couldn't breath. I had to pull the car over and dial 911. I was positive I was having a heart attack and there was no staying calm about it. I was freaking out. When I got to the hospital, they did an EKG and put me on a heart monitor. My heart rate was 170, but they said I didn't have a heart attack. I ended up going back to the ER when I got home to a different hospital. I fell asleep and woke up quickly as I felt I had stopped breathing. They too said I did not have a heart attack. <br><br>
This was 6 months ago and I am nowhere near over this. I have been to the ER a million times and I have even had a cardiac cath done and I am only 25. I am continually told that I have no heart damage, and I absolutely do not believe it. I have chest pain 24/7 and thoughts of suicide constantly. I am on a ton of meds for depression and anxiety and they don't even let me live a comfortable life. All I do is think about dying. I have not, nor will I ever touch anything remotely associated with drugs again. It's not worth my life to feel high. I still don't know if I will survive what happened 6 months ago. Whether from heart damage or by my own hand, I am still that affected by the incident. I have no idea how much I took, but I was still pissing hot 4 days later when I went back to the ER. I hope this helps someone to either not pick up a drug or to stop. Being scared for my life and not knowing whether I was going to live or die was not fun.<!-- End Body -->
