WARNING! The use of RC's can be dangerous! Only you know your body and mind! Know your source.<br><br>
This is a little trip report, given that it was a first trial to see how my little body would react to this drug. I would describe only the effects which I experienced as most of the evening was spent lying on bed watching flims (Brice de Nice, Dikkenek, Double Zero, Enter The Void, Requiem For a Dream, How High, ect ...)<br><br>
10:53 p.m.: Ingestion of 5 mg of 2C-C in liquid solution. Damn that thing is bitter! Pwaaaah quickly drink water! (Note that the powder looks very fluffy like snow, hard to weight so I was very cautious to use low dose first).<br><br>
11:10 p.m : Redrop of 5 mg ... Still disgusting.<br><br>
11:45 p.m : First alert, my muscles seem more relaxed than used to it, I stretch them, I'm too good. Little heat in the chest as a kind of continues euphoria ... yum!<br><br>
0:20 a.m : I feel more relaxed, my muscles will drop off? Do I took a wrong molecule? I took a benzodiazepine or something? I lose concentration to the flim and I close my eyes.<br><br>
0:30 a.m : Some minor nausea as if I had eaten too much. I keep burping and farting (hihi it did not stink luckily for my friend).<br><br>
0:35 a.m : Well I need to pee, I'm so lazy to get up, I'm so relax. I go into the bathroom. The colors are definitely a bit more pronounced, more saturated. I stare at the ground. A few ripples on the floor, I see small eyes moving on the floor (recurring in my trip).<br><br>
A small black kitten is in the bathroom floor and I lie on the floor with the kitten on my chest, I was too calm (Nah seriously... I thought I had eaten 2-4 Xanax mixed with 1/4 of LSD blotter tab).<br><br>
My friend asks what am I doing and come find me! Pffff it's boring, I was being so good here!<br><br>
0:40 a.m : Back into bed, I lie down in his bed, I decide to close my eyes for 20 minutes to enjoy the relaxation. I'm ultra relaxed, I resist to not fall asleep.<br><br>
1:00 a.m : Okay well we continue to watch movies and smoking cigarettes, (while farting and belching). The bodyload is still there, it's terrible if I could be like this all the time it would be awesome, but I'm really in flange plate. I sink into his bed like an old mold. Of slight deformations on his wall in the background caught my attention, Yeah it's really not that great visuals are not really perceptible as this level. As soon as I move my head that dissipates.<br><br>
2:30 a.m : The movie 'Dikkenek' just ended, a few muscle spasms really barely noticeable are felt in the legs, no change in body temperature, no stimulation. Taking the pulse and heart beats with a small device, result: 90 BPM and the systolic pressure is at 137 mm Hg. Everything are normal. I was told that the 2C-X were somewhat stimulating ... maybe not with the 2C-C!<br><br>
3:00 a.m : I start to comedown, I feel motivated again and I discussed with my friend, We ends the packets of cigarettes. We watch our last movie for the night.<br><br>
4:45 a.m : Well we are going to sleep. Easy to sleep. Very vivid dreams and very realistic, I really feel like to live in reality! Really alive.<br><br>
7:40 a.m : We wake up, unfortunately we have to move to see a chick. Feeling a bit tired. 450mg magnesium were taken.<br><br>
Conclusion: A chemical with a very nice bodyload well if we can say that because it's not disturbing at all, but it's really ultra relaxing! The visuals were light, however, very very minimal (However, I didn't expect to see great visuals at this level). I did not speak about the mind effects simply because there were none! Just the concept of concentration that fell off occasionally.<br><br>
Positive effects:<br>
- Nice Bodyload!<br>
- Excellent mental clarity<br>
- Easy to manage if located in an environment / social environment<br>
- Very soft on the body and mind<br>
- Visual quite beautiful in itself, but were minimal at this level.<br>
- Relaxation is really good! Very good point.<br><br>
Side effects / Neutral:<br>
- Some tension in the neck and arms / legs (Subsidies fast enough)<br>
- Nausea, gas / fart / rot!<br>
- But, uh ... I do not want to sleep ! (Too sedating ?)<br><!-- - (Vasoconstriction?)<br>
--><br>
I will probably make more enough research about this chemical, upgrading the dosage with caution and see how deep this chemical can be. It can be useful for some therapy I guess.<br><br>
Again a nice compound from Dr Shulgin! Will give another try to find our sweet spot!<br><br>
Take Care, my bad for my english (I'm not from USA).<!-- End Body -->
