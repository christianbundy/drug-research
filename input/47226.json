 "report": "<p>I went to my GP today, because in the last few months, I've experienced severe panic attacks (caused by mild hppd).</p><p>So he gave me a strip with 7 Effexor for free (Denmark, free health insurance for the people:)</p><p>I got home, and swallowed a capsule (containing 75 mg). And now after no more than 2 hours, I'm experiencing some facinating changes in my vision (my hppd really freaks out) when I close my eyes, I see intense COLORED fractals, moving to the music. Im feeling a bit distorted, and warm and fuzzy, there's alot of floaters, and everything really seems to wave back and forth. The textbox Im writing this in now seems to be endless, expanding thru the screen, and onto my walls.</p><p>Ive read alot of very bad things about Effexor, and I do not doubt that it's a drug not to be taken unless the only other choice is death. So this was my first and last experience with Effexor.</p>"
