Wow is one word that perfectly describes my first experience with shrooms. Pot has been a part of my life for a few years now, and I have always been curious to see what shrooms would do to me. I had only heard good things about it and was ready to try it, but somehow never got round to it. Well it happened like this:<br><br>
One typical day, I was at a friends room, just smoking pot and relaxing with a few of my friends. Another friend came in and said he had shrooms, I imediately knew I was going to try it once and for all. I consumed maybe 1/16th of an ounce, and just sat there talking and waiting for the fungus to take effect. I didn't really feel it for like a half hour, but then it hit me. It went suddenly from relaxing to very intense in the room. <br><br>
I was immediately removed from reality and thrown into my own little, lonely world. I was rolling, I mean i was totally rolling, over and over again. I was confusing myself and sort of flipping out. I was trapped in fear in a world that i thought I could not get out of, but desperately wanted to. I remember thinking, what I would give to have things normal again. I was freaking out. I started jabbering on, and really felt that I was annoying the others in the room. I wanted to stop and just chill, but couldn't. I hudled up in a corner of a couch and just kept talking to myself, convinced that I was going through a bad trip. It was way to intense for me to even look around the room and try and see visuals.<br><br>
My friends then picked me up and said that we all should go for a walk. Suddenly, my whole trip flipped upside down and I felt great, like a million bucks.....a billion bucks. The world had never been better, and I was ready to do anything. We all went into the basement and danced like crazy. It was great. I was seeing the sorroundings perfectly, things were spinning, I was just great.<br><br>
I ended up going to bed eight hours or so after I consumed the shrooms. I was still seeing small visuals when going to sleep. It was great. I woke up, had no side effects whatsoever.<br><br>
I intend to try shrooms again, hoping that the next time I do them, I won't have as an intense beginning. I definitely recommend that you try it once. Pot still remains my drug of choice, but shrooms may jump in my life once in a while.<!-- End Body -->
