 "report": "<p>Me and a friend were sitting around one day, smoking some pot and playing on the computer. Earlier that week I had been out looking for shrooms and had found me about 50 of them, I had also powdered them after drying them. So, being our usual druggie selves we just couldn't keep our hands off of them, but 50 are so few...</p><p>We decided smoking them would have to be tried out, which turned out to be... Strange. At first, it felt like I was coming slightly up on the shrooms - but there it halted. In mid-onset. From there on out it's hard to remember things, but I didn't go any higher...</p><p>The very next monday was a surprise for me, talking to friends and relatives who told me of meetings with them I could not remember, places I've been I have no recollection of and such. Very, very strange...</p>"
