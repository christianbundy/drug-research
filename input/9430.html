One plant that had fascinated me over quite a period of time has been the centrepiece of the Bwiti Pharmacopeia, the elusive Iboga shrub famed for its ability to end addiction in some individuals and prompt an intense learning experience in others. With my yearning to expand my horizons, I purchased an Iboga extract from an online retailer in Denmark.<br>
This magical elixir came as a dark, clumpy mass that smelled almost of cedar, but did not taste anywhere near as one would imagine cedar would!<br><br>
It was 9am, Tuesday morning. I had a week off work and in retrospect, due to the afterglow, this was an extremely good idea. Here's how I dosed:<br><br>
T+0: Ingested one and a half grams of extract wrapped in a cigarette paper to mask the taste, washed down with water. I immediately occupied myself by once again picking up my old faithful friend, the Crafter Electroacoustic guitar and began strumming 'Sultans of Swing', followed by a melody of Hendrix, 'All along the watchtower'.<br><br>
At T+1:30: I noticed a very strange feeling in my body, a very intriguing 'shakiness' in my limbs, which came as 'waves. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was a little uncomfortable. At this point I ingested another gram and a half of extract and lay back in my recliner. With my eyes closed it was very easy to become lost in thought. I kept myself grounded with controlled breathing and placed 'Electric ladyland' in the CD player.<br><br>
T+3:00: This is becoming quite intense now. A large component of CNS / peripheral nervous system stimulation is noted, as is quite a powerful nauseant. Due to the stimulation, if I forget to stay in control my limbs twitch, and I forget where I am. What I see with eyes closed is really quite remarkable -- I see the earth as a film cel with an overlay and underlay. The underlay portrays a second sister planet which is connected to our planet through dimensions and is affected inversely to the events on earth. I have visions of Germany, 1940s and the pain inflicted upon those hated by Adolf Hitler. During this time of great revulsion on our planet, the sister planet is prospering, glowing with the birth of new culture, new life and peace, the gentle people as Samadhi, enlightened by their inverse Buddha, however ironic the thought seems. The overlay portrays a third world, and upon viewing all three simultaneously, they form a large triangle, with the three moons orbiting in synchronicity. The purpose of the third world is that of governing mind. Every action seen on this planet affects the situations on the other two planets and it is the job of this planet's patrons to maintain equilibrium between the two. This planet is not host to humans of any description, but to any creature on either planet which has ascended beyond their physical form and opened their 'third eye', enabling them to see this planet housed between the stars. One thought entered my brain and brought quite an understanding to the situation. As Mahatma Ghandi once exclaimed, 'There is orderliness in the universe', and this, it seems reigns true.<br><br>
T+7:00: The material seems to have peaked - I don't think my body would respond to sensations any more intense than I am feeling now. I will lay down now and maintain my breathing.<br><br>
T+7:30: The material has not peaked. Intensity has just risen a notch and I retreat to the WC to vomit, the house around me has taken a different form --  the walls are made of bark, the carpet the ocean floor. Out the corner of my eye I see horrible creatures, although I do not hear them their appearance is hideous -- one-armed maroon beings with short legs and Picasso-esque twisted faces, contorted in exquisite spiritual pain. I will send my love to these tortured beings. Emesis occurs and resembles ferric chloride turnings. Truly disgusting. I pour a glass of water and take a few sips, and return to my bed.<br><br>
T+8:00? - I have figured out these beings' purpose of existence. They have seen that my third eye has opened and come as helpers for the reaper. They want me to work on the third planet helping to maintain equilibrium. 'I'm not ready to go! I say to them, thinking my life would have been in vain if I were to leave this plane of existence now. The creatures acknowledge my state and promptly disappear. I close my eyes and see a vision of death, as portrayed in 'The reaper and the Flowers' (I forget the poet who wrote this) and see he has no desire to pluck me from the tree of life yet. Everything's better now. I shakily reach into my drawer and open up a baggie Id purchased the day before, I pack my bong and take a desperately fat rip of high quality purple indica in a bid to reduce nausea, accompanied by a couple more.<br>
I lay on my bed and as the cannabis kicks in the nausea rises from my stomach and floats out of my mouth. I see a glistening dark black ball that proceeds to rise through the ceiling. I am at peace once more. The ataxia seems gone and I can concentrate on breathing again.<br><br>
T+10:00? - I'm still somewhat feeling the effects of the extract as I thought I would. After some short while of viewing events on our planet and their inverse reactions on the sister planet, and how all this was governed by the third world, I start to feel quite sleepy. I see the clock says 7 PM roughly and I roll over and drift away into sleep, reflecting upon the secrets of the universe I have learned today. Oh my, what a day.<br><br>
The next day.<br>
I awake after roughly fourteen hours of interrupted and vague sleep and stagger to the toilet to vomit once more, although my stomach is empty and only bile rises with a very strange odour. I think I can describe this state as 'sensory overload' - touch, taste, smell and sight all become too much. I decide to eat a couple of slices of toast which help the nausea enormously and allow me to watch TV for a little while, before retiring to bed again, and sleeping for another eight hours.<br><br>
T+ 32:00 - The drug is still affecting me, although now it's just a vague nausea with dizziness and a slight headache. The visuals have disappeared and I enjoy a late breakfast and catch up with my friends. Telling them of the experience was enjoyable, as they all seemed to think it was a rather zany idea, and I'm inclined to agree with them.<br>
I must say that Iboga or Ibogaine, in no way whatsoever could possibly be a recreational drug - huge amounts of material have to be administered regularly and the experience can probably last a whopping 72 hours under some circumstances. However I think this risk is outweighed by the benefit to some - that of personal growth and freedom from addiction.<!-- End Body -->
