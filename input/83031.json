 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nA while back I ordered some dimethocaine. There was not much info on this substance. So I decided to contribute. Preliminary tests proved that intranasally, this substance did feel a lot like cocaine. Mild euphoria and moderate stimulation. It was better than bad cocaine, but not as good as amazing coke.\r\nI decided to see it would replace the speedball. I put the last 150 mgs in solution and added one bag of 'Overdose' brand heroin.\r\n:30 seconds warm feelings, sense of stimulation\r\n:01 realized that there was not going to be a rush or any audio flanging.\r\n:10 On irc, kind of disappointed\r\n:30 Just feeling the heroin.\r\nIn conclusion, I feel that dimethocaine was interesting. But not altogether fulfilling. I'd do it again. But I wouldn't go out of my way to.\n\n\n"
