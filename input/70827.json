But just for refrence, I was in a room with friends.<br>Your mist tasted of strangeness<br>the people said goodbye <br>I was gripped into your depths<br> at an alarming rate.<br>My limbs were ripped off and I ceased to exist along with my friend, time.<br>we saw god who was revealed as everybody in the room being ripped apart.<br>tearing. everywhere.<br>the true state of reality was chaos.<br>I was being pulled and cracked -- god  was  breaking.<br>I could not exist for much longer in this universe. The dark energy was too strong for me.<br>Sudden I saw the puzzle pieces reforming.<br>I wasn't ready to see into infinity so I was sent back.<br>\tMaybe reality can be handled one frame at a time. but perhaps not all at once.\n\n\n"
