 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was recently given one year of probation, which in any case requires drug screenings. being that the reason I was there was for drug possession I wanted to make sure I was clean for the screening. I never heard of DXM appearing in drug tests so I had done 2 bottles of robo max strength cough. Nothing else. I was expecting the test to come back clean but was surprised when I got a phone call saying it was positive for PCP.<br>I've never touched PCP before. The only thing I could think of was the DXM giving a false positive. I don't think the makers of robbitussin cut their cough medicine with PCP and I had not been on any other substance (besides alcohol) for a long enough time to pass a drug test.\n\n\n"
