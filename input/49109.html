After a great deal of research I decided to order 100g of the aforementioned substance.<br><br>
As I do with most substances Ive ordered, I acquired the services of many individuals to help test the effects of phenibut.<br><br>
Unfortunately the dose curve varied strongly between individuals. Some people responded to a mere 200mg (placebo?) while others required at least a gram to meet a threshold. After a week of testing and doses reaching a maximum of 15 grams, I determined from volunteers that phenibut indeed exhibited the effects mentioned earlier. Most individuals compared it to Valium, alcohol, or what they thought heroin would be like.<br><br>
It should also be noted that we determined than an insufflated dose of no more than 50mg is about equivalent to 2 grams ingested. This implies some breakdown in either the stomach or intestines.<br><br>
The following records my experience on phenibut.<br><br>
At about 10pm I ingested approximately 5 grams of phenibut on an empty stomach with a friend of mine whom ingested about 12 grams of phenibut.<br><br>
1 hour later I could begin to feel a strong sedative effect come over me. Every muscle in my body began to feel relaxed and I began to feel slightly drowsy. A few minutes later I began to lose motor function and my sense of balance. My friend was having trouble standing up and speaking in complete sentences. Despite his inability to communicate in a civilized manner, my friend assured me that he was having the time of his life. Unlike my friend (and everyone else I knew) I did not experience any euphoria from the phenibut; only a desire to go to sleep.<br><br>
I will continue to purchase phenibut and continue my independent studies on it.<!-- End Body -->
