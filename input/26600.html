My first experience with meth was not very pleasing.  I did a small line which made my nose burn.  The drip was pretty bad.  And I was told to swallow the taste, and not try and spit it out.  Shortly after, my heart began to race and I felt very uncomfortable.  I ended up being scared out of my mind all night.  <br><br>
I didn't plan on using meth again.  Then my friends started snorting lines regularly on the weekends.  I joined in with them just to stay up all night and have long conversations. I was beginning to have more of an enjoyable experience with the drug.<br><br>
Then the wierdness kicked in.  We started smoking off of foil, and my friend spilled a sack.  She began scraping the floor and trying to find the lost contents of the sack.  She ended up smoking lint and pieces of the ceiling.  <br><br>
I began using a glass pipe shortly after.  I smoked nearly a 20.00 sack everyother day.  The fun was beginning to wear off.  My funds were running low, and going to school was becoming nearly impossible.<br><br>
I ended up failing an entire semester of classes.  Being only 16, my family was very concerned.  I confessed to them that I was using and felt I had a problem.  But that didn't keep me from using.<br><br>
I got arrested at the age of 17 for breaking and entering.  That was no fun.  And it all started because I needed a safe place to hit my pipe.  I then realized I needed to shape up.<br><br>
I quit using for a short period of time.  Then, at the age of 18, I began smoking 1/2 gram daily.  I was out of my mind 99% of the time.  During this time, I experienced psychotic episodes, severe wieght loss, paranoia, sleep deprivation,  heart problems, and kidney problems.<br><br>
I finally quit for good right before my 19th birthday.  The comedown was nothing short of hellish.  I couldn't move, my body ached and I kept vommiting up whatever I ate.  The worst part of the comedown though, was the severe depression, paranoia and anxiety.<br><br>
For five months, I suffered with severe depression, paranoia and anxiety.  During that time, I was clean, but definately not a functioning member of society.  I now have 7 and 1/2 months clean time, and finally I can feel normal.<br><br>
I would not recommend this drug if you have a compulsive nature.  Personally, I will never touch any illegal substance again.  The time it took me to recover from my drug use is not worth a weekend of tweaking.<!-- End Body -->
