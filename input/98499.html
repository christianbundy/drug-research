It was a cool spring night, and I was at a friend's. We were in the mood to toke, so we called up my neighbor who delivers and told him that if he brought us some weed, we would smoke him up. He agrees, and the three of us walk to the cul-de-sac at the end of her street. <br><br>
We sit down, and he pulls a bong out of his backpack and we start ripping it. We smoked an eighth among the three of us, and that's when the paranoia started creeping in. While my friends were pointing out the serenity and beauty of the night, I felt as though the earth was going to swallow me at any minute into Hell. I could sense what I thought was Satan's presence, and began pacing. My friends asked if I was okay, but all I could get out was 'Any minute.. it's going to happen.' I spent the next couple of hours terrified and feeling so alone. I haven't smoked since.<!-- End Body -->
