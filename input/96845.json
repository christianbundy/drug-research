 "report": "<p>I recently received another gram of MXE and did WAY too much within a small amount of time. My mother came into my room and found me laying in bed, barely conscious, sweating profusely. I can't remember anything between taking it and going to get a shower and coming to in the ER getting my second shot of ativan. Apparently my heart rate was at 180 (possibly higher, don't know for sure) at one point. </p><p>I ended up having to get 3 or 4 shots of ativan in during my 8 hours at the hospital, of which I was awake for 3 or 4. I'm fine now, but my short-term memory is a little weird (I'll walk down the hall and grab something and as I'm walking back I won't remember walking there to begin with)</p><p>I guess this was just to say DON'T BE STUPID WITH YOUR DRUGS!</p>"
