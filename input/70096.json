 "report": "<p>It was in college. I was drinking with 3 of my good friends and my girlfriend at the time, and smoking some weed.  My ex-girlfriend wanted to get away to have sex in the woods; needless to say it was very easy to convince me.  As I lay in was mounting her in the dark woods outside of my friends mountain home, I put my hand in a spiders web that seemed extremely tough and springy.  I didnt think anything at the time because I was focused on the job at hand, until I felt something crawl onto my hand.  I reached to swipe it off, crushing the Black Widow Spider, but I felt a stinging in my hand.  I tried to continue having sex, but my hand was hurting so bad and I had to stop.  </p><p>When I stood up I was very dizzy and disoriented.  My ex-girlfriend and I started making our way back to the house which was about 150 yards away (we didnt go very far into the woods) and about halfway there my legs gave out.  My ex-girlfriend gave me some support and we got back to the house.  It was kind of late and everyone was really drunk.  I looked at my hand and it was swollen where the bite was and there were red marks around it.  I was starting to feel really strange, and I knew that it wasnt just the alcohol.  I remember my ex-girlfriend wanting someone to take me to the hospital, an argument ensuing over why we shouldnt drink and drive, and where the nearest hospital was.  My best friend was on my ex-girlfriend's side and he said he didnt give a fuck and he would drive me to the hospital, which was about an hour away.  I had being lying on the couch for a while, not sure how long, and I tried to stand up, and fell straight down.  I thought it was hilarious, but inside I knew something was very wrong.  My ex-girlfriend and my friend carried me to his truck and put me in the back seat.  </p><p>This is when the blackouts and hallucinations began.  The spider poison gave me a trip like I had never had before, and I have tripped on everything but mescaline, including DXM.  In the back of the truck I was looking out the window as my ex-girlfriend cried and my friend got on the CB radio, not giving a damn about anything.  There were parts of the trip where it felt like I was in a bubble, parts where I watched the trees grow really really tall and then shrink back to normal, and saying a bunch of random shit I dont remember.  I know that about 30 minutes in, my friends couldnt even understand what I was saying because my speech was slurred so bad.  We made it to the ER room where the nurse was waiting with a wheelchair, and they checked me in.  They asked me how bad it hurt on a scale of one to ten, and even with the beer and weed numbing the pain, I said it was an 11.  The doctor who treated me at 3 AM was drunker and nearly as fucked up as I was.  He slurred his speech really bad and all I could do was laugh in his face.  (I asked my friends what he was saying and they dont know to this day, we just do impressions of him, I think they laughed in his face because I was laughing)  He ended up giving me some shot, keeping me for 30 minutes, and releasing me with 20 10mg oxycontins (score!). on the way back, my ex-girlfriend and I finished our business in the back of my friends car, against his wishes.</p>"
