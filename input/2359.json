 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was far from my first time using cocaine... I'd had it perhaps 2 dozen times since 1990... but this time I decided to try and document the effects as they occured.\r\nNov. 23, 1997\r\n-------------\r\n11:27pm:\r\n        I just cut out two medium-to-small sized lines of cocaine. I've\r\nalready had about 6 or 7 lines over the past 3 hours or so, the last\r\nbeing a little over an hour ago. I smoked a bowl of pot about 45 minutes\r\nago, but its effects are pretty much unnoticeable, except maybe a slight\r\nreduction in the edginess of the cocaine effects. I'm definately still\r\nfeeling the effects, although I'm in the come-down stage at present. The\r\nnext 2 lines should give me a pretty typical high-dose cocaine experience.\r\nAt present, I feel contradictorally wired and tired. I feel as if I could\r\nfall asleep if I wanted, although from experience I know I couldn't yet. I\r\nfeel a warm fuzzy feeling all over my body, similar to the feeling of the\r\nsecond wind you get when you stay up all night, but there is also a mild\r\nfeeling of stimulant tension. Euphoria has definately long since passed.\r\nCocaine makes me dehydrated, and this manifests itself primarily in the\r\nfeeling of dry mouth. I will frequently suck on my cheeks, trying to\r\nsalivate, I guess. It's not really a conscious thing. Its a bad thing,\r\nactually, as it makes the dry mouth worse, and sometimes will leave my\r\nmouth feeling uncomfortable the next day. I'm going to finish my\r\ncigarette, then do these lines.\r\n11:33pm:\r\n        I snort the lines, and immediately feel both euphoria, and a\r\npassing urge to get the rest of my coke out and do more. I get the urge to\r\nsmoke a cigarette, so I do. The high intensifies for a minute or two then\r\nlevels. I'm mildly euphoric, but very stimulated. Its a distinct\r\nstimulation, more like amphetamines than caffeine. But definately\r\ndifferent. There is a mild anesthetic property, mainly concentrated in my\r\nmouth and nose, and a generalized tingly, warm sensation. I notice myself\r\ntyping alot harder, but pausing more between sentences. The urge to smoke\r\nmy cigarette is overwhelming. There is a warm feeling along my spine.\r\nMentally, I feel both calm and stimulated, somewhat paradoxically. If\r\nthere were people here, I'd be talkative.\r\n11:38pm:\r\n        I am feeling a barely perceptible decrease in the high, and decide\r\nto stop typing for a little bit to enjoy it, probably with another\r\ncigarette. The urge to do more coke occasionally pops into my mind but\r\nthen leaves just as quickly.\r\n11:53pm:\r\n        I went and smoked a cigarette, and alternated (quite frequently)\r\nbetween walking around my room smoking it, sitting on the edge of my bed,\r\nand putting down the cigarette to lay down and close my eyes. Laying down,\r\nI felt very calm, and as if my body were floating. The peak wore off\r\ngradually, and not evenly. I would alternate between feeling come-down\r\neffects and peak effects, with the come-down periods becoming longer and\r\nmore frequent.\r\n        The euphoria is mostly gone now, and the thoughts of doing more\r\ncoke are a little more frequent and longer, but are nowhere near\r\nirresistable. Simply being aware of the craving seems to make it go away.\r\nI took a multivitamin just now, which I always do before bed anytime I do\r\nany drugs outside of my usual ones (pot, tobacco, and caffeine). It\r\ngenerally reduces day-after fatigue. The stimulation is still quite\r\nstrong, and more amphetamine-like, although it is beginning to fade into\r\nthe post-peak mellowness of cocaine. I am almost back to the point I was\r\nwhen I began writing this.\r\n        Physically, the dry-mouth has become more noticable again. My\r\nlungs feel sort of grimy from smoking too many cigarettes (cocaine tends\r\nto make me chain smoke), and my nasal passages feel somewhat clogged and\r\nsore from doing coke all night. I snorted a few drops of warm water to\r\nhelp clear out my nose, which helped significantly. I can still\r\noccasionally taste cocaine in the back of my throat if I snort or breath\r\ndeeply through my nose.\r\n12:05am:\r\n        I'm basically back to where I was at the beginning now. I feel\r\ncalm and quiet. I don't really feel bad, although there have been times\r\nwhen I've felt quite depressed and physically worn when I've done alot of\r\ncocaine in a short time. I feel physically worn out, and mentally a little\r\ntired, but its definately not a bad thing - basically like being\r\novertired, despite the fact that I know I could not fall asleep right now.\r\nI've probably done about 1/2 gram over the course of about 4 hours, which\r\nalthough is alot, is nowhere near the most I've done; that would probably\r\nbe about 1.5 grams over 2 or 3 hours. Aside from the two lines I did while\r\nwriting this, I used the cocaine in a social setting tonight, with a girl\r\nand a guy I'm friends with. Its when doing it alone that I'll sit there\r\nand do line after line until it's gone or I just can't take anymore.\r\n        I plan on smoking a small bowl of pot to relax, and write a little\r\nmore. I'm going to take a 3mg melatonin tablet and probably a shot of\r\ntequila before I go to bed, to counteract the stimulant effect that would\r\nkeep me from sleeping. I'll still probably be unable to sleep for about an\r\nhour, perhaps more, but it will definately help, though it will probably\r\nmake me groggier tomorrow.\r\n        Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but not outstandingly so.\r\nCocaine simply isn't my drug of choice. I'm glad I did it, but it'll\r\nprobably be a while before I do it again.\r\n12:16am:\r\n        I take my melatonin, and take a hit off my bowl. This experiment\r\nis at an end.\n\n\n"
