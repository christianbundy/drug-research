I took 50 mg of 2c-b and the next day wondered if it would indeed show up for amphetamine. I bought a amphetamine instant urine test and it passed with flying colors, even after 50 mg the day before.<br><br>
My second test I bought a drug test that tested specifically for amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA in addition to a few other things that I knew wouldn't be in question as to if they passed or failed from 2c-b.<br><br>
After taking a dose of 50 mg 2c-b the night before, I took a smaller dose eyeballed at around 10 mg the day of the test. About three hours after I consumed the 10 mg dose I took the drug test. MDMA and meth passed very quickly as did all the other drugs, amphetamine also passed but it did seem as if the line may have taken a bit longer to form and as if it may have been a tad bit lighter than the other lines. But regardless, it still passed and the line was very real, although perhaps just a tad bit lighter than the other lines. This could be for tons of reasons I assume but it really doesn't matter because it was dark enough to pass.<!-- End Body -->
