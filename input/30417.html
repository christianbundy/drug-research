I thought whippits were safe, as I had done research and found out that it is even administered to pregnant women to help with their birth pains. So I had no problem filling a balloon with 2 cans of N2O and inhaling it until losing conscoiusness.  The echoing in the ears, the fading out of consciousness, it all seemed too good to be true.  It was.<br><br>
The problem with how I took the whippits was that I didn't know my body was oxygen deprived, and because I did so many, I have effects of it to this day.  I will every now and then just shake/have a tremor which is very embarassing and I try my hardest to suppress, but it's like I've damaged the part of my brain that controls muscle movements so it's involuntary.  <br><br>
I just want first timers/long timers to know that they should inhale and exhale into the balloon, then take a breathe of normal air, then into the balloon again in a pattern so they don't get too oxygen deprived. I haven't done N2O going on a year now and regret doing them at all. On a good note I'm slowly recovering from this and shake less and less. I guess my main point is please enjoy them in moderation, it's not worth fucking up your brain over!<!-- End Body -->
