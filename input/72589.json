 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nA slower entry than anticipated (first effects after some 40 minutes on a fairly empty stomach). Did 20 minutes Ashtanga yoga followed by mantra, very gradual ascent until Im actually in the space. Minor body load, some abdominal full/emptyness but no nausea. Did lots of dancing using Roths The Wave  very nice can see how this material would work in clubland. Sense of the body enhanced, yes certainly an erotogenic!\r\nOutside some 2 hours in, perhaps a peak? Sitting in the hidden 'group ups' terrace of my garden, there is a light rain and the last light of the sun is still around. I can see all the little Deva spirits in the trees, and greet them. They smile back, elfish but in no way scary. Enjoying the rain, though Im sheltered beneath a small umbrella. After a while I decide that I should be at one with the rain, take down my brolly and it stops. There is a revelation (?!) here;\r\nThe rain is a blessing, though on our damp little islands it's easy to forget. But the rain is a blessing.\r\nSure its nice to have an umbrella, but if you take it down, you some times find the shower has already passed.\r\nDeep!\r\nDid some Horns of Baphomet yoga, very nice. This material feels like the sister to the Toad venom (5-Meo-DMT), slower but the same deep, earthy content. Very minor visual changes with either open or closed eyes. It's my body that is tripping more than my mind.\r\nBack in the house, send a few emails to friends, did some VIII magick (autoerotic tantra), very strong climax. Not much of the speedyness of acid, which is nice, and after a few more waves at t+4  hours after drop time Im coming down, but this is a very gentle descend. Nice.\r\nOverall highly recommended. Would blend well with bodywork, sex, massage etc. I can see this being a material to explore in a range of sensual conditions. The nice side of Pan.\n\n\n"
