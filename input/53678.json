 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nOkay so i'm really bored and on a nasty drug testing regime and I've really been needing SOME kind of mental distortion (reality is BORING for me!).\r\nI recently got prescribed Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10mg a day. I am really bored so I just took four of them to see what happens.\r\nT+0:00 I just popped four of them, it's 9:11pm, we'll see what happens, im currently just listening to some music and surfing the web.\r\nT+0:45 nothing happening yet...\r\nT+1:00 Been really giggly, I cant stop smiling and laughing at pointless stuff, I dunno if im just in a good mood or if somethin is happening.\r\nT+1:10 yeah it isn't the lexapro, cuz now I feel normal again.\r\nT+1:20 I feel a lump in my chest, it doesnt feel bad or weird, I kinda like it actually, kinda feels like I swallowed something big whole or something.\r\nT+2:00 I went and smoked a cigarette and kept laughing for no reason, it was pretty enjoyable, now im just gettin into some music\r\nT+3:00 I'm pretty delirious I dunno if im tired or if it's workin, I'm laughin at things I normally wouldnt.\r\nThe next day: I woke up feeling extremely tired and groggy, but once I got moving I felt really relaxed and in a very good mood\n\n\n"
