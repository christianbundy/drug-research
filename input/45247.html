This actually just happened tonight, when I was smoking a nice fat joint at 6:00 pm. I am a everyday smoker and I never expected a trip  like this would ever happen with weed. Right after I smoked that joint, I decided to go on the computer and listen to music I felt a little numbness in my throat. 20 minutes after that I could feel my heart pounding. I was also experiencing my legs and arms constantly shaking. Almost 30 minutes went by, and I was still experiencing these problems. I was really confused and didnt know where to go so I decided to go back in the computer room. I started listening to music and I actually starting rapping and it seemed like once I started to talk and speaking out loud my heart started to return to its regular heart rate on weed. Once I did this for about 10 mins an amazing high came in. <br><br>
I started seeing double of things. As I moved my head slowly back and forth it would feel like an amazing fluid circulating my head and once I took a deep breathe I could fell a warm slow feeling going in my bloodstream and its like every time I would breathe in oxygen and exhale I would also feel it going all over my body. <br><br>
I'm still high right now but it was really messed up. I am taking a acne pill right now but I blazed that a few months ago and up till the incident that happened today. My heart now feels normal. Of course I'm going to blaze again, but I think I'm goin to take a break n not blaze that much.<!-- End Body -->
