I had just got some fresh kava root from a market in QLD on the packet it says WAKA Grade. I have had kava a few times and my usual dose is 3/4 - 1 cup depending on how strong it is.<br><br>
It was a average day at work and I was feeling good, tired but I had a good mind set. I was just bored at home so I decided I would make a brew of my new kava (this was the first time I had it). I put about 1 cup of the root powder into a piece of cloth and then submerged it in tap water(22 deg C) in a bowl say 600ml water. I plunged it up and down and worked it with my hands for a min or 2, I let it stand for about 2.5 hours working it with my hands every half hour or so. After the 2.5 hours I squeezed all the remaining liquid from the cloth/kava leaving a nice milk-coffee colored liquid. I then put the fully squeezed sack of kava into a new container with fresh liquid.<br><br>
(T 0:00) I poured myself a large glass which I finished in about 5 min.<br>
An instant feeling of slight relaxation was present, I then finished 3 more glasses in 5 min intervals which was all I had.<br><br>
(T +0:35) After 35 min I began to feel the effects more strongly and felt the need to curl up in bed. I had a slight feeling of drunkeness/unsteady on my feet.<br><br>
(T +1:00) At this time I was feeling very euphoric with a slight buzz going through my body. The drunken like effects had gotten stronger and my balance was a bit out. I drank the second extract I had made about 3/4 of a glass.<br><br>
(T +2:00) By now I was feeling very sick in the stomach and was feeling the full effects with included Tiredness/relaxation/loss of motor skills/muscle relaxation.<br><br>
(T +2:30) Well that sickness got stronger until I dryreached a few times but never got anything up. It was not an unbearable feeling but certainly not a positive.<br><br>
(T +3:00) The sickness and effects were slowly starting to wear off and there is not much else to report on after this.<br><br>
Well from exprience I would say WAKA grade kava is quite strong I think I will stick to half a cup next time :).<!-- End Body -->
