This year I grew 10 Henbane plants and they have just come to seed. I striped open several capsules and dried the seeds in the sun. I tried them in several small doses of 0.1 and 0.2 grames with litle effect. Last night I measured out 0.5 grams of the dry seeds and sat down to wait for the effects.<br><br>
Hallucinations were minimal but were more pronounced in the dark. In the light the effect is more of a blur to my vision than  true hallucination. I developed the dry mouth that I get with any of the datura plants but it wasnt to much of a problem. I drank 2 cans of cider while I was waiting for the effects but as soon as they came on I found that I didnt want to drink alchol anymore. The cider had taken on a strange bitter taste.<br><br>
I felt quite drowsey in a similar way to Valium perhaps. My coordination and balance was completly shot to pieces. I could still walk and get around but it was the equivilent of being extreamly drunk. I fell over a couple of times.<br><br>
Apart from the above my head felt quite clear and I will be experimenting again next week with a slightly higher dosage.<!-- End Body -->
