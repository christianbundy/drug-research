This experience happened about a few weeks ago.  I decided to do the usual, downing a bottle of robo and going out to the mall for a ton of stupid things to gawk at.  Except this time I downed it on an empty stomach and without the water afterwards.  I was looking to impress and show off by drinking the stuff straight, which was a bad move.  So I felt the high about 45 mins later and everything was going smoothly until I tried to get up from the bench I was sitting on.  I immediately knew I was going to faint, so I told my friend and she told me to sit down, and that she'd go get me some water.  I have some circulatory issues or something because I would faint alot when younger.  <br><br>
I put my head on my knees and the world turned black.  I knew I had a cold sweat from almost fainting, but the DXM just wouldn't let me recover from that feeling.  I felt like almost fainting for about 15 minutes.  I was drifting in and out of consciousness.  I knew I didn't faint because I had very little comprehension, but still some.  It took forever to come back to normal, and it felt like the world pulled me back into existance.  I started seeing where I was, and colors and I knew I was alive again.  I still can't recall those 15 minutes in between though.  This was a very scary experience, especially because I was almost fainting in a public place and nobody even looked twice.  Thank God I had my friend there, or I don't know what would have happened.  I really hope you post this story to show the importance of a sitter.<!-- End Body -->
