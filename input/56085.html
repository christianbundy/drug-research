Mon, 9/18/06, 3:15 AM at time of entry. Smoked at about 1:30.<br><br>
[Preparation:]<br>
My first time ever trying Salvia. Quiet, dimly-lit room, laying back and propped up on a futon with a pillow supporting my head. Will definitely do this laying down next time. Fan on low setting in the next room pointing in my direction. Smoked through a glass bowl instead of a bong. Dosage was also less than recommended, since I mainly just wanted to sample it for my first time. Because of that, no sitter. Went into it with a relaxed mindset of experimentation, and a natural curiosity of reality, whether reality is anything beyond just what we currently perceive.<br><br>
[Report:] <br>
Most certainly did not break through my first time. I did not expect to. However, I experienced several strange occurrences and feelings. Took one hit, held it in for 30 seconds, effects felt almost immediately after exhaling. First, my skin began to feel prickly, is the only way I can describe it. A very intense but not uncomfortable tingle all over my body. I then began to sweat profusely, particularly my legs and forehead. I began to feel the pulling sensation that Ive read is a common effect. <br><br>
At this point, it slowly dawned on me exactly what was pulling at me though, I closed my eyes and felt the tugging coming from my right. At this point - and this is difficult to explain in words - I was convinced that I was becoming part of a crudely-drawn or painted cartoon street sign, like the Sesame Street logo for example. I was slowly being absorbed into it, being slowly covered in paint, and I somehow knew that this pulling force, which may have been cartoon children, though I didn't actually see anyone, was trying to pull me into their cartoon land. Possibly by a ride on a school bus. Strange as it sounds, I thought my experience had something to do with the Childrens Television Workshop. As I had this sensation of being turned into a cartoon sign, certain parts of my body felt like I was being immersed in it, and that if it reached up past my neck, I would somehow drown in the sign or at least become part of it. The pulling later came from below me, and finally to my left. <br><br>
I was lucid the whole time however, still aware of my surroundings but also aware of this odd sensation I was going through at the same time. Sometime during the prickly/sweaty feeling my pants became very uncomfortable and I had to take them off. Unfortunately the fan suddenly made me cold, which I think might have slowly grounded me back into reality. Things I said included me trying to convince this force to take me with you, asking where are you going?, and various odd phrases and syllables about being immersed in a street sign. As the feeling subsided, I felt that I missed the bus to cartoon land. Following this, the feeling left me, and the only remaining symptom was a heavy feeling in my head. Still felt low coming-down effects nearly an hour later. By 3:00 the feeling was mostly gone.<br><br>
[Analysis:]<br>
I reiterate that I was lucid, I knew what was going on, these were just the things that came up in my mind at the time, and I attributed these seemingly random ideas to the sensation I was feeling. Perhaps the childlike nature of the feeling was due to this being a new experience, along with the drug-culture cliché of being taken away in a magic bus so to speak. I had very few preconceptions about the substance and have heard every trip is different, so I didnt know what to expect. <br><br>
[Conclusion:] <br>
I plan to do this again at proper dosage and a higher temperature flame, but not without a sitter. Very interested in breaking through and I believe that I am capable of doing so, based on this first try being a lower dosage and still nearly altering my perception of reality.<!-- End Body -->
