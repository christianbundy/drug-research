 "report": "<p>I received a 4.1 g kratom extract/resin from on online vendor. I made a tea of about 10oz total volume.  The resin dissolved almost completely, the taste and smell definitely that of something active.  It is not unpleasant, but not delicious. There is a mild numbing of the mouth and throat as with kava. The effects are mild - general relaxation, sedative, and almost valium-like. This was supposed to be the equivalent of a strong dose, though it is not a strong effect, but definitely noticeable.  Might be good for long plane rides or the like.</p>"
