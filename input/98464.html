I've been battling depression and anxiety for years, but this month was especially terrible. After losing my job, ending a serious relationship, and dropping all of my college classes, I was finding it nearly impossible to fall asleep.<br><br>
The past few night Ive been up until 6am crying. Last night, not wanting to go through that again, I asked my neighbor if he had Xanax, or anything, to help me fall asleep. He told me he had some antidepressants that he was prescribed to help him sleep. I looked up the medication, Trazodone, and figured that would be perfect. He gave me about 8 100mg pills and advised me to take two of them. I went home and took the two 100mg pills right away with some water. I immediately crawled into bed, turned off all the lights, and put on a TV show. It was almost midnight.<br><br>
After ten or fifteen minutes, my crying stopped. I felt my limbs getting heavier, and it felt like I was a stuffed animal. Fuzzy, motionless, heavy. I was very prepared to fall asleep. This was the only enjoyable part of my experience, and after this I lost track of how time was passing.<br><br>
About twenty minutes in, I was starting to see things out of the corner of my eye. It looked like things were moving behind my curtains but when I turned to check, they disappeared. I tried to focus on the TV instead but found that the main character looked exactly like my recent ex. It was like watching him on the screen.<br><br>
It was freaking me out so I turned off the TV and put on my favorite audiobook. At this point I closed my eyes and found that I was having insane visuals of what was happening in the story. Its unusual for me to picture scenes and characters so well in my minds eye, so I let it happen. At first, I was just watching the characters as if it were a movie, very realistic. But at one point the characters began to warp, from balloon-like cartoons, back to realistic, and then these dark, willowy figures. Id never envisioned this book as dark but suddenly it was terrifying. The characters would be talking to each other and then suddenly look directly at me. I knew I was only picturing them in my mind, but it felt like they were standing directly in front of me, turning to stare me in the eyes. I had to turn the audiobook off.<br><br>
Now, I was sitting in my bed, in complete darkness and silence. I was suddenly aware of how fast my heart was beating and how incredibly thirsty I was. All I wanted was water. It seemed like it took me half an hour to pick myself up out of bed, and stumble down the stairs to my kitchen. I drank some water, didnt feel much better, and went back upstairs to my bed.<br><br>
The darkness of my room seemed evil to me. If I kept my eyes open, I would see dark shadows darting across my walls. If I closed them, the visions would be worse: skulls flying in front of my face, an alien-monster-like creature walking towards me. Eventually I found that I was able to push these thoughts away until they were static in the corner of my field of vision. It was a mental battle between evil thoughts and seeing nothing at all.<br><br>
By now it was probably 1:30 am, but it felt like much longer than an hour. I was suddenly aware of noises coming from the downstairs of my house. I was paralyzed with fear; I could actually hear peoples voices below me. I wanted to get up and check but my heart was racing and my limbs were too weak. I lay there panicking for a few minutes, convinced that my house was being robbed. After a while I managed to drag myself to the window, and realized that it was only my next-door neighbors (loudly) drinking in their backyard. Overwhelmed with relief, I was finally able to start drifting off into sleep.<br><br>
The sleep was unsettling. I had a very vivid, intense dream but could not remember it upon waking. I think I woke up a few times during the night, dry sobbing and feeling sick.<br><br>
This morning, I woke up just in time to make my doctors appointment (10:30 am). I felt groggy, weak, nauseous, and my head was furiously pounding. I figured these symptoms would go away once I was a little more awake. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I had purple bags under my eyes, and it looked like my face was melting. I found myself crying before I left my house, a combination of feeling sick and immediately thinking about my ex.<br><br>
Driving was extremely difficult. I had to use two hands just to turn the key in the ignition. My vision was blurry and I had trouble staring at the same spot for more than a few seconds. Halfway through my drive I began to regret getting into my car. It was incredibly hard to focus and my headache got worse with each passing minute.<br><br>
Its now almost 2pm and Im back in bed. My headache is worse than ever, I feel sick to my stomach, and I dont even recognize myself in the mirror. Its a beautiful day but Im stuck inside trying not to cry because it makes me feel even sicker.<br><br>
This experience was definitely not worth it for me.  I regret taking two of the pills, and probably should have started with half of one. Im not very experienced with psychedelics (only had one DMT trip and it was pleasant) so the hallucinations were very scary and unexpected. I believe Trazodone may be very helpful for some, but I plan on flushing the other 6 pills.<!-- End Body -->
