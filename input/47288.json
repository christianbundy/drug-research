 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFriday night, grounded, very bored. Sadly this means a trip to the medicine cabinet. I dont waste good drugs and alcohol when Im alone. I was about to drink some cough syrup when I found an old bottle of vicodin. I take 2 with milk, and go watch tv.\r\nT+1:00 \r\nI ate something, take two more, and go play socom. No effects yet, remember hearing snorting them is better, and go upstairs, crush one up, and snort it. It burned for an hour or so. But I became very euphoric, and couldnt remember what I was talking about. I got on aim, and was positive that I knew what the meaning of life was, and my friends were unworthy of hearing it.\r\nThen the 4 I took orally kicked it I became numb, happy and depressed at the same time, and felt terribly ill very close to when I took a bunch of Percocet I lay down, and it kinda stopped, but I would black out, and then it was like a flashlight was shined on my eyelids every few minutes would feel fine, then pass out and see the light on my eyelids. Pass out completely for 20 minutes, when my brother found me lying on the bathroom floor (light on door open) I said I was sick, and went to bed. Next few days terrible stomach, no appetite.\n\n\n"
