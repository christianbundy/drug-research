Ambien in itself is an extremely interesting drug and it usually takes 15-30 minutes to feel the effects. I had used Ambien on several previous occasions before deciding to combine it with cannabis.<br><br>
9:00 pm: I take 10 mg Ambien<br><br>
9:15 : Feeling slightly confused and euphoric<br><br>
9:30 : The effects of the ambien have fully manifested and it is hard to concentrate. I feel moderately drunk, my motor skills are inhibited and I lose my balance several times on my way to the bong. I proceed to smoke two bowls of marijuana.<br><br>
9:45 : I am completely zonked and I snap in and out of vivid dream- like states. I feel that I am not alone and that there are people talking to me. Ambien usually trips me out like that but the cannabis makes the hallucinations all the more real.<br><br>
10:15 : The Ambien effects are not as strong now but still definitely have a prescence. <br><br>
10:00 : At this time I am quite drowsy and lethargic. I think of going to bed but I forget to do so.<br><br>
10:45 : I can no longer stay awake and doze off.<br><br>
11:15 : I wake up dazed and confused feeling very drowsy but high.<br>
I decide to return to bed.<br><br>
In retrospect I found the trip very odd and interesting. The feeling of the presence of people was so real that i actually beleived that there were people around me, talking to me. Ambien, an extremely weird drug anyways, was intensified by the ganja.<br><br>
I enjoyed the experience and would do it again. For those who want to experience this combination i would recommend experimenting with ambien by itself first. Ambien, although odd as hell, is definitely worth a try.<!-- End Body -->
