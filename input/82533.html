Warning: THIS TASTES HORRIBLE. Be prepared to brush your teeth directly afterward, and still deal with a crappy after taste.<br><br>
A little background: Alcohol is involved. I, admittedly, do not have a very good tolerance to alcohol.  Only one shot was consumed, and I am very certain I can handle one shot.<br><br>
I had purchased a small bottle of common sage essential oil because I love the smell and hoped to possibly create a candle out of it.  I never found the time, and a while later I stumbled upon an online listing of the herb as a potential psychoactive.  I never realized that this common culinary herb was such a close cousin of 'Salvia,' or Salvia Divinorum which is supposed to produce a short trip.<br><br>
I have never smoked Salvia Divinorum, so I have no way to compare the two, but this is what happened.<br><br>
I became curious, and decided to try the Sage oil.  It packed a very powerful scent, so I figured whiskey (namely Jack Daniels 80 proof, to be exact) would be a great way to cover the taste.  Boy, was I wrong.  The Sage was way more powerful tasting than the whiskey.  After brushing my teeth, I still had to deal with the after taste for a few hours.  Cigarettes helped numb my taste buds, but not by much.<br><br>
I put ten drops (from the dropper included with the essential oil) into one 1 oz shot glass already full with the whiskey.  Cheers, and down the hatch.  Fifteen minutes later, I began feeling a little 'warm and fuzzy.'  The best way to describe it is that it felt like I had four glasses of wine.  It was notably  more of a 'wine-drunk' than a 'whiskey-drunk,' although I could not consider myself being drunk.<br><br>
So, if I ever find myself with only a shot or two of alcohol left and still want to feel a real buzz, I might do this if I were desperate.  It definitely helped screw me up, but it tasted so nasty I might never want to do it again.<br><br>
I never made those candles, by the way. I can no longer stand the taste or smell of sage.<!-- End Body -->
