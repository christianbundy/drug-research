The story that follows is not to discourage use of psychoactive substances, but rather to warn of making the same mistakes that I made. Of course all the names have been changed.<br><br>
This tale takes place when I was a junior in High School, when I was only 17. I had been on a hallucinogen kick recently and had recently purchased 30 grams of DXM and about 25 mgs of 5-MeO-DMT. I had a very accurate scale, and the first time I tried 5-MeO-DMT I did about 5 mgs. It was a very enjoyable first trip, the body buzz was amazing, and the closed eyes visuals were out of this world. However, having recently experienced the far suppirier DMT, I was slightly disappointed in the effects.<br><br>
A week later my friend, Z, suggested him and I go over and spend the night at his house and experience 5-MeO-DMT, drink, and later a little DXM. He lives in another city, about 45 minutes north of where I live. When we arrived I met one of Z's other friends, P, who was quite stoned at this point. We decided unanimously to trip on the 5-MeO-DMT, as I had said it was not a long trip and we could definitely finish the trip before dinner. Neither of them had even heard of the substance, so it was up to me to measure the dosage and teach them how to properly smoke it. <br><br>
P volunteered to go first, and I gave him a 7.5 mg dose. He smoked it, and didn't get a good hit at all, but he was obviously still affected as he lay back and closed his eyes. About 10 minutes later, P sat up and commented that it was weaker then he anticipated but still enjoyable. Hearing this Z decided he should take a higher dosage, so I measured out 12 mgs, which was my planned trip dosage. The thing I didn't realize until later and the point on writing this, was that I forgot to take into account the existing dosage that still remained in the pipe. P had gotten a very poor hit, so there was considerable substance still remaining, probably about 5 mgs. Thus when Z took a very hard hit, he really took 17 mgs of 5-MeO-DMT. <br><br>
After Z had took the hit I cleared the pipe, which still had enough to get me buzzed, and prepared to give myself a little more. However, before I had the chance, Z started having seizures, and sweating profusely. P started to panic, while I went to Z's and tried to talk him out of it. I had always prided myself on reading up on every drug before I attempted its use, and couldn't remember reading anywhere that 5-MeO-DMT could cause seizures. After 5 minutes I realized his seizure was not abating and began thinking of 911. Due to the fear of arrest I stupidly decided to wait a little longer, as I knew his dosage should not be fatal. The seizure subsided but his heart rate at this time was through the roof, and he began to mumble in gibberish. His mumblings eventually increased to the point of shouting. When the second seizure came combined with screaming, I made the decision to call 911. <br><br>
The ambulance arrived shortly, with 2 police officers. I tried my best to explain to the paramedics what he was on, but they had never even heard of the substance. Z now was screaming that he was god, and was practically foaming at the mouth. The paramedics restrained him and drove him to the nearest hospital. As soon as they were gone the police began to question us. Due to the extreme stress of the situation, and the chemicals in our body, we did about everything wrong when dealing with the police. I confessed to everything and was promptly arrested, and driven to the police station. While I was there I was interrogated, about the DXM, which they thought was cocaine. The officer doing the interrogating, kept telling me if my friend died I have his murder on my hand. Eventually my parents arrived and took me home, and I awaited my fate in the courtroom.<br><br>
My friend didn't die, and was released later that night. Mentally he didn't fully recover for a week. He later confessed to me that despite the horror of the night, the trip itself was by far the strongest and greatest thing he had ever experienced. He said he was transported to a realm like heaven, where he felt he was god over everything. When he woke up in the hospital he thought he had died, and that the hospital was the afterlife.<br><br>
In the end I got off without any kind of punishment, not even probation. I am lucky to have wealthy parents, and due to the fact that I was from a different city, the prosecutors didn't feel like engaging in all the paper work necessary to transfer my case. My two other friends however both got probation and rehab.<br><br>
I have since found a new respect for hallucinogens, and know now that they are not to be taken lightly. While I continue to experiment, I know do so in a controlled environment, always being overly careful in my dosages. Because, you can never be to careful when it comes to your life.<!-- End Body -->
