 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIf I were to go on in detail, this would be a novel-length report. But for the folks just wanting to know about high dosages of 2c-i, i'll keep it short.\r\nI'm by no means a psychedelic amature. I've run the entire gamut: LSD, Mesacline, Mushrooms, DMT, numerous research chemicals, and various dissociatives, so i wasn't going blindly into this excursion. I've lost count of how many times i've done 2c-i. At least 75.\r\nMy tolerance for 2c-i at the time of this experience was nonexistant, as this was the first time i'd done it in over a year. I drank 100mg in a glass of soda, and began feeling my first alert 15 minutes later, which is strange because i usually have to wait 30-45 minutes. [Erowid Note: 100 mgs of 2C-I is considered an extremely high dose, see 2C-I Dose Chart]\r\nI go rent the movie Yellow Submarine. Feel extremely nauseated. After only 30 minutes trip is already passing the intensity of a 20mg dose. Visuals and Mindset somewhat similar to mescaline, with a strong amphetamine flavor.\r\nAfter 45 minutes visuals are extremely intense, walking difficult. Start watching Yellow Submarine.\r\nThe movie is ridiculous. Time becomes meaningless, the movie becomes one with the physical world.\r\nI'm unsure of when, but i begin to lose control. I feel my ego dissolving. I feel like i'm dying, like i've overdosed. I fight it, but eventually accept: This is the end, I'm dying.\r\nMy ego is peeled away in layers, my life flashing before my eyes in an instant. I'm extremely frightened, but feel death is inevitable.\r\nI leave my body and watch reality become a tiny sliver floating in the aether. I feel eons pass. I feel the universe aging, destroying, rebuilding. I feel entire races of life created and destroyed in fractions of seconds. I feel the birth and death of stars at an unimaginable rate.\r\nThe peak lasts for about 3 hours in realtime, eternities in my head. Effects last for another 6 or 7 hours.\r\nThis was the most intense drug experience i've had, including DMT. I base this on the fact that DMT's speed leaves no time for pondering, while the 2c-i had me in a transcendental state for 3 hellish hours. I've vowed never to go back to heights. Time will tell.\n\n\n"
