I have had quite a few experiences with smoking 'magic' mushrooms. My first experience with such was one of the first times I ate mushrooms. Me and some friends had never heard of anybody trying it before (mind you we were quite young) and were presently under the influence of them. Believing that the affects were going to be mild or none, we packed half a pipe of some REALLY nice kind bud :) and filled the rest with the mushroom shake from the bottom of our bag. After smoking about half of it I personally noticed a distinct glow (maybe an aura?) on everything around me. I confirmed these visions with my two friends who were partaking with me and we decided that it was a very nice way to increase your visuals on a mushroom trip.<br><br>
Although we were not satisfied and came back to this issue several months later because we were not decided that it actually did anything because we were under the influence of mushrooms. So, we decided to try from baseline and smoke JUST mushrooms this time and we smoked them out of a bong. Indeed it was a success and we had interesting results. We felt quite a change and noticed that were weren't tripping as hard as we would have if we had eaten them, but were still feeling the 'body buzz' with pleasant mild visuals. And my last note for this very long report, I recently smoked a very large blunt consisting of about 1/3 'shwagg' dirt weed and 2/3 mushrooms and had an EXCELLENT time and noticed a little more than mild visuals with one hell of a 'body buzz'. Well, thanks for letting me spit some experiences out. And you all be safe when using mushrooms because they are to be respected and not to be fucked with. :)<!-- End Body -->
