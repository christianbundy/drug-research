 "report": "<p>\nI had tried whippets and liked what i felt. so i purchased a tank, 10lbs and found a place that would fill it with nitrous only and no sulfur dioxide(which is bad news). we tried balloons but i wasnt impressed..we went to kitchen trash bags...oh my god!! Ever hear the word unconscious with your eyes open? Hahaha gotta love this stuff!! Taking deep breaths..light hyperventalating before taking in the nitrous makes the high hit fast. PLEASE lay on your back and do not ever put the bag over your head because you WILL go out....and could possibley asphixiate.\r[Erowid Note: Using garbage bags to dispense Nitrous is extremely dangerous, especially if you are using alone or without a sober sitter. Even if you're careful to not put the bag over your head, it can fall and cover your face and mouth, blocking breathing. There are confirmed cases of death (1999) caused by this...USE A DIFFERENT METHOD.]</p><p>The high is intense with auditory sounds going wah wah wah wah and getting louder until I transport into another dimension vision becomes non existant and my thoughts are projected into there spot. No headache no naseau nothing but a good time !!!</p>"
