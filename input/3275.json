 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI would just like to express a brief note of caution. Although regulations require medical products to list the medical ingredients of their product, in Canada they won't neccesarily put the 'buffer' chemical on the list. This buffer chemical is the one that makes you throw up violently if you accidently ingest 'too much' to stop little kids from accidently killing themselves (or adults too, I suppose). Of course, if you're using a chemical recreationally then this buffer will almost certainly get in the way. \r\nThis may be why a number of people have reported ill effects from cough remedies which _appeared_ to contain only DXM. I have personally used DXM with no undesirable effects several times, then, after switching brands (to the generic one none the less!) I became violently sick and had uncontrollable diarheah when taking a trivial dose (300mg DXM HBr) I guess the moral of the story would be to try out a new brand at low levels and see if you can feel evidence of a buffer before subjecting yourself to 5-6 hours of nausia and delerium.\n\n\n"
