I received an amount of Hops from a friend who likes to experiment with psychoactive herbs. He bought the herb from a health food store. I first tried hops with this guy and we smoked it out of a glass marijuana pipe.<br><br>
The herb looked like little flakes of hay. I thought it tasted a lot like weed but the smoke was extremely harsh, probably because the plant is so dry. Another friend who is a regular pot smoker tried it and disagreed that it tasted like weed. I got some mild weed-like effects my first time but nothing to write home about.<br><br>
The experience that really floored me was when I smoked it out of a bong with weed. Several nights after my initial experience, I got the hankering to get stoned by myself (I only occasionally use this drug anymore). I didnt have much pot so I packed a medium size bowl with a 3rd weed and 2/3rds hops. The weed layer was on the bottom. I smoked most of the bowl in 3 big rips. I became extremely high but in a different way than with weed. <br><br>
The heavy stoney sedative effects of schwag were there but very little of the psychedelic effects. I also didnt see any mild patterns or other visual effects that usually manifest with pot. My imagination wasnt stimulated like with weed. It felt like a cross between being drunk and high but more like being drunk. My eyes felt like they were bugging out of my skull, which I have never experienced on just pot. I also had cotton mouth pretty bad. This high lasted for a good two and a half hours and then I went to bed as it tapered off. I had a sore throat the next morning from the harsh smoke.<br><br>
I smoked several bong loads of hops by itself last weekend and didnt experience the same intensity. I did feel some light effects like with my first experience but nowhere near the weed combo. It was on a small scale what that combo was. I am aware of the fact that weed makes active many substances generally deemed to be inactive. But the difference in highs makes me think that it wasnt just an enhanced placebo effect. My conclusion is that hops is a good filler material when I want to smoke weed for a purely intoxicating experience. This may not work for regular pot smokers though. <br>
