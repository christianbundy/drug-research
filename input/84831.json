 "report": "<p>My friend and I decided to try Ecstacy. My friend has done it before, but this was my first time. The main thing that I would like to express is that Ecstasy did not work for me when I was taking Fluoxetine commonly known as Prozac.</p><p>Yesterday was the day this happened. I took my anti-depressant sometime around noon-3 when I usually did. Later, we took the dose at around nine. We just took it last night and I experienced a very mild body high for a very short period of time while my partner rolled for hours. I was very disappointed and crashed hard as well.</p><p>I have done research to understand why and I believe I will try again without taking my daily dose. Instead, I will take my Prozac well after the dose.</p>"
