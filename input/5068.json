 "report": "<p>This sommer I bought some 1,4-Butanediol because I read that it gave you a really good high simmilar to MDMA. This was actually untrue, but it was still a good high. I started using it more and more over a couple of months until I was at the point of using it about once every three or four hours. It got to the point where I was taking 10ml every six hours just to stop myself from shaking from withdrawl, and then it got to the point where I could not sleep. </p><p>After not sleeping for three days, I checked myself into the emergency room where they hooked me up to a heart monitor. Once the six hour mark came, I started zoning out and then I do not remember anything until I woke up four days later in the detox building. I stayed there for another six days until I was discharged. I was discharged on 10/16/99 and it is now 1/30/01 and I still don't feel normal. I cannot even smoke pot anymore without feeling extreme anxiety. </p><p>So, my advise to anyone using this substance: 'DO NOT ABUSE IT'. Use it in moderation, because once you get to the point where I was, you have to check into the hospitol so they could monitor you, otherwise you really could DIE! I wish I would have read something like this before I got addicted.</p>"
