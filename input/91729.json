 "report": "<p>I started taking Tramadol after my doctor decided it would be a good alternative to Vicoden for my neck and peripheral nerve pain in my left arm. Apparently he thought that the Vicoden was too addictive and I would need long term pain management.</p><p>I had trouble taking the Tramadol at first because it upset my stomach so much but I lost 25lbs and this made me very happy so I stuck with it. I never really got 'high' from these pills but I did get a feeling of increased energy and often would get muscle and head aches. </p><p>After the first six months I found I needed more to get the same results so I had my doc up my dosage and he started writing for 90 day supplies. The first time I ran out 5 days before my new prescription came in the mail I was in pretty bad shape. I had horrific restless leg, didnt sleep for two days and then only slept because I drank myself to sleep. I had chills, sweating, auditory hallucinations, nausea and a terrible crawling sensation in my spine that would not go away. I ended up going to the ER for relief. They thought I was nuts and gave me Haldol which only made it worse. </p><p>I have experienced withdrawal from Hydrocodone and other opiates before and it is a drop in the bucket compared with Tramadol withdrawal. I cant believe any health care professional would think that this drug is less addictive than traditional opiates. I have tried to stop this medication several times over the last 7 years and have been unsuccessful due to the severe withdrawal that for me has lasted as long as 15 days before I gave up and resumed taking Tramadol. Taking other opiate medication, such as Hydrocodone or morphine, really helps with the flu-like withdrawal symptoms but not the rest.</p><p>I am currently down to 25mg every 6 hours, but if I am late on taking that dose by even a few hours my withdrawal symptoms come back. I cant seem to get any lower than that. My doctor thinks I should stay on the drug at this point, but I really want off it. </p><p>I am also having low blood pressure problems and heart palpitations which I attribute to the long-term Tramadol use since there is absolutely no history of heart trouble like this in my family. </p><p>Just my opinion, but if you have a choice dont start with this drug. Too addictive, to many side effects, and not very well studied yet.</p>"
