I'll make this short as I am simply posting this report since there is scant information on the net about the combination of a strong opiate with a bit of MDMA.  <br><br>
I have never attempted a speedball, that is opiate+cocaine.  I don't have any love for coke and that sounds a bit dangerous to me!  Anyway, being the scientific experimenter that I am, I decided to go with two much more refined compounds:  Dilaudid (hydromorphone) and MDMA.<br><br>
The dilaudid was pure, not a pill.  Precisely 4 mg of this substance was dissolved in a bit of sterile saline and an unmeasured amount of mdma was added (approximately 20 mg, 1/5 of a 100mg dose as judged by the ole eyball).  This solution was injected IV.  Time = 0<br><br>
As compared to IV dilaudid, the mixture was a bit heavier in effect.  The rush was not as pleasant, it seemed.  My eyes were hard to keep open and dizziness was noted.  <br>
The rush was accompanied by an interesting tactile sensation.  This was very pronounced, as I had a bit of sunburn on my back from the beach the day before.  This sensation was not overly pleasant, pretty much neutral, and it did not last more than a few seconds.<br><br>
The dizziness was quite pronounced when walking around, but this was alleviated by a tiny bong-hit.  Pot usually messes up opiate highs, IMHO, but I wanted to get away from the dizziness and the MDMA made me want to smoke something (no cigarettes around).  The pot helped with the dizziness, Time = 15 minutes.<br><br>
I sat down for a moment to collect myself.  My eyes were doing mild jittering, common with E.  Overall, I didnt really feel all that lit up.  I decided to have a bit more dilaudid since the 4mg dose was a light dose for fear of what might happen.  3 mg more dilaudid was injected sub-cutaneously (under the skin).  T=25 min<br><br>
The extra dilaudid was exactly what I needed.  The effects picked up dramatically and I felt great.  I felt good enough to CLEAN the kitchen!   Very alert buzz with a little bit of eye jumping, but not too much.  At this point it felt mainly like a dilaudid high, with maybe a bit of stimulation to go along with it.  Movements with my arms and such feel a bit robotic and fine motorskills seemed a bit reduced.  T=1hour  <br><br>
Was it worth it?  Not really, I guess.  Dilaudid by itself is pretty much the rolls-royce of opiates.    It crosses my eyes badly enough by itself, and it seemed like the MDMA just made this worse.  I can do without eye crossing, personally, so that aspect wasnt too great.  Should I have taken more MDMA?  I dont really know.  The first 15 minutes just felt like intoxication more than a high.  I wont do this again, not really that great.<br><br>
----------------------<br>
On a side note, I did witness a friend of mine eat 150 mg of MDMA after dosing dilaudid about 30 minutes prior.  He said it was fantastic as the MDMA hit, but it didnt last long and he was left feeling drained and plastered to the couch.  This guy doesnt really get the social aspect of MDMA and usually hates the stuff, but the combination took away all the discomfort and left him in a good place.<!-- End Body -->
