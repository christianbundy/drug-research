The first time I tried datura was in Isreal, where it's pretty common ( it's also pretty common in Southern Africa, where I come from. Malpitte is Afrikaans for mad seeds, in case anybody's interested.)<br><br>
There where three of us and we each took about two heaped teaspoons of raw mature seeds. The seeds go red when they mature and turn a reddish brown  if you dry them out. We tried the seeds a few times after that and found the mature ones to give the best (well strongest anyway) effect.<br><br>
The first thing I noticed was that my mouth was really dry and had a really bad taste. After about a half an hour I could feel that I was really starting to trip. It was the last coherent thought I had for fifteen hours.<br>
During the trip I had very little control over my mind or my body. It was like I was awake and acting out my dreams.  Most of what I remember about the trip was pieced together when I finally came down. I don't really remember any chronological order for the events that took place. To this day all I remember are flashes of really wierd hullucinations.<br><br>
We had taken the seeds at about ten in the evening. The three of us where staying on a construction site that we were working on, so we had the place to ourselves. There where two girls staying with us at the time who baby-sat us for the evening, if it wasn't for them I think someone (probably me) could have got really hurt. Here's a tip, don't take these things in a half completed building with lots of sharp objects and power tools lying around.<br><br>
After an hour I must have got really hot, because I took all my clothes off, by this time I was apparantly incapable of of saying anything. Gillian told me afterwards that every time I tried to say somethin I would just mumble a few incoherent words. Then I would get upset and concentrate on what I was trying to say. As soon as I opened my mouth to try again the same thing would happen. I remember feeling very frustrated that I could not communicate with the outside world. I also remember almost breaking out in tears because I really felt like I had to take a piss but nothing would come out, my bladder felt uncomfortable the entire evening.<br><br>
Like I said I don't remember the whole trip, I was told the next day that I once I was naked I got down on my hands and knees and started pushing one of those big garbage cans around with my nose. I do remember people speaking to me and not being able to see them. I could see the rest of my surroundings perfectly. If someone was standing directly in front of me I could see right through them, it's difficult to explain but I could see object that people where standing in front of, but I couldn't see them.. Gillian told me later that at one stage she was speaking to me and I kept looking around to see where she was. <br><br>
The most pleasant part of the trip was the next morning. I woke up in bed (I don't know if I had slept or not.) I couldn't remember anything from the night before. I sat up and started reading a book, after a few pages I realised that there was no book there. For about two hours I had the most incredibly realistic hullucinations, reading books, having conversations with old friends that were on the other side of the world, and reading a huge three dimensional animated novel that appeared on the wall. I didn't remember even taking anything the night before and occasionally I would snap back into reality and think I had gone mad. Then another hullicination would begin and I'd get sucked back into the madness. The state I was in differed from the night before in that I was more in control of my concious functions and I can remember the hullucinations and the time frame clearly.<br><br>
Eventually I fell asleep again and when I woke up I was down. I felt terrible for about two days my mouth was dry and i felt like someone had shat in it, my stomach felt like there was lead in it and I couldn't focus my eyes until the next day. One thing we did notice on subsequent trips was that even people who had stopped smoking up to a year before would think they where busy smoking a cigarette, suddenly they would realise it wasn't there and start hunting for it on the floor as though they'd dropped it. I don't know if that's worth mentioning, but I thought it was pretty interesting.<!-- End Body -->
