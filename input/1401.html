Wow this is a fun fun drug......while the high lasts.  I am doing it for the 5th time, but its the first time i bought it and am doing it alone.  I was really just sick of every other drug and i said Peter <thats me> 'go get a ball' so i did.  Its not that i need to do drugs alot i just need them when i am really stresed.  This is my first drug use in like 3 months and its fun, but damn it, damn it, damn it, all you want is some more.  The stuff i bought isnt the best but then again it was pretty cheap. It feels like there is speed in it so its working pretty well.<br><br>
i just really really needed to write that i cant be doing this again for a good 3 months, cause its way to expensive and my nose is killing me.  I just want to be able to read this when i am fiending tomorrow when i run out.  For all the people out there that cant stop, i see your pain, this stuff is nuts, but just try to make it out alive.<!-- End Body -->
