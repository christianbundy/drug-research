 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have recently bought 2-AI from an online vendor. After purchasing I read some fairly negative reports on it so felt a little disappointed in anticipation. Thankfully the reports appear to be unduly unappreciative.\r\nI have found it to be effective, enjoyable and economical. The first gram was shared between four friends over two occasions. Each had three lines at each session (30 lines from a gram!) We were all also drinking beer and playing cards. We insufflated the 2-AI which is fairly painful, but far from unbearable. The initial effects consist of euphoria, loquacity and  a pleasant warm body load, a little like mdma. This lasts for about half an hour or so then tapers off un-noticeably. Doubling the size of a line made the somatic feelings very pleasant but very intense with a corresponding warm sluggishness of mind. Strangely, this two high dose pushed me over into a dreamy almost opiate reverie, I then drifted off to sleep. So, no problems with insomnia! I think it improved my card playing, but it's hard to tell - I am pretty good.\r\nNo significant hang-over the following day. Nostril uncomfortable. Amongst the reports I read, certain addled old junkies sagely recommended shooting it up or administering it via enema.  I'm sure they're right, but it might result in a slightly strained atmosphere around the card table.\n\n\n"
