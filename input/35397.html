I had visited a supermarket and bought 0.49lbs of chocolate-covered espresso beans. I really like espresso, but had never eaten just beans before. I drink coffee on a regular basis, and didn't really think about how much caffeine was contained in the espresso beans.<br><br>
Anyway, I got home that night after spending the day with my girlfriend and had a computer programming project I wanted to get a head-start on. I ate about 4/5 of the bag of espresso beans in a period of approximately 10 minutes. I first felt the effects about 25-30 minutes after I first started eating the beans; however, the super-awakedness quickly progressed into a headache like nothing I've experienced before. Within ten minutes of the headache first hitting me, I was on the ground on the brink of screaming because of the pain. I got myself together and took two tylenol, which wound up having no effect at all. About an hour and a half after I took the tylenol, I fell asleep. There was not a period where I began to get sleepy or anything, I just fell asleep.<br><br>
I woke up fourteen hours later with a minor headache still.<br><br>
So much for getting ahead on the project.<!-- End Body -->
