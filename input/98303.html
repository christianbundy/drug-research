I quit smoking cannabis quite a while back, a professional precaution.  When I did, though, I like most started with commercial brick, and worked up to 'kind' or the best local homegrown.  Lately, I've been experimenting with herbal potpourri.  I was fortunate enough to try the ol' trainwreck by haze.  Awsome 018 blend.  Last year I tried quite a few different blends.  As I travel for work, I get the chance to try alot of different brands and mixes.  I purchased a 3g package of Gorilla Dro about a month ago.  Figuring it to be nothing more than a 'weak' substitute, I made the mistake of taking a small sample puff on the drive home.  Fortunately I was only 3 blocks from my motel room.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.

I inhaled a small amount through a brand new unit, and then, like a ton of bricks it kicked in.  I couldn't feel my feet.  Hard to drive when you can't find your feet.  Panic onset like a real 'physical' heart attack.  It seemed to take a half hour to drive those three blocks.  When I somehow managed to park my pickup, I was stuck.  I couldn't put the vehicle in park, and my foot on the brake was all that was keeping the vehicle from moving.  I sat in my truck for what must have been 20 minutes or more, almost in a commatose state with my mind wandering different planes of existance.  <br><br>
Suddenly I began to realize that I was regaining my basic motor skills.  I put the vehicle in park, and stumbled to my room.  For the next 5-7 uses, the effects would be very similar.  An extremely powerful high, almost able to disconnect the brain from the physical body.  Keep in mind these effects are being reported from a completely clean individual.  I do drink every day, but nothing illegal goes into my body.  I hadn't had any other potpourris's for quite a while... perhaps 4-5 mos.  <br><br>
I can't imagine being an inexperienced smoker and being introduced to this product inproperly.  I have shared with others, but always let them know what they may experience, and I stick around to help guide them if they request help.  Not for the casual user, certainly not for anyone under 21.  Now that I've smoked around 6 grams over a couple months, the effects are much milder.  The tolerance took me about a month to develop, and the trippy times were intense up until then.<!-- End Body -->
