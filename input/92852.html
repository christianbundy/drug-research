I took a 500mg Rhodiola pill in the morning. An hour or two later I began taking my Adderall prescription, which usually climbs slowly to about 40mg while I'm studying. <br><br>
The effects were drastic. My appetite disappeared, which was never an issue after 4+ years with an Adderall prescription. My brain felt like it was going to explode. Physical side effects like nail-biting and twitchiness seemed more acute than usual. I was unable to focus because I felt so tweaked. <br><br>
This was the second time I mixed the two. The first time I mixed them right before bed and didn't fall asleep until 6am. The only reason that I tried again is that I didn't realize how strongly they interacted. <br><br>
Further research revealed that Rhodiola inhibits the neurotransmitters that Adderall overproduces. So, even though my experience was a bad one, others might find Rhodiola useful if they want to enhance the effects of Adderall. But I suggest you experiment cautiously.<!-- End Body -->
