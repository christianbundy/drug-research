I have  for quite a while had a problem with anxiety. Namely social anxiety. I have realized that the most logical cause of this is GABA deficiency. I have a history of using Xanax considering it is the only thing that wipes out the anxiety for me. Even alcohol has only had minimum effects.<br><br>
So being no longer able to find Xanax I searched for a more accessible substitute. I have found many reports praising Phenibut as being a great supplement for anxiety so I tried it. By it's self it does very little for me. I used as much as 2000 mg at a time with no noticeable results. I tried taking it with Theanine, the amino acid found in Tea, and it helped some but not enough.<br><br>
Then I mixed it with alcohol without even thinking about it because the Phenibut wasn't all that noticeable in the first place. I generally have a moderate tolerance for alcohol. It takes about 4 beers for me to get a buzz and 7 to get drunk. But after taking Phenibut and Theanine and drinking just one beer I felt a nice buzz like I had already had 3 beers. I drank 3 beers and I felt drunk. But not just drunk, relaxed, calm, talkative and euphoric, all feelings I don't normally get even with alcohol. And I still felt a relative amount of awareness and concentration unlike with just alcohol. It felt as good as a 2mg bar of Xanax. So in conclusion Phenibut by itself does very little (in my opinion) but mixed with alcohol it produces a feeling that I rarely get and a feeling comparable to my favorite drug, Xanax.<!-- End Body -->
