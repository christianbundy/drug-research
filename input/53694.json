 "report": "\n\n\n\nI have used Remeron a lot to help me sleep. It helps some with depression although I found that meditating and praying to God helped my depression more.\r\nAnyways, here is what I have experienced on remeron.\r\nFirst of all crazy dreams, very intense and vivid.\r\nSome cravings for sweets when on it, it makes me hungry sometimes.\r\nWhen I started taking it the remeron makes me sleep for like 24 hours straight.\n\n\n"
