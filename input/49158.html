I bought some damiana from a local herb store. It was cheap, about 1.40 for an oz. Bought it just cause I heard about it, wasn't expecting much. I first tried smoking it in a pipe, it didn't smoke to horribly. Didn't really have any effect. I tried smoking more of it through this pipe 4 more times without much luck. Finally I decided to just go all out with it to make sure if it had any effect and a smoked a large hookah bowls worth. Which equated to a good, full, thick 10-20 hits. <br><br>
I'm not going to say there are no effects, but it's definanetly so light for how much I smoked that it's not really worth smoking by itself. I am ever so slightly calm and relaxed, which I do not believe is placebo. But it's not even on par with a single cigarrette in how much you get from it.<br><br>
Maybe I got bad damiana, the damiana I got was very dried and did have stems in it, so maybe it wasnt intended for smoking. Maybe it needs another herb to fully bring out the effect, I dunno. I don't fully disvalidate damiana as a smokable substance, but if I do get a hankering to try it again, I'll try to find a better retailer for it, cause just cheap dried damiana from a plain herb shop isn't really worth it smoked by itself.<!-- End Body -->
