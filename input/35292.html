I had been originally planning my nutmeg experience to begin in the morning around 9:00 a.m. but was unable to begin until about 1:00 p.m. the same day. I prepared for this experience by the method I have tried and found to be a universal preparation for psychoactive substances. Fasting - 3 days for something new and potentially strong, 1-3 days for anything less.  For this experience I fasted for 2 days, praying, meditating, and removing the mental barrier that holds us all back every day in our mundane lives.  As with most experiences I use cannabis as a measurable stimulant throughout the experience.  Cannabis has a positive effect in every experience I have partaken in.  <br><br>
10:00 a.m. Smoked Cannabis and a little cigar, meditated and prayed, listened to some mentally positive music.<br><br>
1:00 p.m.  Ingested 9 grams of store bought nutmeg powder.  I measured the dose by teaspoons.  9 grams is about half of the recommended dose for my body weight.  I chose to consume only half the recommended dose so I could more accurately account for the effects introduced by the nutmeg.  Various methods have been employed as to reduce the feared 'awful' taste of nutmeg ranging from teas, slushies and just shoving spoonfuls in your mouth.  I chose to consume the nutmeg the same way I take pills.  I measured out 1 teaspoon of nutmeg; I took some orange juice in my mouth and tilted my head back.  Just as I would drop a pill in my mouth and swallow it with the water all in one swallow, having the pill not come in contact with the forepart of the tongue, I dropped the teaspoon of nutmeg into my mouth.  Head titled back with the juice, I could not taste the nutmeg at all.  I swallowed it all down; a faint taste of nutmeg could be tasted but nothing that would constitute a negative taste reaction.  I continued in this fashion until all 3 teaspoons were taken.  After consuming the nutmeg in this fashion the remaining taste was minimal and not at all unpleasant.  I drank the rest of my orange juice and the flavor of nutmeg was gone.  The whole process of consuming took no more than 2 minutes.<br><br>
2:00 p.m. Minor effects were noticeable and comparable to those felt on my previous P. Cubensis experience.  A heightened sense of being and clarity gave me reason to suspect the nutmeg was beginning to take effect.  I smoked some more cannabis and continued to meditate with some music.  Unsure as to the effects of nutmeg on my body I contemplated consuming another couple of grams and maybe up to another 9 bringing me to the recommended dose but decided to wait.<br><br>
4:00 p.m. Meditation breaks through into 'the vibration'.  Subtle and Gentle were the effects throughout the experience.  In 'The Vibration I encountered many things as I did in that state with P. Cubensis.  Relaxed and centered I smoke some more cannabis and some more tobacco.  Effects were heightened by the intake of these two.  The cannabis had a broad heightening effect as it elevated every feeling, whereas the tobacco was more short term.  Throughout the day I continued my experience by smoking more cannabis and some more tobacco as I felt the desire to.  Listening to music in privacy and peace while sitting outside for the majority of the experience I enjoyed the nice weather and a cool breeze. <br><br>
7:00 p.m. Made something to eat and enjoyed it.<br><br>
11:00 p.m. Preparing for bed and feeling ready to sleep I have not felt any negative effects throughout the day and continue to feel positive and pleasant.  I go to sleep and sleep fine.<br><br>
NEXT DAY<br><br>
8:00 a.m.  Awake, feeling pleasant and calm.  'The Vibration' is no longer felt but remains of the initial onset from the first hour or so of the previous day continue to be felt in a pleasant manner.  Feelings that I would relate to a minor cannabis effect, subtle and pleasant.  The rest of the second day passed in the same state.  I went about my day as I always do unimpeded by any kind of negative after effect.  <br><br>
FOLLOWING DAY<br><br>
8:00 a.m.  Awakening from a dream, remembering my dream, laughing out loud at the nonsense I was dreaming about I noted the ability to remember my dream with clarity.  For the past few years I have not been able to remember my dreams.  I normally pass the night in sleep, awakening into the new day with nothing hanging in my mind from a dream and normally feeling like I did not dream at all.  This day I could vividly remember my entire dream which seemed like it went on for a long time and covered a lot of ground, places, people and activities.  Interesting.  A pleasant after effect that remains with me.  <br><br>
Conclusion:  I have found nutmeg to suit me just fine and I plan on another experience with the recommended dose to follow here in just a few weeks.  Consumed like a pill I never had a moment of nausea, headaches or any kind of negative effect.  I would recommend proper preparation for any experience and encourage those who have thought about nutmeg to give it a try.  I hope this report shines a little light on one of our little known and widely misunderstood friend in nature, Nutmeg.<!-- End Body -->
