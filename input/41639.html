Well I am addicted I guess.  I know that weed isn't addictive but something has got to be going on.  I started smoking in 2002 that's over 3 years ago.  It first started out like many other people, I would smoke once a week on the weekends.  I would NEVER smoke during the week or before work.  I would also not tell many people that I was smoking.  I would smoke with my sister and my cousin (they were already a year into their addiction and smoked every day).  Weed was like the antidote for crap in my life.  I never got along with my family and for once I was hanging out with them (at my grandmother's house which is where we smoked it).  I have had insomnia since I was about fifteen and suddenly I could sleep!  Let me tell you, that was the number one reason I continued to smoke, sleep is worth almost anything to a hardcore insomniac.  Soon I began smoking more and hanging out more.  Then I got a car and it made getting back and forth to my grandma's and work and school was that much easier.  I began smoking more and more and driving home at 5:30 in the morning so my grandmother wouldn't know we were up all night smoking weed.  It's like time passes so fast and slow all at the same time and I really enjoy the company.<br><br>
In those early days, we would enjoy being high so much and hanging out with each other getting high was everyone's first choice.  I began to ignore my other friends and just exclusively hang out with my sister and cousin.  I felt like I was on top of the world but I was becoming a bit anti-social.  I realized this one day on November 18, 2002 and decided that I was going to quit smoking weed and cigarettes and get it together.  That all went to crap when I got home and the Arizona Police were on the phone telling me that my father died and I just crashed.  I don't think I have ever been that high that long in my life.  I was pretty much high every day (with the exception of my father's funeral) until August 2003.  I wasn't quite strung out but my life was vastly different and I couldn't figure out how I got there and I wasn't sure if weed was the reason, a factor, or had nothing to do with it at all (I'm honestly still not sure).  I had two friends, one sort of friends, my sister and my cousin.  I was stuck in the same job that was going no where and I had dropped out of school.<br><br>
I decided that I was going to stop for a week and see how it felt.  But the thing was, I had no social life outside of going to work and smoking with my sister and cousin (and various people we smoked out-I was the nicest person if we were going to share sacks).  so while they were smoking, I would sit outside and cry because I couldn't be in there while they smoked (I would have smoked too), and I was very emotional from the withdrawal.  It was a very low period for me.  But after only a week I cracked mostly because I couldn't sleep and I desperately needed to sleep.  My life was empty and if I couldn't sleep then I wasn't sure what I would do.  I even thought of suicide.  What really gets me is that it was such a big deal to stop but as soon as I decided to start again, that was it.  I just started like it was nothing.  At this point I was living at my grandmother's but I was about to move into my friends house in January of 2004 so I could go to school and (so my friend thought) kick the weed habit for good.<br><br>
But it didn't matter I continued to smoke and actually it helped me in school.  I really don't know if the difference was weed or my outlook on life but whatever it was, it worked.  I love smoking before class.  I've just recently started smoking weed before class on the campus.  I was a little wary but actually it's wonderful.  It makes me talk more (I'm horrifically shy to the point of social retardation) and I actually hit on this guy that I really like recently because of smoking a blunt before class.  I know I make weed sound bad, but the truth of it is I love smoking.  That's the only reason I continue right?  I mean I think back to the hardest of times and when I had nothing but weed.  It's almost like an old friend that I could never leave behind even if it has done bad for me on the occasion.  It made me calmer, I get along better with people, I lose those crappy inhibitions and MOST OF ALL I SLEEP.  Sleeping is like the best thing in the world.  Bad stuff are the munchies (I've gained a lot of weight) and the laziness that sometimes accompanies weed smoking, it's illegal (which is really the worst part of it), now that everyone knows that I smoke they're always asking if I'm high whenever I mess up or don't understand them.<br><br>
It gets very annoying.  But over all I love it and can't imagine going more than two days without it.  That's sad but not to me.  I wonder if it's weed that makes me not care or the fact that I love it so much.<br><br>
