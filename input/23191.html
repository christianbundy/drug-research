I purchased about 100mg of 99+% pure 5-MeO-DMT from the internet. Having tried home-extracted DMT (a very spiritual experience) in the past I heard they would have similar effects and was very excited. At first I tried lining the base of a cheap cannabis pipe with aluminum foil, placing in about 5mg, and holding the flame above it, but I couldn't get the smoke into my lungs, so I removed the foil and tried again. I managed to liquefy the powder, but it seemed to run up the sides of the pipe (heat-resistant?), so I ended up with a lungful of marijuana resin smoke.<br><br>
Later I tried heating it in a test-tube (smoke stayed at the bottom and was impossible to suck out).<br><br>
I finally got my first effects with about 10mg in a metal spoon. I heated it and managed to vaporize it but didn't suck in the smoke until it was too late. I felt some threshold 'weirdness' effects but had absolutely no visuals and felt like puking. I tried 2 more times with varying amounts and the metal spoon method before I gave up and was left with about 30mg or so of powder.<br><br>
I decided to give up on the smoking method. I insufflated about 10mg of the powder. I had minor nasal burn but not nearly as bad as I expected. It came on to me very slowly, yet quickly... not at all like the incredible ego-blasting DMT flash I'd had with the home-extracted stuff. I felt sick and weird for a while. I had trouble walking but the mere fact I *could* walk shows the weakness of the 'trip.' There was minor distortion, but NO 'visuals,' 'trails,' or patterns.<br><br>
Overall: Not an experience that was bad, but definitely not worth repeating. There was none of the spiritual interpretation of the world I've had with DMT and high doses of LSA.<!-- End Body -->
