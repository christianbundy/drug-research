 "report": "<p>It was about 8:00p.m  and I was bored so I decided to see what gingko biloba could do to me if I took a high dosage.  I went to my medicine cabinet and found a box of pills of gingko biloba.  They were 100mg pills. I took 10 of them, wanting to see if I could get an effect.  All that happened was that I felt a little more energetic and was more clear minded.  I went to sleep then.</p><p>I woke up in the morning, got ready for school, and so on.  I had weight- lifting this morning.  During lifting I felt a little less tired then I usually am.  Nothing more happened through the day.  One thing that I noticed was that my memory was quite well.</p>"
