I would like to convey my overall impressions of using Salvia Divinorum as an aid in meditation.<br><br>
My ideal setting is in a darkened calm environment, sitting cross legged or reclining in a chair.<br><br>
My preferred method is to drip some salvia tincture onto salvia 5x extract, and wait for the plant to be almost dry, still just a bit humid. I then load a smoking pipe with it, and bring the lighter  close enough to burn off the humidity and light some of the plant. This is the first toke, and it is just a wisp of smoke. I may stop there... if I do second or third inhalations, they are deeper, more thorough torchings of the plant material.<br><br>
The state that usually envelops me is a calm mentholated tingling that seems to cloak my body with a downward pressure or heaviness. I find that taking an enriched 5x extract as opposed to a 10x extract gives the experience a pleasant light feel, something that I am more likely to be able to understand and flow with. I sometimes feel that  doing deep breathing will allow me to absorb and be more powerfully saturated by the mentholated energy. Occasionally, I have felt like the Salvia plant was showing me how to manipulate the shape of my spirit body: in one experience I may sense myself rolling up like a Persian carpet, during another my being may seem to unfold outwards like a wing.<br><br>
I call this meditation, because my focus is directed in a way that reminds me of the one pointed consciousness of certain practices, and because I often stay still in a meditative altered state well beyond the initial effects have faded. It also feels reverential and spiritual, but not in a dogmatic or heavy way. Approaching the Salvia respectfully yet lightheartedly, using small doses, seems to be the most fruitful method for me.<!-- End Body -->
