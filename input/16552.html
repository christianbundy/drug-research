Unlike the other 99.9% of people who have experimented with dimenhydrinate, or drama-drama-dramamine, as one other psychonaut so aptly put it, I did not experiment with this substance due to a lack of other mind-altering drugs. My desire to muck around with motion-sickness pills came out of people telling me how much it enhances music, and being a musician this interested me. Also being retarded, I assumed it would enhance my already 1337 muzikal skillz to the point of super 1337ness, or something.<br><br>
Anyway I'm going to come straight out and say I'm a pothead, and I have had some mild experience with psychadelics and other drugs. Tripped on shrooms many times, and have also run into salvia once or twice.<br><br>
The first time, I took 12 pills of the straight up regular dramamine, which would be 600 mg for those of you who aren't mathematically inclined. I exprenced no buildup of anticipation or any side-effects prior to the 'trip' part of the non-trip. I spent most of the time in front of the computer working on music, as well. About two hours after ingesting said pills, I noticed something was amiss: looking down in my darkened room, my pants seemed to be spiking in small bunches and moving around haphazardly. 'This is neato', I thought. I brought my leg up and the hallucinations stopped as soon as it was exposed to the light of my computer monitor. I stuck my hand back into the shadow, and lo-and-behold it appeared to be bubbling. I also heard my neighbors kids calling my name very distantly from outside at random intervals, and I knew this was the drug because I was in my room, at night, with my air conditioning on and I haven't talked to my neighbors in about a year. Being a big fan of childhood nostalgia, I also thought this was neato.<br><br>
The effects subsided very quickly and I got up and went to sleep on my bed. Incidentally, I noticed no other auditory hallucinations or enhancement of music. When I awoke the next morning, I did some retrospective pondering and decided the 'trip' was pretty much pointless, and that I would try it again at a larger dose.<br><br>
I took 900 mg (or 18 pills) two weeks later. This time, the effects were brought on in an hour. I experienced heavy body load and dizzyness, like being drunk except 100% less fun and about 75% annoying as fuck. I experienced very little other than basically feeling like crap. Some pants movement again, but not to the degree as my previous trip. Incidentally, I'm hesitant to use the word 'trip' as there was nothing particulary trippy about it. fFor the most part I was confused, disoriented and remember thinking some very odd and unpleasant thoughts.<br><br>
Four hours after ingestion I found myself laying on my bed, trying to get to sleep due to being ridiculously tired. This was impossible, because every time I tried to keep still in one position I could feel a horribly uncomfortable body buzz building up and taking over me. The only way to alleviate this was to shift position roughly every three seconds. I was reduced to smoking a few bowls to kill the aftereffects before passing out and sleeping for twelve hours. When I awoke the next morning, my memory for the previous night was pretty much non-existant. However, I do remember NOT experiencing realistic delusions as many others have reported, and very little auditory effects even compared with minor effects I had on my previous experience.<br><br>
Prognosis: Negative. Dimenhydrinate is a stupid, pointless, unfun drug. Any threshold effects were so subtle it couldn't be classified as a trip, and at higher doses the physical effects become so uncomfortable they drowned out the hallucinations in a vat of grease, blood and melted baby fat. The only positive thing I gleaned from the whole experience is that I can share it with other people, and maybe prevent someone else from trying it out.<!-- End Body -->
