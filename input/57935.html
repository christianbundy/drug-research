So I'm big on xanax. Bars are just awesome. Im not prescribed to them so I end up paying a lot of money per bar (about 5 bucks) but it's worth it because they're just amazing. Floating, comfortable in any position, horny and happy. It's amazing. So I took a bar one night as I had been drinking. Now normally I like to mix pills and alcohol, especially xanax and alcohol, but tonight my friend came by with a bunch of nice blow. We tried it out and me and my friends each got a bag.<br><br>
So 5 lines into it, I notice the xanax has completely worn off and Im back on my paranoid cocaine feeling that I always get when I do it. No matter how much alcohol I drink, Im just irritated and paranoid and needing more all night long. So Im practically sober at this point except obviously Im not, but in my head all I think is depressing and anxious thoughts, which the xanax had originally reduced tremendously. <br><br>
Anyway, I continued doing my bag because it was there and just got even hornier. Eventually all I wanted was to have sex and smoke some weed. I took out my bong and we smoked a few packs. That was excellent. Everything I was experiencing sort of came rushing back but it was all blurred behind a cannabis haze. So I was horny and happy and still anxious but in a good docile way and I wasnt really thinking paranoid things but more like disconnecting from everything for a while. Then I got my much deserved sex and passed on out. Of course I get hazy in the morning as to what the hell happened the previous night but thats expected with xanax taken by itself. So yeah. Great night.<!-- End Body -->
