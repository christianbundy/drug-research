I used GBL constantly for over a year.I panicked when I didn't have a full bottle in my pocket. One day I ran out for 12 hours. A few hours longer and I would have killed myself.<br><br>
My tolerance was unbelievable. Towards the last month, I would sleep for 1/2 hour a night and only by doubling my dose. I knew that soon, the next overdose would be my last. So, I went to the only place I could for help--my parents. They told me I looked like a corpse when I got off the plane.<br><br>
I thought I could slowly taper off and fill-in with Xanex. My parents where totally clueless on what I was going through.  My Mom made me a tapering schedule. I couldn't do it. I finally told my Mom to throw it away and take me to the emergency room if it got too bad. From that point on, I don't remember the next 3 weeks of my life.<br><br>
My dear, wonderful mother sat beside for 3 weeks as I cried almost non-stop and hallucinated.  Xanex helps, but beware of it. There is no amount of Xanex that will make the withdrawal easy (and I had a lot of it). When I finally came around, I ran out of Xanex and could not get more. The Xanex addiction was just as bad as the GBL withdrawal.<br><br>
Mine was an extreme case.I don't want to scare you. But I started using it 'once in a while' and it turned into the only thing in my life.<!-- End Body -->
