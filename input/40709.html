I recently moved from Illinois to California to be closer to my fiance of 2 years.  Long distance relationships are just too hard.  After arriving, we discussed possible employment and the best places for me to look for work.  After emailing and faxing many resumes, the phone calls finally started coming in, and I was offered a couple of good positions.  I am 28 years old and have not touched an illegal drug since high school, so it was to my surprise that after taking a pre-employment drug screen, I was told I tested positive for PCP.  'I've heard of it, but have never laid eyes on it.'  was my reaction.  So immediately the nurses pleasant attitude turns into the witch from hell.  By this time, she's looking at me as if I was the posterboy for High Time's February issue.<br><br>
After I leave the clinic, I rush home to my computer to do a search on PCP and why I might have tested positive for it.  So while searching, I found that the Nyquil and Comtrex (both have DXM) could be the cause.  Because prior to my test, I had been using the Nyquil and Comtrex about 2-3 times a day for the previous week because I was feeling under the weather.  So I guess my point is that I never realized such a thing could happen. My stupidity to over the counter medications has left me with a new understanding.  My only question is, why is it that everyone assumes the worst.<!-- End Body -->
