 "report": "<p>I have tried Vinpocetine on a few occasions.  I have tried both 5 mg and 10 mg doses.  I have tried it on an empty stomach, and with a meal.  Every time that I have taken it, I just haven't been able to grasp any positive effects.</p><p>I have heard that Vinpocetine is good at increasing blood flow to the brain, and that it can increase concentration.  I may feel the increase in blood flow, but it doesn't necessarily feel good to me.  When I take this it makes me feel dizzy, like I'm about to fall forward over myself.  This feeling is not overwhelming, but is somewhat constant.  </p><p>I have much experience with smart drugs/nutrients including Hydergine, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, DMAE, P. Choline, and daily dosages of Piracetam.  I enjoy all of them, except for DMAE.  Vinpocetine is not something I will continue to take.</p>"
