 "report": "<p>(4-Methylmethcathinone is referred to as mephedrone in the review)</p><p>1. Prologue - How I came into contact with drugs.</p><p>When I moved to another town to study, I got my own apartment, and so did a close friend of mine, E. We were both 19 years old and we enjoyed the new-found freedom of living alone. I felt more like a grown up, doing all necessary tasks that had been done for me by someone else earlier. I liked the freedom of living alone, no one telling me what to do.</p><p>I quickly gained many new friends in my new town and it didnt take long until me and my friend E heard of mephedrone. It didnt take many hours for my friend E to order 2 g to try it out. A couple of days later the shipment had arrived and my friend told me to come on over to his place.</p><p>About half an hour later, I was outside his apartment and rang the doorbell. He invited me into his tiny one-room apartment and the first thing that caught my eye was a CD-case with white powder on top of it. He told me he had already tried it the previous day, and that it was great. When I think back at this (Im amazed he controlled himself and didnt re dose now that Ive experienced the feeling myself.)</p><p>I sat down at a chair next to my friend as he tried to, as carefully as possible, divide it into smaller piles. My friend started by insufflating 125 mg and I chose the same amount as he. When I insufflated it I felt a quite sharp pain in my nose that got me worried, but my friend told me it was supposed to hurt a bit. So far so good, my first time with a central nervous system stimulant. It felt kinda cool and forbidden to insufflate the white powder I must admit. E placed the remaining mephedrone aside, and we both relaxed while browsing the internet, mostly being quiet and laughing at funny videos.</p><p>2. Onset - Things are starting to happen (T+10)</p><p>My head is starting to feel empty and light, as if someone suddenly removed my brain. I also feel very light, alert and pleased with life. It felt as if I had nothing to worry about. The most prominent thing I felt though, was a sudden and strong urge to talk. I didnt know what to say though because my brain was constantly generating new ideas and I forgot the old ones very quickly. </p><p>When I finally managed to decide what I wanted to talk about, I opened my mouth and began to speak. In the middle of my sentence my mind went completely blank and I forgot what I wanted to tell him. My short term memory was severely impaired and I feared that it would continue after the high too. I told my friend about my problem and he told me he experienced the  same thing the day before and that his memory was back to normal today. I felt relieved and relaxed again. </p><p>Somehow, we started talking about girls, mainly famous ones. This is when time started to rush by faster than I had ever felt before. I was having the time of my life, doing something as simple as just talking to a close childhood friend. Somewhere in this conversation we both felt the effects diminish and we decided to take an additional 250 mg each, this time orally. The need to re dose was very, very strong, nothing like Id ever experienced before. We both swallowed it all in a piece of toilet paper and continued our conversation about girls. None of us had eaten anything at all for more than 12 hours at this point.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, I started to feel the rush from before, but more subtle this time. After fifteen more minutes things were really starting to happen. I feel all the feelings from earlier, except this time it felt like they had been multiplied numerous times. Our conversation changes from girls to sex. Im usually uncomfortable talking about my private life to anyone, but now it just felt right and easy to talk about. We started talking about when we lost our virginity and to whom we did, best blow job and so on. It was nice to get to know more about a childhood friend, his thoughts and feelings. I even dare to say that after this experience with mephedrone, we have a closer relationship than before. Furthermore, I feel that I can trust him with anything and I feel comfortable speaking my mind to him.</p><p>About an hour after the latest refill dose, I feel that I can no longer sit down. I simply CANT sit down, I just want to bounce between the walls of Es apartment. Ive got so much excess energy that its just silly, it feels as if I could supply the world with electricity for a year by only running in a hamster wheel for five minutes. I stand up and stretch my arms out so that it looks like Im nailed to a cross. E wonders what the hell I am doing, and I tell him I wanted to know for how long I can hold this position without getting tired. Well, I got tired of standing there, but I felt no effort at all to keep my arms up, I simply got bored. This feeling of next to limitless energy combined with the feeling of being extremely light was really awesome. It felt like I could jump like The Hulk with next to no effort. I didnt jump though, because we were inside and apparently its in the middle of the night at this point. If I would have tried to jump I would probably just be disappointed anyway, realizing that I actually have no Hulk-like qualities at all (that would be a too devastating blow).</p><p>3. Altered vision -   (T+5:00)</p><p>The second dose is starting to diminish in its effects, but it is barely noticeable. I instantly feel the need to use more. I tell E, but he says that we should wait until the latest dose has worn off completely. Some time later I feel no effects anymore and neither does he. We decide to ingest 250 mg each, wait for half an hour and then insufflate another 125 mg each. The thought to take it easy never crossed my mind, feeling good and Hulk-like was the only thing on my mind now.</p><p>When the full effect of the latest 375 mg are upon me, I start to feel weird. The feeling that my brain is gone is now more frightening than funny and pleasant. I decide to sit down and close my eyes (Id been standing up since my experiment with stretching my arms out. Sitting was just too relaxing for me). I talk to E as I try to relax, and after a few minutes I dont feel weird anymore. I thought to myself that it was probably the full effect of such a large dose that caught me by surprise. </p><p>I opened my eyes to check what E is doing but I cant focus on the monitor. I'm able to focus on everything else in the room though, but not on the screen. It didnt matter how close or far away from it I was, it was simply impossible for some reason.</p><p>The feeling of being unable to focus didnt worry me, since I could focus on all the other objects in his room with ease. I tried this focus exercise on objects close and far away. When I try to focus on one of his movie posters, I notice some sort of subtle hallucination. The picture shows 5 men standing next to each other, facing the 'cameraman'. I get the feeling that one character is floating in front of the others (Imagine putting 5 objects next to each other and then moving the middle one a bit forward. Then walk left and right and watch as it hides the other objects. I find this effect hard to describe, even though it is not complicated at all). I move myself to another angle to see if that is the case. It was. When I moved I saw the floating character hide the people on the left or right of him, depending on if I was looking at it from the left or right.</p><p>I tell E what I saw and he tells me that he, too, got hallucinations the first time he tried (one day earlier). He told me that the one of the characters at the poster had been spitting on him. I look away from the poster and I get back to the normal, but still high, me. We start talking again, still about the same subject (girls). Neither of us tired of it and we continued as before. We kept talking for many more hours and I felt better than before.</p><p>When we were done, Es bag of magic white powder was emptied and the sun was starting to rise. All in all, ten hours had gone by I had consumed a little less than 1 g of mephedrone. These ten hours felt like two hours, at most.</p><p>I said goodbye to my friend and walked home as quickly as possible, hoping to get some sleep before it was too late (I didnt want to sleep in all day and waking up at night because then I would have a hard time resetting to normal in time for school). I didnt get any sleep at all. I tried really hard but it was impossible. I also tried to eat some but I didnt like the taste of anything and found it hard to swallow. My clothes also smelled of mephedrone. I guess I sweated it out during the evening.</p><p>4. Summary and conclusion</p><p>Positive effects:</p><p>Euphoria, increased alertness, feeling of being light, increased social ability, increased energy</p><p>Neutral effects:</p><p>'Empty' head, hallucinations, unable to focus at a screen</p><p>Negative effects:</p><p>Severely impaired short term memory</p><p>Pros:           </p><p>Awesome when high</p><p>Cons:</p><p>Very addictive</p><p>Seems to have corrosive effects on certain materials</p><p>Not much research has been conducted, making it unreliable</p><p>General thoughts:</p><p>Overall it was a very pleasant experience, alot better than I had imagined it would be. After this I've almost lost complete interest in alcohol as a means of intoxication. It's now been several months since I drank myself to a stupor which I'm very happy with. I hope my occasional use of recreational drugs are less harmful than drinking every weekend as I used to. I've also tried other substances with similar effects (MDPV, 4-FMP), but so far they have all disappointed me when I compare them to mephedrone. </p><p>I had no idea something legal could be this powerful and addictive (At the time I'm writing this it's been made illegal). Neither me or E felt that we should stop, we simply kept going until there was nothing left. This is, according to me, the biggest danger with this drug; one doesn't seem to realize or even notice when one has crossed the line, until it's too late. Maybe we (Me and E) just have bad self control, but I dont think that's the case, since several reviews report that it indeed is highly addictive.</p><p>Another reason that might make one use this too often, is that the landing/comedown is very smooth and it's quite possible to feel fully refreshed after a good night's sleep. I would say the best thing that came out of this experience for me, is that I now treat all drugs with the utmost respect since Ive noticed how addictive some of them are, not to mention deadly. I'd say this was a pretty good 'starter drug' for me that opened my eyes.</p><p>At the time I'm writing this conclusion-part, I've gained more knowledge and experience about mephedrone. I decided to include this part mainly to help people who never have used a stimulating drug before (in this case mephedrone). I've read quite a lot about it and here I just summarized what I have learned. I hope someone will find it useful.</p><p>1. When you feel that you no longer get any effect, don't increase the doses, just stop. I would try to use it as infrequently as possible. When you do use it, be moderate, for your own sake. Otherwise you will have to deal with a lengthy period of longing for more.</p><p>2. Insufflating this drug will wear on your nostrils quite a bit. Don't stick with the same nostril (duh) and try to combine insufflating with another method of administration. I've found it painful to breathe through my nose in cold weather after using large amounts over a short period of time.</p><p>3. Don't use cards that are important to you while portioning (i.e. credit cards, driving license etc.). They will get damaged and stop working. If you get any on your skin, wash it away as fast as possible, just to be on the safe side.</p><p>4. Do NOT underestimate its addictiveness. Some find it worse than cocaine and/or amphetamine and the feeling that you need more of it may last for several weeks. If you can control this, chances are you can control most addictions. (I'd go so far as to call it an achievement when you've gained full control and can tell yourself to stop at any time.)</p><p>5. Start out with a small dose to see if you notice adverse effects. Always do this with any substance that is new to you.</p><p>6. Oral administration and a follow-up insufflation 20-30 minutes later really got me going.</p><p>7. This is a RC (Research Chemical) with very limited information about lethality, long term health aspects, dangerous combinations etc. I would not recommend using this substance at all if you are concerned about your health.</p><p>8. Buy chewing gum! If you start clenching your teeth (bruxism) you will probably curse yourself the next day for not buying it. Another thing I have found useful is putting up post-it's with different things that I might need to remember while I'm high. I usually put up a lot of 'DON'T..'-notes, in other words, notes that simply tell me what NOT to do while I'm at it. I tend to forget easily while I'm high.</p><p>9. And last, but not least, keep in mind that you might smell weird the day after using. If you want to avoid questions, shower as soon as possible. Depending on how much you use, you might also notice that your sweat smells differently several days after, at least I did. </p><p>Some have also reported red rashes that cause burning sensation. Maybe mephedrone causes these burns as it is perspired through the skin? Scrubbing and maintaining your hygiene extra carefully might also be a good thing to do after you've used.</p><p>Dont be naive like I was, legal does absolutely NOT equal safe. Mephedrone is the perfect example for this. Legal substances often have little or no research at all performed on them. Use caution and read a lot about it before you decide to try it out.</p>"
