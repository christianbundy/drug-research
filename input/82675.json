 "report": "<p>Trip Report</p><p>2C-T-2</p><p>9/12/09</p><p>20mg oral dose combined with 0.78g (all up) cannabis taken at noted intervals.</p><p>9:30pm</p><p>I mixed 10mg 2C-T-2 with a cup of cordial. I was very excited as this was the first time I had taken any psychedelics, so naturally I was hyped up a bit, and I had just smoked a joint minutes before, so was feeling relaxed at the same time. I drank the juice</p><p>10:00pm</p><p>Figuring it hadnt hit me yet I decided to take the other 10mg, with a half glass of water.  I didnt even taste the chemical in the slightest. I was still anxious to start my trip, so I decided to put a movie on, and smoke another joint.</p><p>~11:30pm</p><p>Finished the joint and had been watching movie on my laptop for a while after, sitting on my back deck. I didnt think it had hit me yet so I decided to go upstairs. I called my friend who was experienced with some psychs and we were just chatting, I told him about what I was feeling etc. I noted that I did feel slightly different, in the body. Not bad or good, just odd. I walked into my bedroom and thought, Ill dim the lights and see if the shadows start to move or something. As soon as I dimmed the lights and sat down I turned around and realized my wall was painted green. In actual fact my walls are blue.  I started laughing for about 5 minutes because it just didnt look right. Everything was in perfect focus except the color of the wall was wrong. </p><p>~12:00am</p><p>Still on the phone to my friend and he asks me to look at a photo of somebodys face and if it was warping. So far nothing had been warping, I was seeing some weird colors in the shadows and stuff but no warping. I looked at a photo of my friend and her face started to move, like I could see the muscles contracting in her face, shifting the look she had on it. Her smile was moving, and she was just staring at me, and it felt like we were in the same room. I thought Id have a ciggy now so I went downstairs and lay in the hammock on the back deck looking up at the night sky. </p><p>There was almost 100% cloud cover except for one black piece of night sky, it was beautiful. Then all of a sudden I realize my eyes were out of focus and I was looking at a tree, I started letting my eyes drift in and out of focus on purpose and watched as the tree just melted into the clouds and became the sky. It was amazing, I felt really great at this point all over my body and started rolling around in the hammock rubbing my hands up and down the strings feeling the soft fabric. </p><p>I got off the phone to my friend and put some music on. It sounded amazing, like I was at a private concert in a big hall, listening to the acoustics of the environment.  I decided to have another ciggy and then sat back in the hammock, this time facing the house, and there was this beautiful sun right above me, and I just stared into it for ages, it was changing colors rapidly and warping shape but then I realized it was the light bulb. I went back upstairs now to chill in my room.</p><p>~1:00am</p><p>I hopped onto my laptop and sat at my desk and decided to go on MSN and talk to people while I was tripping. For the past hour or so I'd been seeing some pretty cool visuals and felt physically great. Most of the time anything I saw that was dark, or shadowy, or really bright like the light bulb was changing colors. As I was chatting with people on MSN I realized I couldnt focus my eyes, everything was starting to warp on the screen and I couldnt  stop it like before when I just snapped my eyes back into focus. The white on the screen was starting to liquidize and move around a bit, while the letters in the chat box were melting, and stretching, and shrinking. It was just awesome to look at I was having the best time of my life so I just rolled with it for a while.</p><p>This is when I realized I was peaking</p><p>~1:45</p><p>I remembered something I had always wanted to try on hallucinogens. So I pulled out my Phone and opened up the application Galactica. Basically its a particle effect application where you touch the screen and it throws out color changing particles while playing some REALLY relaxing music. I lost myself in this for an unknown amount of time. As I was watching the particles flying around on the screen, I found myself immersed in a completely 3 dimensional experience. It felt like I was INSIDE the screen, in the middle of space, floating, watching the birth of a thousand universes all at once, at the touch of my finger. </p><p>After I snapped out of it, I looked up and realized I had tears in my eyes, as one rolled down my cheek I remarked at the unthinkable beauty I had just seen. I couldnt stop thinking about how amazing that experience was so I rolled another joint (which at this point was REMARKEBLY difficult) and went downstairs to smoke it. Sat n the back deck and lit up. About 5 minutes into this I realized all of a sudden my focus had abruptly come back completely and I had control over the hallucinations again. I felt much more sober now, almost as if I were just really high off cannabis (which is a daily occurrence for me) but still had the occasional color changing shadow or something. I had a bowl of cocopops to fill up my stomach and it was so tasty I had another.</p><p>2:30</p><p>I decided I was getting tired and the trip wasnt really that exciting any more so I went downstairs had one last ciggy and took my sleeping pills (9mg melatonin instant release capsules). I went and lay in bed, turned off the lights and tried to get some sleep. But all of a sudden with the lights off, my hallucinations started again.  I spent about 30 minutes trying to sleep with all these pretty colors and shapes in my vision. Then I decided to relieve myself and got to sleep just fine after that.</p><p>Overall I would say this was one of the top 5 most amazing experiences I have had in any way to do with anything. Looking back on it, I got basically NO side effects apart from a slight headache (and I stress the word slight, it was completely tolerable) which the weed took care of anyway.</p>"
