See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml">DXM Brand Warnings</a> for more info.] </font> <br><br>
This was proberbly the 10th time I tripped off of coricidin, the fourth time I used crack, and the hundredth time I smoked pot. Yet it was the first time I did the combination of all 3 drugs at the same time. I started off by taking 16 coricidin pills at a friends house at around 3pm. I was tripping at around 4pm I felt like I was walking on air and all colors I seen seemed intense and beautiful.<br><br>
At about 5:30pm me and the person I was taking the coricidin with were visited by a friend who just bought some crack and offered to smoke with us, we accepted. I had about 4 hits of crack. I was still tripping hard when I smoked the crack. The crack made everthing speed up when I was still tripping. The hardest I tried I couldn't focus on one thing.<br><br>
At around 8pm I felt tired and a little burnt out, so me and my friend rolled up a blunt of some pretty good weed and started to smoke. About 5 minutes after I finished smoking I felt my body go totally numb and my coricidin trip started to intensify to a level I never previously experienced. The weed must have also reinvigourated my crack high because I felt like time and space started to speed up. At about this time I started to panic for a short time because I thought I was going to overdose.<br><br>
I went outside to get some freash air and try to compose myself. By now it was pretty dark out and I started to stare at my friends house, the house started to change colors and shapes, I was in a dream like haze. I started to feel at rest. After about a half an hour my trip ended very suddenly at around 9pm and I fell right to sleep. This was the most intense drug induced spiritual experince of my life.<!-- End Body -->
