Yea. I've tripped on acid before and done some e, never ate any mushrooms or digested any other research chemicals.<br><br>
So I'm in school, trying to get some acid but here it's a real bitch to find (honestly, people pay like $8 a hit! It's insane). My buddy comes up to me, and asks me if I wanted to try something new. He explained he bought some chemical off the internet. I say 'sure, give it to me in the bathroom' he says 'don't even worry about it, they're just candy hearts.' he gives me two valentine's day candy hearts, tells me to eat em. The one side tastes kind of funny. Later he told me that he buys it in crystal form off the internet, dissolves it in alcohol and eventually drops it on the candy hearts himself. Tells me to get ready because it's gonna hit me right away.<br><br>
So I go into my 2nd period english class (9:20) and sit down. In about 15 minutes I start to feel like throwing up. Had I not been in class I would have just because it would've made me feel better. In an hour the nausea is gone. I head down to lunch. I'm feeling really nice. My body is tingling, I'm smiling, feel jolts of energy going up and down my entire body. Telling everybody how candy hearts are the best candy ever. I usually eat a salad at lunch but I couldn't finish it that day.<br><br>
So after lunch, I'm still feeling nice, I go to my ceramics class. I start to get really hot, sweating a lot, the dehydration made me think of e. Drank some water, noticed I was drinking too much and stopped. Had a lot of fun sculpting werid shit in ceramics, talked to some people who I had never spoken to before and had some good conversations. Was seeing some nice trails all over the place. Best part is no one had any fucking clue and I was tripping the fuck out. I go to my history class and take a test. Write a two page long essay for extra credit on pacifism. I turn in my paper and it's soaked in sweat. Ask one of my friends how my pupils are and he says he didn't notice anything. Had a conversation with the girl sitting next to me about catholic schools for about an hour, then I tell her I'm tripping out and she doesn't even believe me. I think I scared her, I don't know. <br><br>
So school's over. I go outside, it feels great to feel the cold air on my face since I was so fucking hot. I had been pretty depressed lately and I was in such a good mood. I walk across the street and pushed a car full of pueto ricans out of the ice, I don't know why. I was in such a good mood. Walked around with some friends for awhile, then I went to my friend's house and played some video games for awhile. I went home around 5:30. Had pretty much come down but felt pretty fatigued.<br><br>
This fucking headache hits me around 6. It was so bad. Thank god I had a shitload of vicodens I bought from my friend the day before. I was popping those things all night but I couldn't get rid of this headache. My buddy J cames over and chills for awhile, I tell him all about it and we had some pretty nice discussions about life in general, really just ramblings though. Later on this girl comes over, who normally puts me in a terrible mood since I used to be involved with her. I'll call her M. I was still in a good mood but I had a terrible headache. I ate 2 more vicodens and just lied down and talked to her for awhile. They left around 11 and I went to sleep. I wake up the next morning and my head is pounding. I ate my last pain killer and hung around the house for awhile. Headache went away around 11am.<br><br>
So this shit was weird. I kind of considered of a half assed drug, it's effects were really nice but it bored me. It was good to be on in school since I can function completely fine on it. But the headache just made it not worth it, it was terrible. I wouldn't do it again.<!-- End Body -->
