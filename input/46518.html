Of all the myriad psychedelic experiences I have had throughout my life, I have never remembered anything so vividly as my unique trip on Datura. In retrospect, it was quite horrifying.<br><br>
After mincing the petals of three Datura flowers, boiling them, and mixing the resulting liquid with ice cubes, sugar, and kool-aid, a female friend [referred to here as Lauren] and I each drank half a cup of this mixture. We sat on a couch, watching a movie. A short time later, perhaps half an hour, I began experiencing shortness of breath. My heart was beating rapidly, and my thought processes had become muddled. I decided that removing my shirt and belt would help me to breathe. At this point, I walked outside and began gasping for air. Lauren walked out at some point, and I went inside with her, after the feelings of suffocation had passed. <br><br>
We sat together on her bed. I was feeling reprehensive about the experience thus far, but I sat patiently, doing my best to stay calm and have a conversation. Every so often Id hallucinate that I had a lit cigarette in my hand, and attempt to take a drag off it, only to realize that it wasn't lit. At this point, I began to sink further and further in to delirium. My memory of the next few hours is very hazy, and I can't be sure if any of it actually happened. When I had come back to my sense, I was in the backyard. By this time, I was quite far gone, and I began having hallucinations of people I knew. I remember quite clearly one instance where I saw a good friend of mine, Chad. We began having a dialogue. I asked him what he was doing there, and he informed me that he had taken datura too. <br><br>
When I asked him why I was in the backyard and what I should do, he stopped moving. I did a double take, and he had turned into a tree. As I gazed at it, I saw a pattern in the leaves that vaguely resembled his face. I remember thinking that mistaking this pattern for a person's face seemed like a perfectly rational mistake to make, although whenever I went back to the tree, I wasn't able to discern that pattern again. I walked to the front of the house at one point. The car was gone, and I didn't know what to make of it. The house was completely locked, so, unclear as to what I should do, I decided to wait for Lauren to return. As I sat on the lawn furniture in the backyard puffing on cigarettes, I saw a starfish laying on the chair next to me. I stared at it, perplexed, for a good while. After going to check and see if Lauren had returned to her room yet, I noticed the chair again and realized that the starfish was actually a rip in the upholstery. <br><br>
At this point, I realized something was very wrong with me, and that I needed to get back home. I wandered through the neighborhood. A bit into my trek, I experienced amnesia, and I suddenly began looking for my house, which was a several miles away. I didn't realize this, however, and began searching for landmarks from my neighborhood that I would recognize. At some point, my train of thought changed once again. I made my way out of the neighborhood, onto a sidewalk. I began walking. I would hear a cellphone ring periodically, and Id pull it out of my pocket as if to answer it. I brought it up to my ear, and at that point I would realize that there was no cellphone in my hand, and that I didn't have one on me at all. I eventually made my way over to a well lit plaza, and found a payphone. I waited behind a man who was using it for what seemed like fifteen minutes, although I eventually realized there hadn't been anybody there to begin with. Feeling distraught, I called a family member, who eventually picked me up. Although Im told I was brought to a hospital where I had my stomach pumped, I have no recollection of this at all, short of waking up in my bed the next morning with a throbbing headache.<br><br>
In summation, I can only say that although this drug produced powerful hallucinations, I was far too delirious to enjoy the experience. This was easily the worst drug-related experience I have ever had, and most certainly the single worst experience of that year of my life. I had eaten LSD, mescaline, and psychedelic mushrooms previous to this, and I was completely unprepared for the intensity of this substance.<!-- End Body -->
