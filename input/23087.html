I am a certified 'psychonaut' I took about 500 LSD, and other trips between the ages of 13 and 35 (I'm 36).<br><br>
THE TRIP<br><br>
The first trip was perhaps the most intense. I thought I had been ripped off and went to the movies at the University: 'The Point', which is probably LSD influenced. About 20 min. into the movie I found that it was amazingly intense and realized SOMETHING had happened and I wondered if anyone else realized how 'different' I was. I got lost in the movie, like a waking dream. (a double feature).<br><br>
On the walk back home on a warm summer night in upstate NY I had an archtypal ego-loss experience. I looked up at the peacefull night sky and felt that I had been walking forever and would be walking forever. Timeless and wonderful, yet scary. In reality it was about 10 NYC sized blocks. I had a vague sense that I had had a life before, but it seemed like a dream. As I walked up to my front door, I put my hand on the handle, wondering if I was really allowed to do this, and walked in - !! My parents and about 20 folks were inside playing folk music! Perfect! I felt grounded again.<br><br>
THE CONVERSION EXPERIENCE:<br><br>
I was, at the time (nearly 14), a total slob/geek who did not understand the concept of excersise. My room was a hideous chaotic mess at all times! I took one look at the room, and one look in the mirror and thought 'this won't do.' I cleaned my room immmaculately, and put most everything at right angles. I trew out crap I had had since I was tiny. I scrubbed, dusted, etc. <br><br>
I finally fell asleep, convinced that I would not be 'me' anymore, an obsession that continued for years, by the way. Having experienced the unreality of the personality, I became frightened of losing myself. Anyway... The next day I woke up and I was 'me' again, except not quite. I did not know it at the time but I had an overnight 'personalityectimy'. I have been meticulously clean, orderly and nicely dressed since that time. I also went jogging for the first time that day and have enjoyed excersise greatly since that time.<br><br>
This first trip was the most benificial, if not the most pleasant. If you are a 'beginner', rather than obsess on drug use, I suggest learning to meditate. Meditating on LSD, BTW, once one knows how, is amazing, but I have come to believe that it makes it harder to do on a regular basis without the drug.<br><br>
'LSD can make you meet Jesus, but you cannot stay there that way. With meditation, you can.' Baba Neem Karoli from 'Be Here Now' by Ram Dass. Which I should have read BEFORE the acid!!<br><br>
