I consider myself to be a seasoned hallucinogen user, and a pretty knowledgeable AMT user (I have dosed on AMT more than 15 times), but what happened recently to me really changed my opinions on a lot of things. I decided to dose on some AMT one Saturday morning while catching up on some work. Nothing serious - just 10 milligrammes or so to stimulate me. I soon finished working and decided to go to a great big mall, watch Fantasia 2000, and really dose high. Over the course of about three hours, I steadily ingested about 200 milligrammes of AMT. Since I did so very steadily, there was no nausea whatsoever. And since AMT comes upon a person so slowly, I did not notice what I had done until it was too late.<br><br>
I went to see Fantasia 2000, and 15 minutes into the show, I had no idea that I was in a movie theatre. I was on the front row of the theatre and then I took off my socks and shoes, and began squirming on the floor in front of me like a crazed lunatic. I even took out a cigarette and put it in my mouth (though I never lit it). When the movie was finally over and the lights came on, I realised that people everywhere were looking at me make a spectacle of myself. I quickly gathered my things and put my shoes on and headed out of the theatre, when the manager and several employees stopped me and asked if there was a problem and if I was going to smoke the cigarette indoors. I said, 'No, but I need directions to the outside.' They directed me and I left.<br><br>
By this point, my visuals were so intense that I could not see in front of me. The visuals were so intense that I couldn't read signs, and all people everywhere looked like globs of Play-Dough. I went out to smoke and found myself uttering profanities (something I never do) and began to seriously question the amount of AMT I had ingested. It wasn't long before I decided to just find a chair and lie down and wait until I came down.<br><br>
Unfortunately, that didn't happen while I was at the mall. I found myself lying down in a chair, with my eyes closed. My visuals were mind-bending, but nothing prepared me for what happened next. The striking visual of a giant demon rising up out of hell came into my sight. It's teeth were pointed, and out if its mouth came flowing blood. I immediately became terrorised and opened my eyes. Back to normal. I closed my eyes again, only to see disfigured people, decomposing flesh, and after a while, women being raped and slaughtered with knives and people's heads exploding. All the while, I heard screams, laughter, and loud music, that I knew was not really playing.<br><br>
I was forced to leave the mall by 23.00 when a security guard came and asked me to leave. I had left my lights on in my car, so I had to have it jumped by another security guard. I had to drive home at that point. I barely made it without going insane. I stayed awake until Sunday morning at about 06.00 and went to sleep still disturbed by gross visuals.<br><br>
The interesting thing is that the visuals did not cause the same kind of fear that LSD would have caused. I didn't like seeing those things, but nor did I freak out and have a 'bad trip.' Even so, please do not take more than 100 to 150 milligrammes of this stuff. It's sneaky. It can be a lot of fun, but my limit is 150 milligrammes - and that's when I'm in my own apartment with a sober friend. Do not go into public areas alone - it's just a plain bad idea.<!-- End Body -->
