In my oppinion, I am a moderate to highly experienced experimenter with several substances. Since I made the leap from the occasional weekend drinker into the world of illicit drugs, I have used marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, ambien (sleeping pills), hydrocodone, oxycodone, heroin, methadone, xanax, adderall, and mushrooms. With the exception of one hospital visit, I have had positive experiences with all of the substances.<br><br>
No matter how many people say that heroin and cocaine are addictive after one use, I must disagree. By and far, Adderall is the most intensely addictive drug I have taken.<br><br>
I first tried Adderall (AD) during my first year of college to help me study for a biology exam. It was the first time I had ever been entertained by a text book. My roomate and I both took one 20mg tablet apiece. We must have reviewed the same page in the bio book 10 or 15 times before we were satisfied that we had learned it.<br><br>
Since last year, I have taken AD more times that I can count. If I hear someone talking about it, I want it. If I see it sitting in someones bathroom I'll steal some. The feeling it gives me makes it irrelevant who I'm stealing it from. Nothing matters but snaggin that bottle.<br><br>
My effective dose has risen from 20mg/night to anywhere between 50 and 100mg. I often start with 20-30mg and pop another 10mg pill every hour or so until I run out or start to feel sick. The effects make me contented doing nearly anything and being with nearly anyone. The majority of the time I will just chill out and watch movies one after another. I feel like I must be actively involved with something. Over the past 8 hours I have take 8 of my 10 pills. It is now 3:30 AM. As I type, I am listening to music and watching TV and couldn't be happier.<br><br>
I'm strongly fighting the urge to finish off my last two pills. If I do, there is no chance I'll sleep tonight. I want those pills so bad. Heroin (or any other opiate) has never made me desire repetitive doses. The heroin high makes me borderline if not completely comatose. When I wake up the next morning I feel tired, but I don't crave another dose. On the contrary, I have sat up for 48 hours popping AD. If I have any left after I binge, I may take a couple day break before I start again. Without a doubt, if I possess AD, I will take it anywhere and anytime. It just has that strong of a grasp on me.<!-- End Body -->
