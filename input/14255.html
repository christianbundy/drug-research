We have been interested in alternate consciousness experiences for awhile, and it is with this in mind, that we decided to try 'the wormwood experiment'.  <br><br>
We took a small amount (a pinch, small fingers), and mixed it with cannabis.  We smoked it in a bong.  We felt immediately that we had stumbled into something very interesting and quite unlike anything we had previously experienced.<br><br>
The result, for us, was a very relaxed body stone.  At the same time there was a sense of surging energy in our bodies.<br><br>
I saw what appeared to be some kind of shimmering beings, about the room where we had smoked.  And something big. (scared the crap out of me for a second.)  <br><br>
My accomplice experienced an ache in the area of her 'third eye'.  She did not see anything out of the ordinary.  <br><br>
We would like to caution anyone reading this that attempting to move while having inbibed these substances is very difficult.  It took us 2 hours to get to the store (for munchies).  Although we tried repeatedly just to get off the couches.  <br><br>
Further experimentation is required.<br><br>
We read 'the Thudge' article and are considering experimenting with this obviously more potent substance.  Our stones, were shorter lived and less pronounced, although many of the general descriptions sound similar.<!-- End Body -->
