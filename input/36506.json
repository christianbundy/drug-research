 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nEvery year my school band does a field trip to a local waterpark. This year I had obtained 70 mg of flexeril the day before going an the anual trip and decide I should take a few. \r\n8:30a I ate 2 10mg flexerils before boarding the bus\r\n9:15a I began to feel relaxed both phisically and mentaly and decided to have another 2 pills and ate those on the bus\r\n10:30a I felt extremely relaxed mentally and was having some difficulty walking on the wet floor and decided to get off my feet so I laid down on a few rafts in the lazy river and Started to float around\r\n12:15p I went and got lunch from the restaurant and ate another 2 flexerils and smoked a couple of ciggaretes\r\n1:00p I was feeling extremely relaxed and at ease with my suroundings but walking was almost impossible. allthough I knew I was intoxicated I didnt really feel intoxicated in my mind.(a few weeks after this I saw some of the pictures of me taken at around this time showing me laying on about 6 rafts and completely oblivious to my surroundings)\r\n4:00p I was still extremely relaxed when we left the park and started heading back to the school. I slept most of the return trip.\r\n6:00p after the bus driver took the longest route possible we finally arived back at the schooland I then started for home. during my drive I had to pull off the road a few times to prevent an accident\r\n9:00p I finally passed out and slept for 15 hours straight\n\n\n"
