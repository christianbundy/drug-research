I took one 300 mg pill at 6 pm on an empty stomach. By 7, my heart was pounding slightly and my head was totally clear and buzzed. At 6 I had been awake, now I was totally hyper, more hyper than 2 cups of coffee would do, and without the unpleasant side effects. I started to go stir crazy, so I went for a bike ride around 7:30. I found that I had more motivation to get a better workout, if not more energy. Had not felt this strong in months. My alertness was great, but I could not concentrate on anything in particular for too long. <br><br>
When I got back, my body felt drained but my mind felt perfectly okay and wanted to do more. I watched a little TV, but could not sit still, I had to do other things at the same time to keep my mind busy. Around 11 I thought the effects were wearing off, but I could still feel it strongly. This diminished effect was felt until 6 am, when I took two sleeping pills to help me get to sleep. Even after taking the sleeping pills, I still felt like getting up and doing more stuff. Could barely feel the sleeping pills at all!<!-- End Body -->
