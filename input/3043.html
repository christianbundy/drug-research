It's so funny how there are such drastic differences between 2 people with the same drug.  I am a very experienced person with ecstacy, and I've had well over one hundred hits in the last 4 years.  I have to say that at no time has ecstacy lost it's magic for me.  I just recently (last weekend, 9/16/00) dropped 2 hits of blue tweeties in one night and I rolled harder than I've ever rolled before.  And 2 hits is the most I've ever done in a night, my regular dosage is 1 hit per night when I'm partying.  I do sometimes take a month break between binging for months, so maybe that's why.  But I have a friend who has dropped with me several times, and he has reported to me a loss of effects after maybe 10 hits during this year...<!-- End Body -->
