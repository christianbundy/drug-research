 "report": "<p>\n 2 reports for the price of one!</p><p> Around October of 2000, some friends and i were going to have</p><p>a typical smoke session. Maybe 5 people, some high quality</p><p>weed. Well, i had a bunch of mushroom shake left from a party,</p><p>and i threw it on top. Why not? I had to work in an hour and</p><p>a half and figured the weed would be fading by then. </p><p> So we toked it all down. Pretty soon i felt totally stoned</p><p>out of my gourd. And more, it had the definate feel of mushrooms</p><p>too. Great i thought, its really nice. But by the time work</p><p>rolled around, i was still feeling like dancing through happy</p><p>land. I had to call in with a lame excuse.</p><p> Now, Aughust 2001, im sitting in japan (mushrooms are legal</p><p>here by the way). I just packed a bowl full of mushroom shake</p><p>and burnt down. Well, its definately giving some effects. Mild</p><p>visual changes, sound and tactile perceptions are slightly mushroomy. Nice feeling.</p><p> So, i can say mushroom smoking has an effect. However, the taste is rather bad, and usually causes a mild headache. Definately interesting though. If you have only 1 or 2 caps, or a bunch of shake, id say smoke the stuff, but use some weed to kill the taste.</p>"
