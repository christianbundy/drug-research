 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, i did it.  and it wasn't all that bad!  here's how...\r\n--Went to the bulk herb section of the natural grocery\r\n--purchased 10 nuts of whole nutmeg\r\n--considered buying milkthistle and drinking a tea of that too (i hear that Nutmeg is hard on the liver)--but did not.\r\n--crushed the nuts and consumed...(i boiled mine in milk, but i don't think it matters much...just get that pile of gaggy-bitterness down the hatch in some way!)\r\n--i drank the potion at 7 p.m. and began to feel effects approximately five hours later, after eating and smoking some herb.  (it tasted awful)\r\n--it was late, i was alone...so i feel asleep a few hours later, thiking that nutmeg is an ok buzz...\r\n--i woke up, or rather, came to the next morning, feeling as though someone had slipped me some very heavy sedatives...i was washed out tired and was hallucinating too.  I was as dry as the sahara and weak as a kitten.\r\n--at around 11:00 i mustered up the energy to drag my weak self into the bathroom, where I looked at my eyes.  They were little slits, all red.  I looked like I was half asleep...they communicated my sensations...I was messed up.\r\n--following this I had a burst of energy, made some green tea, and enjoyed the buzz.\r\n--I am still recovering a day and a half later!\r\n-- believe me...if you do this make sure you are not committed to do anything else that weekend...if you are anything like me, you will be transformed into a zombie for at least a day to a day and a half.  The hangover is cool, if you dont have to accomplish a single thing...because if you do...the guilt of struggling with the exteme fatigue in order to accomplish things will be a serious bring down.  Trip out in a mellow super-weed way, then under heavy sedation, then sleep alot.  That's what i did!  \r\n(i really want to know more about Nutmeg and Nutmeg Liver, a scary sounding condition)\n\n\n"
