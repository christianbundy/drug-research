I had high hopes for this one, but it sorta let me down.<br><br>
I obtained 3 grams of Sinicuichi 25x extract resin.  Not knowing exactly what to do with it, I spent quite a bit of time frustratingly trying to smoke the stuff.  This proved difficult, and I think I inhaled more butane than I did the actual smoke.  <br><br>
So I tried a gravity bong.  Smoked the hell out of it.  I began to feel a slight enhancement of the senses.  Or it could've been placebo.  Who knows?  Either way, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, all of my muscles were sore.  I had read one report of this happening, and concluded that it was, in fact, due to the Sinicuichi I had smoked.  I didn't understand how this could be, since I didn't feel tense at all beforehand.<br><br>
Today, however, I decided to take the remainder I had (2 grams), and steep it into a tea.  Broke the resin up into a powder, mixed it in with some hot water, steeped for about 5 minutes, and strained. This brought me some nice relaxing effects, coupled with a slight warmth, and marginal sensory enhancement.  Extremely mild.<br><br>
After a couple hours, I engaged in my daily meditation, and by the time I was through, every single muscle in my body was sore and tight and aching.  Right now I feel like I just got done with a strenuous full-body workout.  This still doesn't make any sense to me, because I felt no strange muscle activity during the experience.  My only thought is that Sinicuichi must act on the muscle cells in some way - similar to the way Creatine acts.<br><br>
A muscle relaxer would be good right about now.<!-- End Body -->
