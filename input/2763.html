I have had several experiences with 2C-T-7 and have been thoroughly impressed with it's effects.  The visuals and thought patterns are the most intense I have ever experienced!  There are however a few things I would like to point out about this substance. <br><br>
It appears to me that unlike LSD, 2C-T-7 can have an even stronger effect on 'next day' subsequent uses.  It may be that it stays somewhat active much longer than one may think.  The first time I used 2C-T-7 I took about 30~35mg (oral) and had a good experience.  Two days later me and the friend I did it with the first time tried it again with a larger group.  He and I had considerably more intense experiences than the first time users and than we had the first day.   I tried it a few more times over the next few months.  Recently I tried it again 15~20mg (insufflated).  This too was an amazing experience.  However, I noticed after this trip something I had kinda' noticed after the first few, but to a much greater degree.<br>
For the next 7~10 days I was rather noticably detached from reality.  I could function for the most part, but considering that I am a student this became a very unnerving time.  I could not concentrate or think clearly. My memory seemed to be extremely short term, and my body was running at less than 100%.  <br><br>
I'm not saying 2C-T-7 is bad. Actually just the opposite.  It has supplied me with some unique percpectives on things.  One thing that 2C-T-7 seems to do for most people is to put you into this state of mind where you think about what is 'really important' in your life.  I have heard of several people finding themselves picking up pictures of loved one's and telling themselves that 'tomorrow' I am going to be more devoted to the 'really important' things.  It is from this mind set that I have come to the conclusion that given lucky7's danger potential that for me it is not worth the risk at the moment.<!-- End Body -->
