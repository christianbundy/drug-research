Experience:<br>
-----------<br>
Person 1: (Me) I had an alright experience. It was not that intense, but the next day I still feel it in my head. I had quite some trouble in my stomach. I was doing all of the things that I thought would make the trip feel more intense. Drank a beer, ate fatty foods, took two Vitamin C's. My visuals were on the verge of getting fucked up, but never got all of the way there. Same with my mind. My mind was very active, but never quite got that intense. I thought a lot faster and clearer. After walking around a lot, I found that my mind was very active and that my Pupils were ENOURMUS. When I got back to my dorm, I was tripping semi hard. But, when I layed down, I fell right asleep. I had some crazy ass dreams that I remembered every time I woke up throughout the night, but just now I forgot all of them.<br><br>
Person 2: Felt it right after consuming the liquid. Was very harsh on his stomach. Visuals and Mind were effected, but not up to his expectations. Felt very sleepy and started falling asleep.<br><br>
Person 3: Felt it in mind and visually. Could not hold it in stomach for that long. Went to bathroom after about 2 hours and puked it up. Felt very sleepy and started falling asleep.<br><br>
Person 4: Completely downed the cup. Had problems walking, fell over while walking down the hallways. Mind and Visuals were distorted. I left before I could get the rest of his results.<br><br>
Person 5: Felt it right away. Mind and visuals were distored. Had horrible stomach feeling for about an hour. After it was over, he was active and was having a great time.<br><br>
Person 6: Only drank half of hers. Did feel different, but not that weird. Claimed that the effects were not touching her that much.<br><br>
-------------------<br>
Overall Experience:<br>
-------------------<br>
If I were ever to make this again, and I still have some more, it will be twice as much as I did here. I felt everything was coming up, but never went all the way there. Most of my friends said the same thing. We were sort of bummed by the experience, but it was an experiment. Not until later did I realize that morning glory's were a sedative. We all got real tired, real quickly. If we had some cocaine, it might have been a lot more intense. I am not recomending it, but in our situation (with our previous experience) it might of been for the better.<!-- End Body -->
