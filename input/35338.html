Ok, so I was not ready for this.  I am actually prescibed the medications listed above for a combination of anxiety/depression.  This was my first day to have the Elavil and so I took 2 of the new pills, plus my zoloft and smoked a couple of chillums of cannabis.  I smoke cannabis on average of 10 times a day, so I don't really get 'high' anymore.  But after smoking these chillums I started to feel really high, which was weird.  Then I went to walk to the TV room, and was stumbling. I layed and watched tv, not really able to move, and my vision was completely messed up.  I had tunnel vision in on the tv, and nothing seemed to be real.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.

So then I left my friends house and proceeded home, felt like I was driving a space ship or something, nothing seemed real, and I could feel myself just blanking staring at the road, not really even realising I was driving.  I got home and all I wanted to do was pass out and get a good nights sleep.  But instead when I layed down, I felt like a ton of bricks was on top of me and it felt like a huge ball was in my mouth, and felt like I couldn't swallow or breathe.<br><br>
Went down to get some water and hopefully feel better.  It took about an hour for this feeling to go away before I could pass out.  By the time all of this was over it had been nearly 3 and 1/2 hours since I had smoked, and I still felt high.  It was the craziest thing I have ever experienced when I wasn't planning on having a psychological event, like with mushrooms or lsd.  I don't know if it was a combination of the drugs or just the new elavil, but I never want to feel that again.<!-- End Body -->
