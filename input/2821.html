My friend absolutely love taking 'Pure Loves' which is 100% MDA.  He describes them as a really intense trip. It doesn't hold the lovey-dovey feelings of MDMA, but you still feel really good.<br><br>
I am always willing to try anything (as long as it doesn't kill me the first time), so i agreed to taking a pill.  He warned how strong they were, so i heeded and only took a half.  I must confess i had a slight hint of sadness at the party, but from past experiences with pill popping, i usually forget about the problem once i'm x'ing.<br><br>
The first hour, i was feeling anxious.  I felt i was wavering between the edges of euphoria and a nervous breakdown.  With the added pressure of thinking Happy Thoughts.<br><br>
Come the second hour into it, i was emotionally dark &amp; drained.  i was spiralling into a realm of depression.  There were no florid reactions.  i  still felt like i had control over my body, but i was psychologically screwed.<br><br>
I sat and sobbed.  Then along comes a fellow who's been there and was willing to help me out.  We talked and his insight &amp; advice brought me out of the emotional pit.<br><br>
In short, MDA is pretty hardcore.  Only if you're emotionally stable at the moment would i recommend trying it.  Even then, i recommend taking only a half. Had i taken the whole pill, i would probably be viciously hallucinating.. i can only imagine how intensely out of control i would've been.<!-- End Body -->
