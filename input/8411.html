Methylphenidate (30mg, snorted)  Alcohol (2 cans beer, 4 shots rum), marijuana (2 roaches, medium quality), tobacco (3 cigarette<br><br>
That night I was feeling good already (just got home from a most excellent date).  I was at home, comfortable and relaxed, but tired.  I started the night by smoking a roach and snorting 30mg of ritalin at about 12am, then I had the alcohol (2 cans beer, 4 shots rum) until 12:45am, and smoked the other roach at about 1:30am.  Three cigarettes of tobacco is just an estimate, as I smoked my mother's leftovers throughout the night to aid my buzz (if I don't smoke tobacco very often, it makes my weed buzz much cooler).  My  body generally felt the same; stomach a little bit queasy from a lot of quick alcohol,  and throughout the night I felt a sort of dry tightness in my mouth, especially in the roof, which is typical of when I snort ritalin.  I felt drunk...everything was fuzzy and my vision was blurred, but my hearing seemed to be more acute.  Also, I had more energy then than I had all day, and probably more than I have had in a long time.  I was able to get up and move around where normally (and especially when I'm high) I'd simply say 'Nah, fuck it.'  <br><br>
It was sort of euphoric...I felt very happy, and very energetic, and I had this feeling like everything was right with the world.  Also, I watched The Next Karate Kid, and the phrase 'Sun is warm, grass is green' had a strangely profound effect that I can't quite remember.  The entire night continued like this, until I went to bed around 5am.  I began to feel uncomfortably hot then, and had to fake being asleep as my mother awoke and got ready for work.  The ritalin eventually wore off around 6am and I slept from then until 1pm.  When I woke up, I had a slight headache, and felt cottonmouth, but the tightness in the roof of my mouth was gone.  All in all, it was a pleasurable experience, but I'm trying to find a way to take heavy hits of ritalin without snorting it (the tabs I have are time released, which means little to no real buzz...perhaps I could crush and dissolve in water, that may help).  I think the only major complaint I have about rits now that I've used them a few times is that they burn the hell out of my nose.<!-- End Body -->
