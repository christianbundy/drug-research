These events began to take place at around 2:00am.<br><br>
I first sniffed up about 20mg. Because I was coming down from some GHB, and even though I had been assured this was a pretty safe combo, I wanted to do a quick low-dose check for signs of respiratory / cardiac depression and whatnot.<br><br>
As soon as that kicked in -- sorry I'm not going to bother describing such a low dose of Ketamine, except that it felt 'nice' -- I quickly snarfed up somewhere between 120-140mg. It felt like a drill going up my nose, but not as bad as 10mg of 2C-B, which remains the worst thing I've ever snorted.<br><br>
Railing Ketamine comes on quite quick. Within 5 minutes I was feeling a dissociative rush come over me, and within 10 minutes I absolutely had to go lie down on my bed. It came on so quickly that I think my body had a bit of a strange time adjusting to it. Like I caught myself reminding myself to breathe at somewhat normal intervals, and my heart seemed 'different', although later on I realized it was beating at a pretty normal pace. Anyway it took me a few minutes to get comfortable and let the experience flow.<br><br>
When I finally did get comfortable I remember seeing a large black square-shaped object rotating down towards me. Was this the 'hole'? Well, I don't know, I think the term 'K-Hole' is pretty retarded anyway, so I will just describe what happened. After I entered that square black rotating black hole-looking thing all the rules of reality were completely done away with. Also my concept of the sequence of events that followed is pretty fucked, so I will mention a few things first:<br><br>
- About 1 hour after doing that ~130mg I snarfed up another 80mg with my other nostril. Then an hour after that I snarfed up at least 140mg. I found each of these re-doses to cause me to peak again for at least an hour, and substantial effects lingered for about 2-3 hours after the last dose, when I finally fell asleep.<br><br>
- I was listening to music, mostly Flaming Lips, Cat Stevens, some Phish, the whole time.<br><br>
- I turned off all the lights and put GeForce on my monitor. I didn't spend any time staring at the monitor, but instead enjoyed the various lights and colors it caused in my room.<br><br>
- I am very experienced with dissociative states via DXM. So the kind of stuff that follows doesn't really mess with my head at all. I will try to compare these two substances towards the end of this report.<br><br>
Allright, so here's what happened. Totally out of sequence I'm sure, but whatever:<br><br>
- With my eyes open I experienced extremely intense visuals. Like my entire scenery changing before my eyes and transitioning. Blotches of red and green worked over my visual field. The green blotches seemed to draw whatever my mind could come up with (although I am now convinced the Ketamine has a bit of its own imaginary agenda) with the detail of an incredibly fine ink pen. These objects / images would often become animated after being drawn out. The red blotches seemed to serve another purpose. It seemed that whereever the red blotches went I could see through whatever surface it was overlayed upon. And under the surface was almost always geometric designs and Aztec-lookin' dudes scurrying around. These guys were very small and probably 4 of them could fit in a square inch.<br><br>
- With my eyes closed pretty much all I could see was Tekken battles. I had played quite a bit of Tekken 5 that afternoon and evening, so it's not too surprising. And plus, this was like a trippy version of Tekken 8, yet unreleased for Playstation 4 or something. I really tried to make other things appear behind my eyelids but all I could see was Tekken. So finally I willed myself to embody one of the characters so I could be an active participant instead of just watching it. My perspective immediately shifted from that of one of the players, I believe I was Jin actually, and I saw the punches and kicks coming at me from my opponent, who I think was Paul. At first I was like, oh shit, I'm getting my ass kicked, but I quickly picked up the art of fighting and started kicking Paul's ass.<br><br>
- I decided to make my room rotate around while I was lying on the bed. It was really easy to do, and I felt like I was spinning around. Also, I literally saw my room rotate around me which was pretty fun for a while... and then, I saw them.....<br><br>
- Ghost Children! Wait! Rotate back, what the hell was that?! Okay, I rotated back, and they are still chilling there in my room. One boy, about 16 years old, and one girl, maybe 10 years old. They were sitting in my chairs. The boy looked like he was tying his shoe or doing something near his foot anyway. The girl was just sitting there. What the hell are these children? They were 100% photorealistic and three dimensional. They were also oblivious to my presence, so it seemed. The thought kept occuring to me that these might be my children from the future. It wasn't like an overwhelming thought, just a suspicion that it seemed the Ketamine was reinforcing. I guess we'll see, eh? Anyway, these 2 children re-appeared several times during my trip, and I was totally cool with their presence.<br><br>
- There were several points where my scenery was so completely different from reality (with my eyes wide open.... keep in mind I didn't want to be playing Tekken all night hehehe) that I really forgot where I was. Additionally I could be tilted up/down/sideways in any given direction to further distort and make me forget that I was actually lying on my bed in my room. At one point I was staring at my wall I guess, which turned into a waterfall and in front of that was some kind of sunken garden. I have seen a similar scene on DXM + Mushrooms but this was even more detailed. Inside the sunken garden were like 6 or 8 Toltec looking stone figures, sitting in a circle and making small movements and appearing to communicate with each other. I examined this scene for a while until a red blotch came along and destroyed them.<br><br>
- I could quite clearly see some four legged geometric trippy creatures running, single file, along my floor. Almost like ants. They seemed to be heading under my bed. This didn't bother me at all. In fact between that and the ghost children I'm pretty sure I could have witnessed just about anything take place and not have been bothered by it. Ketamine seems to limit my range of emotions, including fear and euphoria. Much of the trip was spent in a state of somewhat passive awe and wonder.<br><br>
Now, those are just the main things I remember best. But many of these scenes changed at a rapid pace and many of them seemed to end prematurely, destroyed and rebuilt by red / green blotches.<br><br>
By about 6:30am I had come down enough to segue into a nice restful sleep.<br><br>
With DXM I am used to closing my eyes and drifting off into space, into a slowly building experience. With Ketamine I found it was much more interesting to have my eyes open and that things seemed to move at a faster pace. I did smoke some cannabis during the momentary 'comedowns' between the K peaks, but it didn't seem to significantly affect the intensity of the experience. With DXM cannabis can easily make it twice as intense.<br><br>
I am hesitant to call Ketamine a superior dissociative, because I have so much DXM experience and I'm more or less in my Ketamine honeymoon, having only tried it a handfull of times (this being by far the most intense Ketamine experience I've had). Both of these substances seem to carry infinite possibilities and are a highly recreational brain vacation. Ketamine does seem more 'psychedelic' though... much more classicly psychedelic OEVs. Ketamine does also have a bit more pleasant body feel, kind of like the 2nd half of a DXM trip (which is the good half, IMO).<br><br>
Anyway, I look forward to mixing Ketamine with a few tryptamines :)<!-- End Body -->
