This isn't so much of an actual trip report, rather a general report of the effects from my use of it.<br><br>
Maybe I'm just different, my brain chemistry is just a little different maybe not. Drugs have always effected me wierd. Coke has no effect what so ever other than a slight energy boost. I am not a big E person but I have to down like 5 pills to roll. Dust definatly fucks me up but in a wierd way, or so I am told by friends.<br><br>
When I smoke dust I feel like I am stupified. I can feel my the liquid building up and swirling around my head as if my brain was melting. I feel very zombie or vegetable like. But when I get dusted I am cognitively more alert than I am when I am sober. In fact I can remember every little detail to the 'T' as they say. I could be in a part of the country that I've only been in once before maybe like 4 years ago and still give flawless directions somehow. And this goes on till the next day or two.<br><br>
The next day my vision is still all fucked up but at work I am very alert, very wired. Mentally I am what I should be like all the time, generally MUCH better than normal.<br><br>
Only once has this been different. I had smoked some REALLY potent juice and I had alot of trouble remembering the simplist of things. Actually, these are things most people don't need to remember because they are just commen sense. For instance I had to refigure out and tell myself who I was, where I came from, why I was where I was, where I was going, or what money is used for etc... Basically I had to figure living out. All I could say to anyone was 'I need my brain back'.<!-- End Body -->
