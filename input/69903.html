I had been taking ecstasy for over a year and a half on a regular basis, on average every second weekend with the occasional 4-5 day binges. I was by no means an inexperienced user, I liked to get on it and when I did I went hard. Id had both MDMA and speed countless times, I knew what to look for and I knew how it felt, this experience however was like nothing I'd had ever before. <br><br>
Last weekend, on Friday I went round to my mates place with a couple of friends. We were planning to have a night off and just drink. Around 4am one of my mates suggested we get pills and we all went with it as none of us really felt like sleeping. My dealer came round, off his head and bringing with him 20 of the pills he was on, with him - Pink Ladies, Id had them before, speed bombs, but considering he was completely wasted we decided to take the chance. <br><br>
We all took our first one and not much happened for a while. I started to feel REALLY horny, which was unusual because the last time I felt like that off a pill was, well, about a year and a half ago. It then came up slowly, then all of a sudden I was completely smashed, like out of no where. I decided that wasnt enough so I poped a second one. Again, it came up slowly then all of a sudden you're smashed. <br><br>
This was like the perfect pill; I felt speedy, lovey and trippy all at the same time. It felt like Id candy flipped with a line of speed on the side. We all went into the lounge room to dance. I remember saying something like 'These pills would be perfect for Q-Dance', how wrong was I. PMA pills, had I kept dancing I might have been in trouble a lot sooner. I stopped tho because I felt sick. <br><br>
We all went back outside where we took 1 more pill each. Now Id munched 3. I felt alright except I started to notice my heart was racing, I ignored it. We went down to the pool house, I was sitting in the sun for about 2 seconds before I started to overheat really badly. I noticed my mate lieing down on the tiles he said if he moved he would through up, so I left him but still kept an eye on him as I started to notice some weird things happening to me. My heart was still going a million miles an hour, how ever I was calm, so something wasnt right. <br><br>
I started to trip balls way too hard. My mate was next to me talking and I could hardly hear him. Everything started to go really quiet, like nothing was real. I couldnt think of anything, my mind was completely blank, not a thought going threw my head. I snapped out of it quickly when my mate lieing on the ground said he couldnt breath. We werent taking any chances so we got ourselfs to the hospital. <br><br>
We got there, another one of my mates jumped out of the car and ran to the paramedic, saying he also couldnt breath. 2 of my mates got admitted in and monitored for around 10 hrs. During that time, atleast 8 hrs their heart rates were above 120 bpm. I sat outside, and didnt check in, fearing my dad would find out. I mean, I was at the hospital anyway so if anything went seriously wrong Id be fine. <br><br>
The whole time I was having panic attacks. I got the paramedic to check me out and she said to just calm down, and it would be fine. If you've ever had one you'll know how scary it can be. You feel like you're chocking, your hands go numb, you get insanely dizzy and, in my case at least it was like someone had a strobe light in front of my eyes, couldnt see anything. The funny thing is, Ive never had a panic attack, Im not an anxious person, at all, the opposite accually, yet the PMA made me like that. The slightest thing would set off a massive panic attack.<br><br>
When we got out we tested the pills, they came up as PMA, which I knew all along but it was nice to know. <br><br>
We got lucky. We took 3 PMA smacks each and came out kickin. It could have been a lot worse. If I went to Q-Dance on these I most likely would be dead. It was the scariest experience of my life. Im never taking ecstasy again. Its too risky, you dont know what you're getting.<!-- End Body -->
