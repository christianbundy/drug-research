After a long well loved history of experiemce with Meow, Meow (Mephedrone,4MMC) I found myself saddened by it becoming illegal and impossible to get anymore so i started to search for something interesting and new. I found it -- MDBD, Butylone.<br><br>
I was a chemistry major in college so i could rough;ly predict how it might feel and had 20 years of experience with dozens of substances. So I was clearly an experienced psychonaut and prepared.<br><br>
I prepared 75mg for IV usage. And administered. There's no room for error with this substance just as with meow, because if I miss even slightly the burn is furious!<br><br>
T 30sec Warm invigorating rush like meow or meth in that there's an immediate adrenalyn release as well as a quickened heart rate like jumping out of a plane.<br><br>
T 1min  Feeling of euphoria combined with sharper feelings of kindness and connection to others. Then a sudden urge to watch internet porn or make love.<br><br>
T 2min  Decided to try to administer a rectal booster dose. Administered 75mg in 3 CC of water. Made my male part tingle immensely.<br><br>
T 3min  Begining to sweat profusely. Clearly my temperature has climbed. Music is significantly enhanced. Labido is through the roof.<br><br>
T 1hr  Re apply IV dosage of 50mg. Incredible rush again. repeat of previous experience.<br><br>
T 1hr 3min Re apply rectal dosage of 50mg.<br><br>
T 1hr 5min Very alert, accelerated. ADD with the desire to juggle porn, conversations, music and computer maintenance at same time.<br><br>
All in all, I liked it alot. I liked the way my thoughts connected, and I *really* enjoyed conversations. A very social drug.<br><br>
T 4hrs Feel like I'm coming down but clearly it's so gradual and slow. This stuff last forever it seems.<br><br>
T 6hrs begining to calm but clearly still wound up, controllable though now.<br><br>
All in all this was an amazing experience with a quality somewhere in between Meow and speed. Deffinite hint of MDMA like feelings, but clearly much more speedy =) Will try again soon =)<!-- End Body -->
