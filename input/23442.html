I've been drinking heavily since I was around 13 with exception of 2 years in high school, when I quit. So it's been about a decade since then. According to the contemporary medical community I'm an alcoholic, though a functional one. I'm also an honors student at a major university who hasn't missed more than one or two classes in the last three years. <br><br>
I've gone through a 30 pack of beer or a bottle of bourbon in a day and remain relatively sober. I've quit drinking on an almost weekly basis for the last year. Hangovers from drinking as much as I do are especially nasty and result in headaches and mild shaking, and coughing up bile, which I've often drank through (40oz's or MD 20/20 get rid of hangovers fast). <br><br>
Drinking is like a love affair. When it's great, it's amazing and when it's not it's terrible. Blackouts are the personal scourge of my being though. I've cut down recently after I got the shakes after a week-long drinking binge over the summer. But, of course there's the reason I drink - it feels great if I can stop at a buzz and not get full on drunk. <br><br>
It's harder for some of us to stop though. It helps to know if I'm one of those people. Me and most of my family are. But I'm not some puritan.<!-- End Body -->
