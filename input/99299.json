 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis drug is not fun. If you are incredibly desperate to fall asleep, it could be helpful. But I took 50mg around 1am and tried to stay awake, but was asleep by 1:30. I was texting some friends but had to stop due to an overwhelming urge to sleep. My legs felt restless and I was extremely uncomfortable. The next day I still felt off, and was exhausted all day long. So once again, this could be wonderful for someone really struggling to sleep, but be prepared for these averse side effects. Either way I was  tired, so it's not really worth it.\n\n\n"
