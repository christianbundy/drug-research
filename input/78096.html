After my earlier negative experiences with some other research chemicals,<br>
2C-C and 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy Methoxy), whose heavy body load and insufficient<br>
psychedelic yield got me disappointed, I have approached this chemical<br>
with a degree of apprehension and skepticism. I needn't have to worry;<br>
this is a very gentle drug of rare beauty.<br><br>
Xavier (my partner) and I decided to tag on an experiment with this<br>
drug to the end of our MDMA-enhanced love-making session, having just<br>
celebrated our anniversary. We were both already quite tired, but still<br>
felt we'd like to extend this wonderful night for a bit longer.<br><br>
I decided to apply this drug by IM injection, in order to bypass the<br>
deleterious effects of the digestive tract, and to speed up the action.<br>
The drug acted quite fast, perhaps within 10 minutes, and my threshold<br>
dose was about 5mg. I was then comfortable enough to gradually increase<br>
our dose to a total of 40mg, for each of us. The dose-to-response curve<br>
was remarkably linear, gently tapering off. There was very little body<br>
load. The effects started to subside in approx one or two hours, and I<br>
have extended the duration of the trip by topping up.<br><br>
The first thing I noticed were gentle rushes in my face, followed by<br>
altered perception of colours. It's a bit like if I turned my<br>
internal 'colour contrast' adjustment control to the max, and then some.<br>
Colours become incredibly deep and vibrant. Xavier (my partner) and I<br>
were watching a porn movie; this was turned into a piece of art, a<br>
feast to our eyes.<br><br>
Watching Xavier's face, I saw it transformed before my eyes. He has a<br>
handsome face, with some strong features, and I saw him transformed<br>
into a Star Trek alien, then yet another type of alien, and then some<br>
strange animals, one after the other. He looked a bit scary, but I<br>
realized that I would still love him even if he remained like that.<br><br>
Closing my eyes produced a never-ending tapestry of intricate artistic<br>
imagery which, if one was able to remember it all, would keep alive a<br>
generation of fantastic artists.<br><br>
Interestingly though, this drug was not at all trippy in the Ketamine<br>
sense. It did not affect my mind; there were no 'conversations with<br>
gods', no funny mental loops, no time dilation. It never got scary. I didn't <br>
actually get deeply involved in the 'action'. Rather, I was in a<br>
position of an amused, almost detached, observer. That was quite enough<br>
for me, but Xavier was somewhat disappointed, being used to a deeper<br>
involvement on Ketamine and complaining that the visuals were too<br>
weak even while he was at the peak of his experience.<br><br>
Having said that, I did in fact notice some subtle mental cues of deeper<br>
psychedelic deja-vu of my earlier Ketamine sessions. The drug does seem<br>
able to get me close to some of the doors of higher perception, but leaves<br>
them safely shut.<br><br>
In terms of the stimulant/depressant scale, this drug was mildly<br>
stimulant, in a peaceful, gentle way. I would imagine (as I heard) that<br>
it would make a great combo with MDMA (in our case the MDMA effect was<br>
already over). But it was not a rave club drug; I wouldn't be able to dance on it.<br>
In fact I tended to develop a slight nausea just by going to the<br>
bathroom and back, which however, quickly subsided when I got back in<br>
bed again. It was not a sensual drug; I probably couldn't have sex on it,<br>
it does not seem to enhance any erotic feelings. But if I wanted to just<br>
lie down and relax, and perhaps watch some movie, I could be sure it<br>
will become a work of art, a colourful, yet not kitchy, eye candy, while<br>
still leaving my mind intact enough to be able to follow the plot.<br><br>
This is a successful research chemical which could in fact make it to<br>
the mainstream. It should have a street name; I'd simply call it 'Colour'.<!-- End Body -->
