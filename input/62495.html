I was going to be another boring Monday at school, so I look through our medicine cabinet. I come across this new bottle that's marked with 'causes drowsiness', so I go and look it up. This had been my first time with this so I take 2 with some tea.<br><br>
About 30 minutes pass, I start to feel relaxed, sort of out of body.  Another 10 minutes passes and I start to feel a lot more relaxed, I get up to go get a piece of paper, and my whole body feels very light. I felt as if I can run a marathon. I'm guessing it was the hot tea.<br><br>
Another hour passes, still feeling energetic, but I start to get the drowsiness feeling.<br><br>
Lunch time, when I am walking feel sorta dizzy, but still light footed.<br><br>
In the next period class, I was sorta just drifted away, now really tired, just wanting to go to sleep. If I started staring into something it would move a little bit, and I would stare into something like a little circle everything would turn completely black for about 1 second and my heart would start racing, I think I passed out for a second? This scared me, so I stared again and I happened again, it was as if someone tried to jump start my heart.<br><br>
This is a good buzz giving drug, but nothing too intense.<!-- End Body -->
