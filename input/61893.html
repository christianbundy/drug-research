After a day of uncomfortable pain, I had asked my grandmother from the 'Old Country' what I could do for my tooth/gum pain (molars were erupting from gum tissue) that would be a natural remedy. She said to chew whole cloves, as it numbs the tissues in the mouth. I found chewing them painful with sensitive gums. Having some alchemical knowledge, I procurred 15 grams of powdered cloves from the local bulk food shop. I then bought a bottle of 99% Isopropyl Alcohol to make an extraction. <br><br>
Extraction Process:<br>
Add 15 g. of ground cloves to a sealable mason jar.<br>
Add 2 parts (30 ml.) of Isopropyl to this<br>
Seal and shake the jar for about 30 sec. to a minute, the solution will turn a dark brown.<br>
Let the mix settle for approx 30 minutes or so, you will have a brown coloured liquid on top, with solid, darker precipitate on the bottom. Pour off the alcohol into a seperate container, discard the precipitate. Re-pour the solution into the jar. Repeat shake, settle and seperate.<br>
Pour the alcohol into a flat pan (I find glass pyrex works well) and let it evaporate by an open window or outside, never contain it in a non-ventilated space! After evaporation is complete, scrape off the brown, oily substance off the bottom of the pan. This is your usable extract, no other washes or clarification is required, as the tannin in the cloves is the active ingredient.<br><br>
Use: I apply the substance directly in the mouth with a finger or Q-Tip to the affected area or on the gum tissue surrounding it. First sensations are a heavy burning sensation, similar to eating a hot pepper. (This acts as an antiseptic as well) This quickly changes into a pleasant and powerful numbing sensation that is quite effective, and releaves pain for a good hour or more. I re-apply as I see fit.<br><br>
Enjoy this Ancient Remedy with a Modern Twist!<br>
Yours,<br>
