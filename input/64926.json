 "report": "<p>I realize how dumb it was to ingest this much DXM. I was 16 and scored 14 grams of pure DXM powder and was doing it pretty much daily, adding more and more each time. One night I decided I was going to the 4th plateau so I weighed out 2 grams of it and put it in a piece of toilet paper and washed it down with some iced tea.</p><p>The next thing I no I'm in a hospital bed with restraints on me and cops everywhere. Apparently I was found in the road unable to walk so they called an ambulance and when I got to the hospital I was being violent and aggressive pulling out my IV and ALMOST ripping out my catheter and lurching out at the cops around me and shit.</p><p>I tested positive for PCP and Opiates, neither of which I knowingly ingested so I wonder was this a false positive or just an impurity either way it was hard to explain that I ingested a legal substance.</p>"
