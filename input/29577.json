 "report": "<p>I have always been interested in mind-altering substances of any kind, but mainly ones that produce hallucinogenic effects.  I have smoked pot many times and I can safely say that I do not like it.  Call me crazy, but I sort of tweak out on it, I can't function, I don't have any idea what's going on, and I just want to go to sleep, and usually only after like 3 hits.  But thats me.  </p><p>Anyways, a few days ago, I was over at my boyfriend's apartment and him and three other guys were splitting a 'ball' of coke.  My best friend has done coke several times and really likes it, so I decided to give it a try.  My boyfriend threw $35 for both of us and one guy started to split it up.  I told everyone I had never done this before and they said I should start with a small line.  I always get really scared before I do a new drug for the first time and I shake really bad and my heart races.  Everyone else snorted one decent sized line before passing the plate to me, and I snorted my line.  Snorting it wasn't anymore unpleasant than snorting anything else (pills).  All the guys said they felt something right away...but I didn't feel anything.  </p><p>We passed the plate around again and I did another line.  Still nothing.  My heart was beating fast but it was just because I was so nervous.  I decided to wait awhile before doing anymore to see if it would kick in.  I kept snorting and eventually I felt this like clot (sorry thats gross haha) hit the back of my throat and start dripping down.  Once again, this wasn't anymore unpleasant than the drip you get when snorting pills.  </p><p>However, about 10 seconds later my throat became completely numb and I was having trouble swallowing, which alarmed me.  The plate got passed back to me and I passed it cuz I was scared.  I drank some water and the numbness wasn't as bad.  After that I did about 4 more lines and I didn't feel anything.  I didn't feel happy, euphoric, elated, any more talkative, nothing.  My nose just went numb and my throat was numb.  </p><p>Someone told me to rub it on my lips and gums, and I did, and soon my tongue, lips and teeth were numb and tingly too.  This was all in about a half hour.  I didn't feel bad, I was happy, but not anymore happy than usual.  Everyone else, especially my boyfriend who is usually quiet, was talking and happy and the other guys said their faces were numb.  Also, they told me I wouldn't be sleeping that night, and I had absolutely no problem falling asleep when I laid down about 2 hours later.  </p><p>Overall, I didn't really care for the cocaine experience.  It's expensive and it didn't do anything for me.  It seemed more like a local anesthetic, sort of like Novocain.</p>"
