Oh my goodness. Oh my motherfucking goodness.<br><br>
So I have smoked a few times before this one experience. Maybe a cigarette or two, or a cigarello. It was never much. And I never seemed to inhale right. <br><br>
But recently, I tried smoking two cigarettes to chase that buzz. I woke up and grabbed two cigarettes, walked outside, lit one up. I managed to catch the buzz, too. I was dizzy and lightheaded and could hardly walk right. Due to my small size it came on fast and hard, and about halfway through my second cigarette, I felt terrible. Words can't describe it. <br><br>
I immediately put it out the second one, ran inside, up the stairs, and jumped on my bed. I started to sweat immense amounts of sweat. Then a painful wave of nausea hit me. My heart was beating like mad. After about 10 minutes of this, I snapped out of it, but the nausea was still there. I wobbled out of my room and flopped down on my couch. I was holding down puke. I laid down on my couch for over an hour and finally found the strength to sit up, and then about 20 minutes of sitting up, I could walk around. <br><br>
I still had a mild nausea for awhile and it wouldn't pass. Who knows how long it went on for.<br><br>
Moral of the story:<br><br>
Cigarettes may kill, but who cares when you feel like you're going to die?<!-- End Body -->
