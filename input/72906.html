I took 900 mg on the way to a 311 show just for fun to try it and see how it was. I didn't really expect to feel it. Drank a Doctor Pepper because I heard that makes it hit you more quickly. Began to feel it a little bit within the next hour, but not much. Later on (during Snoop Dogg) I smoked some bud, then I smoked some more bud.<br><br>
At first I didn't feel it at all, but as I was leaving the crowd to get some water the dank hit me HARD. I could tell it was the combo, cause I was chill but still wanted to dance and talk to people. 311 came on, and I started peaking on the ganja and the gabapentin. I got a few closed eye visuals and really enjoyed the music more. The combo was interesting.<br><br>
As I left the show, my legs were rubber and just moving felt amazing. Shaking my head, moving my legs, everything felt nice. Not like Xs or anything. There are some similarities to GHB but not overwhelmingly so. All in all a great night. Although I had to get up for work at 440 am today and woke up like a damn zombie. It's gonna be a long day at work. Totally worth it.<!-- End Body -->
