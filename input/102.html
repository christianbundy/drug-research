In the Autumn of '97, I arrived at university.  The previous year had been very traumatic for me.  I had been through a very messy break up, was told by my doctor that I may never play sport again at anything approaching a decent level, and to top it all off, I was flirting with alchoholism, having been sacked from my part time job in a local shopping mall for arriving drunk.<br><br>
And so it was with gratitude that I took this opportunity for a new start away from all these hassles, and moved in with some wonderful people who made me feel at home straight away, though I was still drinking nearly a bottle of vodka a day, unable to completely leave everything behind.<br><br>
Two or three weeks into term, one of my flatmates turned up with a bag of ecstacy. An old hand at such matters, he asked me if I had ever indulged.  'No' I replied, but if your'e offering?  OK, he said, adopting a more serious tone, 'as long as your not drunk'. Luckily, I had been working that night, and, keen not repeat the mistakes of the past I had managed to stay sober.  So, despite my calm exterior, it was with some trepidation that I gulped it down, along with my flatmate, his girlfriend and her best friend.<br><br>
I spent most of the next twenty minutes, running around like a headless chicken, making cups of tea, and tidying my room, despite the others insistence that I should sit myself down and have a spliff.  My flatmates girlfriend put some deep, expansive house music on and I started to skin up, grateful for something to do. A couple of minutes later the joint was complete, and I looked up to see three beaming faces, all looking at me.  I took this as I sign that they had all started to feel the rushes, about the standard 30 minutes after taking the tablets, but was concerned that I was still yet to feel anything myself.  Don't worry, was the general consensus in the room, they're really good pills, it will happen soon.<br><br>
Sure enough, as soon as the joint was lit, I felt an explosion of pleasure, emanating in the pit of my stomach, as wave after wave of pure ecstacy shot through my body.  I was aware of the corners of my mouth turning up as I took deep breaths, loving the rushes but unwilling, or unable to completely let go.  My flatmate turned to me and asked me if I was cool, he had noticed I was coming up although I had been very quiet.  Yes I was cool I thought to myself, 'EVERYTHING is cool' I replied, he smiled and hugged me tight, we were joined in the middle of the room by the two girls and stood there, transfering rushes of energy between each other.  An hour after my first tablet, I was well and truly sold.  We had moved to the back garden as it was a very mild evening for early October, and it was decided that we should take another one.  I sat in the tree at the bottom of the garden, which affords a beautiful view of the river estuary, and felt very connected with it all in a way that I have since only experienced with hallucinogens, which as it turns out, were next on the menu.<br><br>
My flatmate walked to the shop with his girlfriend to fetch skins and cigarettes, leaving me at home with this other girl, whom I was meeting for the first time.  It was soon evident that there was no need for meaningless small talk. As most of you are probably aware, you get to know people very quickly when you take drugs of any kind with them, but this seemed to be such a special bond that it was almost with disappointment that I heard the key turn in the lock, and the two happy travellers bounded back into the room.  <br><br>
It turned out they they had made a detour to pick up some 2c-b, which I had never even heard of, let alone taken. However, I was in an adventurous mood, and, as they were so small we all decided we would take two each, as recommended, just as we had stopped peaking on the ecstacy.  <br><br>
It was late, and we lived in a relatively unpopulated area, so we decide it was safe to go to some local common land for a walk, which was where the trip really came into its element.  The grass was all surrounded by a shimmering green light, and the moon and stars were simply awe-inspiring, as was the depth and breadth of vision.  In the space of one evening the world had become a place of wonder and interest again, the problems of the past were in perspective and the future was looking rosy.  The four of us sat on the brow of a hill, from which you can see most of the town, as the sun came up and people started their day.  I was astonished to note how much like toy town this all looked, unreal if not exactly unfriendly.  The clouds formed animals of all shapes and sizes as we all sat in awe, feeling the last of the ecstacy leave our systems, smoking grass, and reflecting on a truly life changing experience for me at least.<br><br>
Two years on and this trip still has the same resonance as it did that morning.  I now drink once a week or not at all, and have a healthy relationship with all drugs.  That night, ecstacy released me from the past and 2c-b allowed me to look at the future with less jaundiced eyes.  The girl I met for the first time that night is now my girlfriend of some two years standing.  The fact that this wonderful drug is so demonised in the eyes of the general public is disgraceful and I cannot praise highly enough the work that is being done here and by others who have been able to share such an experience.<!-- End Body -->
