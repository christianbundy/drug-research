My friends botched a synthesis of LSD based upon morning glory seed extraction, and ended up with roughly 8 liquid ounces of LSA. I'd always wanted to try LSA, but was afraid to eat morning glory seeds due to the fact that many are coated with poisons, so this looked like a golden opportunity. I dropped five drops from a Visine-type bottle onto two sugar cubes (five drops per cube), and saved them for a rainy day.<br><br>
Well, a day came when it rained and I was alone and bored, so I decided to ingest a half of one. My state of mind at the time of ingestion was the same as it always is with any psychedelic - nervousness, prayer, and a continued conveyance of respect for whatever god I might meet. As experienced users know, dosages are extremely various, and some are just too damned high! I can say that with me, some of the physical effects of any psychedelic are due simply to nerves as I await the powerful psychedelic experience - I am pretty high strung to begin with.<br><br>
I waited for an hour and felt nothing, so I took another whole cube, leaving me with one-half. OOOOPPPPSSSS...then it hit me, and hard. The visuals were intense for a very short period of time, but nothing like a full-blown LSD trip. They crept up on me in a matter of minutes. I knew they could only be from the first half-cube I took, so I expected one hell of a ride. <br><br>
The physical sensations were unbelievably strong, and I felt nausea, coupled with a racing, pounding heart. I also noticed an intense need to urinate, like a vice had tightened on my bladder. As always, these physical sensations caused me undue stress verging on panic. I managed to maintain, though, as I have experienced VERY strong LSD trips, and knew that it would go away eventually. After another hour, the second whole cube kicked in, and it was basically a repeat of the first, but stronger. Thankfully, the physical effects tapered off rather quickly, leaving me to enjoy the very modest visuals for around four hours afterward. <br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> <br><br>
I went to Barnes and Noble, it did not render me incapable of driving, at least after the physical effects lessened, to read books about ancient Egyptian civilization. The pictures of tomb art took on a mystical 'glow,' like a low-level acid trip, and I had that mystical mindset like one gets from being stoned on herb. There were very few trails, and no real sustained auditory or visual hallucinations like with LSD. <br><br>
The closest similarity to acid was that silliness, where I just have to laugh and everything is amusing. For example, I was plopped down in an easy chair, and a family of rednecks (I live in the southern U.S.) stood in front of me, browsing books. Their child, roughly 5-6 yoa, was raising hell, being hyperactive, and generally causing a scene. It was all I could do to stifle the urge to laugh - a few snickers did slip through, and people looked at me like I was a madman, which I felt like, and this caused no anxiety, but instead encouraged my inner giggles. <br><br>
On the whole, LSA was neat, but very dirty in the physical LSD sense. The duration of the trip was not very hallucinogenic, and did not last nearly as long as good LSD. The come-down was easy, and the worst part, the physical discomfort, did not last long at all. For me, LSA is one of those things I am glad to have experienced, but I probably wouldn't do it again.<!-- End Body -->
