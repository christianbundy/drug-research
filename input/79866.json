 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI took ambien one night and feel asleep. Next thing I know I was hit by a train in my car in a train yard. I was sleep driving. It happened for real and my memory of the event is like a dream. It totalled out my car. I lived to tell the horrible side effect story of ambien. Don't do it. It can cause serious problems.\n\n\n"
