 "report": "<p>I had taken zopiclone for recreational use a few times previously and it was always fun, so I figured I would step it up a notch and try taking four 7.5mg pills. </p><p>The first half hour felt about the same as any other time, although oddly, the effect wore off after an hour, but my actions spoke differently, my memory skips hours at a time and apparently I was calling people, talking to my parents without even the slightest clue  of what I said the next morning, I felt no effects at the time of my behavior shift, at the time I thought the pill had worn off and I was back to normal.</p>"
