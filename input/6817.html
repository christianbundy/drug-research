PREPARATION:  I ground 10 grams of Syrian rue seeds in a coffee grinder and put them into a small pot. I added 2 cups water and 1/4 cup lemon juice and one 'emergen C' packet. (Emergen c is an energy supplement that comes in a powdered effervescent formula. It contains high amounts of vitamin c, ascorbic acid, and b vitamins. It can be obtained from any Vitaminworld or GNC.)<br><br>
I brought this mixture to a boil and kept it there for about 5 minutes. I strained off the liquid through a fine mesh permanent coffee filter. Any type of filter would work as long as it keeps the seeds from going through. I then added fresh water, lemon juice, and another emergen c packet in the same proportions to the seeds and repeated the whole process. I combined both batches of liquid into a fresh pot and set it to boil. I discarded the seeds at this point and sat around waiting for the liquid to boil down.<br><br>
I let the liquid boil for about half an hour until all the water and juice had evaporated and a very sticky resin was left. This resin is dark black and smells somewhat like coffee and chocolate.<br><br>
I poured the resin onto a plastic plate and let it sit for about 5-10 min to cool and harden slightly. (Dont touch resin to anything you would not want possibly stained.) Once the resin was still soft and malleable, but not too sticky to touch I rolled it up into a big mass and pinched off small pieces. I rolled all of these small pieces into small balls no larger than a small gumball. I put the balls back onto the plate and put the plate in the freezer to let the balls harden. <br><br>
BODY SETUP: I ate a light breakfast of oatmeal and had a little bit of rice and chicken broth in the morning, but did not eat after 1:30 p.m. Be sure to adhere to the diet restrictions necessary when taking MAOI's. During the whole preparation of the Syrian rue I drank a tea made from dried dandelion and ginger. This tea helps to prevent nausea and calm the stomach.<br><br>
SETTING: I did this at home and prepared the concoction in the afternoon. I took the balls out of the freezer and swallowed them all at 7:40 p.m. just put your head back and down them. If they stay in your mouth too long they taste really bitter.<br><br>
TRIP: After swallowing the Syrian rue balls at 7:40 I waited around for it all to kick in. I felt a little warm and fuzzy after about half an hour, but nothing significant. The trip really didn't start until about 9:30, but once it started it came on hard much like MDMA does. By the time you notice it starting it's almost peaking.<br><br>
Balance and coordination started to become impaired which made walking sorta interesting, similar to alcohol effects. The thing I noticed the most was trails, extreme fucking trails. I had my blacklight on in my room and many things were glowing because of it. Every time I moved my head or turned around there were trails from everything that was glowing on my walls. Also, a funny note, harmine/harmaline must be blacklight responsive because my hands were glowing really bright.<br><br>
It took me the better part of the night to figure out that it must've been from when I was rolling all the resin into balls between my hands. Anyway this also made for great trails because the trail from my hand would glow. I could move my hand in a figure eight and have a steady trail keep the eight there. I didn't really get any CEV's like I had expected. This high seemed to focus around motion. Moving my head around would cause the whole room to spin, slide, or trail.<br><br>
The only frustrating part was that moving around too much did make me feel a little queasy. I felt perfectly fine while laying down though. I never did throw up and didn't really feel sick unless I walked around for too long. The main stomach discomfort was that I was really hungry the whole time since Id eaten so little in order to fast for this. All the effects appeared to have peaked by 10:30 and stayed on strong.<br><br>
I laid down around 11 and closed my eyes. I found it really easy to concentrate and think clearly. I had many great thoughts and strings of ideas. By laying down I sort of fell into a dream like state, I'd say a light REM sleep stage. I awoke at 12:20 with the effects still going strong and decided to eat something. I had a barbecued chicken breast and drank water. I had no problem keeping it down and didn't feel sick at all. I have a feeling I could've eaten earlier, but didn't want to risk it just in case. After eating I laid down again and drifted back into the dream state and stayed there until morning.<br><br>
CONCLUSION:  I awoke the next day feeling very relaxed, happy and satisfied. My mind was a little numb and I was a little groggy, but normal otherwise. It was somewhat hard to concentrate the morning after, but that's the only side effect I had. Overall I consider it a success and enjoyable. No paranoia or sickness, but in general it's too much hassle for the high. Id only do it again to combine it with something else, either with shrooms, acid, or in an ayahuasca brew.<!-- End Body -->
