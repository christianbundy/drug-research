I've suffered w/ backpain for about half a decade.  Soon after the injury, I became addicted to narcotic pain meds.  Then someone told me about methadone.  As I was profoundly uncomfortable, I went to a clinic and they started me on this treatment the following day.  The effects were not immediate, and I started to think this drug was a scam.  About 8 hrs. after ingesting what was possibly the nastiest tasting stuff I ever had, I began to feel that all too familiar warm opiate sensation.  I was beginning a six month love affair.<br><br>
As I was an executive, this drug was indeed a bad choice and for two reasons:  A month or so after starting treatment, I noticed and uncontrollable urge to sleep in the early to late afternoon.  I was starting to sleep 12 to 14 hrs. per night/day.  The second and certainly more troubling side effect was profuse sweating.  When I say profuse, that's exactly what I mean.  My hair was always soaked, I had to bring towels to work and a change of clothes (a new suit) and I told my colleagues I was sweating because of my back pain and the pain meds.  Thankfully, this was believed because I had MRI's to back up my claims.  But it was uncomfortable nonetheless and my coworkers were always complaining about me having the ac jacked up so high.<br><br>
Six months or so into this, I'd had enough.  The people at the clinic were less than pleasant to deal with, and one day I just didn't go.  Yes, I stopped cold turkey.  Another day or so later I was having leg cramps, diarrhea, sweats, anxiety/panic attacks; just pure hell.  This lasted about three days.  I'm currently taking Ultram for my back pain (wonder drug in my opinion) and am doing very well.  Methadone isn't a drug I'd recommend to anyone.<!-- End Body -->
