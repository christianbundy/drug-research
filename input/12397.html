My friend blaine once told me about coricidin, and how you could really trip on it. I though, 'cool, I'll try it', and he came over one day and we walked to Rite Aid and bought two boxes, one for each of us. <br>
After returning home, we each had a box, 15 pills, and left for Adam's. There, we sat around with a few friends who were all clean and me and Blaine started our trip.<br><br>
It started with a light bodybuzz, like after you stand up after sitting down for a while. That was ok, but I wanted something heavier. I don't know when it hit full on, because it hit me faster than Dale Earnhardt at the Daytona 500. I passed out for a second, and then woke up, I asked Blainer if he was feeloing this too, and he said yes.My vision kept tunneling out, like in cartoons. my stomach was upset, and my pupils were extremely dilated. I kept losing my vision, and my hearing. Not much later my legs got light and jellowey, and i couldn't walk without the assistance of my friend Mike. My life flashed before my eyes, and I babbled on about dying and thought I was gonna die right then and there. <br><br>
I was loosing my mind, and I called my mom for a ride home. She told me to start walking, so I said ok. I called her 15 minutews later, forgetting I called her 15 minutes ago, and once again, asked her for a ride home. She knew I was on something and picked up me and Blaine and took us home. All the while, I was expierencing hell, passing out every 2-3 minutes, and an icy hand reaching into my chest, ripping out my soul. I fell asleep at home for maybe an hour, and then Blaine and I were taken to the hospital. I had to get my somach pumped. Let me say that's the worst thing that could have happened to me. Coricidin was hell, pure hell.<!-- End Body -->
