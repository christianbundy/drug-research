 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPlant the seeds, don't consume them. Others have reported fascinating experiences, but mine (seeds consumed as a brew) resulted in a day of sopor, dropping off to resless sleep unexpectedly, and seeing people looking as if their heads were disconnected from their necks. Very unpleasant physical effects, and not worth it.\r\nIt's a beautiful vining flower, and there are other plants that will give you more pleasure when used for internal experiences. It's best to look at, not consume.\n\n\n"
