 "report": "<p>I have anxiety disorders, pretty bad too, I also had a pretty bad drug addiction and while in rehab and the period in which I first stopped using I was plagued with severe panic attacks. I saw the doctor in the clinic and they prescribed me paxil.  </p><p>I have been on it probably for about 3 months now,and every morning and ever so often everything ripples as if you threw a tiny stone into a puddle of water.  I look at the sidewalks and they boil and or ripple.  It is quite a divine sight.  I tried getting stoned while being on this stuff and it is nothing but shit.  My heart races, and it feels as if gravity is angst toward me.  I cannot lift my head, nor any other limb, I am basically incappacitated. And in terms of the non-addictive factor, I feel myself slipping further and further toward being addicted to this drug.</p>"
