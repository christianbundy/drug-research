Late one night, after drinking three beers, I went into a drawer and grabbed the Prozac and Wellbutrin I found behind a refrigerator at my friends house. The expiring date read sometime last year, I'd been taking them for a while before that night and they seemed to make me alert, a little happier but paranoid. So being drunk and all I took both bottles and swallowed every last pill. I had no idea what would happen I don't even remember why i took them. There were no effect from then and twemty minutes later when I fell alseep, it was probably about 9:30pm when I first took them.<br><br>
About 2am or so I woke up, I stood up just remembering what I did that night. I couldn't stand up very long, I fell back onto the bed and looked around, the whole room was like looking through a blurry grid, every thing was rotating back and forth very slowy. I wanted to turn the light on as it was scary but I couldn't make it that far, the doorway didn't look very invited either. So I just laid there and took a short nap. I woke up to my heart throbbing, I couldn't tell how fast it was but it was fast. My eyesight was clear now but I was going to hallucinate for a while, the room then started to light up with colors, but it wasn't a good thing. The colored objects were flying toward me, I felt very threatened, they were bubbles that turned into crab like creatures that would move their pinchers and tentacles around at me, I was touching every one of them so they would vanish.<br><br>
Pretty much anything I did made it worse for me, I closed my eyes but I could see things that were much worse in my eyelids. I found a solution, I ran to the light switch, flipped it, and the room was perfect again. I had some fun with this for a while.. light on, light off.. the dark seemed to trigger my halluciations.<br><br>
The day seemed to drift pass me, I was in the bathroom every hour gagging and throughing up any food I ate or water I drank. I couldn't eat or drink anything for the whole morning, so I watched TV to pass the time. That's when I started to see people in the house, a man was laying down looking right at me while I just sat there. I got up to investigate, he got up and went to my room and I followed him. I searched everywhere for him, he just keep appearing then hiding somewhere or running away from me. I thought this was all real so I kept looking for him, I was very very paranoid of everything, a side effect from the drug overdose. After my parents got home it stopped and I began to calm down. I went to the bathroom and locked the door, a legion of spiders started crawling up my legs and all over me. I got into the shower and started ripping each one off one by one. I washed my hair three times and got out, the shower was covered in spiders. After that I started to realize it was me and there were no people or spiders. I was very sick through out the afternoon, exactly like having a bad fever, I drank some 7up and I was fine.<br><br>
It was a intresting experience, terrible yet good, im sure I'm not gonna try this one again. I could feel my personality was temporarily changed, I had some images in my head of murder and suicide, nothing I ever had before. The worst side effect was the paranoia that lasted a week after. If you're wondering this was my first experience with drugs, I'm only seventeen hopefully there will be better ones in the future.<!-- End Body -->
