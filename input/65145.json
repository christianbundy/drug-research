 "report": "<p>My Doctor put me on Tramadol after arthritis of the spine left me unable to walk or even move without pain.  My dosage was 50 mlg three times a day.  The drug worked to relieve my pain within hours.  I felt like a new woman.</p><p>A month later, feeling like Superwoman, I took two Tramadol at once and moved 5 yards of mulch.  The next week-end I repeated the same.  After taking the larger dose I realized it also did wonders for my depression, and began taking two Tramadol at once and a third in the afternoon.  This is not a large dose, but I did this for 7 months.  </p><p>My family and co-workers started telling me I was acting different, that I wasn't fun anymore, and my looks went drastically down hill.  I was worried.  I started to wean myself, but felt like Speed withdrawal from the 70's.  Grinding teeth, sweating chills, skin crawling, eyes wide open while trying to rest...Awful.  I'm a week into being off it and I'm still shaking and sleepless.  I later got injections of cortizone in my spine and there's no pain, except the physical pain of this Tramadol turning me inside out.  I've lost a week of work and maybe my job.</p>"
