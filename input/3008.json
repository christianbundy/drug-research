 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nRolls (E, beans, whatever you call them) lost their magic for me REAL fast.  the first time I took one, I was in heaven.  Like it says on the effects page, I wanted nothing more than to come off and eat another one.  I thought 'this is how i want to feel ALL the time.'  I was super confident, funnier than usual, very open, sweet, and of course, the 'I love you, man...'   It was sweet.  <br>But soon after I needed two to get me where one took me.  ridiculously (may I emphasize RIDICULOUSLY) soon after, 2 wouldn't cut it and I'd need three.  When you're in highschool and mooching off your parents... wasting anywhere from 30-60 bucks in one night (maybe more, depending on where you're going, what you're doing, etc...) can raise a lot of questions for your parents.  Besides, no one wants to be wasting that much money chronically and not have anything to show for it.  <br>On TOP of all this, they just weren't putting me in that wonderful place anymore.  I'd be at that peak for 5 minutes then come down and be real depressed then peak up again for another 10 minutes and then back down.  It was an emotional rollercoaster of the worst kind in a pill.  And the mornings-after just kept getting worse and worse.  I felt absolutely brain dead after a while.  I didn't wanna turn into some of my friends who've taken way too much E and is evident in their behavior, slow talking, and new-found slurs.  <br>That's how rolls lost their magic for me.  *tada*\n\n\n"
