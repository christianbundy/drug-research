 "report": "<p>\nAn interesting note on Methoxy. During my first dose over 25 mg, I noticed all sounds had a lower pitch. Much lower. During most trips where I dosed over 20 mgs, and all trips where I dose over 30 mgs, I have noticed the same effect. Two other people that I know experienced the same thing. None of the reports or faqs on Methoxy reported this, which I found it strange, thus I am writing this little note. Minutes ago, while reading the TiHKAL entry on DIPT, I saw reported that it is a common effect with that drug. I suppose that's what is happening to me and my friends.</p>"
