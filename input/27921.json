 "report": "<p>Upon initial dose (300mg) no effect was noticed, however after the second dose (300mg approx 2 hrs later) there was a definite increase in social activity while making even the most uncomfortable position feel like sitting on my favorite chair. </p><p>Third dose (300mg) was taken about 3 hrs later about 1.5 hours before sleepytime which resulted in about 8 hrs of sleeping 'like a rock' as my fiance would say.</p><p>The next morning there was a bit of a zombie floaty feeling but not much other after-effect.  Just after waking up, the first dose of the day was 600mg which produced extremely hightened social activity as well as a bit of a visual 'trip' which came and went about every 15min or so and never lasted more than a half an hour.  These effects lasted most of the day (approx 8 to 10 hrs) and trickled off just about the time i was getting ready for bed. </p><p>Next morning I felt great, well rested, didn't seem to have any after effects.</p><p>*all doses taken with cola which seems to help expedite the absorbtion process.</p>"
