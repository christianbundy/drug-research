A day ago, I got in a fairly serious car accident. Physical injury was minimal, I didn't have any problems besides six staples in my scalp and a sore knee from kicking my door open... but from the looks of the accident and how hard I got hit (70mph), everyone expected to me to be pretty sore the next day.<br><br>
To make a long story short, I'm not in much pain at all, and that leaves me with a full bottle of Vicodin and a whole bottle of Soma at my disposal. At about 9:30 I injested two 5mg Vicodin tablets, rolled up a blunt, and started watching Adult Swim. Half an hour later, I injested two 350mg Soma tablets, and half an hour after that smoked my blunt.<br><br>
I'm a fairly experienced pot smoker, and no stranger to vicodin. It takes a good quantity of either one to really fade me, and combined the effects of the two typically seemed to negate each other. This is the first time I had even heard of Soma, but I had been taking it the whole day before, combined with the Vicodin; just like they had given it to me at the hospital. That combination produced the expected floating sensation... but not as much as it just made me extremely drowsy.<br><br>
Anyway, after I smoked my blunt I started working in Fruity Loops on my laptop... and the next thing I know I get an instant message and realize it's a  quarter until two in the morning, and I missed Family Guy.<br><br>
In Fruity Loops I had made a little bit of progress on the instrumental, but definitely not 3 hours worth. I chase the whole experience with another one of the Vicodin and smoke a cigarette.<br><br>
Soma by itself didn't have much kick... but something about the weed brought about some nice effects.<!-- End Body -->
