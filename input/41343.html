I tried kratom for the first time today.  I'm an overnight shift worker and a frustrated stoner, because I can't risk the piss test.  I've been looking around for legal substances that do the same thing and might help me to sleep at the same time.<br><br>
I ordered some kratom over the internet, after having looked over others' experiences.  I tried tea earlier today, about 1/4 cup which I'd run through the coffee grinder until it was a fine powder.  I added it to my sleepytime tea as a loose powder.  The taste was FOUL.  It's so bitter that it made me gag up a mouthful, and it was all I could do to keep it down.  I did, however, feel a bit sleepy after something like half an hour after I took the dose.  I stayed up an additional half hour to see if I was going to have any adverse effects, and then I went to sleep.  I slept like a baby.<br><br>
Tonight I decided I'd try it again, this time in apple sauce instead of tea.  Apple sauce helps, because I can mix it in and then swallow without chewing.  It worked.  The taste wasn't so bad, and I didn't have to keep it in my mouth long at any rate.  I used more, about 1/2 cup, again run through the coffee grinder.  Again, I began to come on in half an hour.  This time, though, I had nausea.  It wasn't so bad for an hour, but I felt a little giddy, and my balance wasn't what it should have been.  Then the nausea got worse.  I had to run to the bathroom and throw the whole thing up.  As the man said, though, it wasn't as unpleasant as stomach flu or a night of tying one on.<br><br>
I'm still comfortable, and not feeling very sick, although I'd say that I'm getting mild waves of it now and then.  It's been about two hours now.<br><br>
I don't expect it to get much more than this, although there's a possibility that I could have to clear the rest out of my stomach at some stage.  <br><br>
Frankly, it's more trouble than just rolling a spliff and getting stoned.  I'd rather find something as user-friendly as pot without the risk of it being detected in a urine test.<!-- End Body -->
