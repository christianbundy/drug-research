My friends have all tripped off Dramamine but I had yet to try it.  I always figured that the damage to my brain wouldn't be worth the trip.  As time went on and I got bored of pot, after I gave up on LSD, and after many drugs, I became interested in diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate type trips.  I bought a bottle of 100 pills of Benedryl (diphenhydramine).  I told myself I could always use them for sleeping pills if I didn't use them recreationally (diphenhydramine is also sold as OTC sleeping pills).  I went to my friends house and told him what I was planning on doing and he wanted in too.  <br><br>
We each took 16 pills right off the bat.  I have talked to many people who have done it and have read many trip reports on it.  After I wasn't getting many effect, I took 2 more pills, totally 18.<br><br>
The first effects I started to notice was a slight head change, and an increased-gravity feeling.  I soon started noticing slight waving in the ceiling, walls, etc.  I went outside to have a cigarette and I set it down to take a piss.  When I went to grab it again, I was frustrated by not being able to get the damn cobwebs on my cigarette.  I realized it was just the smoke from the cig; I shook my head in disbelief and continued smoking.  After we went inside, I kept seeing those damn cobwebs in my cup of water and all over.  I kept seeing flies all over too, but I knew they weren't really flies.  <br><br>
I did get one weird hallucination when I was looking at my friends who were sitting around chatting.  This girl had a toothpick in her mouth while she was talking.  The tooth pick simply flew out of her mouth, flipped in the air, and landed right in front of me on my friends leg.  I laughed, but then I realized there wasn't a toothpick on his leg.  Then I remembered she never had a toothpick in her mouth.  I told this story to my friends and they all laughed and just said 'He's fucked up.'  When laying on the ground, I say spiders lowering themselves from the ceiling towards my face.  I was a little shocked, but intrigued, not scared though, because I knew they weren't real.<br><br>
After we tried to go to sleep a couple ours later, I had a tough time.  I kept dreaming/hallucinating, that my friend who was in the room with me, and others who weren't even there, were talking to me.  As soon as I tried to answer them, I would come to realization that I was imagining it.  One in particular one that is stuck in my head came when I first lay down.  My friend walked back to the couch from the kitchen and said 'Do you want some chips and dip?  I have some chips and there's dip on the table.'  I was confused.  I didn't know if he really said it or not.  I asked 'What did you just say?'  He replied saying he didn't even say anything and that he was almost asleep.  This kind of stuff went on all night.  I also had a tough time getting around.  My coordination was off.  When I went to grab things, or set something on the table, I was completely off.<br><br>
In the morning I felt fine.  I didn't feel wasted or anything.  I had a pretty fun time, although it was nothing special.<!-- End Body -->
