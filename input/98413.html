I had heard that you could have a psychedelic trip on Ambien and prior to this event I was doubtful because the little effects I had were lack of coordination and a slight dissociative feeling but nothing too impressive.  I was after the real trip I had heard about.<br><br>
12:00 Am I popped two ten miligram pills in the living room and was not getting the desired 'trippy' effet.<br><br>
12:30 I had heard snorting the pill delivers a much stronger effect, so I crushed up the last ten milligram pill and snorted it, which brought me to 30 milligrams total.<br><br>
Around 12:45-? Because Ambien is a time warp, I cannot remember when the effects kicked in, but boy they did!  <br><br>
The room suddenly expanded and walls began to breath and I felt very disassociated I decided to go for a walk on a semi busy road (somewhat dangerous) and as I walked in the middle of the street the Ambien visuals really kicked in.  <br><br>
They are very hard to describe because they are subtle, almost like a thin shadow of a visual I would see on a traditional psychedelic, but very intense in it's own right when stared at directly  <br><br>
They appeared as thin and grey and expanded outwards towards me until they froze and became brittle, at which point they would drift away and break like cobwebs.  I remember stepping over the ballooning, bubbling visuals on the asphalt like I would fall in 'quick sand' and swatting at others to watch them break away.  A short trip down the road almost had me lost, which caused great concern save for the landmark of a local school.<br><br>
That guided me home.<br><br>
1:00 AM--When I returned home paranoia got the better of me and I kept seeing 'shadow people'. For instance any blanket or big cushion laying on the couch took the form of a person and I really believed they were people for a short while. I calmed down once I convinced myself that it was just me in the room, though it was a hard feeling to shake.  When I went to the toilet I viewed the most impressive visual of all--n ever expanding psychedelic bubble three feet deep expanding from the toilet bowl made out of the same greyish substance described earlier.<br><br>
Aftermath next day--I am shocked I didn't alert neighbors or wake up my mother who I was staying with.  I ate an entire box of cream chipped beef and had no memory of it.<!-- End Body -->
