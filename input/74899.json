 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Facts:<br>I'll note that the only thing I am prescribe of this concoction is Lexapro which I got on a little over a year ago after spending several years on St. John's Wort & other remedies for a diagnosis of PTSD & moderate depression.<br>I'm familiar with many substances from E to Acid to AMT to Shrooms & Herb.  Years since I've been into that or any hard stuff. I'm more interested now in nootropics (smart drugs) for day to day life enhancement.  <br>So my pops was away for a day to attend a seminar on Huntington's Disease (if any of you are familiar, it explains my interest in nootropics) so I decided to take a day concocting a mix of supplies I had on hand.<br>Experience:<br>8:00 am - 200mg Modafinil<br>Modafinil is a fantastic substance almost a dream drug but one of the few downsides is that its effects taper with long term usage.  If used daily for a month its only about half as effective.  But this was a recent acquisition for me and I hadn't taken any in about 6 wks or so.  20 mins after I popped the pills, I began to feel the usual warm awareness & slight euphoria bubble up.  I listened to some music which can sound a lot better on modafinil & messed around a bit on the comp.<br>10:00 am - 100mg Modafinil, 800mg Oxiracetam<br>This is way better than folgers in your cup.  Just a little booster to keep the morning cruisin. Oxiracetem works gives me a little kick in the pants (motivation/energy) not on the level of modafinil but it adds lucidity too.  After a little while of flying through some chores, and a lot of errands my responsibilities are done so....<br>1:30 pm- 4 mg Lorazepan<br>This turns out to be not what I expect.  I know I had done it once upon a time long long ago & it seemed pretty fantastical.  Unfortunately about all I really noticed was a return to nomal energy level & total lack of anxiety (might've killed any possible post-modafinil shakiness) but no real body high or any high of any kind that I'd remembered. Minor downer...<br>4:00 pm - 1g Phenibut & 100mg Modafinil<br>In an attempt to finish my gumbotrip on a brigher note I add 1g of Phenibut & 1 more pill of moda.  Managed to give the trip an oxymoronic feel.  Chilled out with the lorazepam & phenibut but still amp'd from the modafinil booster.<br>It was pretty good all in all. I was totally coherent & functional & slight more than happy for the whole day.  Though I'd expected the lorazepam to have a larger effect,  So not mind blowing though If someone boxed this combo as a workweek survival kit I'd be first in line.<br>Carry on!\n\n\n"
