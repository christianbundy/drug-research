2mg +or- 1mg<br><br>
T+0.00 4:30pm: Took 2mg of Powdered 2C-P orally. <br><br>
T+1.00 5:30pm: Effect onset, first signs of anything different. Started feeling heavy, no visuals yet<br><br>
T+1.10 5:40pm: Effects intensifying, slight short bursts of nausea can be felt, although not troublesome or debilitating. <br><br>
T+1.22 5:52pm: Effects intensifying at a constant rate, decided to start a Trip report. Still feeling coherent and clear-minded if not sluggish. Still no visuals, although a slight haze and film grain is present. Body feels constantly heavier than onset. Decided to open the window on my fourth floor apartment.<br><br>
T+1.30 6:00: Effects still intensifying at a constant rate. Very fascinated at the wind on the lake behind my apartment, not expecting any visuals any time soon, besides the haze and film grain. I am starting to feel head pressure very faintly, I am going to walk outside soon with my room mate. I am feeling very passionate about the things I love, I am very loving and very, if this sounds odd cute right now. Im not sure of any other way to explain it.<br><br>
T+1.40 6:10pm : Effects STILL intensifying, As of right now, I am feeling more body sensations and fuzzy visuals, but at least my mind is still very clear and coherent. This is a very inspirational drug, I feel very emotional and aware. Not very paranoid, but sort of just acceptance of anything that could and can happen. Loud Noises SCARE me, but if I reflect on them I get over being scared. My thought patterns cant really be pin-pointed yet, although I am feeling rather on-the-fly or random. I feel as if the big problems in my life are gone, and I can look at things I want really badly, and be alright with not having them right now <br><br>
T+2.00 6:30pm: Getting distracted doing the trip report, feeling a huge urge to write and express my feelings as fast as I can because I am getting so distracted with some things. After reading my last entry, I can say that I am more open to expressing my deepest secret thoughts, but only on a word document.  (Later note: I am going to keep the things I wrote out of this report but I want it known that I wrote almost 2 pages of some of my deepest thoughts that are troubling me. This is a writers drug.)<br><br>
T+4.00 8:30pm. I walked around with my room mate for awhile, having some smokes. He took a lot more than me, but I want to focus on myself. I was amazed that the peak is this stable for so long. Its literally been the same, no matter what. Its fantastic. I love the feeling like this is never going to go away. I re-read the things I wrote earlier. I have to say that it still makes sense. Although tomorrow, I might not be able to read it. I thought psychedelics were going to be a disaster for me, with my deep thoughts such as that. But it isnt, Im almost really insightful. Focusing on things physically is hard, things blur in and out. While we were walking, I became almost tired. Im worried this trip report isnt going to be useful, but Ill try my best as Im technically trip-sitting my room mate, who did 10mg instead of my 1-2mg. All in all, this is fantastic. Ill try to do another check-up later. Anyways, Im out.<br><br>
T+5.00 9:30pm. The effects have almost totally worn off. I dont have much to say, I have low drive for writing.<br><br>
Conclusions: Notice my increased drive to write during the peak,. An interesting note is how I wasnt very aware of the comedown, which was probably because of my small dose.  Looking back, I have almost no memory loss. The entire time my mind remained clear even with the distractions of body sensations. All in all, it was a very uplifting experience, and very positive.<!-- End Body -->
