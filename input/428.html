my sister and i decided to get what we thought might be a 'high' one night in december and nearly died. i decided to take 16 caffeine pills with a 200 mg amount of caffeine in each pill (equivalent to 2 cups of coffee) and drink a diet coke. my sister liked the idea because she thought it might be like speed. it was like hell. i shit three times i peed like a race horse about three times. i also thought maybe consuming some good h2o and some nourishing food might help but everything that went into my body came back up. i had an intense headache and body temperature that seemed to range from boiling to arctic freezing. i reached a point where i could not stop tremoring or shaking and my heart was pounding out of my chest. i really thought i was going to die. my sister had taken half the amount that i did and saw what i was going through. i had called an ambulance and was carried out in a stretcher and just about bounced out out of it from being unable to keep still. on the way to the hospital i blacked in and out and the blackouts got longer and longer. i was given numerous amounts of shots and hooked up to hooplas of equipment and was told to drink charcoal or i would die. my sister, i later found out went through the same thing just when i was hooked up to all of the monitors and what not. we were both told that we could have died from the amount of caffeine that we had taken. <br><br>
my reason for telling this to whomever is reading it would be, be aware of what how much something can do to you. i just thought i would be very awake. it turns out i was almost asleep permanently.<!-- End Body -->
