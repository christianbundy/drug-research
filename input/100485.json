 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI picked up two white ecstasy pills with a glock/pistol logo on them off my friend who tried them, and said they made her trip out sort of like 5-MeO-DiPT made her feel but stronger.  She said the person who gave them to her said they were laced with LSD. I find this very hard to believe.  \r\nBut being curious, and seeing as she did not like or want them, I purchased them from her for five bucks.  Online reports have reported some of these to contain piperazines (although never tested) and one report suspected it contained a 2C- base with low MDxx content.  Other reports said they were great.  All I have learned is, pills are different everywhere, and hopefully it isnt piperazine.  Nausea is no fun.\r\nIt's a Tuesday, Im home alone until Im guessing at least 6pm. I'm kind of nervous, but thats to be expected when you dont know exactly what youre taking.  \r\n2:24pm  Swallowed both with a cup of OJ\r\n2:34  The usual butterflies in my stomach I get after taking pills is present\r\n2:44  Mild nausea, feeling very slightly off baseline.  Going to go take a hit from the bong to help my tummy\r\n2:54  Go to the bathroom to throw up.  Lasts about a minute.\r\n2:58  Eyes feel sort of tight, if that makes sense.  Starting to notice very slight visual distortions.  Nausea is mostly gone.\r\n3:04  feeling simultaneously hot and cold, mainly on my back.  Probably just sunburnt.  No change in visuals\r\n3:25  Nausea stays at about a 3.5 (of 10), occasionally moving up to a 6.5, but I havent thrown up again.  The visuals stay at the point where it feels like youre about to start a mushroom trip, but havent quite begun.  Just minor blurring out of the corner of my sight and what not.  Head feels slightly foggy.\r\n3:28  Just had one of those full body pulses that rises up to the eyes, that usual happens to me on mushrooms or a fair amount of MDMA, although I feel almost no MDMA effects.  Maybe this is starting to pick up. \r\n*After this point, nothing new happened, just nausea and the occasional body pulse and slight visual distortions*\r\nI felt fine the next day.  My official guess on what the substance is, is going to be 5-MeO-DiPT.  It made me feel just like it, and it tasted just as chemically and gross on purging it up.\r\nI do not recommend taking a substance if you are not sure what is in it, a better idea would have been for me to buy a test kit, but I didnt have the time.\r\n-DSR\n\n\n"
