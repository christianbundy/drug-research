I've consumed about 15 grams of this total, and I'm satisfied with the effects, but obviously wary.<br><br>
As far as insufflation goes, it's really not so bad. The euphoria hits in within 10 minutes, and it's a nice way to start off the inevitable binge. But it's definitely caustic, and I wouldn't recommend snorting it on a regular basis. <br><br>
My typical experience goes like this:<br>
I look for some sort of vitamin capsule or something of the like, empty it, and fill it with the powder. If it doesn't get me high in 30 minutes, I take more (Very scientific I know). Some people say 50-90 mgs is good for them, but I prefer around 200 for a single dose.<br><br>
Early on in my experience with mephedrone, there were hardly any noticeable effects leading up to the high, but these days I notice that anxiety sets in during that waiting period. I also tend to get the runs. The high is very clear-headed and bright. It lasts a few hours without redosing. The empathy is nice, but the explosive euphoria is much better. Redosing doesn't bring the peak back, but keeps me at a relatively elevated state. I consider it a pretty heroic accomplishment to avoid redosing. 4 out of 5 times I will redose at least once, probably a few times. <br><br>
I don't experience the short-term memory issues which appear to be common. There is a clamminess to my limbs after the peak, but I've never gotten any blue tone. One thing to note is the intense painkilling. I mean if I am sitting in a shower with nothing but steaming hot water turned on,  I am not going to notice it. So I'd watch out.<br><br>
One very odd thing that happens to me is that, after long binges, there's this disturbing but temporary effect (lasting a couple hours or so) on my mind. Confusion is the best way to describe it. I'm unable to internalize certain thoughts such as 'what am I doing and why?' Everything becomes alien and information turns to white noise. Interestingly enough, I took ginkgo biloba for it one day, and it was actually very effective. Just a tip for anyone who experiences whatever that is, mild serotonin syndrome maybe?  In any case, going on a long binge is retarded.<br><br>
As for the comedown, it widely varies. It can be suicidal to non-existent. Tramadol is extremely effective for me. It usually gets rid of it altogether.<br><br>
The next day, I smell very pungent, like a mephedrone factory, so take a shower. Also, I notice my skin tends to take an odd tone for a while. That's basically the gist of it.<br><br>
(P.S. I would avoid.. masturbation..)<!-- End Body -->
