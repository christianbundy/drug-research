 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI wanted a substance that was a mild mood enhance for a long time. I have read a lot about GHB and I thought that was the one for me. A replacement for alcohol without the hangover. I wasnt afraid of it being addictive, bc I just wanted it for some weekends, not for everyday. \r\nI finally got some GHB, in GBL form, that was sold as a solvent when it was legal. \r\nI took 30 and 40 drops a few times and I only got a mild buzz, roughly equivalent to two beers. It took me a while to increase dosage, because I know that the dosage curve can be unexpectedly steep. But yesterday I thought I'd do it, and I took 60 drops, mixed with water, which I drunk in a period of five minutes. \r\nI got a very pleasant buzz after 40 minutes, that I certainly enjoyed, not a problem with that, it made me keep a constant grin and feel a pretty pleasant physical sensation. The effect lasted for about one hour only. The downturn came two hours later (actually it happened every time I took it, even when I did 30 drops). I became very irritable and moody. I could actually clearly sense the pendulum effect that I get with most drugs, in which I have to pay my high with a low mood afterwards. This happened every time I took it. Furthermore, I get a weird mild pain in what I think is my kidneys the day after. That's scary because the kidneys are a major energy producer according to chinese medicine. \r\nThis is my report. I bothered writing it because I never read this type of thing about GHB and I could clearly sense the irritability (specially to noises) and the pain in my kidney area. \r\nI regret this fact, because I would still love a mood enhancer for specific situations, like nights out, or for facing a creative project. Ill keep trying. \r\nEnjoy your trips and take care of yourself\n\n\n"
