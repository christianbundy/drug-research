 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n'Ride the dragon, walk with the dragon, or lead the dragon; but never chase the dragon.'<br>A little bio, I am about 200 pounds, male, an also recovering addict. I have experience with several other drugs and RCs, but MDPV had really taken hold of me in the past, been a very fiendish MDPV user in the past, which always results in a horrid crash followed by days of agony and craving. <br>The title says it all. MDPV is indeed the pitbull of RCs, it is all about the way I treat the drug. In the past I had binged on tan PV and slipped into a psychotic state. <br>ººººº/M/D/P/V//D/E/S/C/R/I/P/T.》1 Gram《<br>》Strong semen-like smell.《<br>》Consistancy is a very odd《 fluffy/crystalline white powder.<br>》MDPV \nºººººººººººººººººººººººººººººººº<br>★★★★★Supplies★★★★★<br>A banana for each of us to eat tonight. <br>24 Pack of 12 oz water bottles. <br>For us to drink every 2 hours.<br>10MG(M) and 5MG(F)for every 2 hours until 6:00AM<br>A bong along with \n6x 25mg Benadryl<br>×××××Testing the MDPV×××××<br>[00:00]>15mg  insuffiated<br>[00:15]> Euphoria is strong, but nothing like Tan MDPV<br>[00:30]>Going to use this focus to draw up a plan for me and my fiance.<br>[01:00] Still strongly mentally stimulated as well as physically.<br>[02:00]Comedown left me wanting 'just one more line!!'<br>I'm fighting the urge, I know I won't regret that. <br>♣♣♣♣♣Mission♣♣♣♣♣♣<br>1▪ Determine whether I can resist the urge to redose. <br>/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>★Yes, DO NOT CHASE THAT EUPHORIA★<br>2▪To find a comfortable dose and intervals to redose at.<br>/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>★5-10MG every 2 hours with a bottle of water for every line★<br>3▪Find a good dose to treat my ADHD with.<br>/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/<br>★15MG orally at 5AM and then at 12PM makes my job extremely pleasant with no bad side effects.
