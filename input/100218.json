 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n'Ride the dragon, walk with the dragon, or lead the dragon; but never chase the dragon.'\r\nA little bio, I am about 200 pounds, male, an also recovering addict. I have experience with several other drugs and RCs, but MDPV had really taken hold of me in the past, been a very fiendish MDPV user in the past, which always results in a horrid crash followed by days of agony and craving. \r\nThe title says it all. MDPV is indeed the pitbull of RCs, it is all about the way I treat the drug. In the past I had binged on tan PV and slipped into a psychotic state. \r\nººººº/M/D/P/V//D/E/S/C/R/I/P/T.》1 Gram《\r\n》Strong semen-like smell.《\r\n》Consistancy is a very odd《 fluffy/crystalline white powder.\r\n》MDPV \nºººººººººººººººººººººººººººººººº\r\n★★★★★Supplies★★★★★\r\nA banana for each of us to eat tonight. \r\n24 Pack of 12 oz water bottles. \r\nFor us to drink every 2 hours.\r\n10MG(M) and 5MG(F)for every 2 hours until 6:00AM\r\nA bong along with \n6x 25mg Benadryl\r\n×××××Testing the MDPV×××××\r\n[00:00]>15mg  insuffiated\r\n[00:15]> Euphoria is strong, but nothing like Tan MDPV\r\n[00:30]>Going to use this focus to draw up a plan for me and my fiance.\r\n[01:00] Still strongly mentally stimulated as well as physically.\r\n[02:00]Comedown left me wanting 'just one more line!!'\r\nI'm fighting the urge, I know I won't regret that. \r\n♣♣♣♣♣Mission♣♣♣♣♣♣\r\n1▪ Determine whether I can resist the urge to redose. \r\n/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/\r\n★Yes, DO NOT CHASE THAT EUPHORIA★\r\n2▪To find a comfortable dose and intervals to redose at.\r\n/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/\r\n★5-10MG every 2 hours with a bottle of water for every line★\r\n3▪Find a good dose to treat my ADHD with.\r\n/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/\r\n★15MG orally at 5AM and then at 12PM makes my job extremely pleasant with no bad side effects.
