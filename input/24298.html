This past week, a friend and I decided to get some cocaine and MDMA.  So we picked it up.  We picked up our stuff and got 2 smilie pills.  We ate them around 7:30.  They were sorta round and tasted HORRIBLE!  Not to mention the press was one of the worst I've seen.  I almost gagged on the pill when it touched my tongue! I figured that it was just some sort of an outer casing or something, not really caring a whole lot.  Btw, I live in NY.<br><br>
Coming up I noticed I was EXTREMELY hyper.  After a half hour or so we did some more blow and we just kinda roamed around for a bit.  I was still under the impression that it was E, so I guess I tricked myself into thinking I was really happy or something, but I noticed that it was far too trippy then normal MDMA.  I asked what the hell was happening and my friend said that we probably weren't used to good MDMA any more so this should sort of be normal.<br><br>
He was wrong.<br><br>
I went home around 12 or so and turned on my computer.  Everything was alive and moving.  'Shit' I think to myself, 'this is FAR too trippy.'  Having to get up for work the next morning around 6:40 I decided to take some sleeping pills.  As I layed in my bed I got astounding visuals which were very 5-MeO-DiPT like.  I can tell the difference between the two drugs by the body load and the CEVs.  If those don't answer my questions, the trip length is a dead give away.  I eventually took some some Simply Sleep pills to try and get to some rest in hopes I could make it to work - no dice.<br><br>
I spent the entire night and most the next morning in my bed tripping.  I had to miss work (very annoying) and played sick.  The trip eventually ended around 11am and I then I finally passed out thanks to a second dose of Simply Sleep.<br><br>
My advice:  be careful of what you buy and who you buy from.  If it looks fishy - it probably is.<!-- End Body -->
