The day started with a caffeine pill (200mg) in the morning to wake me up for school.  I got a pleasant feeling from it, and once it wore off around noon I took another.  That started the buzz again, and kept me energetic until about 8.  <br><br>
I remembered I had some of those Coridicin Cough &amp; Cold pills in my dresser from a long time ago.  I thought I only had 4, but I found another half-package in there.  I figured what the heck, might as well get rid of all of them.  I took a caffeine pill at about 1:15 to make sure I would stay awake long enough for the DXM to kick in(in CCC it always takes an hour and a half almost on the dot).  Then at 1:45 I took 4 CCC, and every 5 minutes after took 4 more until they were gone (10 minutes total).<br><br>
I chatted on IRC for quite a while.  There was no school the next day because of a snowstorm.  A friend signed on MSN and I talked with him all the way up until the DXM hit me.  I could feel it coming on, feeling good, no nausea whatsoever(unusual).  Then it kept getting stronger and stronger. <br><br>
I never felt anything like it before in my life.  Soon it was like I couldn't breathe.  I started panicking.  I stood up, and ran to the kitchen for some water. <br><br>
Amazingly I had no trouble with coordination, another unusual aspect of the trip.  <br>
By the time I made it to the kitchen(like 7 feet away), and got a glass out of the cupboard, I couldn't hardly stand up.  I couldn't focus my eyes without really really trying.(never happened to me before)<br><br>
Then I heard a REALLY loud ringing pulsing in my ears, and my whole head was throbbing.  By then my heart was racing a hundred miles an hour, and I thought I was going to die for sure.  I could barely manage to swallow any water, I almost gagged on it.  I decided I didn't want to pass out and make a huge noise in the kitchen, JUST IN CASE I somehow managed to make it through this.  <br><br>
So I half-ran-stumbled (still couldn't focus) back to my room, and dove for my bed.  As soon as I hit the bed, I grabbed the blankets and wrapped them around me REALLY REALLY tight.  I don't recall doing this consciously, it just sort of happened.  And then I began to breathe huge breaths as fast as I could.  <br><br>
And just like that it was over.  As soon as I started breathing really hard it just went away, and I was back to normal.  I was no longer feeling anything of the dxm except things still looked the way they do on DXM.  But my thoughts returned to my norm, and everything was ok.<br><br>
This scared the living daylights out of me.  I will NEVER take CCC again, much less take caffeine before tripping on dxm.  I have tripped many a time on dxm, even those nasty CCC pills, and nothing even remotely like this has happened.  I was sure glad to be alive though.  I crashed about 2 minutes later and slept until 1:30pm.<br><br>
The span of those events from the time I started panicking until the time it was all over was not even 5 minutes.  But I have never been so afraid in all my life.<br><br>
The next day I was completely drained.  I didn't want to move at all.. all day long I just laid on the couch and watched TV.  Barely able to keep my eyes open.  I did take a few naps here and there for a few hours at a time each.  All in all, it was an experience I will never forget, and never want to repeat.<!-- End Body -->
