Put about 12mg in a spoon with 30 units of water. Put lighter under spoon, all disolves well and clean.<br><br>
I think that this may be a bit much for a first try via this route of admin. so I shot about half and waited... I didn't have to wait long! Think like being on 50 acid tabs at the same time in 30 sec short, with still a needle in your arm and all the coulors of the rainbow riding waves and plusations over what would otherwise be my sink if the object I percivied were the actual objects themselves. <br><br>
I got anough control over my self to take out the seringe, cap it, put everything in a bag and threw it at the bottom of the medecine cabinet. The next hour or so was hell, physically and psychologically; I vomited 3-4 times and it seemed to help. My body seemed hell-bent on getting rid of all that nice mucus I had stored up from years of smoking; and in those times, let me tell you; what the body needs, the body gets. So with all the mucus, the vomiting and the fear of dying, it got pretty disgusting. <br><br>
Psychologically, on the other hand, I would say that it was a very interesting and worthwile experience, just start with WAY lower dosages than I did when using the IV route. Be accompanied by someone who is qualified to detect signs of trouble before trouble does arise. In my case, I was lucky. A good milligram scale is a must.<br><br>
Ciao, it is 4 and a half hours after, I can still feel it, but it's now 95% over, so good night lads and lasses,<br><br>
