About two months ago, I decided to combine a massive dose of 35x salvia with one hit of good acid. So, right when I was peaking, I took the hit of salvia. I was instantly 5-10 mins ahead. The last thing I remembered was a large fractaline, mirrorlike, shield in front of me. Slowly but surely, it rearranged itself into my normal vision. I forgot everything I had ever learned. My memory for language came back rather quickly. All of my life's memories...gone. I didn't know who I was, nor anyone else in the room, and no idea how I got there. I went around, asking my tripping friend about my life. 'How often do I do this? How long have I known you? How did we meet?' <br><br>
At this point, I was in the strangest and most fucked up of all places in my mind, tripping BALLS! Not sure that I can quite describe it. I'll never touch salvia ever again. The amnesia took about 3 hours to end and start to remember things again. This was the worst experience of my life. Later on, we went out to the beach during a tropical storm (the plan the whole time), where I had one of my best trips. The raging sea during a tropical storm while you are way out on a pier with waves crashing onto it is a very very amazing experience. So I got the worst and the best out of one trip. I'm never smoking salvia again. Maybe acid, but never salvia. I'm really not too enthusiastic about acid either, now.<!-- End Body -->
