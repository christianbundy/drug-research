So I go to the two local 'head shops' as I like to call them, they sell legal highs from salvia, amanita muscaria, lettuce/hemp mixes and various herbal tablets that are supposed to mimic the effects of ecstasy and other drugs. I bought a 10ml bottle of liquid gold iso-butyl nitrite and tested it later in the day. Up to this point I have regularly done 20-40mg of methylphenidate in thick lines daily for over a year. The first two times I used the popper's I got a really banging headache and could hear my blood pulsing in my head. After these times I became fine with popper's, a warmth is felt rushing all over my body and the short rush of oxygen reaching the brain lasts a minute or two.<br><br>
I proceeded to test out why my first experiences were so bad. I took my usual dose of ritalin for a week then tried the popper's again, and again the intense pressure was felt leaving a headache. so I stopped taking the ritalin for a week and then did the poppers and had a great experience. I conclude that the vasodilatation or increased oxygen in my brain from popper's had countered the constriction of blood supply to my brain from regular methylphenidate use. now I only wonder what the hell using ritalin does to the supply of blood and markedly oxygen supplied to the brain and the obvious negative effects I feel this could present.<!-- End Body -->
