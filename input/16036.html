The week before my experience I was in the pub talking a friend who had supplied me with Salvia before. He said he might be able to get hold of some mushrooms from the season previous, and asked me if I was interested. I hadnt taken mushrooms before and had only had a mild LSD trip a few months previous. I really wanted to trip again though so I told him I would be back next week with the money.<br><br>
I got the pub around 7 and started drinking. My alcohol tolerance is pretty low, so it wasnt long before I was drunk. Salvia guy turned up with my mushrooms not long after and sold me fifty liberty caps which were ground up. They were in a plastic zip bag and I slowly started to eat them. Around twenty minutes later I started to feel like I was rising into a new world. This world didnt exist in the present the past or the future but existed somewhere. I carried on drinking while I rose up to meet this new world.<br><br>
Someone walked over and sat between me and Salvia guy which made me angry, I couldnt understand how they could do such a thing. I told them to sit away from me and my co-pilot. I was starting to come up nicely and felt like I had joined the world now so I decided to leave. On the way out I told the bouncer I loved him. He said, Oh, drunk again are we? which made me laugh. As I began walking home I felt really good, I could feel a warm buzz inside. It wasnt as intense as MDMA, but somehow nicer.<br><br>
As I walked some more I began feeling content with everything, I wanted to find friends and chat to them about what I felt. Everything was ok. I took a piss in the middle of the street, It didnt bother me, and I couldnt understand how anyone else could be bothered by it either. I walked up to a friends flat and knocked the door, no answer, so I started making my way home.<br><br>
On my way home I was just loving the feeling of warmth and understanding. I decided to take a detour through some woods, the darkness didnt bother me as I was in love. In the woods I began thinking about my life, how things werent so bad and how the future was going to be so bright. I decided to change a lot of things about me and the way I thought about others. I felt like some sort of guru who knew the secrets of the universe. When I was coming out of the woods questions came into my head, which I had the answer or solution to straight away. I kept firing questions at myself and answering them with total ease. I must have asked myself dozens of complex questions in the time it took me to walk twenty-five meters.<br><br>
Once out of the darkness of the wood and back onto the street I was filled with a sense of nothing. I couldnt be bothered to think, just relax in the feeling of love. I managed to get home and to my room where I lay out on my bed and listened to Sgt. Peppers. I lay staring at nothing listening to the music. The songs spoke of the place I was in which felt good. After the album ended I tried to sleep. I don't know how long it was before I slept, ten minutes or three hours. <br><br>
I woke up the next morning quite hazy and not remembering much.<br><br>
The experience taught me how to improve myself and how to treat others. This lasted for many months, but has worn off. I feel like I need another mushrooms trip to bring back the things Ive now lost.<!-- End Body -->
