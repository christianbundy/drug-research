The setting was a Burning Man reunion type party at a place in Dumbo, Brooklyn. I started the night with a raging headache, and decided soon that this was probably not the best time to try a drug for the first time. So I resign myself to a lame night.<br><br>
I got tired of the music pounding my head and asked my friend for his keys so I could go sleep in the car. But luckily the attendnet at the lot would not allow me to. So I walked back. My friend called me and sounded more blissed than I have ever heard him: 'Dude you have got to try this stuff!'. (At this point my headache had waned). So I went back to the party and tracked him down (it took a while). He had promised me two pills but had only one left 'You're only going to need one' he says, and he was right.<br><br>
I would say that there's something akin to alcohol in E.  But take away all the nasty nausea and foggy thinking, purify that feeling in a way you never thought possible and then extend it and deepen it.<br><br>
I have always liked to dance by myself, but the ideas and notions that night were the next level up. The creativity went on and on.<br><br>
I enjoyed telling people that this was my first time on E, and enjoyed hearing their perspective.<br><br>
I did not drink enough and lost my voice the next day.<br><br>
The guy who provided the pills said this was the best batch he had ever had (and he was experienced).<br><br>
Sometimes, alone, several days later, I find myself repeating those dance moves.<br><br>
It is not a drug but an elixir.<!-- End Body -->
