I am 24 years old.  I have honestly finished my drug using years.  I really do not do a whole lot of experimentation any more.  I have done enough.  My main concern is keeping my shit together.  Which is already hard enough to begin with . . . at least for me.<br><br>
I am a photography assistant/aspiring photographer who migrates from studio to studio on a contract basis.  I hit a period with a really stressful studio where the hours were really long and the environment was less than ideal.  Which is not really anything new.  The Photo racket is a hard buis.<br><br>
I suddenly dropped about 15lbs over the course of a month for no reason.  I quit sleeping worth a shit.  Started having anxiety attacks at night.  And literally felt like crap about 90% of the time.  I was really used to getting no sleep.  It was a regular occurance.  I was used to being a Zombie.  It was nothing new.<br><br>
I finally went into the doctor.  And . . . no surprise.  One of the chambers in my heart was filling too fast.  AKA.  My heart was beating too fast.  Which was likely stemming from a thyroid disorder.  Which is a genetic thing. My need for something to help me sleep was legit.  And my need for some blood work was also a legitimate concern. I have abused alot of substances in the past, which I did not quite make clear to the doctor who was concerned about my lack of sleep and overall tired appearance.  <br><br>
I have to say that Ambien really gets me high even at the dosage of 10mg which was prescribed for me.  The first couple of days I took it, I took it earlier than necessary.  And if I were in public,  I probably would have taken a ride in a squad car.  It really gives me a night of quality sleep beyond anything even close to natural.  I wake up feeling fine.  I usually take it around 8pm or so. When I use it for a week straight,  it really becomes easy to justify taking the stuff . . . I sleep really well.  And not taking it can mean no sleep . . . and a shitty job at work.<br><br>
The past few nights I have forced my self to not take a tablet.  And needless to say the nights have not been easy.  I have been sweating alot.  I notice much more anxiety than I remember and sleeping is overall worse than I remember my self doing before I started taking the tablets.<br><br>
I am familiar with the symptoms of opiate withdrawal.  And I really think this drug has got some potential for some real problems if I am not careful.  All I know is that I am counting on taking the tabs to sleep.  I think about them alot when it is bed time. <br><br>
I think it can be a God send.  I really needed the stuff.  But about half as much and about half the dose prescribed.  It is getting me stoned.  Even in the amount the doc is writing me.<!-- End Body -->
