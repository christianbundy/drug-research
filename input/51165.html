Too often, I laughed at difficult experience reports written about cannabis. I can understand the anxiety and panic of an altered state on someone unfamiliar in a psychedelic environment, however I thought I was much too experienced for these things to happen to me<br><br>
My night started like many others before that. Myself, and my two friends Mike and Adrian met up at Mikes house to cook some herb. A few weeks prior to this night, I, in a foolishly high stupor, knocked over our bong and broke the ash-catcher attachment. We were planning on picking up a new one tonight, and headed downtown to run our errands. We ended up buying a whole new bong through impulse, and without a doubt this bong was far superior to our old one. <br><br>
Rushing home, excited to try it out, Mike and Adrian quickly packed bowls of our finest and were out to lunch. My turn brought a decision of what to smoke. Going with my philosophy of go big or go home I decided to drop it like its hot, and smoke our finest product. I packed a base of house indica, with Juicy Fruit and potent honey oil on top. In a blaze of glory, I took my bowl in the biggest hit of my life. <br><br>
My lungs burned like never before, gasping, I tried to inhale but it felt like my lungs were rejecting the air, only wanting to cough. It felt like my lungs were dry-heaving.  I broke out into a sweat and felt very light headed. Im going to be fucking high in like 10 minutes, I thought to myself casually. Deciding on a change of venue, I went to get some water and sat down on the bed while the boys played PS2. <br><br>
As I sat there analyzing my high thus far, I knew this was going to be one for the record books. As my heart was beating faster and I was getting higher, I tried to think of how often Ive been this fucked to calm myself down. Those who know me know that Im one to preach about keeping your shit together, meaning, dont make a fool of yourself when your dosed on any plants, chemicals or drugs. <br><br>
Letting the music take me through psychedelic thought, I, for the first time, thought about terrible things. As my heart beat faster, and my lungs still burned, I started to get nervous. Peaking on my high for the night, all my negative thoughts swelled until it hit me like a tonne of bricks. I felt tremendous guilt for the life of excess that I lead. I had recently started dealing, and these thoughts of myself not being able to turn back to a normal life really frightened me. I thought of myself dying of lung cancer, the pain and suffering on my family and myself and my health. I thought of my mother, slowly growing old, shamed at what her perfect son had become if she only knew. I thought about how my parents having given me everything, and how Im just fucking off at school, doing poorly and getting wasted everyday. <br><br>
Every song that played on mikes computer went along perfectly with what I was feeling, the lyrics seemed to speak to me, and my conscious cried out never again! I remember reading an experience report about a seriously addicted Heroin user who said once you know you have a problem, your high is never the same. All these thoughts were very powerful to me, I was sick with emotion and felt that I had truly experienced an epiphany.<br><br>
When finally, (for those who are interested) the song Gone Till November  Wyclef Jean played and in an instantit all started to melt away. The melody soothed my jangled soul, and the lyrics made me think of hope and turning a new leaf. <br><br>
Mike, Adrian and I went to get pizza, and I went along and enjoyed it, unbeknown to them that I had the most powerful experience from weed Ive ever had.<!-- End Body -->
