I'm 22 years old, been using drugs since about 14 (mostly pot) and have been experimenting with pretty much all types of drugs (except for opiates which I have never used) I've never had bad trips off of ketamine, lsd, shrooms or any of the known 'freakout' drugs even at really high dosage and although I do have fiending tendencies on some drugs this is really not the case for me on dissociatives.<br><br>
So, I ordered a 500 mg bag of methoxetamine from a reputable vendor (checked reports and vendor sites for about 2 weeks before ordering so felt pretty confident with my decision) and when it fell through the mailslot I immediately weighed off 2 mg for a allergy check and 10 mg for bottom effects which would be taken later that afternoon. I will not be describing that trip seeing as the effects were too weak to really distinguish from placebo and the pot I had smoked throughout the afternoon.<br><br>
Since the afternoon went on smooth I called a friend who was in town for the weekend and made plans with another friend that we could trip at their house this night. Had some diner, prepared my trip kit (backpack with some easy to eat food, protein powder, water bottle, cellphone and some towels) and prepared my first dose of 20mg which would be taken just before we got on the bikes (bicycles).<br><br>
20:20 The first 20 mg were insufflated and we went on our way. It was only about 15 minutes to get to the house we were going to trip at but it already seemed to come on halfway there. Some feeling of disconnection with small parts off the normal reality like time and distances that didn't seem to act very logical. Now bear in mind that my english isn't that great so explaining the effects will be quite difficult to do.<br><br>
20:45 Arrived at the house, there were three people in front of the house but I could not seem to 'understand' them, why they were there who they where and what they where doing was a complete mystery to me and I felt like I had to go inside quickly before they noticed how weird I was feeling (they probably didnt even look twice) and had the feeling that if I had to explain my actions I would have a really hard time. Damn this shit works fast and hard! <br><br>
21:30 Still weird and my friends laugh at me pretty much every 5 minutes because my mind wanders often and walking isn't as nice and flowing as it feels to me:P  I decide to take the rest (50 mg) in two bumps I guess can't really call it rails and took one and left the other one for later. At this time I got my first kind of scary moment. Nothing really happened except I thought there was a chance it might go horribly wrong. Luckily my experience helped me realise quickly if I thought it would go bad it almost certainly would so got back on the positive thought track and went my merry way.<br><br>
23:00 Okay things are really peaking now and I'm feeling pretty good. Kinda warm and euphoric which is sometimes said to be like mdma but I dont really see the similarity because there is no power behind this. (and with mdma I feel it running through me). There is also a very strong need to 'bounce' through the room, not like on uppers but more like taking a step, dipping down to the floor and coming back up in the most absurd ways you can think of. Pretty much all effortlessly which is a really weird feeling seeing as walking normally is totally out of the question now.<br><br>
01:00 Time to go home. Decided not to take the last bump because there was no need for it whatsoever. A little trouble biking at first but was just getting my bearings on this drugs. (biked home drunk lots of times never crashed or anything so) wasn't really coming down much yet so smoked a big joint and went to bed. No problems getting to sleep an slept very good till about 12:30 which is a little long for me but woke up feeling good with pretty much no sign of a hangover or anything. (this could be because I usually drink about 10 beers on friday nights but didn't drink at all this night)<br><br>
All things considered this was a very good experience for me with a little bit of a bumpy start (reading experiences of tilatimine substitution by bad vendors and a distrust of all things ordered over the internet) but a great ending with little to no immediately felt repercussions. (at this dose and frequency!!) I would recommend everyone that is going to use this to BUY A SCALE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and be careful with dosage and setting because this could be scary as hell at a party or something where you dont know people. Have a safety net (friends, location, that kinda thing). Other then that enjoy and bless you all on your trips to your inner selves.<!-- End Body -->
