One day I was waiting for my friends to get home from school cuz I stayed home, so I was looking around the house for money or anything that will help we buy some drugs. When I looked in the medicine drawer I found wellbutrin pills. I have never seen or done these before that day so I decided to look them up on the internet to see if you can get high off them.<br><br>
I checked that out and I found out that you can get high off them but I didn't know how much to take, so I started out taking four 300 mg pills. I met up with my friends and nothing happened, besides the weed we smoked I didn't feel anything off the pills. Later that night I got into bed. I laid there looking at the wall in the dark and I started to see shadows that looked like little outlines of people dancing. I thought really nothing of it and I closed my eyes and tryed to sleep. When I opened them again I still saw little shadows moving across my wall, so I looked around my dark room and I see shadows all around....at first I thought it was messed up so I fell to sleep.<br><br>
When I woke up the next morning I decided I wanted to try those again but earlier so I could feel them in the day time. So when I got to school I took four more 300 mg pills in homeroom. All through the day I was really jittery like I took too much adderall or something. My vision was increased and I felt as if I saw everything going around me 100% clearly. As the day went on I noticed that my hearing also increased and all the colors got brighter. I thought I was pretty sweet actually so I was excited for me to start seeing things again.<br><br>
When I got to my last class I started to twitch and my hands couldn't stop shaking, so I decided to leave class and walk around. Right when I started to walk around, I knew it was about to kick in. I felt alert and worried as if someone was trying to find me (like hide-n-seek). So I got back home and went with my brothers to go smoke. <br><br>
When we were done smoking at my friends house I started to hear people talking but I couldn't make out what they were saying so I walked to were I thought I could hear them the best, which was the bathroom. When I got in the voices were gone, but I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror (with lights off/in total darkness) I saw someone sitting on the toilet right behind me, I was freaked out so I turned on the lights and he was gone.<br><br>
I told my friend and my brother what I saw and I told them to come in the bathroom and Id tell them what I saw. So we got in and turned off the lights the first time and I saw myself in the mirror and I thought nothing of it, until my face started to shrink inward. I raised my hand to touch my face and I noticed that when I moved my hand to touch my face that my hand didn't move but another hand came out of it, so I had three arms now. The arm that wasn't mine had static (like the static you get from your t.v.) dripping off of it.<br><br>
I was looking at myself in the mirror for a good hour till we left. The whole day felt like my feet were hanging off a cliff and I was in a really upbeat mood. After like 4 hours I start to feel shity when I was coming off, I puked only once and it wasn't really bad but I just felt like really uncomfortable. We drove home and I thought it was pretty much all worn off by now since the only thing that was wierd was every song I listened to sounded faster then it normaly should have, but I didn't really mind that cuz it sounded pretty tight.<br><br>
When I tryed to sleep that when shit was really fucked up. I layed down and I started to see those dancing shaddow people again so I layed there and watched them dance, but all of a sudden they all formed into one big shaddow that was a guy standing over my bed. I thought fuck this shit so I looked into the light (in front on my door) to try and not see him. But when I looked in my door way I saw three people standing there so I kept looking around trying to avoid looking at them, so I shut my eyes and tryed to sleep but all I heard was people walking in and out of my room so I decided that I was gunna have to deal with this all night so I started to get used to it.<br><br>
When I looked in my door way again I saw what I thought was my girlfriend cuz it looked just like her but she would just peer around the corner and then go back behind the wall. It would do that over and over and over....all I saw was her head peering around the corner so I didn't care about that too much, until I saw three people hanging from my ceiling...that pretty much fucked up the whole night. I just layed there looking at the thing peering around the corner and the dancing shaddows for the rest of the night until I fell asleep.<br><br>
For the past week I was really shakey and jittery, but nothing too bad.<!-- End Body -->
