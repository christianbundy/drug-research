I didnt even know about this product. I had ordered two other products which came quickly in discreet packaging, and was given this as a free sample. It has mixed reviews, some saying its the next best thing and others saying its dangerous stay away. So I decided to make my own mind up and just start small to see how I would react. <br><br>
I did this at home in a peaceful setting after work. No one was around as I wanted to be able to concentrate on the effects. I initially did a dip test which confirmed It tasted vile and chemically  unlike anything Ive tried before.  It came in a clear baggy, they were fine crystals but I wouldnt have put them in my nose unless I crushed it a bit. Had a small bump about half a finger nails worth, all seemed fine. Did Make by eye react by watering. 5 mins later Thought well that didnt kill me I feel ok,  so then did a couple of bigger bumps. <br><br>
Its not pleasant and no way as nice and gentle as coke. I started working after about 25-30 mins. Started to get the serious chats and had to have a looong conversation with my brother by text. It seemed to make me feel very alert and interested. I then later on in the evening did a very small line probably 3cm but very thin. Thats when things started to get a bit more interesting, my eyes had slightly decided to see black and white patterns in the corner and was feeling quite buzzy and got slight juddervision which was ok. <br><br>
It does last a long time. I have done it a few days now to see how I react to it. I found that I started to get very dehydrated although I have been drinking and making a point to replenish the electrolytes. I also got a really sore tongue to the point it started to crack at the sides, this has never happen to me on anything, and I got mega cramps in my toes which did pass. I think more research needs to be done, if it didnt affect me so bad with the deyhration and having to keep body salts up. <br><br>
I think this could be dangerous if used at a rave / festival where youre going to be drinking a lot of dehydrating alcohol. And noticed my palms were getting really sweaty and if I touched water it looked like Id been in the bath for an hour. It did absolutely kill my appetite, and didnt have any sort of comedown.  I think its a little and often drug, and to be taken very carefully.<!-- End Body -->
