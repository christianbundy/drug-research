 "report": "\n\n\n\r\nEcstasy\r\nTurning round I see, surprised,\r\na large, round, living temple.\r\nI am here, part of it all,\r\nI am part of it all.\r\nI look at the world\r\nand the world looks back at me.\r\nI am not alone.\r\nThis is Ecstasy.\r\nStanding, I feel. So tender\r\nand being held so tenderly.\r\nMy sadness is like a soft bud\r\nvelvet and moist,\r\nmy tear a dew drop\r\ntrembling on the tip of my nose.\r\nI am so happy to feel.\r\nThis is Ecstasy\r\nWe sing, we laugh, we share\r\nand most of all, we care.\r\nWe let each other see\r\nthe beauty inside\r\nwithout shame or anxiety.\r\nWe're happy and free.\r\nThis is Ecstasy.\r\n\r\nby an established professional English woman, written just after experiencing ecstasy for the first time with some close friends. The 'temple' was a yurt.\n\n\n"
