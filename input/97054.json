So tender<br>and being held so tenderly.<br>My sadness is like a soft bud<br>velvet and moist,<br>my tear a dew drop<br>trembling on the tip of my nose.<br>I am so happy to feel.<br>This is Ecstasy<br>We sing, we laugh, we share<br>and most of all, we care.<br>We let each other see<br>the beauty inside<br>without shame or anxiety.<br>We're happy and free.<br>This is Ecstasy.<br><br>by an established professional English woman, written just after experiencing ecstasy for the first time with some close friends. The 'temple' was a yurt.\n\n\n"
