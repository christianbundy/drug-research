This report is categorized as a 5-MeO-DMT report, and it is assumed that the author means 5-MeO-DMT and not DMT.] </font> <br><br>
I had been studying the effects of DMT for some time before I tried it, and lucky I did, for I could not imagine being thrown into something like this. Luckily I had an experienced journeyman by my side to guide me or else I would have had a tough time.<br><br>
I sat back on the couch and took a hit of what was nothing smaller than a sugar in the raw grain, and instantly upon exhale the effects were on me. I was staring at the wall in front of me and still can't discern weather the wall slammed me or vice-versa. But the force at which the effects were thrust into me was intense. I stood up holding my head as my thoughts began to echo louder until my own repeated thoughts became a deafening roar. I felt my ego slip away and this began to frighten me. I remember thinking this was odd because I was still in control of myself and my thoughts (with great difficulty) while my vision was blinded by the brightest white light I have ever seen. I turned to my guide and proclaimed (quite matter of fact, I was told) 'I'm Dying'.<br><br>
I then began to feel nauseous, and experienced extra sensory perception. I could not see anything but managed to avoid all obstacles and make it to the bathroom to vomit. What came next frightened me the most. I began feeling waves in my body that started in my back and worked their way to my chest which I immediately associated with my soul leaving my body. I grabbed my chest and began to try and physically 'force' my soul back into my body.<br><br>
Although I was scared at the same time I felt pure joy, and have never felt as happy and when my vision came back and reality returned I felt completely euphoric. I believe the trip was 5 minutes and 36 seconds long.<!-- End Body -->
