It was an overcast February weekend. Me and my friends were stuck on campus, so we decided we would find some drugs to do. We were all bud smokers: I would normally smoke a bowl on weekdays and several on weekends, but some of us would smoke up to four or five per day. We had done shrooms, and other psychadelics, but we decided that between four of us we would buy an eight-ball and snort some lines.<br><br>
The buying experience was way sketch. We knew the dealer through a friend from school who had just recently been arrested for selling marijuana on a high school campus following a hellish semester that included a drunken accident, a week long hospital visit, and withdrawal from all of his classes. The dealer didn't meet us quickly, we were on an unfamiliar side of town, it was kinda weird, but we got an 8 for $100. So we rushed back to campus to divide it up between the four of us.<br><br>
T + 0:00 - Each of us got just under a gram, and we began to chip some lines off the rock and chop them finely. I started out by doing one small line, which in retrospect I would approximate to be around .07 grams. I didn't get a very good snort, and a lot settled in my sinuses and gave me a huge drip. It tasted like shit, like when I was a kid and would chomp on pills rather than swallowing them. Within about five minutes (it seemed to take longer for me than for everyone else) I began feeling this feeling of intense euphoria and energy. I had never taken ecstasy, adderall, or any other kind of stimulant before, and had never felt anything like that before. The first thing that entered my mind was 'I was feeling great; I should call a friend from home.' So I called one of my smoking/hippy friends and accidentally woke him up (it was only 10 at night.) In subsequent stimulant experiences with a high dose of Adderall and later 2c-i, I've had this necessity to talk to people and be amiable, call up a friend to check on them, apologize to someone for a wrongdoing, do favors, etc. I hope that's a sign of my inherent good nature :)<br><br>
T + 0:10 - I took another line. Everyone was doing two and then going to a friend's room to smoke a quick bowl. We were all talking our asses off and sniffing a lot to deal with the drip. As we walked around outside, I'm sure we sounded like a bunch of cokeheads, sniffling like a storm, but none of us seemed to notice - like it was some subliminal reflex to keep the high. By this time the volume level of the room was increasing dramatically due to our incessant talking and trying to talk over one another.<br><br>
T + 0:30 - We went over to smoke a bowl, and while sitting in my friend's closet we listened to music. We were all talking our asses off, nobody seemed to be listening to the other, and so many conversations happened between the four of us I was unable to count. While sitting in the cramped closet, J offered me his cracker, balloon, and a whip-it. It was my first, and it was incredible. I began huffing in and out of the balloon, and continuted for a minute or so, even as I entered my peak. Everyone realized how hard I was tripping to keep doing that, so they took it from me. I just slumped over in a daze of euphoria. The metallic ringing in my ears was incredible, as was my vision which had reversed colors (black becoming white, red becoming green, etc.) It was odd, because at the time, I had a harsh come down from the nitrous. In future uses I have not felt this. <br><br>
T + 1:15 - In the room, B and R picked up guitars and began playing. B was playing some experimental sounding stuff, he's way into Indie and that shit. R was playing some blues, and it was kicking ass. They were both in the zone, however, and though I was on cocaine, I obtained a great contact high through their playing. J's suitemate from Africa came in and was hanging out with us for a while, and decided to try a line. Not a drug-user, he had smoked bud with us on a couple occasions, but seemed to like the cocaine. He is a big hip-hop fan, and growing up in Africa, I think he had a slightly glorified perception of 'the Thug Life,' which cocaine seemed to fit into perfectly. I took another small line just to keep it going.<br><br>
T + 2:00 - We were all coming down by this point, and all had prepared our next lines to take. It was the major activity of the night. We had tv and music on, but everyone was either preoccupied with fixing up a next line or talking about the experience. Each of us took another line and went out to get a cigarette. I had been running on SUPER for a while now, and was looking for a new stimulant rush, so I smoked a cigarette. I rarely smoke, and then only to get a buzz while stoned or drunk. I downed one very quickly, at the same rate as my smoker friends, and we all lit up another. About halfway through the second cigarette I began to get the spins and had to go in to lay down. I laid down on my friends bed, where the spins became subsequently worse for the next two to three hours, where I lay shivering before finally falling asleep. The next morning I woke up at around 5:00am and went back to my own room to pass out for another few hours.<br><br>
Overall, I enjoyed the cocaine experience. I had originally attributed my terrible comedown to the coke, but I realize that it was probably the cigarettes, as the same experience has happened to me several times since :-/ I couldn't finish off the ~.7g I purchased. The next day, a friend of a friend called looking for some, so I traded him the rock for a small nug he had. I was glad ot be rid of that shit; I had such a bad time the night before.<br><br>
Since then, I have taken one line on another occasion, and it was great. The comedown wasn't terrible. Since that experience, I have smoked freebase which wasn't as good. It seemed to give me a buzz, but immediately I wanted another hit. When we were out I didn't feel like I needed anymore, but smoking crack out of aluminum foil just isn't that pleasurable.<br><br>
Would I recommend insufflating cocaine? It depends. If I came across a gram, I'd snort it up, but I haven't come across one in two months. On the other hand, I have several friends who over the summer got into some serious shit involving coke addicition and sex with dealers, and I know how terrible that was for them. One in particular even frequently dreams about it. J and B spent an hour of the night discussing how much fun it was and when was the soonest they could buy more 'without getting addicted.' Personally, I have a very addictive personality, and had a bad relationship with ether. So if I get to the point where I am addicted, and I don't have a source, I could stop. I would never buy my own coke so that I don't fall into that cycle.<!-- End Body -->
