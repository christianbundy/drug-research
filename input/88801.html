Background: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually. <br><br>
Set: Home with 1 friend.<br>
Setting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.<br><br>
8:00PM<br>
Dose taken with water<br><br>
8:20PM<br>
Stomach feels a bit like ingestion, heart beat up a little.<br>
More awake, possibly just music and relaxing. Clammy hands.<br><br>
8:25PM<br>
Notice subtle headspace change. Fluffy, floaty.<br><br>
8:30PM<br>
Not that jaw is clenching yet, but chewy sounds good.<br>
Feels nice to move and stretch. <br><br>
8:40PM<br>
Chose chewy that tastes putrid, 'rotten berry flavour' . Spat it out. <br>
'Need to poop feeling' but I know I don't need to.<br>
Body temp must be up, sweaty 'pits'.<br>
Pupil Dilation<br>
Feeling mood lift and nice body high coming in waves.<br><br>
9PM<br>
Definetley feeling nice. Desire to move about. <br>
Getting harder to write, concentration not as good.<br>
Enhanced colours, music is enveloping me.<br>
Still want to poo. <br><br>
9:30PM<br>
Keep thinking about getting comfortable on couch but keep getting distracted.<br>
Hot and cold waves. Sweating with jumpers on but want a heater. (I get this on MDMA and 2ci also)<br><br>
9:50PM<br>
Put a heater on, bit more comfortable. Making sure to drink water. <br>
Music is hard to chose, no particular genre' sounds good, just particular songs.<br>
I STILL WANT TO POO! I think my bowels must be relaxed.<br><br>
10:10PM<br>
Had a water pipe hit of THC, got chills and prickly fingers. Very nice.<br>
Conversation is deep, but not serious. Laughter feels good.<br><br>
10:20<br>
Some slight jaw tension. Want chewy but don't want the disgusting berry one.<br><br>
10:45<br>
Starting to mellow just a little.<br>
Debating a little more. <br>
50mg oral?.'woops I did'.<br><br>
11:20<br>
Feeling the 50mg. It doesn't bring me up in any way just sustains the buzz.<br><br>
2:30<br>
Finished watching watchmen. Still feeling awake<br>
Talk to friend.<br><br>
4PM<br>
Fell asleep<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
I used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.<br>
Unlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends. <br>
Mentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.<br><br>
Although it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything. <br><br>
