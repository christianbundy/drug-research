 "report": "<p>One of the most frightening experiences of my life. It felt like my mind was being torn apart and nearly going into the K-hole was the worst feeling ever. I felt as though I was on much more LSD then I actually was and once the effects of the Ketamine began to subside I was sure I had suffered mental damage, but once I came down completely off both drugs I felt much better. Also sleeping was more difficult then usual.</p><p>I'm not sure if I'd recomend anyone trying this combination but if you decide to, prepare yourself and keep it to a very small group of people that you know well. Make sure you do not have a weak mind, feeling like I have suffered serious mental damage is pretty scary.</p>"
