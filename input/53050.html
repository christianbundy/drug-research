I discovered salvia about 1 month ago. The complexity of the salvia experience seemingly grows with each use. A running theme I have found through my brief but facinating trips, are visuals in which I fall from 1 vision, spin/shift/rotate and find myself slipping though another portal to another vision. This typically happens several times. The relation of these types of trips to lucid dreams is also unmistakeable.<br><br>
Early one morning, I sat myself on the porch and did two modest sized hits of a 20X extract. I found that anything more than that limits my ability to recall. One cannot underestimate the reverse tolerance effect of the drug.<br><br>
With the sun still down and birds chirping in the background, I slipped into a salvia vision. I was in a summer time scene. Lots of people walking, bicycling etc. The hills were alive with trees and a pastel colored grass. I then felt the entire periphery of my view begin to ripple like waves. Slowly, the vision began to<br>
sink into a vortex a few 100 yards ahead of me. I started to float backwards, slowly but steadily to view the rippling and sinking of this vision. When I broke the horizen of the view I could see the field slowly getting sucked into a wrinkled tan colored funnel. As I floated back further I noticed this funnel narrowed and terminated on the head of a human bust(basically head and shoulders). The man had his eyes closed. He was very old. There were also several other off shoots of funnels leading up to other parallel realities.<br><br>
When I reflected on this trip, it seemed to me to indicate that the dream state may actually be a singular view into one of many, perhaps thousands of simultaneous stories playing within the mind at all times. I had a view to 3 such concurrent realities (dream or sub conscious realities) but perhaps there are more. How or when those realities commence is for further speculation.<br><br>
How's that for a profound experience?<!-- End Body -->
