 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nConcension of disorganized unity looped together in sandy blue psilocybin embraces. A cluttered sky opened up, revealing an infathomably magenta perception laughing in four single minds. Conversation flowed, sans tongues, periodically interrupted by expressionate lips only to return to its state of immaculate lucidity. Taste became smell in a orgy of closed eyes and trees. Time shattered, bringing labels down with it and revealed the continum to eight dilated eyes. Psilocybin drool dripped onto psilocybin tracers left in the thick psilocybin air by psilocybin imaginations. It was a glowing eternity. Immobile bodies rolled in ecstasy over twining pink thoughts. Echoed words drifted away in the hot wind and morphed into hallucinatory memories. I was myself, and four other people, and the whole world. I was solitary, drowning in the same musings as every other beautiful thing. I was uncontrolled serenity, basking in the cellophane sunlight of an inhuman world. I was god.\n\n\n"
