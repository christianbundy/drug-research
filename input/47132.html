One Saturday evening, I had the worst toothache of my life from a wisdom tooth that needed to be taken out, and my appt wasn't for 4 more days and I literally thought I was going to die from the horrific pain!  I could hardly move.  So I decided to go the emergency room to get something for the pain. The ER Doctor gave me Vicodin ES and Antibiotics.  I got the scrips filled at 6pm and was home by 6:15pm and popped a Vicodin by 6:25pm. I had never taken Vicodin before, so I had NO idea what to expect.<br><br>
6:35pm: I layed on my couch praying to God that this pill would take away the unforgiving pain that had me paralyzed.  I hadn't eaten much but broth that day because my mouth hurt so badly.<br><br>
6:55: I start to notice that not only is the pain lifting away, but when I rubbed my legs together it felt really good.  So I started rubbing my hands together and feeling my arms, and had the same feeling.  My state of mind was also changing.  My spirit was lifting, and I had been in severe pain and very sad for days, so it was wonderful!]<br><br>
7:10pm: I had started feeling pretty euphoric, and could move around and wanted to turn on the TV and ended up seeing that 'Shanghai Noon' had just started and I had never seen it before. So I started watching it.  <br><br>
7:30: The pain was mostly gone, I was laying on my couch, feeling light and fluffy! I kept wanting to rub my legs together and touch my hands, as it felt almost like a magical numbing feeling, that even though it was sort of numbing, I could still feel it and it was amazing!<br><br>
8pm: I was still feeling wonderful, and laughing so hard at 'Shanghai Noon' like it was one of the funniest movies in the world!  I had a sense of very high spirits, both mentally and physically, and emotionally.  I was smiling and felt very content!<br><br>
9pm: I still felt incredibly pleasent and the body high was one of the best I have ever experienced before. <br><br>
After about 10pm I was getting pretty sleepy, probably due to not sleeping well all weekend from being in pain.  I still felt good, but was coming down slowly and then passed out and slept like a baby.<!-- End Body -->
