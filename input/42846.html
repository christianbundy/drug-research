Dosage of 10mg each, following a few hours after coming down from 2C-C trip. Will report as needed. <br><br>
T +0:00<br>
10 mg ingested with coke (the soft drink, if there was doubt). Stronger bitter/chem taste than 60mg's of 2C-C taken earlier. <br><br>
T+0:15 <br>
No discernable effects. Considering another 10mgs. <br><br>
T'+0:25 <br>
Feeling a little light-headed. Taking another 10mgs. Fluke is going strong. <br><br>
T senses things starting to happen. mild tingling, chills. <br><br>
T+0:35 <br><br>
E: Sudden euphoric rush toes-to-head. things definitely happening, though no sensory distortion. O feeling light discomfort. <br><br>
T+0:55.<br><br>
O claims neural damage. None of us have any visuals. Good mood, though, except O. Mild-medium euphoric tingling, nothing overwhelming. Testing hash as a possible booster. Issues being debated eagerly: Base jumping and pez. <br><br>
T+4:00<br><br>
T and E still feeling the good mood and some other trippy sensations, while O just feels tired. E and O heads home.<br><br>
Conclusion: T and E found this chemical to be very pleasant and enjoyable, nothing heavy. Whilst O found it unpleasant, had other effects and came down hours before the others.<br><br>
Two found it very pleasant, whilst the third had only bad feelings, and had no plans of doing it over.<br><br>
Now its T+4:15 and I am alone(T) and still feeling very pleasant. Thinking about snorting 100mg Dpt, but I think I`ll smoke another bong while I think about it some more.<br><br>
3 bong hits later: I`m not in doubt that THC really enhances the good vibes and floaty sensation, having problems writhing this, so I`ll take a break. The room is spinning.<br><br>
T+7:00 <br><br>
The ganja is wearing off, and I decide to snort 50 mg of dpt. I am really exhausted because Ive been awake for over two days on amphetamines.<br><br>
While the DPT is kicking inn I make two big bong hits, and smoke one. I just float in to a trancelike state, listening to chill out music, and I think I was asleep by 8,00.<br><br>
Slept the whole day, until 3 in the afternoon feeling hungry and exhausted. I went out and got some food, and now I feel fine (dropped 20mg valium 20 min. ago).<br><br>
This could change the effects a bit, but T (two days on speed) and E quiet rested, had very similar experiences.<!-- End Body -->
