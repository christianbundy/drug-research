Took the pill in the car on the way to a free party on a Saturday night.  Didn't feel anything at first for an hour or so, assumed it was a dud and intended to get something else at the party to replace it.<br><br>
Starting coming up really subtly at first, felt very chatty and comfortable, started to get quite warm and sweat.<br><br>
By the time I reached the party, approx an hour and a half after I took it, I was starting to get a buzz. So I bought a few balloons of nitrous and stood at the front near the speakers.<br><br>
I came up very suddenly in the middle of a balloon and from that point my memories of the night are very jumbled.<br><br>
The feeling was very intense and I continued coming up for an hour or so.<br><br>
Initially I felt totally comfortable and happy, incredibly euphoric and just wanted to dance because I could feel and see the music.  I danced for quite some time (possibly an hour or so) - drinking water little and often as I was sweating quite intensely. When I stopped dancing, I found that walking was very interesting, all of my movements felt very over emphasized, my attention span was very small and I found myself trailing off halfway through words and sentences and just forgetting what I was doing.<br>
Not long after I stopped coming up and found a plateau, which lasted some 3 hours or so and quite literally felt like an all body orgasm.<br><br>
By about 4-5am I was still going and still incredibly happy and loving, could still barely talk and could not co-ordinate at all - apart from dancing and hugging people which felt incredible!  I also experienced some open and closed eye visuals including fractal patterns and incredible visualizations of the music and people talking to me.<br><br>
After the intensity of the feeling I experienced on this substance I was worried that the comedown would be intense also - I am not vanilla when it comes to drugs and in terms of physical effect and feeling this was one of the most extreme experiences I have had - especially from a legal high!  In truth I experienced the complete opposite: I was still quite high when it came to midnight the next day (Sunday night) and my pupils were still like dinner plates!<br><br>
The next day (Monday) I felt a little burned out, but still quite happy and comfortable and a slight feeling of tiredness but at the same time feeling completely centered and happy.<br><br>
All in all I was incredibly pleased by this and would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting night!!<!-- End Body -->
