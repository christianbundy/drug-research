I first heard about Salvia on the web while looking for information on ayahuasca and possible legal highs.  It was described as an extremely potent hallucinogen and completely legal.  I was definitely intrigued and ordered a small supply of untreated leaves.  I wanted to try this first before venturing into the 5X, etc. that are also available.  My first experience was pleasant but not at all hallucinogenic.  I carefully took a small hit from a pipe and felt a sense of relaxation over my body and a slight feeling of being stoned, somewhat like marijuana lasted for maybe 30  45 minutes.  I tried this small amount later on again and it lead to an intensified sexual experience with my partner.<br><br>
As I experimented with slightly larger hits I began to experience visionary, trance-like states.  One time while sitting in my car I sucked in two good hits and experienced a swirling, undulating world of colors that resembled house paint.  The interesting thing is that the swirling tentacles of patterned color seem to move in and through the body as well.  There is a definite sensation of being part of that strange reality in a physical way. Unfortunately the setting that I had chosen for this experience was not the best and I became fearful that someone would find me in an obviously intoxicated state.  Fortunately the experience did not last long  maybe fifteen minutes -  before I was back to the consensus world.  However, It all seemed a little dream-like for awhile.<br><br>
Recently I had an evening alone (my partner is not into psychedelic experimentation) and I decided to try some of the 5X salvia that I had ordered several weeks before.  I had had a little brandy to drink which may have helped my courage.  It may have also effected the experience.  I filled a waterpipe bowl and and was able to get two good hits before sitting back on the couch with my eyes closed.  The swirling world came on very quickly and before I knew it I was in a weird cartoon-like world in which I was part of the landscape.  I was struggling to get up as I came to the realization that I was becoming more and more of an inanimate thing.<br><br>
Then I experienced myself as part of an enormous slow moving wheel as it rolled around toward the ground.  I became afraid as I experienced myself rolling down into the earth.  However, I was able to relax into the experienced although I was feeling myself being crushed into the ground.  It wasnt unpleasant however, just very weird.  What happened next is harder to remember or describe.  I lost all sense of a physical body or location and went into a state like deep sleep or emptiness.<br><br>
When I emerged from this state I found myself on the floor clinging to the couch.  The Deuter CD I had been playing had some ocean waves on it and I felt like I was clinging to a life raft after having been lost at sea.  I felt like I had witnessed something overwhelmingly beautiful or magnificent and kept repeating What a blessing!  Although I dont remember exactly what it was.  I stayed there on the floor for a few minutes longer and began to feel back in contact with the world.  I dont know how I got from the couch to the floor but my dog was looking at me funny.<br><br>
I have tried several other herbal highs, which have been fun but nothing compared to the intensity of salvia divinorum.  I plan to try it again after awhile when I am brave enough.  No alcohol this time though.<!-- End Body -->
