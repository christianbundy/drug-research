 "report": "<p>\n\tMy form does not function while suffering the effects of the prescription drug marketed under the name Adderall.  While on it I freak out, think at once at an amazing and lithargic pace (whereas I ususally consider myself bright and imaginitive), feel a tingling sensation in my hands and face (where I have Rhenard?s syndrome), and besides all that, Adderall makes me feel lonely and unloved despite the fact that when im not on the drug I am happy and liked by those who ?know? me or I encounter and choose to speak and associate with.  For all these reasons I will no longer take this fucked up chemical into my blood.</p>"
