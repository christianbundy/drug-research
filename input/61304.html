I’m not a serious drug user.  I hate alcohol and love pot, but don’t smoke it more than once or twice a month.  I never want to get burned out and always approach drugs with the utmost respect and appreciation.  About a year and a half ago I almost got my hands on some LSD, but came up short.  I was disappointed as one knowledgeable friend described a trip where his disembodied alter ego had put his arm around his actual self and began talking.  This seemed too much to be true for my ever rational intellect, but I was intensely curious. A true psychedelic trip to whatever alternate realities that may exist is something I had craved since high school when I first started reading about them. So when my brother told me he had got some good acid from a friend, I perked up immediately.  <br><br>
Being somewhat afraid, as I usually am before trying a new drug, I wanted to let him try it first and when he came back all he could utter was an exasperated “these are awesome...lots... of energy”.  So I set a date, my 22nd birthday, to try them.  My brother told me he had taken 2 hits and said it was just about right, but I wanted to make sure that it hit me fully and really ramp up the experience.  I took 3.  In about thirty minutes, I started to feel subtle waves of energy flow through me.  An increase of energy made me feel as if I was hovering slightly above the ground.  I felt taller and stronger.  My visual field became hazier and more blurry, like everything was just slightly out of focus.  I felt an overwhelming wanderlust come over me so I decided to head to the local arboretum and enjoy myself.  I went off the beaten path and explored the interior of the forest.  Various sights attracted my attention.  Majestic and massive oaks and hickories put me in a seemingly fantasy world where I played but a small and insignificant part.  I just stared and stared at complex spider webs that blew my mind.  Being a biology major, I’ve always been interested in nature and its secrets, but before this day I never really looked at one in this way before.  How could this simple invertebrate make something so intricate and beautiful and deadly?<br><br>
I had thought from previous discussions about the drug that I might lose touch with reality or in some way have a “bad trip”, but it was nothing of the sort.  Reality was intensified, and instead of feeling fear, I felt an overwhelming love and appreciation for everything around me.  In that sense it was similar to MDMA.  I also felt a slight giddiness and would burst out with joyous laughter at different times for no apparent reason.  Nothing frightened me.  Insects that before would provoke a quick reaction from landing on me didn’t.  I just observed their details and gently pushed them off.  I encountered a dog that was barking, but just blocked it out.  So many thoughts flowed through me, but I didn’t get bogged down in any of them.  If I didn’t like what I was thinking or feeling, I could alter it at will.<br><br>
I found a lake and just lied down by it for an hour just taking in the surroundings.  It was so intense and delicious, like high quality fudge or ice cream, that must be sampled in small bits and pieces because of its richness, that I had to steel my mind momentarily from the stimuli. All worries about life, college, and women that had been building for months just evaporated from my consciousness.  I saw tracers and various alterations of light.  At one point, I thought something was crawling under my skin and at that moment could sympathize with people who tweaked out and thought these things were real.  But as before I just changed my feelings at will.  It didn’t bother me. I felt like a kid again before everything got so complex.<br><br>
After about three hours the main effects began to subside, but nevertheless the longevity of the experience, close to eight hours in total, pleasantly surprised me.  The come down was essentially a feather fall over 4 hours in a book store with just a touch of physical and mental fatigue.  This was the most intense experience of my life up to that point.  The drug gave me the profound and  mystical experience that I had been craving for so long. LSD was everything I had hoped it would be.<!-- End Body -->
