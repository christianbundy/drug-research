I've been taking Paroxetine (Aropax) 20mg a day for about 3 years now to deal with panic disorder which I have suffered from on and off for most of my life. I have to say it was a mistake beacuse I've never dealt with the problem, drugs are only temporary solutions. I've heard it's thought patterns that lead to these kind of imbalances and it proves true for me as I was born with a sensitive chemical structure and I tend to hold on to the bad experiences, dwell, worry, get angry and depressed. Ive heard it's this over working of the adrenalin gland that leads to panic attacks.<br><br>
For those of you that don't know a panic attack is a terrifying experience. It's so terrifying that I will do anything to avoid another one. If I have one at the supermarket for instance, I will not want to go back to the supermarket again. The association is generally because there is nothing at all to be afraid of so what ever I'm doing at the time or place is associated with that feeling. This said it's basically like being a slave to my own mind. The only real way to over come this is meditation, learning how to control my own mind. So Ive heard anyway. <br><br>
I've been taking chemical drugs for about 4 or five years now on a weekendly basis. Mainly ecstacy and speed to begin with but these days its only ever crystal. I don't think I need to say much about this because there's several reports and they are all true. It's basically the end of the line once you get into meth. <br><br>
Firstly what they say about ecstacy and SSRIs is true. I do experience effects but there's no euphoria. I still get eye wobbles and yawns but it just makes me exhausted more than anything else. Pointless on aropax. Ive never had any problems with speed and SSRIs until just recently but it may be due to my infrequent use of aropax. Basically I will go for a few days then have one, just forget until the witdrawal symptoms remind me (which are basically like little electric shocks in my head, the same feeling as getting up real quickly but every time I turn my head. Over time they get worse and worse).<br><br>
3 weeks ago I had a 2 night binge on crystal, then I had 2 aropax to try to compensate (40 mg with my daily dose 20mg). I'm not sure if this works or not but Ive noticed that depression on comedowns is almost non existent while Ive been on aropax. I used to have week long dark depression where I could not imagine feeling happy ever again before ssris. Anyway so 40mg of aropax and a quarter of a zanex and I was feeling good again. Good enough to have one more night on the crystal (its always 'the last time' excuse). I didn't think twice about the aropax taken 30mins previously. After all Ive been smoking this stuff for as long as Ive been taking it. Ive never had any nervousness taking any form of speed or ecstacy. Psychadelics and pot really mess with my head and are somewhat responsible for triggering my panic disorder.<br><br>
The first toke on the pipe and the usual rush of goodness. But a strong urge to vomit Ive only ever had one other time when I had 4 pills (mdma) and then smoked ice and violently spewed up nothing for 1/2 hr. I ignored the nausea and kept toking. Probably about 1.5 to 2 points of pure crystals. Over the next hour I started feeling restless, couldn't concentrate. I couldn't lie in any position without getting pins and needles and painful numbness. My head felt like it was going to explode, and my heart was racing a million miles an hour. It was total overload.<br><br>
I rang the poisons info line and after trying to talk to them I passed the phone to my friend because the words were coming out faster than my mouth could pronounce them. The lady on the phone told me it was a dangerous combination and that I could possibly have a seisure and to get to hospital. I chose instead to have some more zanex and see if it helped. Normally if I'm high on meth a quarter of a zanex can get me to sleep. It took me the whole just to relax a bit. <br><br>
Basically it seems like the paroxetine intensified the meth to an uncontrallable level. Since then Ive had another but not as intense experience on a 20mg dose of aropax taken earlier in the day and the same usual 2 points or so of ice. My friend who always smokes with me only experienced the usual effects so it wasn't a bad batch or anything. Not alot is known about aropax so I'd have to suggest being careful when combining with meth.<!-- End Body -->
