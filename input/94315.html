Before I begin, I have seen that many newer reports begin with trip pedigrees. So, here is mine. Ive experimented with 5-Meo-DMT, aMT, 5-Meo-aMT, 5-Meo-DiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 5-Meo-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-I, Ketamine, DXM, MDMA, bk-MDMA (Methylone), LSD and mushrooms. I consider myself to be a very experienced psychonaut; as do my friends.<br><br>
On New Years Eve, 2011-2012, my wife and I decided to ring in the year trying out a new substance 6-APB. I have not taken MDMA since 2004, but my understanding was that the effects of 6-APB were very similar to MDMA and/or MDA. I did a lot of research online about sources, doses, chemical structure, etc, and found contradicting reports.  But, trusting my gut, I had procured 6-APB from a reputable source and prepared for the night. I have also not been Hippy Flipping in almost 10 years and figured that, if the effects of 6-APB were as reported, a comdination with 4-AcO-DMT would be a very close emulation the experience.<br><br>
What follows is a timeline of the events from my notes and as best as I can recall.<br><br>
~6:30PM - My wife and I have a light dinner together and simply enjoy each others company.<br><br>
~7:00PM - We each take 125mg of 6-APB and 30mg of 4-AcO-DMT and then take a shower together.<br><br>
~8:30PM - We are watching Blue Planet: Seas of Life on Blu-ray when she begins to complain of feeling sick and too trippy. Usually when this happens, we are able to help one another through the initial come-up. Im sky-rocketing, waves of euphoria washing across me make it hard for me to pull myself together to help my wife.  But, Im able to help her to the bathroom, and she sits there for a few minutes.  She is having difficulty and feeling overwhelmed. I get her to drink a little water and help her back to the sofa to watch some more Blue Planet.<br><br>
~8:45PM - The narrator of Blue Planet mentions Snow Geese. I am not paying attention so much as I am fixated on my wife, making sure that she is doing better. She looks at me and says snoogys, and begins to giggle uncontrollably. I start to laugh, too. I realize that everything is going to be a-ok.<br><br>
At this point the visuals from the 4-AcO-DMT are powerful. interesting patterning and color distortions abound.  But, has the waves of euphoria wash in faster and faster, like high tide, they overpower the effects of the 4-AcO-DMT completely. At about the 9:30PM mark, it is almost as if we didnt take anything but 6-APB.<br><br>
For the next 8 hours, we proceed to have one of the most mind blowing, euphoric experiences weve ever had. Is 6-APB like MDMA? For me, it was better than any MDMA experience Id had before.  <br><br>
Nothing super insightful came of the trip. My wife and I talked for hours about all kinds of topics. We opened up about topics we havent discussed in years and forgave one another for minor things we hadnt talked about in a while.  All in all, the experience was very pleasurable.  <br><br>
We both fell asleep shortly after 5:00AM. I woke up around 12noon, I typically wake up far earlier than my wife. I had a fair amount of energy and the handover wasnt very bad at all.  My wife ended up sleeping almost all day, but the fatigue was all she really complained about.  <br><br>
In the future, I will likely not combine 6-APB with anything else.<!-- End Body -->
