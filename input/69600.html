<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body -->
I'm a very experienced psychedelic user, having taken most drugs in circulation and combinations of them. This experience, however, was quite unlike anything I've done before. I began the night, as usual, by getting quite drunk. Once the party died off, my friend suggested that I insufflate some 2c-T2 to determine the effects. Ive tried 2c-I and 2c-B, and figured that this experience would be relatively the same. Wrong!<br><br>
T=0: I snorted roughly 20mg through one nostril. The pain was unreasonably severe; even drunk I needed a pen to bite down on as a gag. Tears flowed from my eyes, and I just laughed at myself for submitting to this much pain.<br><br>
T+10m: My friend took about 15mg orally, and then gave me another 20mg to snort. (We tend to do drugs in really high doses, considering ourselves experienced enough to go farther than is recommended.) Once again, the pain was incredibly intense, but it subsided quite quickly.<br><br>
T+20m: Im sitting on the couch. Besides feeling pretty winded, Ive had one or two very intense but quick hallucinations. Both of them involved sudden distortions of location: it seemed as if the room spiraled around and crumpled up for only a second or two.<br><br>
T+30m: My body has begun quivering and shaking to a degree that I previously would have considered life-threatening. I have no control whatsoever over my motor functions, and the shaking has become so pronounced that Im unable to hold a glass of water without spraying it everywhere. This is the first time to date that Ive lost control of my body. Only by standing up really quickly and focusing on my location am I able to stop shaking. Presently, I vomit uncontrollably into a bucket, expelling nearly a gallon of fluid. After this, my body feels better but the quivering grows more intense.<br><br>
T+40m  T+2h: During this time period, I began to stutter. I dont mean mild stuttering. I mean full blown chattering, without any hope of actual communication. Ive never stuttered before, and never quite understood the mechanism that makes it happen. But for these 80 minutes, I was an incredibly annoying and pathetic person to be around. I could not be silent, because I had no control over my vocal chords. Fortunately, I was able to communicate in fragments by writing in a notepad. My mind was close to normal, but it was a real head trip to be stuck in a quivering sack of flesh and blood hopelessly repeating:<br><br>
T-t-tut-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-tut-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-tut-t-t-t-t-t. <br><br>
Although I was an entertaining prospect for my three friends, it was quite humiliating and frustrating.<br><br>
T+2.5h: Ive grown so embarrassed and angry at my uncontrollable stuttering that I seek a release. The friend who also ingested 2c-T2 suggested we smoke some Hash. After one long drag from the pipe, my stutter completely disappears. Thank god! We look at a picture on the computer screen, and with lots of concentration, I find it is possible to see hidden pictures WITHIN the picture. Most of them are frightening to me, mainly because Im on edge from having taken such a large dose.<br><br>
T+2.75h: It is now 3:00, and although my body is tired, my mind is not. Both of us decide to lie down. After a few seconds of shut eye, both of us bolt up and stare at each other intently. We have both simultaneously realized that 2c-T2 is all about CLOSED EYE VISUALS.<br><br>
T+2.75h  T+7h: The past 4.25 hours have been a journey that I could never forget, if only I could remember. These visuals that I experienced while half asleep and half awake were by far and away the most intense I can remember, besides of course DMT. By concentrating hard on a location, I could see it perfectly even with eyes closed. Needless to say, I was exploring completely unreached depths in my brain until mid-morning. Id love to relate some of the hallucinations, but they were so vivid and confusing that I found it hard to use words to describe them.<br><br>
Epilogue: From T+7:15 to T+13:00, I sleep peacefully and normally. Waking up, I know exactly what happened but am unable to remember specific hallucinations. All in all, I found this to be a very new and different experience, on a different level than most of my trips due to the unspeakably huge body load. I would do this again, maybe when I am able to cope with a rather derisive blow to my ego.<!-- End Body -->
