 "report": "<p>Having read some reports about gamma-C I decided to purchase some.  </p><p>Late one particular friday evening about a week after the gamma-C arrived I was having trouble sleeping and decided to try this new product.</p><p>I had heard various reports about how much to use.  Everything from 1g to 3g.  </p><p>I have a 1ml pipette and I calculated that 1ml = about 1g.  Since I weigh 190 pounds I opted to start at the high end of the dosage range.</p><p>This chemical looks like GBL and its viscosity is very similar.  But the smell is fairly strong and the taste is the worse!  I could not drink it strait or with water.  Finally I mixed it with Tomato juice.  </p><p>gamma-Crotonolactone with tomato juice tastes like a spicy bloody mary cocktail with a smokey flavor on top and a bit of extra burn going down.  I had an empty stomach as it was about 2 in the morning and I had not eaten since dinner time.</p><p>After about 25 minutes I started to feel the effects.  I felt a very slight nausea, much less than with g-BL or GHB.  A nice pleasant sedative effect soon overcame me.  I turned on the stereo with some light trance music.  I became completely relaxed and very happy.  I only wish I had been with friends as I really wanted to share the experience.</p><p>At about the 1 hour point I thought to myself that with this much GHB or g-BL that I would have gone to sleep.  The sedative effects of the g-Crotonolactone were stronger and deeper yet not too similar to GHB or g-BL.  They felt better.  But I did not fall asleep!</p><p>The whole experience lasted about 3 or 4 hours with the effects dropping off slowly over that time.</p><p>This is a great chemical.  The taste is too strong for the date rape crowd to use.  You could never put this into a drink, even a the strongest bloody mary without there being a strong and noticable taste.  Also, I did not sleep or pass out as I would have with GHB or g-BL.</p><p>This is my first try with this chemical.  I am really impressed.  I will share this with friends.</p>"
