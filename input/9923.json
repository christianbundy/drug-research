 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm often alone among my peers in that I experience much more intense effects from smoking marijuana than they do.  I often trip from smoking pot, and recently I experienced a very intense trip which was not all pleasurable.  \r\nI went to a friend's house, and smoked maybe six large hits from a blunt.  I began getting extremely high, and stopped smoking after that.  I started feeling very anxious, my heart was pounding and I could feel my muscles spasming irregularly, although not violently.  I went home and tried to relax, but I found it impossible.  \r\nI began to see straight up hallucinations, like a multicolored wave in from of my eyes just morphing and shifting, then neon psychedelic ribbons and spirals.  I felt like I'd eaten a ten-strip of acid.  I'm not sure what happened next but I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into this altered state, and I had trouble fighting it.  Even when I put on some music I found it a little frightening, as well as when I tried to placate myself with a movie; it was as if I didn't understand what these things were anymore.  I kept getting horrible shivers as well, that wracked my entire body, as if I were cold.  I ended up just going to sleep after some struggle, and felt fine in the morning.\r\nI think some people are hyper-sensitive to weed and maybe should just smoke enough to get a mild buzz, unless they are intending to trip.  I know I'm going to limit my smoking from here on out, and when I feel like tripping, I'll smoke like my friends do, which is without restraint.\n\n\n"
