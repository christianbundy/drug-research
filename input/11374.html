I had a fucked up, fucked up childhood and so when my friends started smoking cones at age thirteen, I was all for it. I honestly don't remember if I enjoyed myself or not, I don't think it really hit me for a few years. By the time I was seventeen I had a bit of an eating disorder, a few hang ups about my body, that sort of shit. I was pretty fucking happy alot of the time. I had heaps of friends, alot of boyfriends...that sort of thing.<br><br>
I'd been avoiding pot for a while. I'd notice I'd green out alot of the time, or get in weird moods where I couldn't talk to anyone. But one day I was at my friends house and I was offered a couple of cones. I wasn't in the mood but I said yes anyway. I'm that sort of person.<br><br>
I had two cones, a few cigarettes, a coffee and a lie down. About a minute after I lay down I knew something was wrong. It was my heart. It was racing so fast that I could feel the vibrations, my hands were shaking, it was missing beats, I stood up and I fell down. Everyone thought it was so funny. I had to crawl to the bathroom with everyone laughing so I could collapse on the tiles and try to shake the feeling.<br><br>
I was crying in the bathroom. It's hard to describe but I just knew in myself I was dying. I had denounced God years before, and here I was begging, pleading, screaming with God to save me. I was blacking out and coming to and seeing visions of God and the Devil (more like auras than human figures) and neither of them wanted me. I wanted to be with God so I promised him I wouldn't fuck my life up anymore. I said I'd cut off all my hair, stop smoking, swearing, fucking, anything.<br><br>
After a bit I felt a bit better, still really sick but not on deaths door. A friend came in and offered me a cigarette. I said 'fuck yeah' took a drag, and it all started again. I was sure God was punishing me.<br><br>
In the end I went to the hospital. My heart beat was 170 or something fucked like that. I stopped seeing my friends. The truth is I have never been the same since. I have an anxiety problem that is so bad that I can barely leave the house.<br><br>
It's not fair to say marijuana wrecked my life. I have a lengthy history of mental illness in my family. However I hate how people say pot is so harmless. Because for some people it is fucking hell.<br><br>
It was for me.<br><br>
If you don't like smoking cones just dont do it. It doesnt matter what your friend think it hits some people differently.<!-- End Body -->
