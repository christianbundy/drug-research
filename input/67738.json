 "report": "<p>This will be short and to the point. I suffer from insomnia and as such was perscribed ambien. I regularly enjoy a trip on mushrooms. I personally have never experienced a truly bad trip for a couple of reasons. 1. I like to think that 'bad' trips show us something about ourselves we can learn from. 2. I have ambien. Now I have never needed to actually abort a trip because of a bad experience because I know that if I need to I can make everything stop withing 30min.</p><p>When tripping if I take 10 or 20mg of ambien my trip seems to slowly ease down over about 30min and then (although you do still feel off baseline) pretty much stop. I am usually asleep withing 40 or 45min after taking the ambien. My advice to anyone out there who would like a safe guard (at least in my opinion) should attempt to aquire ambien.</p>"
