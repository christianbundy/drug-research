I had held on to these 10 8 mlg capsules of 2c-t-4 for quite a while after I had let a friend try it out with the normal effects of oral ingestion (heavy body load/no visuals at a ++ the whole 12 hours). So after working a double and feeling very bored with drinking, I decided to up double the dose and also insufflate them. While at the peak (which was very quick, I would say about 45 minutes) I took a very large hit of salvia (15x). This is when the story begins. For around 15 minutes as I can tell I was in a strange time loop in which I thought someone was spinning me around and playing a very twisted joke on me. When I came half way back to reality I decided that I needed my girlfriend (and sitter) to take me where I was outside and knew that I was alive. And not in the after life.  <br><br>
Once the salvia trip came fully off I realized that the 2c-t-4 had totally taken hold of my entire vision (no closed eye visuals though) waves of confusion and transparent collum slithers of light stayed in my vision. My only sanity was to close my eyes and listen to soothing music. My sanctity at the moment was my girlfriend who provided a warmth that I have never felt, maybe comparable to mdma. More visuals that were included were flashes of different lights from the corners of my apartment and a red strobe lights. A very amazing chemical if insufflated. Although I do not think it is for everyone (my friend did half a dose in the same method and just couldnt fall asleep.) In conclusion the salvia took me way beyond a place I could ever ever describe. But the 2c-t-4 was so amazingly strong and beautiful. I have taken large amounts of other substances but this combination took the cake. I was in another dimension for a long long time.<br>
And although it scared the shit out of me I am not afraid to see it again. <br><br>
