 "report": "<p>I began taking Tramadol in October 2003. I started with 3 pills, (150 mg). At this dose, it brings about euphoria. When first starting 4 pills would cause nausea and vomiting. Also, when first starting, sleep was pleasant, or at least laying in bed, in a semi-sleep state was pleasant.</p><p>The tolerance to this drug comes about quickly. At the height of my use I could take as many as 30 pills in a day[Erowid Note: this is considered an extremely high dose, see Tramadol Dosage]. I never did have a seizure, but I consider myself lucky. On a couple of occasions, after taking extremely high doses, I had uncontrollable spasms that lasted slightly more than a day.</p><p>The withdrawal symptoms I experienced included marathon sleeping sessions, vivid but pleasant protracted dreams, sweating and extreme fatigue. Nothing would relieve the fatigue but another dose, which clearly indicate physical dependence. The psychological dependence lasts at least 30 days.</p>"
