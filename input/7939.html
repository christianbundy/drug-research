All I have to say is WOW... astounding effects offered by the kava, and the Xanax just put me in another realm.  You see, I'm currently prescribed to Paxil (an SSRI), for depression, panic disorder, GAD, and social phobia.  I also take (on average) 2-3 mg of Xanax/day, in addition to a daily potent multivitamin to help with severe malnutrition; as well as current treatment for chronic hypoglycemia.<br><br>
However, a very stressful family situation today prompted me to try the kava powder in addition to 11 mg of Xanax and all I can say is I feel absolutely wonderful.  I would strongly suggest this 'drug' [kava] to anyone who suffers from these same disorders.  I would have to say that I don't think the Xanax had much to do with my uplift in mood-- it usually requires me to take around 15 mg to get the full effects.<br><br>
I took the first 1.5 oz of kava at approximately 9:00, after taking 5 mg of Xanax.  I then consumed another kava beverage containing 1 oz at app. 10:30, followed by another 6 mg of Xanax; another dose of kava consisting of 1 oz was administered at 12:00 midnight.  I'm still on my way to finishing that.  :-)<br><br>
The experience has definitely been quite a positive one--enough that I feel I may be able to ween myself off of the benzodiazepines in sticking to a bi-to-tri-daily regimen of kava root.<br><br>
The 'fucked-uped-ness' of these drugs is hardly akin to anything I've ever quite experienced from the use of benzodiazepines (such as Valium, Ativan, Xanax, and Tranxene) that I've been prescribed in the past.  It is much more lucid in cognitive process, among other things.  High suggestible-- if you suffer from any of these disorders, its worth trying.  It may work wonders.<!-- End Body -->
