This happened quite a while ago when i was in a hospital, i had been admitted because of error, but got to try scopolamine. BTW I had not eaten food for 6 hours, my stomache felt empty preceeding the intake of scopolamine. I was also on a prescription Benzodiazepam at the time (Ativan), but i don't think it affected the following experience as i had taken the Benzo that morning.<br><br><br>
T+0:00 - Liquid scopolamine of 5-15 ml, [wasn't looking at how much i was given, but it tasted like cherries, so yummie] I go to lay down and try to sleep.<br><br>
T+0:05 - Nausea begins to form.<br><br>
T+0:10 - Nausea becomes increasingly unbareable, it feels as though someone or something is grabbing my stomache and it does not feel good.<br><br>
T+0:15 - Nausea has transcended into an extremely unpleasant feeling, (it feels as though someone is trying to tear my stomache apart) I toss and turn because it hurts so much, and i start to feel as though a dream-like haze has come over me.<br><br>
T+0:25 - I am sitting on my bed next to a curtain which has flowers all over it; This curtain starts to flutter a bit as though it is windy out, but there is no window open.<br><br>
T+0:30 - I feel weird, looking to and fro everything starts to look somewhat blurry and dreamy.<br><br>
T+0:35 - I look at the curtain and i see a face where there should be a flower.  I look away and then quickly look back and see 2 faces, then 3, 5, and so on.  By now it looks as though these children I am seeing are spirits.  The spirits look just like the ones off of the haunting (that movie where the rooms are distorted so that they look as though there are ghosts).<br><br>
T+0:40 - The spirits start calling my name in whispers.<br><br>
T+0:?? - I fall asleep, or lose cosciousness shortly after.<br><br>
All in all, this experience was very interesting, very hard on the stomache, but not scary like some substances may seem to some people (acid for example).<!-- End Body -->
