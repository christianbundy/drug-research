 "report": "<p>Within the past three weeks I have decided to take acid for the first time in my life. The first time for a concert, the second time at a friends house. Both of these times I took 1 hit of acid with others. The first hour or so nothing occurred. Later on the only feeling I had was a sort of body high. After that everything just faded and I felt normal again. My friends all ate the same amount and were in a completely different state of mind then I was. They were all having a complete trip but nothing happened to me. I have been taking 20 mg of Prozac daily for over a year now and I wonder if this is causing the effects of LSD to not occur.</p>"
