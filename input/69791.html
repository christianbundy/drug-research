It was a generally fast feeling week for me. I'd completely done all my homework for school and I was looking forward to the weekend. All my friends were going to a friends house for the night and another friend had promised me he knew a drug dealer and that he would buy us Acid of him. The weekend came and it was Friday. I walked down to my friends house and before we left, we gathered our money for the bus and the money for acid so we could meet up with the drug dealer.<br><br>
We probably stood around for a good hour waiting for him but finally we had all met up. My friend who knew the drug dealer greeted him and had a small chat and then he showed us what seemed to be a bag of 8 pills (two for each of us.) Immediately I was confused and although I was new to acid, I know for a fact that acid primarily comes in gelatin, blotter, and/or as a sugar cube, but I wouldn't question the guy because he seemed assuring. Frequently he suggested that we smoke pot with this too. We gathered our money together and payed him.<br><br>
We all argued what our plans would be for the night and when we would take the pills as we bussed home. Finally at 8:00PM we ended up standing in the middle of a gazebo at night in a memorial park by my friends house. We all held the pills within our hands, it appeared as pale yellow color with a DC logo imprinted on them. We counted down from five and at one, the pill was in our mouth. I knew immediately nothing was going to happen but I was still completely unexpected for what's to come.<br><br>
Right after, we had taken a break from walking and busing so we chilled out at a place called the youth center. We played some billiards and xbox there. My friend suggested that I closed my eyes and requested if I saw anything that he tell me. The first thing I noticed is that I enjoyed feeling things more.. Yet, no visuals but I'm starting to feel energetic and a bit more social than usual, I just assumed this was apart of the experience and that something will abruptly skew eventually. It was about 9:30 PM and we had a couple girls with us to walk to a park and sit down on the swing set and stuff. We walked for about an hour and still nothing. At this point I was restless, and wanted to know if I would see anything anytime soon. My friends just re-assured me 'Just wait..' as if it was just about to come.<br><br>
Still at the park, I needed to take a piss so I walked over by a fence and whilst pissing, randomly observed the backyard of some strangers house. I was trying to believe that what I had taken was acid and that I could only see something if I let my mind be free. After I was done, I turned and my friend was walking up to me as he's dancing. He puts one of his earphones in my ear, and he says 'You have to try this!' he's playing 'Daft Punk - Digital Love' and I noticed that I found the music incredibly repetitive yet really rhythmic and enjoyful. I kept the earphone in my ear for awhile and that was enough to set me dancing while walking for the rest of the way.<br><br>
It's about 10:30PM now and we've split up with the ladies and we're now walking in the direction of my friends house. Along the way we are gravitated towards the loud sound of what appears to be a band playing in a cafe for 'Open Jam Friday.' We walk in and immediately make ourselves comfortable at a table nearby. We sat for awhile watching the various musicians play songs. I met up with an old friend there too and she told me to get on the drums since she knew I was a drummer. About maybe 15 minutes later I decided 'what the fuck,' and got up there and played with a band.<br><br>
It was now around midnight and my friends and I walked home all together. It's now midnight exactly, my friend offered me upp with another pill, and I couldn't refuse so I took it. 12:30AM After playing a few rounds of Counter-Strike with a friend beside me I gathered that what we took was not acid at all, because at this time (now 4 hours later) I had not experienced any hallucinations at all. Around one, one friend who had a second pill and I were completely uncomfortable with ourselves and were worried about what we took, our minds just racing off the walls, our hearts beating strong and fast. We needed something to calm us down. So we ventured off into the living room with the TV in it, we sat for a bit and had something to eat. We planned on smoking but we put it off for awhile, and finally I was settling down because we had figured out what we had taken. It was 2C-B or 'Nexus' pills, the only thing I was worried off of is if I would suffer an addiction at all, but we were settled now.<br><br>
I tried playing guitar but I found that the guitar needed tunning, I was having a hard time trying to establish the perfect pitch so I just gave up and opened my binder, tried to write and found that hard as well. My arm simply couldn't stay in one place and was uncomfortable being leaned on. It was around this time where I'd become incredibly horny, and me and my other friend were the only ones who were talking about it. Also, I had an incredible affectionate speech about the love for my girlfriend and how her absence made me sad. I tried to ring her up a couple times, her house, her friends cell, her friends house, her cell phone. And then gave up, I wasn't completely disappointed though<br><br>
I urged my friend to escort us so we all could smoke. Eventually we did and it's about 3AM. We lit up a bowl expecting just a normal high and at this point I was almost sure that the 2C-B was worn off. After we smoked I voyaged back into the house feeling very weird. My friend ordered me to take the lamp into his bedroom, but immediately as I entered the house I forgot where he wanted me to put it and didn't know where the lamp belonged at all. So I put it down where my shoes were. Walked into the main room and the only thing I cared about was playing counterstrike.<br><br>
As time went on the effects and feelings became more and more intense. I started noticing graphical flaws within the game and the antialiasing was more vivid to my eyes now, plus the screen framerate was starting to irritate my gameplay experience and eventually I just put myself in spectator. I talked to my friend beside me and he was explaining to me what he had described as a 'constant headrush' and almost right after he said it, I had the same experience. Later again, I told him I was experiencing the headrush even further and he agreed, at that moment I knew both of us had this visual subconscious image of our brains being washed over with a tidal wave of blood. He pointed to the screen and told me 'The refresh rate is so low. This is such a shitty monitor.' I came back to my game of CS, even though the sound was on, I was focusing more on the nearby ambient sounds coming from within his computer. The fan he had mounted on his processor started to make noises like someone saying 'Ahh' repeatedly and each one was higher pitched than the last. Also I could of recall hearing my sleeping friends behind me have a conversation right by my head involving something to do with what there plans are for next weekend. I had no intentions on being awake at this point because every single sound and indistinguishable visual seemed like a threat to me.<br><br>
It was not 4AM and I fell asleep.<br><br>
The next morning I felt no different other than the fact that I was incredibly burnt, other than that. I felt fine.<!-- End Body -->
