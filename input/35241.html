I had been aware of scullcap as a plant with psychoactive qualitys for around a year before I finally found some growing wild. In the mean time I had picked a few different plants that I had misidentified as skullcap only to get them home and realise. Being of the labiate family, I have mistook several varieties of mint, woundwort and dead hen bit, for skullcap. Some notes on identifying:<br>
1. Once I've actually come across one, I wont mistake it. Its flower heads are unique.<br>
2. The smell is a good indicator - skullcap has a very faint scent that is slighly sweet. Other labiates tend to have very strong scents.<br>
3. Skullcaps tend to grow in wet, shady places such as pond sides, marshes, etc.<br><br>
Having found a supply of skullcap growing wild I took about half of the plants growing there, and left the others so there would be a supply next year. I set to drying them out, but a few days after collecting I decided to roll a joint of the still damp leaves to test it out, I mixed it with tobacco to ensure it burned.<br><br>
before I go any further I should say that I had heard reports comparing skullcap with high strengh marajauna. I was sceptical of this - if it was that good why wasn't everyone doing it? So perhaps I was a little gun-ho in my approach to it, but I've tried that many supposededly psychoactive plants that didn't have an effect or I  practically had to consume a field of the stuff for a mild buzz.<br><br>
Anywise, I lit the skullcap joint, it was a very pleasent first drag, a sweet, woody smoke, a little harsh perhaps. The effects became apparent immediately. I felt very relaxed, lightheaded, a little giddy, but it was very different from a marajuana high. I got an instintive feel that this was a plant that is best smoked outside, in a quite spot, woodland or the like. It was like the plant was telling me that is where it was meant to be smoked. <br><br>
This initial sensation of relaxation soon turned into sedation. I had difficulty lifting the joint to my mouth. I managed to smoke about two thirds of the joint. I was still able to talk, or mutter to my wife (or I think I was still able to talk) but I have no recollection of what I was saying. I went to bed and fell into a very deep sleep for about twelve hours during which I had many dreams. The dreams themselves were not unusual as dreams go, it was simply the profusion of them. Towards the end of the sleep I kept waking, feeling grumpy, then falling straight back asleep. I needed to go to for a piss but everytime I woke up to go I fell straight back asleep. When I finally got up, I felt deeply rested and relaxed and happy. <br><br>
It is definitely a plant I will further experiment with, although I will be a bit more respectful in the future. A very pleasent and different experience.<!-- End Body -->
