Deprivation of smoke can lead to curiosity, which has been said to kill cats.  Fortunately, I'm not a cat.<br><br>
Prompted by a longterm lack of cigarettes and weed, I decided, a few days ago, to pick some sage leaves out of an herb box out on the porch and try to smoke it.  I left them on a high cabinet where they wouldn't be disturbed for a few days, actually about half a week, to dry.  I would've used an oven, but I researched and found the boiling point of Thujone, the supposed active chemical in Sage, to be slightly lower than that of water.<br><br>
I checked on the leaves earlier today, and by checking that one of them burned quite nicely when lit with a match I determined they were dry enough to smoke.  I took two thin OCB papers and stuck them together so there would be more paper to help the plant burn, as I was unaware of how well sage burns, and I often either double-paper or spliff when I'm burning particularly moist weed.  I broke up the leaves, observing quite a strong smell that made me think of minty lotion.  I saved a little for later and came out with a relatively thin cigarette.<br><br>
I had tried once before to smoke sage from a box in my spice cabinet, but it was finely ground into a powder and the cigarette didn't drag well.  I also assume the company must've heated the plant up to dry it quicker, boiling out the water and all the Thujone.<br><br>
I wasn't expecting much from my sage cigarette as I headed outside, but I figured I might as well smoke it, just to enjoy the act of smoking.  I lit it and found it to burn nicely, though the double papering was a bit unnecessary and the cigarette burned somewhat quickly.  The smoke had that same minty lotion taste and it stung my mouth a bit as I inhaled.  My lungs are quite numb to smoke, so I'd be a poor judge of whether or not it was particularly harsh.  My mindset was clear, though I was obviously bored enough to be smoking garden sage.<br><br>
I began to experience a bit of light headedness, which I believe happens whenever someone inhales smoke.  But, to my great surprise, I began to feel mildly inebriated.  And it didn't go away.  It slowly got stronger.  I decided that this first cigarette had worked nicely and I'd try a second, rolling the rest of what I had, this time into just one paper.  I smoked it and the effects began to kick in stronger.<br><br>
The high is mild, though there was certainly a high.  I felt a nice buzzy feeling inside my head, as I always do from drinking or weed.  There was almost no body high.  Weed has often given an effect I like to call crazy thoughts, or the rapid flow of ideas.  Sage provided very little of that, though I was feeling quite spacey.  I smoked the sage about 3 and a half hours ago and I still have a nice buzz in my head.<br><br>
Overall, fresh Sage gives a nice, and I reiterate, surprisingly nice head buzz and it definitely makes me high, though it's DEFINITELY NOT weed.  I did a little more research, though and found Thujone to be toxic to the liver and brain, so I would not recommend this.  <br><br>
Anyway, that's about it.  Peace.<!-- End Body -->
