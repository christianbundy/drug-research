I had just ended another hard week and yet somehow, another week was just starting. It was Monday and I decided to plan something to look forward to later in the week. Little did I know it would end up being one of the most unpleasant weeks of my life (so far). I was looking online for something that I could take that would be easy to find and seemed relatively safe. I read about Nutmeg and it seemed like a good idea.<br><br>
Tuesday - I woke up bright and early and decided to take some nutmeg with breakfast before school. I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea, but I did it anyway. I took 2 tbsp of McCormick ground Nutmeg at 8:00AM once I was done driving and at school. I waited, and waited. Nothing all day. That evening I did some more research and found that I needed fresher nutmeg. I stopped by the store. I couldn't find actual un-ground nutmeg, but I did find McCormick gourmet 'fresh-ground' nutmeg. I purchased it.<br><br>
Wednesday - This time I was thinking a little more clearly and decided to take the nutmeg AFTER school.<br><br>
4:30PM - Had my mixture of 3 tbsp nutmeg and milk all made. I downed it and had to eat Oreos once I had finished it to wash down the taste.<br><br>
7:00PM - I started to feel a little more up-beat, and my vision became a little more blurred. At this point I was talking on the phone with a friend and looking something up on the internet.<br><br>
7:30PM - My friend didn't know I was taking nutmeg so I decided to end the phone conversation because it became very hard to listen to what he was saying and answer sensibly within a reasonable time.<br><br>
7:45PM - It put on some music and enjoyed it. The music seemed to flow through me and I could see it go out through the back of my head. I think this is when it was really coming on hard. I watched the visualization on my computer. It seemed that the computer's music visualization knew what I wanted to see and displayed it for me.<br><br>
7:55PM - I could barely stay up on my chair. I shut off the lights, they seemed very bright, and fell onto my bed. It was very comfortable. I felt as if I were sinking into the sheets, just going down farther and farther into them.<br><br>
8:00PM - I started to fall faster, and faster. I knew at this point what was going to happen. I knew that I was going to start to panic. I spoke out loud 'God damnit!' my own voice startled me and echoed off my walls. I tried, without any luck, to get back to the exremely happy place I was in just five minutes ago.<br><br>
8:10PM - I really had to go to the bathroom so I got up and went. While I was in the bathroom my mouth felt very dry so I gargled some water. Now that I think back on this, it remember that my lips started to really hurt. I now remember that I went back into my room, then back to the bathroom and gargled water over and over again without noticing it. I don't know how many times I repeated this action, but after a while all the things I would see on the way, the microwave, the bathroom door handle, the hand towel, it all seemed too firmiliar so I stopped myself and went into my bed.<br><br>
8:30PM - I though wow, this sucks, it must be like 10PM by now. I was dissappointed when I looked at the clock and it was only about 8:30 because I wanted this feeling to stop. I tried to sleep it off but every time I would start to doze off I would feel like I stopped breathing and I heard an extremely loud noise in my head. This kept happening when I would try to sleep and I was positive that I was going to stop breathing and die once I fell asleep so I tried to stay awake. I watched the clock and each minute felt like a year.<br><br>
9:00PM - My heart was racing and I couldn't stay awake, but I didn't want to die so I went into total panic at this point. I ran out of my room and found my little brother playing on the computer. I asked him to feel my heartbeat just to make sure I wasn't just imagining that it was fast. He said it felt like 160 beats per minute. He told me that that was normal if I was sprinting at the time. This freaked me out and I told it it was because I had a bad dream. I sat on the couch and started to watch Oprah. Oprah gave me a sense of comfort, but during every commercial I would go into panic again and think I was going to have a heart attack.<br><br>
9:30PM - I finally told my brother what I had done. He looked up some information on nutmeg and told me a lot of people think they are going to die when they take it. This gave me some relief, I just had to wait till morning.<br><br>
10:00PM - I finally went to sleep having been comforted by my brother, and was awakened by my mom, she had just gotten home and my brother told her what I did. I thought of telling him not to tell her, but I secretly wanted her to know because at the time I thought I was going to DIE and what's better than the comfort and love of your mother? She told me I was stupid and that I better get up nice and early tomorrow so I won't be late for school. I chuckled, trying to act normal, I cracked a few jokes about the situation to ease the awkwardness. She then told me that she got a call and it turned out my car was stolen from the mechanic's shop. Just the perfect ending to my, what I felt, was a near death experience.<br><br>
The next morning I got up at 6:15AM and had to get ready and go to school. It sucked so much, I could barely take a shower, I didn't know where my clothes were and so it took me a while to get into the shower because I needed new clothes to change into before I got in. For the rest of the week I didn't learn anything and everyone would come up to me and ask what's wrong and I would just say nothing, until the next week I could talk to my friends again.<br><br>
Overall this was horrible, my week was ruined, and for a while later I couldn't go to sleep at night because I would remember what it felt like when I tried to sleep on nutmeg. I also had to talk to a few police officers about my car, which they found, and when I went to the station I knew that they must have known there was something wrong with me, but they didn't. Finally it took a whole second week until I could actually feel my limbs when I touched them or the brushed up against something without feeling a wierd tingling.<br><br>
I don't know what went wrong, but boy did it suck.<!-- End Body -->
