 "report": "<p>I rapidly develop tolerance to sedative-hypnotics. My physician and I were troubled when all the traditional sleep aids had failed: Ambien (zolpidem), ProSom (estazolam), Valium (diazepam), Restoril (temazepam), Atarax (hydroxyzine).... I could go on. </p><p>Flurazepam or Dalmane was able to give me just enough sleep on the second night. Strangely, Dalmane has a ~130+ halfhour in the body. So every night you take Dalmane more had subsequently built up hence the action of the drug. I was grateful for the sleep, but the drugs consistent levels in the blood during the day can cause residual sleepiness...</p>"
