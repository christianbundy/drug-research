 "report": "<p>Time: 8:00</p><p>Dose: 6 gram cup of brewed Syrian RU Tea. Boiled down to about 2 sips ingested.</p><p>Oncoming effects: within 15-30minutes, noticed well after 45minutes and well noticed after some marijuana.</p><p>Time:9:00</p><p>Dose: 40 mg Diprophyltryptamine insuffalated</p><p>Oncoming effects: within 5 minutes, strong effects progressed for the next 2 hours</p><p>Time:10:46 - still experiencing strong effects at its peak, came down by 11:30</p><p>Mental Effects: Auditory, Visionary Hallucinations, Pattern Shifts, Change in perception, High resolutions colors, Lucid intervals, Euphoria, Empathy, Sympathy, Paranoia, Mind blowing experiences, fifth dimensions, endless spirals (fractals), feeling of everything flows together in the endless spiral. </p><p>In a nut shell, it was like my favorite wooden roller coaster that lost control, derailed, then smashed into a brick wall, compared to like a merry go round that is.</p><p>Physical Effects: anxiety, rapid heart beat, shakes, chills, jaw clenching, sexually interesting, sensations, feelings of gastric bubbles being released threw skin (mental?), numbness, loss of feelings of body parts, scattered speech.</p><p>After some experiences with DPT, and with Syrian Rue, which contains Harmala, an MAO inhibitor, me and some friends decided to try Dipropyl-Huaska I would say, but it was a little more extreme, I do not recommend for anyone to try this, MAOI's are dangerous, and have limits when being on them, research into them before deciding to mix them with ANY substance.</p><p>Anyway we know the MAOI acted as an inhibitor, and by drinking some Syrian Rue tea, a lot less DPT would get us all to the fullest effects, so it was five of us, we each drink the tea, the taste wasn't good, tasted like a cup full of pills, but I've  had worse, an hour later we decided it was time to take the DPT, we never found any sites or trip reports here of insuffalation with an MAOI, only ingestion of larger doses. We estimated 20 mg would be enough. Our scale wasn't accurate, and the lines came to around 40 mg each. After it was up it took hold pretty quick, i was still getting drips when I noticed a mushroom like feeling where the air was rushing like a river, it was coming on fast, and we were enjoying it, I asked my friend if he wanted to go outside so we went into the backyard where the temperature change only made it work harder, being outside at night and in the rain the visionary effects were extraordinary, but I was feeling very weird, and it had only been about 10 minutes after I had taken it, we came back into the house, and here is where things started getting crazy.</p><p>My energy was too powerful, I had to much of it, and the change of temperature from warm to cold to i didn't know anymore threw off any balance I had left with myself, I admit I felt like I lost it, and I bet the others did too, I noticed my friend convulsing, I had shakes too especially from the temperature change, I was getting way tripped out, My friend would explain it as, you were expecting the walls of the room to fall and behind it see cameras and the directors set. We all were freaked out, we knew we took to much. I sensed bad feelings, I sensed others around me getting sick and losing there stomachs, to my disappointment all in my stomach were some very strong upsetting tea, and purple stuff (1% grape juice), so I lost it as well. It is never fun throwing up in the middle of an extreme trip, not to mention the hallucinations didn't help, and the I didn't know what was going on either. I didn't make much to the toilet, I tried cleaning up my own mess, but it was making me sicker being in the bathroom, and when i tried wiping it up it just felt like a thick purple slime, also even the fact I was throwing up didn't upset me but the hallucinations, Auditory had me running in and out of the bathroom trying to answer question, and reply to people who weren't even there. I had to clean it up when things calmed down, not for another hour or so, before i could even reenter that room. So the bathroom wasn't a pleasant place, 3 out of the 5 of us got sick, this was from the Syrian Rue. DPT was a total ego disillusion, and for awhile we were just existing, and we knew it, I felt the world and energy off everything, and it gave me not much sympathy, over-all the experience gave me the truth of the world being more than human, Recreationally at the same dose with no MAOI is a better time, with smoother ride, but this was some trip I'll tell you that. This report is just to show what to expect if you decide to try DPT with an MAOI, not the mention threw the insuffalation route, don't expect to be able to do much, we couldn't even handle looking at a cartoon. Total time of the trip about an hour and a half followed by the DPT buzz-high feeling following that for another few hours. The most intense trip I ever had, more than Ayahuska, but less pleasant, some who I was with compared it more to 5meo-DMT, but it was Dipropyltryptamine a very majestic synthetic compound.</p>"
