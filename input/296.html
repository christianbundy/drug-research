I usually smoke weed on the regular to help calm me down before i goto sleep.  As the other report stated, i was out of weed, and in need of something to get me buzzing before i went to bed.  I remembered my mom had aquired a bottle of tylenol 3's for a condition she was having with her foot, and had said when she took them, all they did was make her drowsy and dizzy. I also remembered that a while back, my friend had busted his collar bone and had to take pills with codeine in them, and he said they made him hallucinate.  <br><br>
With no other means of attaining a buzz, i went to her bathroom and took 3 of the tablets to my room, along with a spoon and a full cup of water (the glass was about 6-7 inches tall filled about 1cm from the top.)  I took the spoon and mashed the pills into a fine powder (hoping it would hurry the effects along) and dumped it all into the water and drank it (i had just eaten dinner about 30 - 45 minutes before).  It wasnt the best tasting thing i'd ever had, but i was able to gulp it down without gagging.  Within about 10-15 minutes, i started feeling relaxed and comfortable sitting watching TV.  in the next 10 minutes i started getting dizzy, like when you're drunk (not pissy drunk, just drunk).  The total effect i felt was like when you smoke weed (cotton mouth, euphoria, relaxation) but i didnt have the slightest hint of paranoia... I'd never tried codeine before this and from my experience, a good lower dosage is VERY enjoyable and relaxing, and if i run out of weed again, ill be lookin for tylenol 3's again :)<!-- End Body -->
