DMT source: 500g of Mimosa sp. root bark, 6L of sugar cane distilled brew (about 39º GL), 9L of acidified water (w/ lemon juice)<br><br>
MAOI source: moclobemide (Aurorix)<br><br>
After depuration, all the liquid became a strong, dark purple syrup with a brown and purple mud at the bottom (just decanted for an hour or so). <br><br>
I ate a green apple and took two moclobemide pills (resulting in 300mg). Then, waited for 30 minutes, reading De Philosophiae Consolatio from Boetius. Put some of this syrup along with the mud in a tequila glass (some 55 mL). <br><br>
I was a little tired (woke up to early) and hungry, but feeling good.<br><br>
It was very dry and bitter, as if I were licking some wood floor. Some nausea appeared, but I controlled the situation.<br><br>
After more half an hour, I had to give up reading and went to the sink to vomit. Most of the brew went out, but I was feelling terribly sick... My whole belly was in pain, as well as my balls.<br><br>
My brain and nerves just seemed to have been transformed into a wood pin cushion. A voice anticipated what was ready to come: Hey, boy, you thought you were a full grown man, but now youll have to take this.<br><br>
The pleasure I was expecting was far distant from this terror. Im very used to the regular ayahuasca (Psychotria sp.+Banisteriopsis caapi ssp.) and even when threwing up this common ayahuasca I never felt what Mimosa was provoking: a real overwhelming panic.<br><br>
At that moment, I could discern that the whole event was in my mind, so I could briefly explain to my fiancee how she could help me.<br><br>
I went to bed, not wanting to hear any of the good music I brought to the experiment. Not even indirect light was bearable. My heart was beating as if it were some dark metal band drum. I couldnt help myself to be quiet, as I trembled all over, but voluntarily did this in order to dissipate some of the bad impressions.<br><br>
The image of a young friend of mine whos dying from brain cancer was present, as well as the certainty that shell die next year (unfortunately).<br><br>
This image appeared to be some kind of warning concerning the scratchs I had in my brain, along with some noise itching (which I interpreted as brain or cerebellum disorder).<br><br>
Endogenous DMT seemed some kind of extraterrestrial device to examine our inner souls. Such an imagery appeared as a computer presentation.<br><br>
Then this afro woman, much wrathful, showed herself and started to tell me that if I didnt quit such experiences, Id die as my friend.<br><br>
I was reminded of my beloved ones and all that I did bad to them. I got embarrassed and went on some kind of pardon petition.<br><br>
Most of the trip was confusing, but ended after 3 hours or so.<br><br>
I fear if the alluminum on the pans I used was present in the brew, because of the acidified water, thus intoxicating me to a critical point.<br><br>
Im feeling some hang over even now, two days after my personal doomsday... (ehehehe)<br><br>
Examining the advices from the shouting black witch, Im intending to follow them, although I feel sad thinking like this. I was in the mood for some rainbow visuals and nice thoughts and got this. Maybe the roots showed me my shadow, my Hades...<br><br>
Anyway, it was harsh and crude, but very profitable from many points of view... If I decide to repeat it, itll be a very smaller dose, of course!<!-- End Body -->
