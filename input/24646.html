I had only tried nitrous recreationally a few times before.  I'd had it at the dentist, but they give a relatively small dose mixed with oxygen, so you don't have the intense rush you get with whippits.  And it's got to be just about the most intense rush I've ever experienced.  I've smoked meth on a regular basis and never had a rush like that.  Of course meth feels better, is a lot more useful and lasts a hell of a lot longer but that's besides the point.<br><br>
Anyhow, I had recently acquired a whipped cream dispenser which I think is the only way to go if you're into nitrous.  It's so easy a baby could use it and it doesn't leak what so ever.  So I'd been trying out my new little 'bong' all day and I decided to try for those elusive out-of-body experiences people talk about.  I lined up seven to see how fast I could do them but I kept getting so caught up in the rush that I felt I wasn't doing them fast enough to achieve the effect I desired.  So I decided that I would do 10 cartridges as fast as I possibly could.  I was doing them pretty damn fast and getting real fucked over and I started feeling queasy after about the 8th one but I finished them off anyway.  The rush got amazing but no out-of-body shit.  Then I really started to feel sick.  I felt drunk and I wanted to puke.  I ended up vomiting up everything I'd just eaten (and I mean, JUST eaten) and felt the effects for at least another hour.  It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but considering that I got just as good rushes after 2 or 3 and felt great, it was a total waste.<!-- End Body -->
