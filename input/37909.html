I'd rather be addicted to shooting heroin. I can say nothing good in retrospect about this drug. I woke up after 17 hours of sleeping, my nails are chewed to hell with dried blood and dirt and I think grease. I'm not exactly sure where my car is, and I have cuts and bruises all over my body and I dont know how I got them.  I think I might never do drugs again because of this.<br><br>
I came into contact with 4-mta about 6 days ago. I met a guy who I was buying chrystal from and he said his Friend who he refered to as 'chemist' (who does all the cooking) has been involved in cooking something new.  <br><br>
4-mta is one hell of a drug, it isnt even known too good on the streets by seasoned drug addicts or dealers.  99% of people I talked to about it never heard of it. I did it because someone has to be one of the first to try something. I know im not the first but im one of the few low percentage who was to try it.<br><br>
I did it for the first time on saturday October 30th, 2004; its now wednesday November 3rd 2004 and I barely remember anything.<!-- End Body -->
