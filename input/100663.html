I have a fairly extensive background with various psychedelics, including LSD, 2C-B, MXE, salvia, DMT, and DXM. I had previously taken an equal dose and a dose of 500µg separately, weeks before this experience. <br><br>
The night started out fairly normally. I was having a beer when several friends and I decided to drop some 25B-NBOMe blotters that I happened to have left over. I had experienced the compound twice before, but it hadn't ever hit this quickly. I had to go inside to get comfortable...immediately. I was used to this, as the come up was very much like this before. I felt very sleepy and couldn't seem to decide what temperature I currently was. Nearly everyone else in the room was also tripping, but at a dose of 500µg. They all seemed to think that I wasn't doing well, which made me feel worse. Eventually the negative effects went away. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I began to see most things in waves. It was as if heat waves were rising from every surface and they disturbed my vision.<br><br>
It was so nice out that I decided a walk was in order; I had to get out and grasp reality a bit. By this time I had intense OEVs very reminiscent of 2C-B. All lights had beautiful trails, the night sky seemed so deep and perfect, and the grass seemed almost virtual. Something was strange about the walk: everything was perfectly silent. Normally I might find that sort of silence to be eerie at such a time, but instead it was picturesque. The rest of the night was filled with more walking, scatterbrained thoughts about humanity, and a promise to not waste my time with 25B or any other RCs again. I'm not bashing, but I just don't see the reward in these sorts of experiences. <br><br>
Lessons Learned:<ul>
<li>Alcohol seems to have a major effect on this compound. It seems to make the come up quite miserable on the stomach, but way faster/more intense. I only had one beer and noticed these effects. Others in the group consumed a bit more.</li>
<li>This isn't much of a 'thinking' psychedelic. Compared to LSD, 25B is very hectic, cluttered, and leaves a rather unpleasant hangover on occasion.</li>
<li>Be very careful with dosing. The tabs I procured were 1mg complexed blotters. 1mg is a very substantial dose for 25B and I do not plan on ever taking it again, especially at that level.</li>
<li>It really isn't that great. Giggly, everything is pretty, but its just OK.</li>
</ul>
