Background: Taking daily fish oil and steroids<br><br>
Experience: 2c-i, LSD, DXM, DMT, Opium, various opiates, benzodiazepines, MDMA, amphetamines, nitrous oxide, and muscle relaxers.<br><br>
Earlier in the day I drank a small cup of Poppy pod tea made with 1 gigantic pod. I also took Omega 3 supplements and prescribed steroids. I had ingested what I would assume was ~25mg to ~45mg. I did have a mg scale but it would not properly measure this chemical. I had just left a party where I remained sober.<br><br>
T+0.00 I <br><br>
T+0.02 I'm Feeling waves of euphoria that start in my stomach.<br><br>
T+0.05 Euphoria starts to get to intense.<br><br>
T+0.08 Completely mindfucked at this point. I'm having trouble thinking and I'm not 100% aware of my surroundings.<br><br>
T+0.15 I start to take off my clothes and get to bed. It took me a while to get to bed and I just sorta froze up while undressing.<br><br>
T+0.25 I know that something is completely wrong. I try to lay there and rest every muscle in my body. I realize that my heart is pounding out of my chest. I do a quick 10 second pulse check start to really freak out when I realize my pulse is over 200bpm. Instead of multiplying by 6 I multiplied by 10 so my heart rate was really only around ~120bpm.<br><br>
T+0.26 It seems like an eternity has passed. Every time I look at my phone expecting it to have been at least 10 or 20 minutes the minute hasn't even changed.<br><br>
T+0.30 I realize that I'm having a panic attack. I've never had one before but I'm aware that some type of downer would help kill the trip. I popped 4 175mg Somas and lay back down.<br><br>
T+0.40 I'm having minor hallucinations and I'm freaking out really bad. I keep trying to talk myself out of this panic attack but It's not something that I can talk myself out of. At this point all I want to do is go to sleep.<br><br>
T+1.00 I'm having really bad thoughts. I keep thinking that I'm going to die. I know that I overdosed and I know that I should be going to the hospital. I decided that my life isn't worth going to the hospital and my parents will find me dead in the morning. My heart rate is so high that I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. It's pounding out of my chest and I'm afraid it will tear through my rib cage. I keep thinking that my heart will eventually get tired and worn out and stop working. I've never been this scared in my entire life. I've heard of people seeing tunnel vision before they die and when I started going into tunnel vision I started freaking out even worse. In a way my life starts flashing before my eyes. All that I wanted to do was wake up my parents and go to the ER but I knew that a drug overdoes from some unknown drug would just break their hearts. I buried my head in my pillow until I pass out.<br><br>
T+7.00 I wake up to get ready for work. As soon as I stepped out of bed I knew that I was still messed up. I called into work and went back to bed. I knew that something was seriously wrong with my brain and I didn't know if I would ever recover. <br><br>
T+12.00 I wake up and eat a light breakfast and take 100mg of 5htp. I still feel out of space and a little out of it.<br><br>
In retrospect I'm lucky to be alive now and I'm not sure why I had a panic attack/death scare from JWH-018 but this is a chemical I'll never touch again.<br>
It took me about 3 days before I felt back to normal. Let it be noted that me and a few of my friends have safely used this substance before without any problems. I don't know if I just overdosed or if the chemical interacted with any of the medication I was on.<!-- End Body -->
