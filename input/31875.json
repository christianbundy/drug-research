 "report": "\n\n\n\nThis is simply for informational purposes and embraces nearly every ambien experience that I've ever had.\r\nAmbien has a range of side effects that do not occur with benzodiazapines (concerning benzo's, ambien is structurally  similar). I have noticed darkening of all vision, and a darkening of the skin in particular, as if all the matter underneath the skin suddenly turned blue/purple. Confusion comes easily, and don't be surprised if you find yourself in a deeply hypnotic state. Your body is numb, and you can not feel an orgasm. Everything in one's body seems to swell up a bit. The drip from insufflated doses of ambien makes one want to vomit. Dry mouth is horribly present, to the point where your mouth is full of 'paste'. Visual distortions are common. Breathing becomes depressed, slightly.\r\nThese are from my observations, to help other users identify the 'weirdness' that accompanies the experience. If there are any structural/grammatical errors, I am on Ambien now and therefore could not care less.\n\n\n"
