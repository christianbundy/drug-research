First I would like to mention that Phenergan with Codeine, has 10mg of codeine and 6.25mg of promethazine per 5 mL of the syrup (so I took about 80mg of codeine and 50mg of promethazine)<br><br>
T+ 00:00<br>
Watching T.V. and instant messaging. Found a bottle of Rx cough syrup. I take about 3 5ml drinks out of this little medicine cup I have, then about a 20 ml drink, and a tiny sip out of the bottle, all this with some water. You can give or take a couple ml on the dose I said I took.<br><br>
T+ 00:10 <br>
Feeling relaxed, kind of warmer feeling in my face, good feeling though.<br><br>
T+ 00:20<br>
Same feeling just more of the relaxation part. Decide to turn TV off and put some tunes on.  Now I am listening to The Postal Service and still instant messaging.<br><br>
T+ 00:35<br>
Feeling a mild/nice head buzz, nothing really intense. Pretty relaxed.<br><br>
T+ 00:40<br>
Realized that time went by really fast, doesnt feel like its been 40 minutes, but now Im feeling more of an Opioid painkiller type feeling and kind of like everything is nice right now in the world, my legs feel a little tingly, but nice.<br><br><br><br>
Basically it stays like that for the remainder of the time that it lasts for.  I do not know if the Phenergan in the syrup had any affects, I know its for cough suppressant, but I took the recreationally and I dont have a cough.  I also have not taken codeine before, but have taken oxycodone and vicoden and such.  I would have to say that this is a really good relaxation method, or if you cant fall asleep this would probably help a lot.  I can compare this feeling to maybe snorting a little bit of oxycodone, or a mild oral version of it.<!-- End Body -->
