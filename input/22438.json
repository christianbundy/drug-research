 "report": "<p>I am a 52 y. o. male who has experimented w/ many drugs both legal and illegal.  For the last several years my experimenting has been limited to legal drugs. Deprenyl is very impressive.</p><p>I've just finished using my first 300mg bottle (12 ml )of Selegiline solution which has lasted several months.  The effects are always consistent beginning about 20 minutes after I place 3-6 drops under my tongue.  I definitely have a heightened sense of well-being and enhanced energy levels.</p><p>Sometimes 6 drops is a bit too much and I feel somewhat buzzed.</p><p>It is a good all purpose pick me up that never has interfered w/ sleep or apetite.  Women look SOOO MUCH better.  And when it comes to sex it reminds me somewhat of cocaine w/o any of the bad side effects.  It is awesome to feel so 'possessed' AND empowered, focussed and in full capacity to enjoy. My male friends have basically the same opinion.  I wonder how can something so good be so little known.  Women seem to have similiar experiences EXCEPT it doesn't seem to do much for their libido.</p>"
