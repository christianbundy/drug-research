I had heard almost nothing about Blue Lotus, a few mixed reports on Erowid &amp; something about a tv special.. that's about it.  Mostly what I read was combinations of the Lotus with other things.  I wanted to know what it could do by itself, so I ordered some from Herbal-Shaman &amp; on Halloween I decided to take it for a ride.<br><br>
First, I cut open a Tetley's tea bag &amp; stuffed 1 teaspoon into it, then I folded the bag over &amp; stapled it shut.  Then I boiled some water and steeped the 'tea' for 25 minutes.  The brew tasted pretty mild compared to San Pedro or Ayahuasca, but it had a bitter after-taste.  I took this to be a promising sign and finished the drink. Unfortunately I was not on an empty stomach, so I can't say I got the fullest effects.<br><br>
After finishing the brew I went downstairs and played some video games for like 20 minutes when I noticed my vision started to become distorted &amp; my mind was drifting.  Taking this as a sign that something was about to happen, I went upstairs and hid out in my bedroom, where I proceeded to smoke a whole bowl of plant material-- I wanted this to be good.  It was.<br><br>
I was reminded vaguely of both marijuana and opium by the feeling that slowly crept over me, except much less overwhelming.  I certainly didn't want to move, but some things seemed a little different to me.  Specifically the little figure on the hardware store bag in my room seemed like he was vitally important somehow, or like he was trying to tell me something.<br><br>
I realized that I could not be angry or sad, or happy.  My emotions, no matter what I pondered, were shut down.  Sedated-- like I get with Opium.<br><br>
I also noticed that in this state, I was able to answer myself honestly about some deeply personal questions that had been plaguing me.  It was a very liberating experience which took me to a whole new psychological plane.<br><br>
With marijuana, there is often much mental stuff that can go on, but the sensory experience overwhelms me so much that I can't think.  Lotus was like all the mental traits of marijuana with none of the sensory overload (except some visual distortion).<br><br>
I resisted the urge to mix it with anything else, I wanted to experience the Lotus alone.  It took about 90 minutes before I was back to baseline from the peak.  When I came down I was totally baseline &amp; went to sleep very, very easily that night.<br><br>
I would definitely do this again &amp; reccomend it to anyone.  I'm interested in the effects of combining it with Nitrous or Salvia, but not cannabis since I think the cannibas would overwhelm it.<!-- End Body -->
