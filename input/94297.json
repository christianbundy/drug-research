 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n00:00\r\nI had began the day smoking a few bowls of marijuana out of my bong. I had been researching a lot of theoretical physics and trying to imagine string theory in effect and the ten dimensions, as had been replicated by Asian university physicists using a supercomputer recently (a victory for science). I'm not going to go into physics this report, however it does play a major factor in my trip.\r\nI had left the house around 9:00pm on New Years night to go out and celebrate with friends. We smoked a joint and then left to go to an unlisted territory where we got some psychedelics. We got back to the house around 11:10pm. I had snorted half a capsule of 2C-P at around 10:30pm. I am not aware of the dosage, but I'm guessing it was around 5-10mg.\r\n00:45\r\nOkay, I had been feeling a little different around this point and we had reached the house. I felt mild sensations, however nothing remarkable. We then broke out the whippets. I have never done a whippet before, nor have I ever done a psychedelic (besides Morning Glory which was disappointing). I decided I could try some of them because they're non-addictive and have very temporary effects. My first few experiences with them were with a balloon. I remember inhaling, and then just fading out briefly. It had reminded me of when I used to me and my friends would purposely black out when we were kids. The tingling disassociating feeling that just whacks you in the head, and before you know it you're tuning back into reality.\r\n01:45\r\nIt had been over a hour and was just about midnight, when it became the year 2012. I had done about 4 or 5 whippets about this far. My friends were talking and I remember being very self-conscious of experiencing such a dumbing headrush infront of them. I would close my eyes so that I couldn't look dumb. That and the 2C-P had been making me feel a little anxious and uncomfortable. I hadn't been feeling too much of the effects of the 2C-P around this time, but it was climbing up. I had been experiencing some confusion from the nitrous. I sometimes would start talking, blank out, and then try to continue talking while remembering what I was saying.\r\n2:30\r\nWe were laying in my friend's bed at this time doing nothing at this point. I had been feeling more effects and side effects of the 2C-P at this point. I had continued using whippets, but only less frequently and only about 4 more canisters. The 2C-P was making my jaw tighten and giving me slight behavioral problems as I was thinking of the wildest things about things (including all the crammed physics I had learned the previous night). My pupils were extremely dilated at the time, they had consumed 80% of my cornea. As I was laying completely on my black and closing my eyes and enjoying some of the sensations and euphoria, I felt like I was being suspended upside down.\r\n3:20\r\nI had been doing my last whippet around this time which had been the most one of the two most intense ones. The first intense one was right before midnight, we were listening to trippy music and as I tuned back into reality I heard the sounds resonating to one pitch just like how wavelengths and strings vibrate. This second time occurring a little after the peak of the 2C-P felt the most powerful. I had 2 friends with me in the room and I was sitting on the bed. Seconds as I was inhaling the balloon it hit me, my body jumped from my shoes, my mind blanked and 5 seconds after as I was returning back from the headrush, I had realized one of my friends had left and went into another room, which tripped me out. It was like they gone up in left, but what had taken 10 seconds appeared to occur over 5 seconds for me as I was completely dumbfounded as my jenga tower of sanity was momentarily toppled.\r\n5:00\r\nThe past 2 hours or so were spent laying in bed and watching movies and napping. We were in a dark room and I had experienced a few mild auditory hallucinations except those brought on by the whippets. I hadn't really visually hallucinated throughout the trip, I had some colorful and mild CEV's and blurring and smudging of text (which I had experienced on the morning glory). I had experienced a little euphoria, mood lift, a bit of paranoia and insecurity, things seemed surreal. \r\nSummary:\r\nI later realized I could of tried acid instead, but unfortunately I had already snorted the 2C-P. I haven't touched a research chemical before, and I'm not in a rush to do so again. It's pretty effective, and should be taken seriously, and be aware of possible side effects. Nitrous is an interesting headrush, I won't be going out of my way to do again either. I had felt extremely enlightened as I got home, which was around 7:00am, and I hadn't slept because RC's usually keep you awake. I did some more reading on physics and experienced mild auditory hallucinations and smudging of text.\n\n\n"
