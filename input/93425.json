 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI take 2 600mg of the white oval kinda chalky pills at a time. I have anxiety problems and Gabby helps me to chill the f out.\r\nPros: helps me chill out, more social\r\nCons: shakiness, weird thoughts like worrying I'll get addicted to the shit\r\nI have a 2 year old girl and I play with her and take care of her just as well on it as I do off of it, but it's not something I would or do take every day, just when I feel I need to chill out.\n\n\n"
