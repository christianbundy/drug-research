I have anxiety problems and Gabby helps me to chill the f out.</p><p>Pros: helps me chill out, more social</p><p>Cons: shakiness, weird thoughts like worrying I'll get addicted to the shit</p><p>I have a 2 year old girl and I play with her and take care of her just as well on it as I do off of it, but it's not something I would or do take every day, just when I feel I need to chill out.</p>"
