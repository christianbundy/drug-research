alright, so I read about whippets on the internet, heard about the stuff from friends they get at the dentist. I had been wanting to buy some for quite a while, but it took me a while to find a place that sells them, anyway I found one, AU$4.60 for a box of 10 (~US$2.20).<br><br>
I made myself a nice little cracker from copper pipe fittings with a screw in the bottom to pierce the cartridge. At first I would just inhale a single cartridge, and that would be it, it was a nice buzz, everything looked and sounded weird, then I discovered more. Two cardridges at a time would just blow my mind, I would have 2 balloons, inhale one, breathe out, inhale the other. In a few seconds I would be totally out of it, then 'wake up' about 30 seconds later and think 'holy shit, that rocked' and reach towards the box for another 2.<br><br>
Just after inhaling the second balloon, I hold my breath, then slowly exhale, things slowly get weird, hearing 'helicopters' and vision gets all fuzzy like, thats the last thing I can remember. The high lasts about 30 seconds, when the effects slowly fade away and you return to reality.<br><br>
What happens in those 30 seconds I have no idea, it's so fucking weird not remembering anything and suddenly realising where I am and what the fuck just happened, usually sitting/lieing in a different position to what I can remember (like I'd be sitting on the couch, then I'd wake up lying sideways as if i've lay down). My friends have told me that after inhaling I just lose it, start hyperventilating and talking random shit.<br><br>
If you're wondering why I don't have more than 2, it's because after cracking 2, I'm too bombed out to crack the third and usually end up wasting it because I forget what the hell I was doing. ie. not putting the balloon on the cracker, letting the balloon go with the gas in it. I've had mates crack them for me, but I think two is the optimal experience without wasting.<br><br>
another thing which I've also noticed is after doing nitrous I have an unusual craving for a cigarette (which also taste almost like cherry (sort of) after nitrous!)<br><br>
peace - hope someone reads this and gets something out of it!<!-- End Body -->
