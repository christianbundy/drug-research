 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had been curious about the psychoactive effects of the lotus flower since I first read about their potential and historical signifigance.\r\nI ordered loose pink flowers and some gooey black extract. I first tried smoking the petals in a joint, which produced a quite mild (placebo?), relaxing effect. I found the same effect smoking the resin extract. Days later, I ate the rest of the resin, and found no noticable buzz, though I must admit, it was delicious.\r\nTwo months later, I stumbled upon whole, closed lotus flowers in a health food store. I purchased two. When I smoked the petals, I noticed the same, very mild, relaxation. However, when I came to the center of the flower, and noticed the untouched stamens, I decided to smoke them. Surprisingly, I had only smoked half of the joint when I felt a heavy, yet pleasant mental clouding, and felt like keeping still.\r\nI found the experience to be more gentle and less stupifying then other seditives I had tried, and am thankful for this find.\n\n\n"
