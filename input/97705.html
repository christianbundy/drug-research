Compound: 5-MeO-MiPT<br>
Dosage: 5mg, orally in a gel capsule<br><br>
Mindset: Adventurous, Bold<br>
Setting: College<br><br>
Trip #1:<br><br>
0:00 - Before taking a shower, I decide to dose myself with a little bit of 5-MeO-MiPT. Having only heard that it's a bit like MDMA in its effects ('The Tryptamine's Answer to MDMA' as one report would say), but also an aphrodisiac as potent as 2C-B, I figured it would be one of those things that would very pleasantly surprise me. Without much hesitation, I swallowed the dose and continued to take a shower.<br><br>
0:15 - After my shower, I decide to go smoke a quick bowl of weed to abate any anxiety that I am feeling. As soon as I had finished smoking my bowl, I felt a quick, warm rush surge throughout my body. I knew that it wasn't placebo, and that something was about to happen.<br><br>
0:45 - My mind begins to get into a weird, loopy, happy state. I listen to my loud ceiling fans run for a good while, and can pick apart every sound I am hearing emanate from that source. When I closed my eyes, I had heard everything. At this point, I figure that it was fairly active auditorily. From some reports I read, I saw that it 'wasn't too active visually', but I have to disagree because even at a small dose like 5mg, I saw patterning on some surfaces, and things appeared more vivid. Not to mention there were some minor tracers I was experiencing. My tactile senses were THROUGH THE ROOF and I felt like I could really understand the flow of conversation at its very core. The visuals were never really distracting, however.<br><br>
1:30 - I decide to test my motor coordination. At this point, I begin to realize that it has a very rolling feeling; it was at a low at this point. I proceed to get into a car, and drive my friends to a grocery store while I wasn't rolling too hard. It wasn't as much of a trip really during the valleys of the trip, just a general rolling feeling, accompanied with short-term memory loss.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> <br><br>
1:45 - I arrive at the store, and as I step out of the car, the rain against my skin was quickly noticed. It felt incredible. It was the first time I have felt rain hit my skin in nearly 2 months, and I had never experienced the rain like this. It was an absolute joy to stand in it. My tactile senses at that moment were at their peak, whereas my mind was relatively normal at this moment (though my short-term memory from this point onwards in the trip was completely shot). We shop for about an hour or so, and I was rolling all through it. I could take the harshest of criticisms in stride at this point, and I found it useful for psychotherapy.<br><br>
1:45-5:00 - My short-term memory of this timespan is almost completely gone. I sat around and talked with people during this time frame, and layed around.<br><br>
6:00 - I feel as though I am at a + at best at this point. It was like a sinusoidal wave of euphoria until the very end. I decide to drive an hour to give my friend a ride.<br><br>
8:00 - The body high ceases. The 5-MeO-MiPT has essentially worn off.<br><br>
Trip #2:<br><br>
0:00 - I take the dose in a gelatin capsule. The scale said it was between 5 and 6mg. It went down with almost no difficulty.<br><br>
0:20 - I begin to feel my first alert. A smile comes across my face, and then quickly goes away.<br><br>
0:45 - My friends drive me to Wal-Mart to pick up some ingredients for a drink we'll be making later that evening. This is when the effects begin to take hold. I get quiet, but a smile begins to come across my face, and it will not leave. I feel genuinely happy throughout. My friend notices that I am smiling a lot more than normal. + to ++<br><br>
1:30 - The effects are almost entirely present. I feel completely into my body, and my thoughts are relatively clear-headed, although at times they got a bit classically trippy. There were absolutely no visuals, although some patterning was present at this point. No colors changed, or even enhanced. ++<br><br>
2:30 - I begin to smoke hookah with friends and listen to music. I get fully immersed into the songs I pull from my mp3 player. I could completely and genuinely groove to just about any song, though I felt as though some would make me roll harder than others. I was completely awake by this point as well. By this point, it became very difficult to hide the fact that I was rolling, and it became obvious to those around me that I was. Visuals were beginning to take hold at this point, but nothing more than a + on them (color enhanced, but thats about it). Overall +++<br><br>
For the next few hours, I would sit down and talk with my friends. I could feel the roll coming and going, and my friends could visibly see when I was tripping and when I wasn't. There were the giggles of shrooms at points, as well as a glimpse of their insights, but not the full magic of them. There were also plenty glimpses of MDMA, but it lacked its full magic as well. It was a cross between the two.<br><br>
5:00 - The effects begin to wane. Many great conversations were had, and many silences shared. It felt great, and the comedown begins around here. +++ to ++<br><br>
6:00 - 8:00 - The effects have almost completely worn off. When I was drinking during this point, I felt in great spirits, and portions of the trip had returned.<br><br>
Body High: Varied between 4/10 and 10/10<br><br>
This is where that rolling feeling truly came from. I really did feel the roll throughout. I could tell when I wasn't tripping that hard, or rolling that hard, than when I was. There was absolutely no nausea associated with this that I can recall. It felt very gentle overall, and very benign. My sense of taste, smell, and hearing were also enhanced. One thing I noticed in particular with the tactile sense was that anything pressed even lightly against my groin felt absolutely amazing. A very potent aphrodisiac, no doubt.<br><br>
Mind High: Varied between 3/10 and 9/10<br><br>
My short-term memory was completely gone for a while. I cannot remember portions of that trip, even at such a small dosage. However, with that being said, it varied between fair mind clarity to very mind-fucking. I would say stuff that would make absolutely no sense, and I could only sometimes explain the connections. Other times, I hit moments of pure clarity and euphoria. It was like a roller coaster with the euphoria, mind-high, and body-high, and they each had their own cycles. Without weed, my thoughts felt very clear-headed throughout most of the trip, and my motor coordination was normal. My short-term memory had also been mildly prolonged.<br><br>
Possible uses:<br><br>
PTSD - This would be a great substitute for MDMA; very mind-opening and very embracing and accepting. In combo with psychotherapy, this could yield very similar results to MDMA and 2C-B.<br>
Depression - Because of the way it acts on the serotonin receptors, it instills feelings of importance, hopefulness, and sprite. This would effectively combat the feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, and rage one might feel associated with depression. <br>
Alcoholism - I tried drinking alcohol at certain points, but literally had NO desire to.<br>
Addiction - I sometimes crave cigarettes, but when I smelled them on this, I had no desire to smoke one.<br>
Cluster Headaches - Because of the tryptamine backbone, I suspect that cluster headaches would not happen within weeks after the last use.<br>
Narcolepsy - It has a stimulant aspect to it, and thus would be effective at combating narcolepsy.<br>
Sex - This would be very well to go with sex. I am not sure if it inhibits orgasm, but I do not believe that it does (unlike MDMA).<br><br>
Overall commentaries:<br><br>
This is one of those compounds I am really glad to have discovered completely on my own. Everything about it I just like. It has a good, wholesome, spiritual feeling I get from tryptamines (particularly shroooms), but it also has some of the signature open feelings of MDMA. It really does have that kind of feeling to it, but yet, it lacks some of MDMA's traits (and MDMA lacks some 5-MeO-MiPT's qualities). Everything about it makes it seem like a good choice for a rave or a party, and it doesn't hike my body temperature like MDMA would. MDMA, on the other hand, makes me want to talk to <i>everyone</i> (and is incredibly clear-headed), whereas this can get so mind-fucking that I don't speak for a little bit. Overall, it is very clear-headed, though.<br><br>
I really feel like this is one of those truly beautiful compounds that no one has really given a chance, or we've all brushed aside. It could have such great importance in psychotherapy that I feel it would be foolish to overlook it and neglect it. It offers the spiritual feeling of shrooms (which helps with alcoholism), the pure feeling of 4-AcO-DMT (which helps with spirituality), part of the ineffable feelings of DMT (which helps with creativity), the short-term memory loss of MDMA (this is a negative side-effect), and a completely different headtrip I've ever experienced. There was a spiritual aspect to it all that was not quite quanitifiable, but very present.<br><br>
I feel like the mind high was less prominent than a 5-senses high. Everything but my visuals were enhanced, and it seemed like my visuals consisted of things looking more contrasted (but otherwise normal in color) and some patterning present. Visuals were never more than a + at any point.<br><br>
Overall, I would say that this is easily in the top 5 I've tried. There really is nothing wrong with it. It's like MDMA, without out some of the nasty side-effects (the crash, teeth grinding, stimulation), and lasts about the same time. However, having tried both of the compounds, I can say that I know the ineffable differences. I just know by the feeling, sometimes, whether its tryptamine or phenethylamine-based. This was certainly a tryptamine, and it was one of the most beautiful I've tried.<!-- End Body -->
