While this experience was not accidental, the effects of the drug in question (Seroquel) were not as intended at the time of dose.<br><br>
A total of 600 mg of Seroquel was taken orally over a period of 15 minutes.  Each 100 mg tablet was taken whole with a swallow of water.<br><br>
Intended Effect: Sleep (Previously unsuccessful at lower dosages, such as 200-300 mg)<br><br>
-------<br><br>
After battling depression for several years, a doctor seemed to have gotten it under control with Effexor and Amantadine.  Unfortunately, this doctor was relieved of his duties (at the clinic at which I was a patient).  The replacement doctor was kind enough to provide me with some Seroquel as a sleep aid and as an anti-psychotic (I'm bi-polar).<br><br>
After many failed attempts to sleep at the suggested dosage of 25 mg (he said I could go up to 200 mg) and up I decided I was going to try a LARGE dose.<br><br>
Now, I did not do this blindly (not saying it wasn't dangerous, but MANY people have overdosed FAR beyond what I did, and lived) I spent several manic hours researching the effects of an overdose.. among them, 'fainting', 'passing out', 'coma'.  AKA -- Sleep .. or so I thought.  Also, hallucinations were among the 'side effects' and OD effects.<br><br>
About 15 minutes post-dose I felt very drowsy.  I laid down on my bed and began to experience hallucinations far beyond what dimenhydrinate (Benadryl) produces.  Open and closed eye visuals were unavoidable and actually quite scary!  At this point, I had no sense of time what-so-ever, but vaguely remember getting up to go to the bathroom.  I remember my limbs being VERY heavy.  It was difficult to walk, yet somehow I made it to the bathroom.<br><br>
The next thing I remember is waking up about 18 hours after I had taken the Seroquel.  I didn't have a bad hangover, yet it was definitely present.  Again, I didn't intend for this to happen, and this experience is intended to DISCOURAGE the use of Seroquil as a 'recreational' drug of any kind.  In my opinion, it's recreational potential is zero.<!-- End Body -->
