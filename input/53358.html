Since I don't know too many people who have access to drugs I've resorted to purchasing prescription drugs through online pharmacies. Pretty pathetic, huh? What I wouldn't do for just one puff of a joint! Anyway, I recently recieved 30 generic Ambien tablets from a European pharmacy and I've dabbled around a bit with the pills, but last night was just crazy. I took 4 Ambiens within a 30 minute period and preceded to listen to some music. Within minutes I am overcome with this rush of euphoria that literally knocked me on my ass. I am very alert at first but then I begin to progress into a weird, semi-conscious state and then into a coma-like state in which I remember nothing but being around a bunch of people in the dark and walking through a black door made of velvet, WTF!!! This experience was kind of like a dream, but I assume that I was fully awake while this happened.<br><br>
Anyway, the next thing I remember is stumbling through my hallway which leads to my bathroom, calling out 'Who's there?' and finally arriving at the bathroom and turning on the light, all disheveled and disoriented. I relieve myself, turn off the light, and head back to my room. When I got to my room I found CD cases lying all over the floor and my alarm clock unplugged and sitting on a couch outside my room. Why I did this beats the hell outta me but if I had to guess it MIGHT have been because the alarm was going off and I was too lazy to disable it.<br><br>
The rest of the night I remained in a drunken-like state but fully conscious and functioning. The drug lost most of it's effects after about five hours due to it's somewhat short halflife. Eventually I just turned on the TV and crashed. Will I ever use Ambien again? Absolutely, but a much smaller dose though. I should also note that I take 30mg of Paroxetine (Paxil) daily, which may have effected my experience.<!-- End Body -->
