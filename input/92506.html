I had thoroughly researched this chemical quite heavily before using it and it still defied everything I expected. I am writing this almost a year to date after having taken it so I apologize for the lack of a timeline. However I have done considerably more research on this chem than most and im here to say its not for junkies and its not for people looking to get high. It is a door-opener it is 'the path', its primary function is mental and emotional rather than visual. <br><br>
When I took it the first time I expected a larger change in visual perception and was disappointed to see rather little. I lay back and attempt to relax ( caused mad leg cramping) I felt restless, turned on some trance music and laid on the floor. Upon closing my eyes I was stunned by the insanity flowing through my head like a raging river! This was like lsd for in my head! I soon found I had complete control of the experience and could visualize anything almost before I finished the thought. I found I could leap back into dreams long gone and walk around in them! Touch them even! It was as if I had the key to the vast stores of my mind! Truly enlightening experience. Saw things that do not have words or even a true existence. This is a trance drug. A look inside chemical. Drugs for your imagination.<br><br>
I felt a lil fried the day after mostly I think from a lack of sleep (was up till 6am) but had muscle pain from severe leg cramping leading me to believe that it causes mild to moderate CNS damage.<!-- End Body -->
