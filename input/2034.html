I have been reading alot about MDMA, and have finaly desided to try it. My girlfriend and I got a couple of pills, and took them on a saturday night at about 3 in the morning (both of us work in a bar, so we just got home.) About 45 minutest after taking the pills, both of us felt like we got hit on the back of the head with a baseball bat! BANG! I felt like I was stoned out of my skull. I was real dizzy, and could not move. Both of us started getting real nausious. My gilfrend ran to the bathroom and got sick. At that time all I could think about is why the fuck did I take this shit! My girlfriend kept getting paranoid, and asking me what the hell was this stuff make of. We spent the next 2 hrs throwing up untill the effects started wearing off. At that point we were able to relax. We watched TV for about 3 hrs after that, trying not to get sick, and went to sleep.<br><br>
A friend of mine mentioned to me that we might have gotten a bad batch of X. So I went out and found another supplier. Surprisingly, the pills looked identical. We desided to try it again, exept this time only taking 1/2 the dosage.<br><br>
We took our doses at about 8 pm on a monday night (even though I had to get up for work at 7 am.) Again, 45 minutes later, BANG! Stoned (as if I just smoked a 1/4 oz of some killer weed,) and real dizzy. This time I did not get sick, but my girlfriend did. I spent the next 2 hrs on the couch staring at my feet, and wondering why the back of my neck was tingling so mutch. My girlfriend spent most of the time in the bathroom getting sick. Again, about 2 hrs after it kicked in, we were able to relax.<br><br>
I realy dont know what the problem is with us taking X, but it defenatly did not feel like what I have been reading.<br><br>
I am open to comments, and suggestions.<!-- End Body -->
