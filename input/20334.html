Experience  first time<br>
Setting  my house<br><br>
Ketamine is a drug I have been interested in for some time. Its dissociative effects seem interesting to me. I only other dissociatives I have had have been DXM and nitrous oxide. On DXM I experienced complete ego loss, and although it was frightening, it was an amazing state. It left me interested in ketamine, as I had been told ketamine could induce ego loss without the extreme side effects of DXM. <br><br>
I had managed to get 46mg of ketamine from a local source. I was ensured it was enough to get me intoxicated. I wasnt really looking for intoxication, but I knew it was better to start low. I had spoken to others and they said 46mg would probably not be a very intense dose.<br><br>
1:00 AM  I finish asking last minute questions to people on IRC (internet chat client). I try to prepare myself mentally, although Im not quite sure what to expect. Everyone seems to say different things.<br><br>
1:05 AM  I insufflate 46mg of ketamine. The burn was quite sharp, but it was also quick. It faded within 30 seconds it seemed, so it was not too bad.<br><br>
1:10 AM  I feel as though Im being pushed forward. Its as though I have risen above my seat and am floating forward. Its a strange feeling. There is numbness in my finger tips, but no mental effects yet.<br><br>
1:15 AM  I am rocking back and forth as it is all I can manage. Typing has become impossible. Even when I focus hard, I cannot manage to type legibly. I stand up, which is quite strange, and go to turn off the light. With every step I take it feels like a strobe light is going in my head. I am only seeing every few motions. Transitions are lost. It makes walking without bumping in to things extremely hard. Eventually I make it to my room and lay down on my bed. <br><br>
1:20 AM  I lay on my back and stare at the ceiling. I flip off the light.<br><br>
This is where I lose all concept of time and reality. This part is difficult to remember, but Ill do my best.<br><br>
I laid on my back and stared up. The ceiling began to shimmer. Strange patterns began to manifest themselves. The patterns seen were like none other I had ever encountered, and I consider myself a fairly seasoned traveler. They seemed to have deep purple and blue shades to them, and they were just spinning bars.<br><br>
Music began to play. It wasnt from a stereo, it was from my head. I could decide a song, and it played. The Rolling Stones Paint it Black began to play in my head. I am not sure why I chose this song, but it began to play and it sounded amazing. <br><br>
More bizarre images began to appear. Numerous fractals were visible, but even more interesting were the non-fractal images. I saw an image of a house with little elves working on it. They were all singing a song, and I knew all the words. <br><br>
Then two bars appeared. They looked like long chrome bars. The began to spin and they burst into blue flames. A voice in my head was chanting blue flame, blue flame. I decided to try to change this, and I thought red flame. Instantly the colors changed. I was interacting with the images I saw. Then, to see what would happen, I thought kaleidoscope. The flaming bars vanished and my whole visuals field was filled with amazing colorful patterning. I was watching a mental television that was on my ceiling.<br><br>
At this point I rolled over and looked at the time. <br><br>
10 minutes had elapsed.<br><br>
I then closed my eyes, and I disappeared. Everything about me was gone. I couldnt even think to remember my name. The visions faded, as well as the room. The room was no longer recognizable. I completely lost all sense of self and body. <br><br>
This is where my memories end.<br><br>
I blinked my eyes, and it was 2:05 AM. I had only been in that state for 45 minutes, but it seemed like years. I was in complete awe of what had just happened. <br><br>
2:10 AM  I stand up and go back to my computer. I feel very nauseas. I am still slightly under the influence, but I no longer numb and I can manage to type. <br><br>
2:15 AM  I throw up a lot in the bathroom. I feel better as soon as I do. <br><br>
2:30 AM  I have no trouble falling asleep.<br><br>
---------------------------------------------<br><br>
Ketamine is without a doubt the most bizarre psychedelic I have ever used. Once again, I prove to be a light weight with chemicals. I got quite confused and frightened at times, but overall it was very positive. I do not recall what happened during those 20 minutes. I wish there were a way to call it back, but I suppose those thoughts are lost forever.<br><br>
I will definitely try ketamine again. Next time I wont even attempt to type to people. I think I will spend the whole time laying on my back, watching my mental television.<br><br>
I had been told many different things about ketamine. But nothing quite described what I felt. I guess ketamine is one of those drugs you just have to experience for yourself.<!-- End Body -->
