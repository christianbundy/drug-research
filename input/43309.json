 "report": "<p>My girlfriend and I were hanging out and listening to music.  I believe it was led zep.  But recently I have been really concentrating on controlling my body and mind.  I havent ever researched meditation or anything of a sort, so thats why I'm not sure what the hell happened.  But here goes:</p><p>I was lying down and was pretty damn high.  I concentrated on the music in some sort of way I cant really explain.  I let the music consume me and let my imagination run wild.  It brought me to a place with laser lights and stuff.  I close my eyes and all of a sudden a feeling came over me and I felt like I dropped down.  It was like I dove down into a place.  The feeling was intense and really unexplainable.  I didnt want to leave this place so I concentrated on exploring it.  I never had a real picture in my mind, but what I felt made me think I had a picture in my mind.  I cant remember what I was seeing, but it was amazing.  I opened my eyes to see my girlfriend next to me.  She said she could see my pulse in my neck and that it was beating to the music.  I didnt try to ever do this again just because I dont know if I can.  It was that... crazy.</p>"
