 "report": "<p>Being somewhat of a speed-freak I have always been interested in what over-the-counter stimulants will do to my mood and energy..etc.  Anyway I have heard a lot about ephedrine (the Chinese herb Ma Huang) and heard that it was stronger than caffeine.  My usual dose is between 25-50 mg, maybe more depending on how I want to feel.  </p><p>Twenty-five milligrams of epehdrine will make me feel bursting with energy and have a very, very small euphoric feeling.  Music sounds a little better on it.  But I make sure I am taking just strainght ephedrine and not any of that Two-Way bullshit that contains guaifenesin.  Too much of the guaifenesin, an expectorant, makes me feel like shit.</p><p>I have used ephedrine when wanting to successfully stay up all night and not feel like shit but the next day the crash is pretty bad.  I would never go over 150-200 mg because after this point you are pretty much putting your heart at risk.</p><p>This is a pretty good OTC substance when used responsibly and can be pretty fun.  Well, stay safe...keep cool.</p>"
