 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI write this, about 20 minutes after a terrible end,...\r\nI got the Kratom on advice from the seller at the local SmartShop.\r\nI asked for a relaxing tea, I had bought and tried Passionflower tea about 6 weeks earlier, but I just added hot water rather then boiling it, so it was just a very relaxing, but nasty tasting tea.\r\nHe said he didn't have anything really tea like, only brew things.\r\nBut, he said, he had something he uses himself when he needs a nice calm.\r\nHe showed me a 10 gram pack of Kratom, explaining that he takes 5 gram mixed with yoghurt in the evening.\r\nI already read about Kratom, and knew it had nauseating side-effects, so I asked whether there were any bad or strange side effects, besides the calming down.\r\nWhere he replied there were none.\r\nI trusted him, thinking 5 grams of a 10 gram, which should be the full dose, is a light dose and probably just relaxing, like the Passion Tea.\r\nI got time to try it with yoghurt that friday evening.\r\nBut it totally failed, it tasted so bad I couldn't get in more then 3 small spoons of it.\r\nThe next week, now that is.\r\nI decided to try it with some juice, as described on the website of the store, and other places.\r\nT+0:00\r\nI had put the remaining 5 grams in a large glass and filled it up with chocolate milk, at first the powder floated on top.\r\nBut after stirring a lot and waiting, it settled through the chocolate milk and became drinkable.\r\nIt had a bit of a bad taste but not super awful.\r\nT+0:10\r\nWhen I had finished drinking it up, I looked through some music and made a relaxing playlist to chill on.\r\nT+0:30\r\nI lay down in bed, my hands were cold from working behind my computer, so I warmed them up.\r\nAfter my hands were warm, I relaxed, closed my eyes and felt sleepy, I was relaxed and tired, even without the Kratom.\r\nAll that comes now could as well 've been placebo,... very likely actually.\r\nT+0:45\r\nWith my eyes closed, I was very able to visualize lots and lots of imaginative things, pictures, moving to the music.\r\nI usually do this anyways, but it went extra good, seen I was very relaxed.\r\nT+1:00\r\nIt got boring after a while, opened my eyes, looked at my video arcade cabinet and decided I wanted the music from there, as well as the winamp visuals displaying in the screen.\r\nI got out of bed, a bit wobbly in my legs, probably placebo, I had this with Passion Flower tea too, but not with mushrooms.\r\nStarted opening the cabinet and working on it.\r\nT+2:00\r\nAs I was messing with getting stuff installed, I felt a nausea coming up.\r\nI sat down and I started moving my leg neurotically, it made the nauseous feel go away, but it didn't make me feel any better.\r\nMy mood wasn't really relaxed, my hands were shaking and I knew it was going kind of wrong.\r\nWas just a matter of waiting till it went away, then go to bed or write this experience thing.\r\nT+2:30\r\nI was chatting with a friend in canada on msn, told him about the kratom and that I felt like shit.\r\nI paused my typing and I knew I was gonna throw up, I looked around my room, to decide where to leave my stomach fillings.\r\nThe floor was the best place, my garbage bin was full, and I had linoleum, or well, easily cleanable floor covering, so no real problem.\r\nI bended forward from my chair and waited till I actually had to puke, avoiding unnecessary moaning sounds.\r\nAfter 3 throws I was done, I didn't feel nauseous anymore.\r\nCleaned up, and talked to the guy on msn again.\r\nFloor is still smelly.\r\nGod this sucked, I didn't get any relaxier then the badly prepared Passion Flower tea, it tasted far worse, and I had to throw up.\r\nNot for a retry!\r\nIt could've been miscellaneous things that contributed to the nausea, but it's mainly the kratom.\r\nBecause I barely throw up,... even if I'm VERY sick, nauseous, dizzy from a boat ride, or bustour that's taking ages, I just have a nasty feeling in my belly, and sit that out for as long as it takes.\n\n\n"
