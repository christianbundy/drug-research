 "report": "<p>Hello, all. I'm here to share with whatever audience a story of somewhat of a spiritual awakening of 3 people. This is a story of 17-year-old me experimenting with 4-hydroxylized tryptamines with two of my best friends, N and S. </p><p>A little background info: at this time I had much experience with psychedelics as well as other drugs including 4-ho-met, lsd, mushrooms, DMT, 4-ho-mipt, 2c-e, prescription pills, cannabis, spice blends, MXE, DXM and other drugs. A few weeks before, I had foolishly lent my scale to my older brother (who uses it to measure out RCs to sell for a large profit marigin which I don't really agree with) so didn't have a scale to measure things out with. This night could have gone very wrong if I hadn't estimated well, and I don't recommend trying to estimate any powdered drugs, especially potent RCs.</p><p>So anyways, this night, we had in our possession: about 2 grams of sour diesel cannabis, about 100mg of 4-ho-met, about 500mg of MXE, about 30mg of DMT, and some benzodiazepines (.5mg Ativans) in the case that we venture too far (we didn't end up needing them). So, at around 8:00, S and I head over to N's grandparent's house where he's staying for the weekend. The only other person home is his grandpa, who had smoked copious amounts of marijuana in his college days and although we didn't ever tell him that we were experimenting with drugs, he probably knew and was okay with it.</p><p>At around 10:00, his grandpa was asleep in his chair watching television, so we decided it would be a good time to start dosing. We prepared three estimated lines of around 15-20mg of MXE for each of us and insufflated them around 10:05. At around 10:30, I packed a bowl of sour diesel, with the DMT sandwiched in the middle. After I packed this, I started estimating piles of 4-ho-met for us. At 10:45, we all dosed what I estimated to be about 7-10mg of 4-ho-met. Around 11:00, we all decided to have a bit more so we each had another pile about the same amount (all of this is orally by the way.) </p><p>Then, we all decided to go outside and start smoking on the bowl I just packed. That night there was a blue moon, which fit the theme because Neil Armstrong had died fairly recently (the day of this experiment was August 31, 2012. I'm writing this the day after.) We brought two blankets to lay on and three pillows outside, as well as my iPod. Once we got outside, I started playing Boards of Canada over the speakers built into my iPod, and we laid there talking until 11:15, when we started passing around the bowl. Right before we began smoking, I said 'I have a really good feeling about tonight' to my friends, and we all had really big smiles on our faces. We were all in great mindsets. We each got some of the DMT in our hits, but strategicly not enough to break through, just to kick start the trip. As well as the effects from the DMT, sour diesel cannabis was very strong and we each had low tolerances.</p><p>After we finished smoking, we all started to feel the trip coming on. We all laid down and looked at the stars. I realized that I had never really come to appreciate the stars and their wonder before, as well as the moon. Then I started thinking about how amazing it is that each star has an entire solar system attached to it, and that people have walked on the moon. We started talking about these wonders, and how we've never really come to appreciate this before. Eventually, we started talking about life on other planets.</p><p>I remember S said something to the effect of how silly it is when people think that we're the only life out there, when the universe is so vast, and the evidence is right in the night sky. This got me thinking, and then I started thinking aloud to my friends. I started talking about how fast our civilization is evolving, and how silly it is to think that even if there's life somewhere that they're not intelligent, becuase to have life at all anywhere else it wouldn't take them very long to become intelligent because how fast things evolve, and I started thinking and talking about what would happen if a form of life on a planet became so advanced that they knew everything. Suddenly I realized that if you know all there is to know about the universe and existance, then you could do whatever you want because you'd understand how to. Through my talking I realized that this could be God, a fully evolved being that has come to understand everything and created a universe in its mind. I don't mean one specific person, like a human can't just know everything and then become God, but a fully evolved species. Humans, in this theory, would simply be stepping stones (even considered primitive compared to this real intelligent life) in the evolution of the 'perfect being.'</p><p>We talked about things like this for hours, talking about different possibilities of existance and life itself, and the wonders of the universe. We also talked about our personal problems, and all three came to terms with a lot of personal issues which I won't share.</p><p>At around 2:30 (only about 3 and a half hours after dosing) we all felt like it had been days and that we had learned a lot about ourselves and the universe. We went inside and all laid down. By 3:00 I had fallen asleep, and S stayed up for another hour on the computer before going to bed, and N listened to music until about 6:00 listening to music before he slept. I have never been able to fall asleep that easily after having ingested a psychedelic so soon before (and still be well into the trip,) but I felt like it was fitting. </p><p>All in all, we had each come to understand the universe better. Although I had much experience with psychedelics before this, it had always been that I was thrown into the cosmic unvierse, rather than talking it out and gradually coming to accept and understand it. None of us were afraid of this and it all worked nicely. N had experimented with 4-ho-met one time in the past with 25mg and had tripped nicely, and S had never had any psychedelics before, only cannabis and dissociatives. We all came out with a refreshed outlook on life, and I would highly recommend tripping outside with a few good, mature friends to talk with things about.</p>"
