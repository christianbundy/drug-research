This is a basic overview of an uncommon route of admission (ROA) of a popular RC (research chemical).  One may ask themselves, why inject this drug intravenously, what are the risks, is there anything in particular I need to know?<br><br>
I'm not going to cover any particular experiences, or the general effects of mephedrone, if you want a more comprehensive overview of the drug's effects, see an article about Nasal or Oral ingestion, as these are the more 'common' means of taking the drug and will give you a better idea of what the drug is about.  This is also because I have done the drug many times, and it would be difficult to accurately describe every single minute detail that a situational trip report would normally give.  Instead I will give you the general run-down of how the drug effects me during IV admission and some general tips/suggestions.<br><br>
First and foremost, IV admission of drugs, in anyway, is not for the beginner.  Learning to correctly prep your dose is not something than can just be picked up overnight, it helps to have somebody with experience to help you.  Secondly, correctly dosing drugs, especially mephedrone, is of a life-or-death importance.  Lastly, extra steps must be taken to help prevent diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis C.<br><br>
I've found that with drugs such as heroin, Intramuscular injection, while not preferable, is not all that bad.  IM mephedrone, on the other hand, burned like unholy hellfire.  Having personally missed the vein before, this experience was one of the worst pains I could have imagined.  Tingling and 'pins-and-needles' sensations were felt, as well as extreme swelling and redness.  I could really first hand feel mephedrones more 'corrosive' qualities here.  When mephedrone was IM'ed instead of IV'ed, there was a delayed onset, and prolonged peak and extremely delayed come-down, think extended releases vs. instance release.  I couldn't sleep anytime soon after IM injection.<br><br>
As to be expected with any IV drug, in comparision to another ROA, I experience an intense rush.  Mephedrone's rush is very, very intense for me, especially in comparision to other IV drugs, even at low doses. I'm hit hard with a wave of euphoria, emotion, and energy.  Not all that unlike IV heroin, but without the sedation.  I am personally very experienced with IV drugs, having also IV'ed heroin, coke, crack, morphine, and MDMA.  That being said, mephedrone blows all of these drugs out of the water in terms of both shear intensity and strength of dose.  I always make sure I'm near a trash receptical of some sort, as it is not uncommon for me to vomit after dosing, as the rush is so intense.<br><br>
I am quite experienced with this drug, so when I tried IV'ing it for the first time, I wasn't too worried about dosage because of my tolerance (used at the very least weekly for about 4 months, though often much more than just once a week).  My first dose was about 100mg of crystals, broken down into a fine powder.  <br><br>
The high itself is not that all shortlived for me.  While IV drug use certainly means quicker onset and quicker comedown than other ROA's, mephedrone has curiously strong 'legs' as its called, meaning it lasts pretty long, especially for a stimulant. In comparision to intranasal use, its definately a shorter high, though not all that much (1.5 hours vs. 2 hours is what I found).  Stimulants such as cocaine hit me very quickly when IV'ed, but end up in a crash within minutes.  This is definately not the case with IV mephedrone, though I definately experience diminished euphoria as time goes on.  Increased energy levels are about the same until the end of the high. <br><br>
That being said, one last thing that should be mentioned is the vastly increased addictive potential.  I have personally witnessed close friends completely drop heavy IV herion habits, enduring withdrawals, and make full-on switches to IV mephedrone.<!-- End Body -->
