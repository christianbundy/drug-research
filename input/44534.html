After doing the usual research and going through a reliable internet vendor, I received 12 grams of finely powdered 'Super' Kratom.  I eyeballed the packet for a couple days, waiting for the appropriate moment, and eventually settled on last night since I don't work today, and neither does my girlfriend.  We weren't looking for an 'opium-like high,' or a 'oxycontin-like high,' or a 'marijuana-like high' as the website I ordered it from claimed.  We wanted to find out what a Kratom high is all about.  If I wanted a 'marijuana-like high,' I would have gotten some herb and smoked that instead.<br><br>
Preparation: I measured out 8 grams of the powder (about four teaspoons) and dumped it into a pot with three cups of water and about an eighth of a cup of lemon juice.  I brought the entire mixture to a boil and the simmered for twenty minutes.  I then dumped out the liquid, filtering out the powder, and repeated this process twice.  While cooking it smelled just like green tea, and was a light-brownish color.  On the last extraction I filtered out the powder and disposed of it, and combined all three liquids.  I then boiled down the liquid to a manageable dose, about two and a half cups.  I have a feeling my preparation took too long, and was more of a headache than it had to be.  In retrospect, I don't think there's any magic to making Kratom tea, and will do less work next time.<br><br>
Dosing: I poured the tea into two cups respectively, one for myself and one for my girlfriend, she weighs approx. 125 lbs.  I took one sip and realized that I needed sugar.  We both did.  So we added about two tbs. sugar each, and drank more.  She hated the taste, and claimed that it tasted like bile.  I didn't find it so bad, but I'm a bit more tolerant than she, probably due to my Calea tea habit.  She also added two persimmon tea bags, and wolfed it down.  I took smaller sips and got mine down too.<br><br>
The effects were immediate.  After each sip I could feel myself getting higher and higher, but never undesireably high.  We made our way to the couch and put some music on, and were both feeling notably pensive, in a positive way.  We talked for a long time, and went outside occasionally to smoke tobacco, which pushed both of us gently higher each time. After a second cigarette, however, I was hit with a very strong wave of nausea, so much that I had to go to the toilet and sit next to it for a while.  I was so sure I was heading towards puking that I even took my contact lenses out and had a glass of water ready.<br><br>
To my surprise, the nausea faded almost completely after about five minutes, sans hurling.  I then felt that I was higher than before; I think the nausea was a signal that I was going to go up a notch.  It was great.  We went about our business back on the couch, talking a bit here and there, but also just laying down and munching on crackers (Not the 'munchies,' just hungry).  It really was incredibly comfortable.  I would drift off for a minute, then come right back.  We both felt wonderful.  As the night waxed and waned, we went to bed and fell asleep without any problems at all, and some rich dreams.<br><br>
In summary, I wish Kratom was cheaper, but I would be tempted to do it too often, perhaps.  I will certainly be taking more sometime fairly soon, as will my girlfriend most likely.  I feel like I could handle six grams of Super Kratom, but with my close-call of puking, I will probably stick to four or five.<!-- End Body -->
