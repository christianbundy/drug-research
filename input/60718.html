I was hesitant submitting this story due to privacy concerns, but since I didn't see any other listing for this combination I thought my story should get out there.<br><br>
A few months I took some mushrooms with a friend.  Since the quantity of mushrooms was less than desired I decided to put together a psychedelic sampler.  Per the title: won't do that again.  In the end I feel it was the Kratom which was the wild card.  The Mushrooms Cannabis Combo was something Ive had plenty of success with in the past.  We took approx. 1.125 grams of your standard magic mushroom.  One half hour later we took a 1/2 teaspoon of Kratom. What grade I couldn't say, but it must have been high-octane.  One half an hours after that, we smoked a joint of some high end hydroponic bud.  Time elapsed approx. one hour.  <br><br>
The effects of all three blended together creating an amazingly euphoric high.  We were discussing this as the 'trifecta of good times.  We felt like we'd discovered a whole new thing and wanted to spread the good news.  At this point I decided to up the ante with another 1/2 teaspoon of Kratom.  A half hour later I could feel the effects of this second helping of Kratom taking hold.  It's been a bit since this happened, so I can't get super specific about the buzz.  Visually I was having wavy, blurred, and distorted vision.  Physically I was warm &amp; euphoric.  To this my friend decided he was going to try more Kratom as well.  This is where the wheels came flying off.<br><br>
He had decided to make it in hot chocolate, and went about preparing that as I sat down and had a cigarette.  As I was smoking all the sudden I was overwhelmed with a sense I needed to lay down.  Next thing I know, my friend is standing over me on the kitchen floor trying to wake me up.  I had convulsed at the table and passed out.  I was weak, disoriented and had trouble speaking.  After laying there for about five minutes, unable physically to do much, he/she tried to sit me up.  I immediately passed out again.  At this point my friend, who's a nurse, took my pulse.  I was running at between 35-40 beats a minute, which is exceptionally low from my understanding.  After a half hour I was able to stand up and walk to the bathroom.  <br><br>
While I was standing in the bathroom (I'd been upright for about 3 minutes tops) I felt myself passing out again.  Since it was coming, I decided to start heading in that direction while still conscious and somewhat in control.  Trying to yell for my friend, I again couldn't speak.  Groundhog Day!  I woke up to my friend standing over meagain.  This time he insisted we go to the ER.  I was able to convince him that third times a charm, and if that happened I'd go.  <br><br>
I was able to drag myself into the living to lay on a couch using only my arms.  At this point my legs weren't altogether cooperating and by raising my head too high I risked passing out again.  Then I'd be heading to the hospital.  Things had gone terribly sideways and I didn't know what to do other than ride it out.  But let me say this: I've ridden things out before.  This wasn't my first rodeo.  But in all my experience, this was the first time I didn't know if I was coming out the other side.  I started to wonder if this was what OD'ing felt like.  My friend, who deals with dying and nearly dead folk all the time, was terrified.  Both times I passed out he/she had trouble waking me up again.  I had nothing to gauge this experience against.  <br><br>
For the next half hour I fought off passing out because I didn't know if I'd wake up again.  I was really afraid Id close my eyes and never wake up.  After this time passed I began to feel the effects waning and I knew I had turned the corner.  About half an hour after that I felt fine, this being relative to the condition I was in to begin with.<br><br>
Total elapsed time, about 3 hours.  This was not fun or enlightening.  This was dead-ass bad news for me and my friend.  Both he and myself thought I was going to die.  To be honest, I took awhile writing this because I didn't want to put the story out in cyberspace-privacy concerns and what not.  In the end I decided to go ahead because I think people should know what they're playing with here.  I wrote it because Id feel horrible if this went even worse (death, coma, who the hell knows) for someone else and I hadnt done something to help.<!-- End Body -->
