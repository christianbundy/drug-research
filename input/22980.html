I made some absinthe at home using a kit I ordered online. I have some experience with distilling and general chemistry from high school and my early college years, so the setup was easy for me, but there are instructions with the kit.<br><br>
Anyway, it essentially follows the Pharmako/Poeia recipe. I was pleasently surprised with the results! After using the finishing herbs, the absinthe was a nice light green color, and it smelled pretty good. It louched nicely with water. However, it is very bitter. I've never had commercial absinthe, so I don't know if it is more or less bitter than usual. I don't have a way of measuring the alcohol content, but I can tell it is very high. I probably should have diluted it some. <br><br>
After two glasses (each containing 1 shot absinthe + water &amp; sugar, consumed in about 30 minutes), I was quite drunk. I didn't notice any hallucinations or anything like that. However, I did feel very happy, and very 'lovey' toward everyone. I just wanted to hug everyone and tell them how much I love them. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true. I would attribute that feeling to the absinthe, as I don't usually feel that way when I drink regular alcohol. Other people to whom I've described the effects noted 'that sounds like ecstasy to me.' I cannot personally comment on this, as I've never taken e. So take that with a grain of salt. <br>
In the future, I will experiment with different cocktails, since the absinthe was so bitter. If it just tasted better, it would be a completely pleasant experience! I would, however, caution people to be careful, especially if you make your own, since it is difficult to accurately measure the alcohol content.<!-- End Body -->
