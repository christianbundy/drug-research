Did this several months ago, so the details are foggy. Bought 2, 1/2 gram containers of 'concentrated' Ricky Bobby bath salts.  Not sure what 'concentrated' exactly means.<br><br>
Not at all like cocaine in dosing.  Very light, a line goes a long way and 1/2 gram lasted a day, where as I could do well more than that with coke.<br><br>
Insufflating was horrible, but I kept at it.  Terrible burning and terrible taste.  In hindsight I should have swallowed it. First line hurt, as I said, but I felt great soon after.  Not as good as coke high, but it also led me to not want to snort as often as coke.<br><br>
I started on a Saturday afternoon.  Feeling good and on the computer, I soon found that I had literally 20+ tabs (or more) as I was anxiously clicking from site to site and back again.  I felt pretty damn good.<br><br>
Sunday morning I finally got through first 1/2 gram.  Sun was coming up and I had another 1/2 to go.  This is where I should have stopped, but noooo......<br><br>
I started measuring my heartbeat and temperature.  HB was around 100 or so beats per minute, and temp was a little over 100.  I figured this was a good measure of my dosing and would go from there. All through Sunday I stayed on the computer and insufflating this horrible substance.  It never felt any better.  I knew I would be calling in on Monday.<br><br>
Monday morning comes (I'm still on computer), and I finally force last line in (didn't even really want it at that point).  I wasn't hallucinating really, but couldn't really focus anymore, and visually things were just kind of odd (depth perception way off, lack of focus, etc.). <br><br>
Finally blew my nose like never before.  It was just a thick mucous, and kept blowing it out and blowing it out, like my sinuses were just packed with it.  At one point a bit, long, hard snot came out, and all I could think of was that it was nasal lining dislodging.  <br><br>
Never took X, so I can't compare.  It was definitely less subdued than coke, and the high wasn't so high, and the comedown wasn't really an issue as compared to coke (like I said, I didn't even want to do the last bit, but knew it was the last bit so did it anyway).<br><br>
So Monday I'm up and not feeling that great.  Haven't slept since Friday night. Couldn't eat. Figured I'd sleep that night.<br><br>
Nope.  No sleep whatsoever (at least none that I remember).  My heartbeat was elevated (pounding through my chest).<br><br>
Tuesday got out of bed (after calling in again and deciding I couldn't sleep at all), but felt awful.  It actually hurt to move. I had to force myself to do anything.  I just wanted to lay where I was and not move at all.  I had no appetite.  I forced myself (in a snowstorm) to go to the pharmacy and get some OTC sleep aid. It was tough as I had massive anxiety at that point and dreaded going into public (luckily for the snowstorm, I guess).  Took it and slept maybe and hour or two.  Forced a little food in me.  It physically hurt to move and was an effort to do anything.  I've never felt like this in my life.  I almost went to the doctor.<br><br>
Took more sleep aid (diphenhydramine) Tuesday night, but still got  no sleep except for maybe 1/2 hour.  It was awful.  By then I knew I had to go to work, and figured screw it, I'm not sleeping anyway, so might as well go to work.  BIG mistake.  I lasted 1/2 hour.  My body was killing me.  Luckily my boss saw how 'sick' I was and let me take a vacation day, and somebody else switched with me the next day.  Luckily my doctor isn't in on Wednesdays or I probably would have called, though I had little energy to do so, even less energy to actually speak intelligibly, and even less to drive there.  My anxiety was killing me at that point. FINALLY, Wednesday night I got some sleep and felt a ton better by Thursday.<br><br>
So it was Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and into Wednesday from what I estimate to be 2.5 hours sleep max. Terrible, terrible experience. Maybe I'd try it again by swallowing it and not using so much as there seems to be many good experiences, but mine sucked for sure.<br><br>
I've had many, many past experiences with psychedelics, marijuana,  cocaine, alcohol etc, so I'm pretty savvy to most substances I take.  This just totally screwed me up hardcore.<br><br>
I'm assuming by 'bath salts' that it was mephedrone in it, but maybe not.<!-- End Body -->
