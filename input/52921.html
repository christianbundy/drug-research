A friend and I were at my house chilling one evening.  My parents had gone out to eat and we wanted to smoke some ganja, but didn't have any.  I looked through my kitchen and my whole house for something to smoke.  I just wanted to smoke some kind of herb.  I was almost about to give up, when I thought about smoking my Yerba, which I drink as a tea.  I like the way it tastes and makes me feel.  I had heard from a South American friend of mine that he tried to smoke it and it made his head feel really bad, and gave him bad headaches.  <br><br>
I was eager to smoke something so we decided to give it a try.  I brought the whole half pound bag down to a little gulch in my yard and lit up my homemade bong.  My friend took the first big hit, and held it in.  I took the second and we traded off for about 2 hits each until the bowl was cashed and the cherry had fallen through.  <br><br>
We weren't feeling anything so we decided to burn down another bowl.  We lit the next one clearing it in about 3 hits each.  (Small bowl, eye dropper).  We started to feel it.  It was like a weed high but not as trippy.  It was a mild weed high.  Pretty much like taking about 3 normal pipe hits of weed.  After, we smoked another bowl and went back into the house to listen to music and play some Halo 2.  <br><br>
My friend was completely spaced out. Dying in the video game like nothing, just when I least expected it, it jumped up on me. It really started to hit me.  The walls started breathing, like when Im on shrooms sometimes and looked like water ripples.  It lasted for about 2 hours over all.  It was the single most far out experience I've ever had while experimenting with household herbs.  I will definitely try it again sometime. <br><br>
The taste was not bad, and the smoke was not harsh at all.  It tasted like the tea when I drink it, which is good.<!-- End Body -->
