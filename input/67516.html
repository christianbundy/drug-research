This was my second time taking HBW, and it was without a doubt, one the most amazing experiences in my life.<br><br>
For the record, all people mentioned in this are heavy weed smokers, and have experimented with magic mushrooms, E, and Salvia.<br><br>
I was staying with college friends in Ireland and wanted a night to remember. I suggested we take HBW, to which two of my friends (herein referred to as A and B) agreed. There were two others who decided that they would be sitters for the night. We decided to buy 9 seeds each, which were purchased legally from a headshop. We intended to have empty stomachs at the time of ingestion.<br><br>
6.00pm. After removing all the white fur from the seeds by hand, I put 6 of the seeds in my mouth, and chewed them up well. The reason for choosing this method over eating was because this way supposedly reduces feelings of nausea, which I found to be untrue. I kept them in my mouth without swallowing for half an hour, then spat them out. This was very unpleasant feeling, as my mouth filled with spit, and it had the same consistency as cum. Next time I'll eat them.<br><br>
6.30pm. I noticed a strange feeling in my stomach, but it was very subtle. I recognised it from the first time I tried HBW. I was very much looking forward to coming up, as the first time I had tried HBW, I got very intense eye-open and eye-closed visual hallucinations. I had a cigarette. A and B eat 6 of their seeds on pizza<br><br>
7.30pm. The feeling in my stomach is getting more noticeable, but its very bearable. Feels like I'm slightly bloated or gassy. I was getting slightly impatient, so decided to listen to Pink Floyd on my own for a while, to try and help myself come up. Had another cigarette. <br><br>
8.00pm. I woke up, not realising I had fallen asleep. I didn't fall asleep because of the HWB though, it was because I had been up since 3am. I get up to see how my friends are getting on. Neither of the two report feeling anything yet, and the 3 of us are feeling slightly annoyed. I ate my 3 remaining seeds in pizza.<br><br>
9.00pm. I look in the mirror for the first time and notice that my pupils are very dilated. I start having a slight feeling of euphoria, slightly unsteady on my feet, and begin to feel tired. I go outside and talk to a friend I haven't seen in a few months. It was enjoyable, although she was drunk and didn't understand what I was experiencing. She was trying to have a normal conversation with me, which my brain just couldn't handle. I preferred not to talk. Had another 3 cigarettes.<br><br>
10.30pm. I head back inside, when my friends inform that they're going to leave for a small while, and ask me to join them. Feeling quite nauseous, I decline. I make my way to the bathroom, and throw up for about 15 mintues. It's pretty horrible, but the bloated gassy feeling in my stomach leaves, and I feel a rush of euphoria. Leaving the bathroom, I begin to notice my first visuals. As my hand was moving through the air, it left trails. I was delighted that I was finally started to come up, as it had been nearly 5 hours, an unusually long time. I felt quite giddy, was smiling a lot, and felt generally happy.<br><br>
11.00pm. I retreated to the bedroom to listen to Pink Floyd, and start moving my hand through the air, playing with the trails. It was pretty cool, as when I blinked, things would momentarily flash a different colour. Very strong purples, and neon greens appeared around the edges of things. Was feeling slightly more tired now, and my legs were stiff and sore. I close my eyes and start having mild eye-closed visuals. It was very similar to what you'd see in a music visualiser, on iTunes for example, except that the images in my mind were a lot better. <br><br>
12.00am. My friends return and have managed to get some weed on their travels. Delighted, I instantly get out of bed, feeling almost normal again. A and B report feeling very euphoric, and having mild visuals. Their pupils are enormous. We roll a joint each, and I hit two large bongs. This is much more than I normally smoke, my judgement no doubt impaired, and I began to feel sick. I make my way to the balcony, and start puking violently. The 2 sitters come outside to keep me company, and to make sure I was alright. I continued vomiting for what felt like half an hour, although I was experiencing pretty strong time dilation, so it was probably more like 10 minutes. I have now puked so much, that there is nothing left in my stomach, but the feeling of nausea is still so intense that I begin dry-heaving. At my sitters' suggestion, I drink some water, which allowed me throw up again. I felt much better, and went back inside.<br><br>
12.30am. This is when I really started to hallucinate. I sat on the couch, my legs were quite sore, and I was too tired to talk properly. The first thing I noticed was that the movement trails were a <i>lot</i> more intense. They were multicoloured and I could see them everywhere. When I moved my head forward, I could 'zoom in' very close on something far away, and 'zoom out' when I pulled my head back. It was very cool, very intense. Next, I noticed that everything I could see was changing, into computer game graphics! Everything took on 8-bit graphics, very similar to the NES. This was unbelievable, as I could see everything so clearly, but it didn't last very long, maybe 3 minutes. While sitting on the couch, parts of my body started disappearing. Example, I could feel my chest and my legs, but my pelvis area disappeared completely. I continued smoking weed, but only in small amounts, as it made me hallucinate very intensely. When not smoking weed, I found myself smoking 2 or even 3 cigarettes at a time, as it felt very soothing.<br><br>
2.00am. I head to the bedroom area, where A and B have been lying down, listening to Pink Floyd. I lie down on the bed, and close my eyes. Since I last vomited, I haven't felt any nausea whatsoever, which gives me a huge sense of relief. I feel very tired, my legs are really sore, but I haven't stopped smiling. A and B are completely tripping balls at this stage too, and the 3 of us together just lie on the bed, talking, trying to communicate how we feel to one another. It made for a great bonding session, and definitely strengthened our friendships. I fell asleep around 3.00am.<br><br>
Next day<br><br>
Woke up around 11.00am, feeling pretty sluggish, but otherwise, felt perfectly fine. We smoked some weed, and watched cheech and chong. We spent the day talking about the night, and all 3 of us agreed it was definitely one of the best experiences we've ever had. I continued having very very mild trails for the whole of the next day. <br><br>
In hindsight: Having lots of cigarettes was key. I am definitely glad we had some weed, as it helped to bring me up a lot, although, I'm not sure if this presents and dangers from mixing drugs. I don't think I'd like to mix with alcohol. We had lots of really mellow music, and a safe, positive environment. The hallucinations seemed to come in waves, and as the night progressed, the got more frequent and stronger. The puking sucked balls, in fact, it's one of the worst pukes I've ever had, but I really started to come up afterwards.<br><br>
Conclusion: Totally fucking awesome stuff, although it'll be a few months before I try it again.<!-- End Body -->
