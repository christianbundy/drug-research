It was midnight and I hadn't started work on my answer to the question for tomorrow's test on public policy. I hadn't slept for a couple of days and I was feeling slightly panicked as I rifled through books looking for some quotes I could use. It was then that I decided to go to my test tripping. What did I have to lose? And besides, it would be interesting.<br><br>
I had used morning glories several times before. I've never vomited with them, or had anything worse than a slight stomach ache. I was pretty certain that I could keep it together on them. So, after a few hours hours working on the question, I ground up 200 morning glory seeds and, at five AM, I ate them. The worst thing about morning glories is eating them. The texture lodges in your throat and makes you gag. However, I've discovered a good way to get them down. I put the seeds in a shallow bowl, which I filled with orange juice. Take a gulp of the seeds and juice, then add more juice. Keep doing this until the seeds are gone.<br><br>
The timing of consumption was intentional. For me, morning glories take around five hours to peak. My test was an hour long and started at 10am. I intended to reach the peak of the trip during the test. The morning glories came on slowly as expected. I left my halls to go to the test a little early - I wanted to buy some cigarettes and perhaps have some breakfast. By now, I was having closed-eye visuals and the world looked subtly different. The walk between the halls and the class is about ten minutes. As I walked, my thoughts raced. I had trouble preventing myself from grinning madly at people. I thought about how I could be paranoid and suddenly, I was convinced that I was convinced that people knew that I was tripping. This made me grin even more. It was as if there was a huge joke and I was the only one who knew the punchline.<br><br>
I reached the shop and bought my cigarettes. This was the first interaction I'd had with anyone. I believe that I handled myself well and quite normally, although I'm not sure how big my pupils were. I suspect that they were huge (as they usually are on morning glories). I continued to the canteen where I decided that I couldn't stomach any breakfast, but got myself a coffee instead. I sat outside, looking at the static in the sky when Kali, a girl in my class came up to my table. I chatted to her much more ably than usual - normally I'm somewhat asocial and have difficulty conversing with people I don't like. However, today I talked easily. I almost wanted to tell her that I was tripping, but I managed to restrain myself.<br><br>
The test itself was fine. Before, I had been concerned about whether I'd actually be able to write, but from the time the test began, to the time it ended I was one conduit of knowledge on the subject. I didn't even need to use the cheat-notes that I'd written on my wrist. The trip peaked, as expected, around half-way through. It was very intense - suddenly, colors flowed over everything, flickering and strobing. I sat back and enjoyed it for a minute or so, and then continued to write.<br><br>
I believe that I did very well on the test, although I haven't got my result yet.<br><br>
Afterwards, I met up with my friend Jon and went shopping for Christmas gifts. The shopping center was a very stimulating environment - almost overwhelming. As I came down, things began to make more sense. I was left feeling happy and energised, and not in the least bit tired - almost as if the morning glories had paid back the sleep debt of the last couple of days.<br><br>
It might be the case that the morning glories actually enhanced my ability to think whilst taking the test - I certainly couldn't have remembered the dates and names that I did. All in all, another positive MG experience for me.<!-- End Body -->
