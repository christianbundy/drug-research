This is mainly a report about combining MXE and 2C-B, as the MDMA dose was small, came much later in the evening, and was a bit of an afterthought.<br><br>
My good friend A and I were both having a bad day as our plans had fallen through, so we decided it was high time we tried combining MXE and 2C-B. We are both very fond of combining Ketamine &amp; 2C-B, as we find it results in intricate inter-dimensional patterns of thought. The combination seems to really bring the otherwise mild 2C-B out of its shell, and reveals it for the true psychedelic it really is. It also adds colour and detail to the usually dark and monochromatic k-hole.<br><br>
Since our usual Ketamine supply has been dry lately, we have been experimenting with MXE, which we are also fond of, though it is similar in small ways to Ketamine, we don't find it to be as powerfully psychedelic. So we reasoned that 2C-B might be enough to turn it into a richer, more-fulfilling experience.<br><br>
We usually ingest our 2C-B, wait an hour, and then sniff our Ketamine. Since MXE has a far slower come-up than Ketamine, we decided to sniff it before our 2C-B. So we did, and waited. I danced around my room while I waited to come up, A played video games. Eventually everything became more intense as it tends to on MXE, so we knew it was time for 2C-B.<br><br>
About 20 minutes after dosing, the world became thick and sludgy. There were little neon sparks here and there, but I felt too detached and removed to enjoy them. The world was distant, my senses felt dulled. I stopped dancing, drew the curtains, and lay in bed with A, who had now joined me.<br><br>
It felt like the worst of both chemicals to me - MXE's weird detachment and plasticky feel, 2C-B's glassiness. It felt entirely un-psychedelic. I was definitely wasted, but in a messy, empty way. We agreed that it wasn't a particularly pleasant feeling, boring and not at all spiritual. I had very slight nausea. We lay in bed listening to music and chatted intermittently, though we both felt a little subdued.<br><br>
About an hour passed, and we talked about having more MXE. But neither of us was keen - we agreed it would make us feel even more detached and probably would make things worse rather than better. So we decided instead to get out of bed, go and have dinner and think about other things. It was a good decision. We put the pizzas we'd prepared earlier in the oven, and watched some nature programmes on the projector. I felt immediately better after eating, and we chatted through the programme, busting out into fits of giggles occasionally.<br><br>
Things became rather erotically charged, and we decided to have a little MDMA to round off our evening. We only wanted a little, to add a little sparkle and stimulate conversation. It defintiely did - we had a lively conversation about life, people we know and our plans for the future. We were pleased - we'd rescued our dull experience and turned it into something fun. A terrible Saturday had turned out to be a good one.<br><br>
We felt fine the next day, we went out with friends and had no hangover to speak of. Although it was an interesting experiment, it was disappointing. For two chemicals that are individually so enjoyable (MXE and 2C-B), were together were pretty horrible. Not a combination I will be having again.<!-- End Body -->
