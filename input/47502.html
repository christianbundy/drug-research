My granpaps had died recently from colon cancer and I raided his room because logically he should have had some painkillers. At the time all I found was some antideppresants and some stay-awake pills for narcolepsy. Months later I told my mom about some joint pain I was having. This pain was routine for me, I get it during really bad  weather or when I'm really tired. I've been getting it for years but that day I decided to complain. She told me about some patches that my gramps had used and she gave them to me. I thought it was going to be some Icy-Hot stuff or something, but the box said Fentanyl. I logged on the internet and read up on the stuff. Little did my mom know what she had put into my hands.<br><br>
The same day I put on two patches (50ug/h). I put one on my chest above my heart and one under an armpit and pasted down the edges with medical body-tape. I sat down to my computer for some diversion. I got nothing at first, and then a slow sort of relaxed feeling after about 4 hours. There was no euphoria involved which really killed it for me. I went to sleep and woke up 7 hours later to go to school.<br><br>
When I got out of bed, I felt an immediate nausea and a dull throbbing in back of my head. The throbbing I believe was the ensuing hangover, but dulled by the Fentanyl flowing thru my body. I closed my eyes and relaxed as I had done so many times when I try not to throwup from alcohol. It worked and I went about my morning, but the feeling of nausea was always there. The train ride to school was very hard, I had to concentrate on keeping myself from heaving. Also, it was very hard to keep my eyes open, so I settled on keeping them closed for the duration of the trip.<br><br>
In school, when I warmed up and sat down at my desk, it was impossible to keep my eyes open. Every few seconds I had to pry them open with all my concentration. Eventually that got old, so I put my head on my binder and closed my eyes. The naesuea was long gone, but a new effect had taken its place. Very vivid CEV. It was like seeing everything, but with your eyes closed. I could see my binder, but it was different, and my brain chose to see it with all the paper ripped out. I quickly opened my eyes, and was surprised to see my binder in normal condition. Hallucinations such as these happend throughout the day, along with the heavy eye.<br><br>
I noticed that the effect of heavy eye and hallucinations disappeared completely when I was outside. Twice during that day I went out to my school roof to smoke a cigarette and felt fine. I remember feeling not as cold as I should have felt since it was a windy and cold autumn day, multiplied by the fact that I was 10 floors up, but I'm not sure if its just the placebo effect or the Fentanyl. Another interesting experience was when my friend offered me a dollar if I could take a dollar bill, place in on my forearm and push the lit end of a cigarette into it and wait until it burned through. I agreed and the experiment ensued. After about 30 seconds I got pissed and pushed his cigarette away, the dollar bill was undamaged, but the skin underneath had boiled from the heat. All I felt was a slight tingling which soon passed away. It was a horrific burn, but I couldn't feel it. It's left a hole in my arm. <br><br>
When I got home 9 hours later, the effect had not lessened, to my great joy. I sat down at my desk and locked my door so that I could enjoy peace and quiet from my nagging mom and loud siblings. I called up my best friend, a very pro-drug hippie kinda guy, whom I had introduced to weed. I told him about this great new drug I found. I lay down in my bed and continued talking. The heavy eye was back, along with even more powerful hallucinations. At one point I closed my eyes and was transported to a jungle, where a monkey with all its skin peeled off and a giraffe talked to me. I don't remember what they said, but I was very convinced I was there. I opened my eyes and the vision dissapeared and my friend was threatening to hang up if I didn't start talking again. Apparently during the vision I had stopped hearing him, and was completely transported to my jungle.<br><br>
Another intereting one was less of a vision, more of a space-out kinda thing. I was talking to him, and next thing I know he tells me to stop growling. I had spaced out and for some reason unknown to me, I had started growling. I was startled. I was in a vision at the time too, and I thought that it was somebody growling at me. Keep in mind these visions were only 2 or 3 minutes apart. I kept having more of them and eventually my friend hung up on me because of my frequent visions during which I forgot about him. As I was coming out of a vision, I heard the persistent and annoying beeping sound a phone makes when its just on, but not connected. Later that evening, I took the patches off because they had started to itch unbearably. I know it was a wasted, but what the heck, it wasn't that enjoyable anyway. <br><br>
I had never tried any opiates of any kind. I used to smoke marijuana quite frequently, and I have taken acid once. I have also tried adderal, and cocaine and I drink quite frequently. During my Fentanyl experince, I did not encounter any of the breathing problems other people have come across, but the CEVs were something I had not read about and was overjoyed that I had been affected in such a way. This drug is not very fun, its more of something you do when you cant do anything else. I'm going to try eating some of the gel, and see how different the effects are.<!-- End Body -->
