I'm not really quite sure why I attempted this, but it definitely was fun. I was at my friend's house with two other people and we were getting high and it was all fine and fun. And then the one guy pulled out a box of whippets and said that we should do that, too. I had never done nitrous before and I really didn't want to do it for the first time with cannabis, but I did it anyway. I inhaled four canisters of nitrous. The first one made my entire body feel as if it was flying and I felt so happy and giggly. The second one did basically the same thing as the first one, but it was a bit stronger. The third one was definitely the most intense. I felt like I was traveling through this narrow tunnel with neon lights all around it at like... 700 miles and hour. I couldn't stop screaming and laughing, and my entire body was tingling. The fourth one, was about 25 minutes later, and it did basically what the first and second ones did. <br><br>
I do have to say that my experience with weed and nitrous was awesome, but I have never done nitrous by itself before, but i'm a big fan of the combination. It was awesome!<!-- End Body -->
