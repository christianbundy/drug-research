 "report": "</p>\nI used versed when I was having some rough times in school (med school believe it or not) & thought I was going to harm myself if I didn't find a short vacation from stress. The alcohol wasn't helping anymore. This drug is fantastic for helping me relax, to stop obsessing, to sleep restfully... Wonderful.</p><p>BUT!!! It has some bad sides too. Too much can make you stop breathing. You sleep SO soundly that you could easily vomit and choke to death. I awoke one night with dried vomit in my mouth. I don't know why I didn't die, but I did end up with a bad pnuemonia a week or so later as the consequence of inhaling stomach acid & food.</p><p>Versed is easily a truth serum. It makes me willing to tell ANYONE ANYTHING. I wouldn't remember a lot of things I said and did the next day. Or I wouldn't be sure if I dreamed those things or they actually happened. The sensation of lost time can be unnerving. Finally, it's relatively expensive.</p><p>It also causes extreme uncoordination although this is not entirely unpleasant really! I didn't have any trippy, weird experiences, just plain old relaxation & a temporary escape from reality.</p>"
