Recently I acquired 40mg of 2C-E in one bag from a friend.  This is the first time that I had ever taken a phenylthylamine.  I decided to take half the bag.  I busted it out and separated it into two lines.  So it was 20 and 20.  Taking 20mg of 2c-e orally is a hard enough trip in itself.  Not knowing how crazy it was instead of taking the 20mg orally I snorted it. <br><br>
All I have to say is that this was the fastest that any drug has ever kicked in.  Approximately 3 minutes after snorting it a very strong feeling started to come over me.  The walls began to flash and I began to fry very very hard.  An extremely strong sense of terrifying fear and paranoia began to come over me.  Basically I began to wig out.  I began to become very sick to my stomach and started vomiting.  Even thought I was freaking out extremely hard, the visuals that ensued were fucking ridiculous.  <br><br>
As I was staring at the ground the grass looked liked octagon shaped stained glass in sections swirling in and out of each other.  After the I stopped throwing up and freaking out approximately an hour after I had snorted it I went to sit down inside.  I was still frying very and couldnt stop shaking.  <br><br>
About 4 hours into it I began to feel sane again and started to calm down.  The drug finally wore off totally about 8 hours after taking it. This was my first time taking a phenylthylamine and I obviously made a huge mistake snorting 2C-E.<!-- End Body -->
