Participants, time, setting:<br><br>
My girlfriend (J, early 20s) and I, Hooway (early 30s) were bored one evening 3 weeks ago, watching TV in my San Francisco apartment around 8.  <br><br>
I just got 10g of dried Kougoed (Sceletium) from a legal source on the web.  Cost: $47 after shipping.  A worthy experiment for the dull wintertime.<br><br>
Deposited 200mg (?) of Sceletium in a standard glass pipe.  At 2 hits for her and 4 for me, we were laying on the futon...our moods were brightened a bit.  This seemed to wear off in an hour.  Felt like the long long end of a easy foxy trip, or the first comings on of an MDMA trip.  Mild, nice.<br><br>
Second time, two hours ago put 200mg in a water bong, after smoking some pot.   Emotions are brightened, and I feel very little problems with logical thought.  It's like being told very good news, then going out to hang out with friends and smoke a little pot or have a couple beers.   Slightly off and buzzed, but happier than just what the pot/beer buzz would bring.<br><br>
One hour ago - 200mg - two hits in a water bong, no pot +1 hour.  The effects (brightened vision, feeling emotionally uplifted) have come again.  Almost has a little salvia edge to it, it's hard to quantify but feels nice.   <br><br>
Now: Nothing but cigarettes.  Scelectium effects are fading, but still felt like it lifted my mood from the deep, after a day and night of emotional tension.  No side effects except slight visual (brightened surroundings, slightly...)<br><br>
I can somehow tell it's working on the Serotonin side of things and not Norepinephrine vs. Dopamine vs. Opioid vs. the other myriad receptors.  A short acting SSRI, or possibly short mild acting Serotonin agonist like MDMA?  <br><br>
If it is like MDMA, should we be worried about the same mechanisms that cause neurodegenerative effects (dopamine flowing into sertonergic neurons, serotonin depletion?).   If so, would a MAO-B inhibitor be good with this - Nicotine, Deprenyl/Selegiline?<br><br>
Possibly Alpha-Lipoic to prevent heavy than normal oxidation problems? (it seems to lessen problems with Ecstasy in Rats)<br><br>
Research on it is limited at this point.<br><br>
