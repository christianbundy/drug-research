 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was feeling the need to smoke one night, but did not really want to smoke pot (I am a fairly regular smoker) and go through the long process of being high. Then I remembered that I had a large bag of dried catnip laying around that I bought from an herb shop to make tea with. So I put on some relaxing music, dimmed the lights, and began to pack the bowl of my pipe with about two large pinches of catnip. It took me about 5 minutes to finish smoking the bowl.\r\nThe taste surprised me. It has a very sweet, almost minty taste that I would consider adding to a smoking blend in the future. Inhaling the smoke was fairly mild and it actually helped clear some of the phlegm out of my throat and lungs (I had been experiencing allergies at the time). Almost immediately after smoking the catnip I felt a small but noticeable high. I felt very relaxed and experienced slight euphoria. My movement felt slightly slower... very similar to a low dose of pot.\r\nIt's nothing incredible, but it would be interesting to experiment with higher doses.\n\n\n"
