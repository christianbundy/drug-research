 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\n11:30PM\r\n-------\r\n        I've been fasting since early yesterday evening (~30 hours). I\r\nhave here one Mitsubishi pill (MDMA), 10mg of 2C-B (as 5mg pills), and 4mg\r\n(1/2 pill) of 2C-T-2. The plan is to take the MDMA first (as 2 halves, 15\r\nminutes apart), then the 2C-T-2 when that begins to decline, then wait 20\r\nminutes or so for potential nausea, then eat the 2C-B. This promises to be\r\na good night! I've never had 2C-B before, so I'm trying to go for the\r\nShulgin classic combination from PiHKAL. The 2C-T-2 is only to make up for\r\nthe low dose of 2C-B, and hopefully will not too much color the \r\nexperience.\r\n        Well, half the MDMA is down the hatch!\r\n11:45PM\r\n-------\r\n        Other half down! I think I'm already feeling the first half of the\r\npill! Must be the fasting... fasting can make a massive difference. Alot\r\nof butterflies in my stomach. Bees. Wow. I've been wanting to do 2C-B for\r\nyears, since reading the old Reed College 'bromomescaline' thing. Nexus.\r\nThe elusive Erox. I hope this is as good as I've heard!\r\n12:10AM\r\n-------\r\n        Damn, the MDMA is really beginning to kick in. Only 40 minutes in!\r\nFasting definately makes a difference. Its been a while since I've fasted\r\nover 24 hours.\r\n12:30AM\r\n-------\r\n        Wow... I'm going pretty good! I'm getting alot more than I have\r\noff these Mitsubishis before! I think I need to begin fasting before trips\r\nagain. Not only does it make the onset faster and the effects stronger,\r\nbut you feel alot 'cleaner' with an empty system. I wholeheartedly endorse\r\na nice fast of 24 hours (or more) before most entheogens.\r\n1:00AM\r\n------\r\n        Down the hatch with the 2C-T-2!\r\n        I'm in a great place. I read some email a friend sent me today\r\nwhich I found very touching. I spent some time thinking about that friend,\r\nand realized she truly is one of the treasures of my life.\r\n        Spent some time laying down, just thinking. I love to do\r\nMDMA-class drugs alone or with a small group of friends. Doing it at raves\r\nor clubs is a waste. Too hectic for some of the sublter, delicious\r\neffects. Doing it alone is especially luxurious... you can melt into a\r\nwave of pure feeling. Lay down in a nice quiet dark room... maybe some\r\nmellow quiet music... nice!\r\n1:23AM\r\n------\r\n        I think the 2C-T-2 is coloring the MDMA some, hard to tell.\r\nAnyway, I just ate about one and half of one of the bees... I cut off\r\nabout half of one and crushed it, to snort. Might as well, considering the\r\nsmall ammount I have. The stuff I powdered, I put into 4 *very* small\r\nlines.\r\n1:40AM\r\n------\r\n        Schnorrrt! First bump, not too bad... Second, not too bad there\r\neither. Two more... Third, in the other nostril - little sting. Nothing a\r\nsquirt of saline nasal spray doesnt fix... All done! Not bad at all.\r\nLittle bit of a bad taste, thats it. I assume the filler material in the\r\npill probably buffered it alot.\r\n1:50AM\r\n------\r\n        Definately feeling alot more than MDMA now! Im feeling sweaty.\r\nSorta mescaliney, but the body sensations are still all MDMA. But wow,\r\nthey're increasing.\r\n1:53AM\r\n------\r\n        Whoops, just went from sweaty hot to cold. Here come the bees!\r\n2:05AM\r\n------\r\n        Wow. Very nice. I feel very cool, almost cold, despite still\r\nsweating a little from the MDMA. I feel very good, physically. It feels\r\nsomewhat like a low dose of mescaline, or the latter part of my 2C-T-2\r\nexperience. Not outstandingly visual (yet?) but feels great physically and\r\nmentally. Only drawback - it seems to enhance the MDMA jaw clench quite a\r\nbit. Small price.\r\n3:35AM\r\n------\r\n        Im in a really interesting space. VERY nice. Much like mescaline,\r\nindeed! Similar to my San Pedro experiences, but milder on the body. I can\r\nfeel the 2C-T-2 in there, and the MDMA... but theybe all melded into a\r\nnice whole. Colors stand out in razor sharp clarity. Very vivid, yet\r\nnatural. Mescaline-type visuals overall.\r\n3:45AM\r\n------\r\n        Wow... this has only been 10 minutes? I must be experiencing some\r\npretty heavy time distorions. Laying down in bed with my eyes closed I had\r\nsome great closed eye visuals. I see things flitting around the corners of\r\nmy vision with open eyes. Colors are ultra-crisp. I see little fractally\r\noverlays over alot of things. Shimmery and spider-weblike. Similar to what\r\nI've gotten from mescaline. Sounds of crickets outside are amplified and\r\nreverbate - natural music. Physical sensations are amazing. Not quite like\r\nmescaline or MDMA but about half way in between the two polarities. I can\r\nfeel the MDMAishness fading some, but the 2C-B and definately the 2-C-T-2\r\nare going strong still! In some ways theres a GHB-ish feel to the physical\r\naspect. This is very interesting... and nice.\r\n5:10AM\r\n------\r\n        I'm still pretty stimulated, and my visual field is still pretty\r\ncrisp, but I'm on my way down now. Out with a little pot and GHB, then\r\nsleep, I think!\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\n        Well, it took me till near 10AM to get to sleep. Perhaps the\r\n2C-T-2 was responsible for that. There was a long lingering effect, with\r\ngood visuals lasting the whole time. Phenethylamines are unlike\r\ntryptamines that way... the effects are more spread out and continuous,\r\nrather than the sharp peak, gradual decline, and long tail of tryptamines.\r\nIt was definately a nice experience, and I hope someday to get to explore\r\n2C-B at a more appropriate dosage range.\n\n\n"
