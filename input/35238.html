I went to my friend's party at the year of 2000 and in the month of July. I stayed up all night at his party and then I stayed up the whole night for the whole next day. I was really close to falling asleep but I didn't want to because of what would have happened. <br><br>
When it turned 12:30 A.M. I really started to flip out. I was delirious and I laughed my ass off about things that weren't even funny. Some of these things were saying 'Cat, Dog, Mouse, Rat'. I mean, that isn't even funny at all. Then I went into the bathroom and I fell asleep on the toilet. <br><br>
My dream was that at the year of 2000 everything would explode and everything will be gone. There was a giant monster telling me this and I thought that I would really die. Then I woke up because everything was about to explode. I went downstairs and screamed. I yelled 'I DON'T WANT TO DIE!'. Then my mom said your not going to die what are you talking about. Then I told her that at the year 2000 everything would explode. Then she said 'We'll thats too bad but do you know what. <br><br>
It's way passed the year 2000 and nothing exploded'. Then she told me that I had delirium from staying up too much and then told me to go to sleep. Then I brushed my teeth and then went to sleep. This was a weird trip but it wasn't scary after the 5 minutes that I woke up.<!-- End Body -->
