Datura's not a worthwhile adventure; about 15 years ago I ate a number of Jimsonweed seeds and only remember about two hours of extremely severe Phantasms. This was two hours of conciousness out of almost THREE DAYS of heavy duty delieirum, visions/fantasy, lucid dreams.I would'nt call them hallucinations in the LSD on Psilocybin sense. They were completely otherworldly. I was completely gone.<br><br>
My friends and sister had to take care of me .I was a danger to myself and others. I am surprised noone took me to the hospital ( I was a teenager and my parents were out of town). I remember having a long conversation with my alarm clock on the nightstand while trying to sleep and other weirdness. After about 2 1/2 Days I was pretty aware of things around me again but remained poisoned for about a week. My vision got back to normal after a few days.<br><br>
I have never heard good things about using the tropane group of alkaloids for recreation (of which Datura and Atropa Bellodonna belong) although I have a lot of books by Hofmann , Schultes and others who document the use of Datura and related plants among Shaman of South America and Native Southwestern Americans. (not to mention the Wiccans of old Europe). <br><br>
I think if you have someone skilled in the use of medicinal plants, these two plants are very helpful for pain relief, asthma and other illnesses, ceremonies etc (In fact you can buy O-T-C- in most health food /vitamin stores in the homeopathic remedies section a product callled Bellodonna 6X it is used for fevers and neuralgia ). But if you do not know the potency of the plant AND its origins AND how much to even begin with eating, my advice is don't fuck with it. I can remember that shit like it was yesterday and it was not fun.<br><br>
Hope this helps.<!-- End Body -->
