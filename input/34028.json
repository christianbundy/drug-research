 "report": "</p>\nI can assure you that even a light dose of 200mg caused my methadone to be metabolized very quickly. This is, of course subjective, as I didn't do blood levels with and without.  I loved the feeling of modafanil and would try to use it to stay awake and feel euphoric, which doses of 1000mg to 1500mg do.</p><p>But I had take supplemental methadone every few hours just to avoid withdrawal sickness, which with methadone-done doesnt come on heavy for 48 hours or longer.  A single large provigil dose causes the sickness to come on with a startlingly fast speed.</p>"
