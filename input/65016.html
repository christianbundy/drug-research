I had never tried illegal drugs before, and had always been curious.  I wanted to try LSD or shrooms but my friends convinced me to try marijuana first.  I bought a pack of zig-zags and my friend took me to her dealer where I purchased 2 grams of weed.  She supervised the first joint that I'd ever rolled and we sat on the porch so she could smoke a cigarette.  She started smoking her pipe and offered it to me.  I decided to take a few hits of it.  I should have let it set in, but I decided we should try out the first joint I'd ever rolled.<br><br>
We both smoked the joint and once it was finished I was fine for about 10 minutes.  She asked me how high I was and I remember saying 'I'm fine, I don't think that was very strong.'  Very shortly after I said that, I remember scratching my leg and not feeling my leg.  Then I touched the arm of the chair I was sitting in and it felt like sandpaper.  I started getting really scared and considered running home, but I never left that chair.  Every time I shifted, I felt even more uneasy and uncomfortable.  I could barely get my words out, and all I could say was I am so high.<br><br>
After what felt like an eternity, she took me inside and sat me on her couch to watch Super Troopers.  The couch was very scratchy and uncomfortable, like sandpaper.  I had a difficult time following the plot, even though I had seen this movie before 3 times, but I also felt like I finally got the movie.  Afterwards I just lied down on the couch dosing until I had to use the washroom.  The entire time I had been drinking water because my mouth was so dry.  Her friend drove my car home and I could barely get my keys to work on my front door.<br><br>
I had a bath to get clean and then watched Dazed and Confused.  I ate half a bag of Lays chips with guacamole and played video games on my computer.  After another hour or two I was feeling better and went to my friends house to drink and smoke more.  I made sure to smoke less than before because I was still a little scared from my trip earlier.<!-- End Body -->
