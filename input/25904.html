Since my friends and I had previously exhausted my city of all its Morning Glory seeds, I wanted to try a different legal drug.  Having read up on Nutmeg some months before, I made the decision to eat some spice.<br><br>
I am not an experience drug user by any means.  In fact, the only drugs I have tried are Marijuana and Morning Glory seeds.  I have never experienced any convincing hallucinations, and that was what I was looking for in Nutmeg.  As of today, Nutmeg is definitely the strongest drug I have taken.<br><br>
(T-1:00)  I ran out to the local grocery store and bought a jar of 12 nuts.  Net weight is 63 grams.  <br><br>
(T-0:15)  From the research I did the night before, I decided to eat the 2 largest nuts in the jar.  Should be somewhere between 11-15 grams.<br><br>
(T=0:00)  After grinding up only two nuts, I was amazed at how much spice I had to eat.  Since I knew it would be impossible to eat the Nutmeg straight, I fetched some ice cream and some water.  By plugging my nose and using the ice cream to mask the Nutmegs texture, I got it all down without any difficulties.  Now I wait.<br><br>
(T+1:00)  I went to my friends house where I met K and L.  K was hesitant about trying any Nutmeg because most experience reports said that Nutmeg was not worth it.  L had no knowledge about Nutmeg.  They both ended up grinding up 2 nuts and then mixed the shavings with tapioca.  I told them that plugging their noses would mask the taste, but it didnt help.  They both gave up after ingesting no more than 2 grams of Nutmeg each.<br><br>
(T+1:30)  K and L decided to smoke some pot.  I decided against smoking because I wanted to feel the Nutmegs effects alone.  If Im experimenting with a new drug, I dont want to take two drugs and mix up the effects.<br><br>
(T+2:30)  Nothing more than a contact high.<br><br>
(T+4:30)  I think Im feeling something.  Could be placebo. My other friend J arrives.  <br><br>
(T+5:00)  Im feeling stoned now.  I have cottonmouth.  I was so used to only getting cottonmouth after smoking, that I thought I had smoked.  After remembering that I didnt smoke at all, I realized it must be the Nutmeg giving me cottonmouth.  This was reassuring because I now knew it wasnt a placebo high.<br><br>
(T+6:00)  Definitely off baseline.  Im feeling very stoned.  I can make myself see minor hallucinations in the wall or carpet.  My memory is shot.  Its very similar to a Marijuana high.  No nausea.  At this point Im pretty comfortable with myself. <br><br>
(T+7:00)  Feeling sedated.  I felt like I was on a tranquilizer.  I just wanted to sit down and stare off into space.  I have never been drunk before, but I gather this is what its like.<br><br>
(T+7:45)  K, L, and J wanted to smoke some more pot.  At this point, I feel really drunk and sluggish.  I tried to take a few hits of the blunt they were smoking but it was unusually difficult.  I couldnt distinguish the effects of the Cannabis and the effects of the Nutmeg.  I felt the need to separate from my friends and take a walk.  I ended up in my car and waited until my friends were done smoking to reunite with them.<br><br>
(T+11:30)  Its hard to remember what I did after we smoked.  I never felt particularly uncomfortable.  I never felt really good, either. <br><br>
(T+14:00)  Went to bed.  Still intoxicated.<br><br>
(T+20:00)  I had to wake up to go to the dentist.  I was amazed at how high I still was.  Sitting down and watching my brother play video games was very enjoyable.<br><br>
(T+26:00)  I forget what I did after my dentist appointment.  Nutmeg kills my memory more than pot does.  I was beginning to come down.  I went to my friend, Ps, house.  He commented that I looked drowsy as hell.  He didnt know that I had previously done Nutmeg.<br><br>
(T+28:00)  I feel normal again.<br><br>
Nutmeg was too long lasting for my taste.  It was also too sedating.<br><br>
I now understand why its still legal.  I dont see how anybody could abuse this drug.  I might try it again.  It really takes a lot out of me.  Luckily, I never felt nausea of any kind.  Its a pleasant, sedated high with minor hallucinations.  The whole experience seemed mildly similar to Marijuana.  Be sure to be patient and not take too much.  It took me seven hours to peak.<!-- End Body -->
