 "report": "<p>I have suffered with insomnia off and on for years.</p><p>I was given a 5 mg Ambien to try- to see if I liked it in order to ask my doctor for a prescription.</p><p>I took one pill at approx. 10 pm.</p><p>At 10:30, things in the bedroom started to look funny.</p><p>Every surface that had a straight line (such as a piece of paper, the tv, a table) was starting to move. It was as if the lines were moving, very hard to describe.</p><p>Inanimate objects were suddenly shifting and moving. </p><p>The visual disturbances were so extreme that I would have been a danger to others and myself if I was alone or if I had gotten up.</p><p>I did not feel sleepy or tired at all, just very weird.</p><p>I don't drink very much and I have never done any recreational drugs so this was a scary event.</p><p>I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you are alone.</p><p>I did go right to sleep as soon as I closed my eyes.</p>"
