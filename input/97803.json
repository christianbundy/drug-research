 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have suffered with insomnia off and on for years.\r\nI was given a 5 mg Ambien to try- to see if I liked it in order to ask my doctor for a prescription.\r\nI took one pill at approx. 10 pm.\r\nAt 10:30, things in the bedroom started to look funny.\r\nEvery surface that had a straight line (such as a piece of paper, the tv, a table) was starting to move. It was as if the lines were moving, very hard to describe.\r\nInanimate objects were suddenly shifting and moving. \r\nThe visual disturbances were so extreme that I would have been a danger to others and myself if I was alone or if I had gotten up.\r\nI did not feel sleepy or tired at all, just very weird.\r\nI don't drink very much and I have never done any recreational drugs so this was a scary event.\r\nI would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you are alone.\r\nI did go right to sleep as soon as I closed my eyes.\n\n\n"
