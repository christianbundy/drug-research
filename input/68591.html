Woke up this morning, I was a bit depressed after a fight with my girlfriend over the telephone, about stupid little things that bothered me for a long time.<br><br>
I smoked +-150 mg of kanna mixed with tabacco in a ciggarette, almost didn't taste it. 20min later I wasn't so depressed anymore. An hour later I was at work, and for once didn't bother to be there, although I wasn't thrilled to be there and the time passed very slow. I felt some weird headache in the late afternoon (+-6hours after smoke).<br><br>
after work I went to the cafe I usualy go to, met some friends I hadn't seen in a long time and had the best conversation in months, talked for 4 hours nonstop and had to split because we have to work tomorow. Came home and finally finished the painting that was laying on the floor for weeks and then I still had the energy to type this all down. Now some mj and some sleep.<br><br>
It's a bit early to tell for me, but it feels as a good antidepresive, perhaps not for daily use.<!-- End Body -->
