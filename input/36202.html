To prepare this tea, I put several flowers and large leaves from my Brugmansia versicolor (Angels trumpet) in 2 cups of water in a covered sauce pan and boiled it for about 30 minutes.  I then removed it from heat and poured it through a colander and caught the strong tea-colored liquid in a bowl (the darker the color the stronger it is).  I put this in the freezer for about 15 minutes to cool it to drinking temperature.  Note that I have also left leaves soaking in water overnight after boiling, and this seems to result in a stronger brew. After it cooled, I drank a half-cup.  It tasted like water which had vegetables cooked in it and wasn't that bad.  <br><br>
About an hour later I took another 1/2 cup.  I split the dose for safety reasons.  If I feel the first dose coming on unusually strong, then I know I do not need a 2nd does, or perhaps a smaller second dose. Effects start after about 45 min and peak at around 3-4 hrs later.  During this time I am really delirious.  I then start slowly coming back to reality for several hours after that and try to sleep. I was just hanging out in my apartment doing this.  This is not a social drug. <br><br>
Visuals:<br>
For me, this drugs causes some visual hallucinations, such as swirly patterns, a clear gel-like ooze on objects.  Everything seems to get a yellowish tinge, and watching the TV can become a real 3-d experience. You may see things moving around at the periphery of your vision, like dust bunnies on the carpet springing to life :)<br><br>
Eventually my vision becomes extremely blurry if I try to focus on any object closer than 18'.  This will last at least 24 hours.  It really sucks when trying to use the TV remote :)<br><br>
Mind:<br><br>
My favorite part of the trip is the communication with people who aren't there.  With eyes closed I will carry on conversations with everyone I know - friends, family, co-workers.  I will be speaking out loud when doing this.  It is SO real, when I open my eyes and see I'm alone, I walk around my apartment looking for them!!<br><br>
Sometimes I can't interpret what the characters are on TV - my brain just can't assoicate the visual to the memory in order to comprehend what its seeing, so it just appears to be some kind of morphing abstract art.<br><br>
Extreme Confusion and forgetfullness while on this drug can be funny or just downright exasperating.  I get up off the couch to go to the kitchen to get a drink of water, but when I get to the kitchen I don't why I'm there.  If I'm talking with someone on the phone, I cannot remember their conversation or mine long enough to comprehend it or respond.  I may place things in odd places, like finding VCR tapes in the fridge.  Once I tried to brush my teeth with my shaving gel.  <br><br>
Physical effects:<br><br>
I do not really like the physical effects from this plant. <br><br>
Initially I may have a very pleasant floating expanding feeling in my torso, but that usually gets replaced by a kind of itchy feeling everywhere.  Sometimes not, sometimes very much so.<br><br>
My sinus passages may dry up to the point they are very uncomfortable.  I found that using a nasal saline spray helps.  You may get very thirsty too. <br><br>
Walking/moving gets difficult.  I feel like I have lead weights all over my body and my coordination is really bad.  <br><br>
Talking may become difficult or impossible.<br><br>
Heart rate goes up.   I tend to get marked vaso-constriction which will make me feel cold.<br><br>
I can get hand tremors that make it diffult to write or do any task that requires dexterity.  This could last 48 hours.<br><br>
My skin flushes all over so I am quite red, and this may last for a good 24 hours.<br><br>
My pupils dilate markedly and stay that way for abour 48 hours.<br><br>
I would NOT recommend taking brug tea if you have any committments for the next 48 hours that require your full mental/physical capabilities.<!-- End Body -->
