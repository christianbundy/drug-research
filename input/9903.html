I once had an OBE after toking 2 gigantic bong rips of Salvia Divinorum leaf.  I was holding the second blast in and I started to feel a tingle start in my limbs.  The next thing I know my astral body is being pulled out the back of my physical body and then through the wall of my house.  Down my block I went being pulled by an unseen force.<br><br>
The feeling of having your conscience forcefully pulled out of your body is a pretty amazing and scary experience.  It reminded me of the way peoples spirits were pulled from thier bodies in the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  I was about three houses down my block when I suddenly realized that I shouldn't go any farther for fear that my physical body might die if I went too far.<br><br>
I had to fight with all my might to travel back into my house and back into my body sitting in a chair.  I entered my body the same way I left it, through the back.  At that point I opened my eyes and saw my friend who was there to watch over me while I was under.  He was laughing at me, which kind of bothered me cause I couldn't comprehend what had happened to me.  It felt as if there was magnet pulling back in the direction of my OBE (I checked later and the direction was exactly east).  I tried as hard as I could to turn around in my seat, because I was sure there would be some sort of tunnel or worm hole into hyperspace.  Of course there was no tunnel, but the effort to turn around was exhausting. <br><br>
I've had breakthrough Salvia experiences all of the 6 times I smoked it out of a bong, but none of them have ever compared this humbling experience.  Haven't tried DMT yet, but for a legal, immediate, short-acting high Salvia is the most intense psychedelic I've ever tried.<!-- End Body -->
