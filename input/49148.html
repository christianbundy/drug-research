I found myself unemployed with free time between school schedules, so I thought I'd put it to good use.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active as such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">related article</a>]</font><br><br>
From known weights, usually 250 mg or 100 mg, I have eyeballed divisions to guess at my pill weights.  So there is probably a +/-5% involved.<br><br>
This report is specifically for a series of trials with 2C-E.<br><br>
12.5 mg ingested orally proves very visual, but physiologically overwhelming, vomiting is probably a given.<br><br>
8.66 mg orally relieves the physical, although the emotionally unstable my still have a bit of difficulty integrating (and will still pop.)  This is my dose in snuff, a bit harder than the 12.5 mg oral dose, but 2c-e has an effect within 15 minutes by this route, otherwise it can take an hour to two hours.<br><br>
2ct-2 trials, 31.25 mg oral.  <br><br>
The trip was amazing, the visuals were almost constant... distinctly distortions of what I was seeing though, nothing manifested as with a pot/acid combo.  I make mention of this chem though, for it has greater potential as a synergist.  2c-e, usually at 10 mg with 20-25mg 2ct-2 creates oceans out of carpet, rainbows from white walls, etc.<br><br>
Trips are usually visual for 5 hours after onset; for 2C-E and 2c-I. The visuals are pretty hard to ignore the first 3 of those (I refer to it as the self-guided phase).<br><br>
2C-E becomes unbearable past 2x a dose.<!-- End Body -->
