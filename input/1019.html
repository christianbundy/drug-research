I've used GHB for over a year with increasing doses, to the point of a couple of times a day.  The symptoms I've notice from the regular use include a loss of that special high that I used to get in the early months of use.  Possibly a downregulation of the receptor sites.  I quit 3 weeks ago for a 3 month hiaitus.  The withdrawal symptoms consisted of severe anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, and lack of focus.  Unfortunately, I'm supplementing these withdrawal symptoms with pot and valium.  Trading one monkey for another. <br><br>
The biggest problem I had while using G was severe constipation.  It got to the point that I wouldn't go for 2 days and then would resort to using a stool softener to keep it all moving.  How pathetic that I would continue to justify using G at the expensive of not being able to move my bowels!  After 3 weeks I still notice a loss of energy and positive emotional state, but know this will return to normal when my body gets over it.  I just wonder if I have the willpower to just use G on occasion or just quit it altogether.  I prefer its overall health benefits to other drugs like X, pot, valium, alcohol, etc. I even used it to workout (on small doses) and had great results, faster running times, leaner muscle.  Would love to hear other stories.<!-- End Body -->
