Just thought you guys be interested in a little bit of excitement that came my way last night...<br><br>
After drinking an entire pot of coffee in less than an hour, around 4 AM this morning I became completely and utterly convinced that the world was going to end at exactly 6:11 AM this morning, just before first light. I'm not making this up. I completely lost my shit in a way that I have never lost it before.<br><br>
I was so freaked out, I wanted to die. Not to kill myself, just die. I had absolutely no desire to write, speak, eat, blow my nose, kiss, think or be in general...I wanted to die and I was convinced that when the world did end in a blaze of hellfire, I was gonna be judged by the Lord Almighty and burn for eternity. I wrote four pages about it in my journal as I was hip deep in the shitpool that was a stimulant overdose induced, acute manic/paranoiac attack that triggered some sort of neoclassical, metaphysical, socio-religious and philosophical crisis.<br><br>
Needless to say this sucked real bad, and I didn't real start to come down off this until around 5 in the morning. This particularly blew 'cos I had two labs to finish by today (already late...I only ended up getting one done), and I didn't feel a hell of a lot of incentive to expound on the vibrational-rotational modes of carbon dioxide molecules being that the world was going to come to a screeching halt and I was hurtling toward that inevitable eternity of suffering and agony reserved for unrepentant pagans and unbelievers like m'self... <br><br>
I fully snapped out of it at 6:20 and now my stomach feels like I swallowed a pound of Drain-O and pixie stick cocktails...<br><br>
If anyone ever tells you caffeine is not a psychoactive drug when taken in significantly large quantities, spit on their nose. And if you find the bastard that sprinkled LSD on my French Roast, cut out his tongue...<!-- End Body -->
