 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis experience was so radical I still remember it vividly after 30 years.\r\nMy friends came up on a pallet load of expired drugs from a hospital headed for the hazmat dump site. We went thru the hard stuff MS, Diluadid, Dexoxyn, etc. With a rip roaring drug habit I started digging thru all the little bottles of unknown stuff. Thats when I came across the vial of pure Scopolamine Hydrobromide used for compounding and formulation. \r\nThe Drug Reference said it was used in over the counter sleep tablets, and I needed some sleep bad. I swallowed about ½ grain and injected ½ grain. BIG MISTAKE.\r\nIt was about 9:00pm and I dont remember much of the next 12 hours. My stepson said I crawled around all night eating lint balls off the shag carpet and mumbled to myself. At times I felt perfect, except I couldnt walk and the hallucinations were so vivid I thought they were real. I was so bad my stepson helped me get to a payphone to call the ambulance but the numbers on the phone were backward like in Russian.\r\nThe fire department came and took me to the ER. My body was like on a PCP overdose, and I could not even stay on the exam bed but kept slipping off onto the floor. It was funny cause I would go from a clear mind to talking to people who were not there. They shot me with valium 3 times to no effect. My heart rate was over 200 and my mouth so dry I could not talk.\r\nThe cops came, accused me of resisting arrest, and put me in a choke hold. After beating my butt right in front of the nurses, they took me to jail and tossed me into the rubber room. There I kept seeing a detective shove his handgun into the cell and pull the trigger. Click but no shot. He would laugh and pull his hand out. This happened over and over. Then I saw my grandma get thrown into the bull pen right across the hall. I saw the thugs rape her over and over. I was sure I could knock down the cell door and slammed into it with all my weight over and over. It was screaming I would kill those punks and they were all pointing and laughing at me.\r\nIt was 12:00 am the second night, the watch commander opened the cell to check on me at change of shift. I leapt from flat on my back like a cat and bit him so bad he had to go on work comp then retire. After that, they called me the biter. All the time I was in the padded cell I thought I saw pills all over the floor. I kept eating the pills hoping to come down. I thought there was a bowl of valiums in the middle. It was really the crap hole in the rubber room. Gross.\r\nThey took me upstairs the 3rd day to a medical unit. I thought I had a long sword stuck down my pant leg. I was walking with a stiff leg and the cops kept asking why I was walking funny. Over the next 12 hours my toilet was singing do-wop, my towel was Popeyes kid Sweetpea swinging around the bars, and I was stuck in a standoff between the Hells Angeles and the Black Panthers. I must have killed a dozen men with my sword.\r\nThe third night I was afraid to move because I would set off a war and I was right in the line of fire. I lay frozen for at least 10 hours. The Black Panthers kept throwing dead cats into my cell.\r\nThe fourth morning I had to go to court so Mental Health interviewed me. I denied taking any illicit drug, knew who was president, what day it was, and where I was. I told them everything was fine cept they keep throwing dead cats into my cell.\r\nWhen I got back to my cell I noticed I could see more clearly, was able to shave (Had to threaten a fellow prisoner with beheading if he didnt give me a razor) and went to court. I mustered every ounce of strength and told the judge it was all a big mistake. My wife had filed a police brutality report over the hospital incident and they let me go.\r\nIt took over a week and a lot of downers for it to wear off completely. I know what it is to be insane and come back. Dont recommend it.\n\n\n"
