 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n15mg of 2C-D in a glass of wine, taken with good food and good friends...<br>(I apologize for the lack of timeline, but I honestly didnt look at the clock all night, and writing a trip report was an afterthought.)<br>Very slow ride up very pleasant all around.  A companion and I both likened it to MDMA.  It made me very sociable.  It also squelched all the drowsiness that came from all the alcohol I drank (which was impressive considering the quantity of alcohol I had).<br>I noted increased body heat accompanied by an exquisite body high, very soft, warm and pleasant.  Breathing felt good. <br>Attention span was fucking shot.  My ability to perform simple tasks such as set up a dreamcast were failed miserably (due to a missing cable, and missing games, so I would have failed regardless of how sober/intoxicated I was), but it took me a while to realize the cable was missing and remember I had lent out my binder of games.<br>As pleasant as this chemical is, it is by no means a psychedelic (at least not at this dose).  This drug goes in the same category broad category as alcohol/codeine/ghb/methamphetamine/ecstasy (feel good, not mind expanding), no profound revelations were had (and consequently not an ounce of freaking out or paranoia)<br>I was shocked at the efficacy of this dosage!  My previous trial with 10mg was unimpressive to say the least.  I suppose that is a 50% increase in dose though.  The funny thing was that I felt more composed than I did on 10mg, though Im sure the alcohol had a part in that. It also lasted a notably longer than the 10mg trip.  Even more so than my experience with 10mg, it was apparent that this material was not steady in its effects there were moments of great intensity with a vertigo like sensation around the peak, then it would switch to perfect lucidity, as if I were stone sober, then back again.  This would happen in 10-20 minute intervals.<br>No enhancements of bright lights or any visuals at all.  I didnt get a chance to check my pupils.<br>My behaviour was very spontaneous and weird.  Ideas just came to me, bizarre things I wouldnt normally say.<br>It had an excellent synergy with the alcohol, I feel it allowed me to drink more without getting tired or being clumsy.<br>As pleasant as this was, I cant help but feel guilty for feeling this good without gaining anything.  I learned nothing from this trip.  I had a superb time, and now have some fond memories of the evening, but I couldnt see wasting time doing this often, especially if Im fucked up tomorrow well see though.<br>I dont feel guilty after I do a true psychedelic and actually pull something out of it that enriches my life - a new perspective or concept though good memories undeniably enrich your life hmm at any rate as fun as this was, not a regular thing to be doing, unless of course I somehow feel 100% tomorrow, which seems unlikely considering that 10mg didnt leave me 100% AND all the alcohol Ive had tonight.  Well see though.<br>Epilogue: Was it ever hard to get to sleep!  After I finally fell asleep I slept for 5 whopping hours.  Despite my sub-standard amount of rest, I feel pretty good today.  I am glad I dont have to work though.  Work would give me an idea what % I am.  Now Id have to guess at least 90%+.  The day after that I was back to normal.\n\n\n"
