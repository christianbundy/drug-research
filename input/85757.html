Background: Male, 370, 6,2ft tall.<br>
Ive never really tried any psychoactive drugs before, or for that matter, any recreational drugs. The only thing I ever tried was lighter gas (butane), which does give an interesting feeling, but I can really feel my brain cells frying, and I feel down for up to 24 hrs later. Huffing chemicals absolutely sucks.<br><br>
I also tried some dried psilocybin shrooms, but they did absolutely nothing. I suspect the dosage was too low, and since Im a big guy, I need more than people of regular size.<br><br>
Okay, lets try some Gabapentin. I have plenty of pills. Its early in the morning, and Ive just had breakfast, so my stomach is full. I feel neutral; neither happy nor sad. <br><br>
Total: 2000mg +2 hrs, 2pm<br>
I feel sort of good, like Im a tiny bit tipsy, a bit dizzy and floaty.  Theres a small amount of buzzing in my extremities.<br>
+5 hrs, 5pm: I can definitely feel the effects now. I feel pretty drunk and dizzy, and my eyes can only really focus on whats right in front of me, but I can still act sober. I get an occasional wave of pleasure running through my body, and it feels really good. I need more.<br><br>
+5,5 hrs, 5.30pm: Ate dinner, feeling a bit more sober now. My vision is still a bit blurry Okay, maybe I didnt sober up. Im smoking a cigarette, and just felt another wave in my head. This is weird, but it feels good. Smoking really seems to enhance the feeling.<br><br>
Total: 4000mg +6 hrs. 6pm<br>
Just doubled the dosage. Im considering huffing a tiny amount of butane, but I dont know. The stuff is nasty, causes headache, and I can taste the butane in my mouth for an entire day. The trip lasts only a few minutes, but it is awesome while it lasts. Well see. For now, Im satisfied with just the Gabapentin. Im in my recliner, just chilling, preparing to listen to some music. Its very serene around here. Birds are chirping outside and it has just rained, so the smell of flowers is amazing and very powerful. Mentally, theres no change. I feel exactly the same as when I woke up. Looking in the mirror, I can see bags under my eyes. I dont feel especially tired though. Physically I feel a bit different. It may just be my mind messing with me, but I seem to be able to breathe easier, almost like the air flows faster into my lungs.<br><br>
Total: 6000mg +7 hrs. 7pm<br>
I couldnt find any butane, which is probably a good thing, so I went to buy cigarettes. The physical effects seem to be gone, though my eyes are a bit more sensitive. I seem to notice things I usually dont: the bright color of the flowers, the faint shift of colors in hedges and bushes. White almost blinds me, yet I feel almost drawn to it. When I went into the shop, I noticed the hubcaps on a parked car. They seemed to move a tiny amount. Everything inside the shop (which Ive shopped at almost daily for 12 years now) is brighter than usual. Its an explosion of color. Even the skin of the cashier, whom Ive seen plenty of times, seems to be softer and more gentle than before. Its a bit odd, not unnerving or anything, but pretty cool. My eyes are hurting a bit from having such a hard time focusing on anything.<br><br>
Total 8000mg +7 hrs. 7.43pm<br>
Last chance for this to impress me. 8 grams inside me now. I feel absolutely nothing anymore. Lets see if anything happens.<br><br>
+8 hrs. 8.44pm<br>
Found some butane, and took 4 hits, to see if the Gabapentin would react to it. Doesnt really seem to do anything. I now honestly believe everything I experienced today was just a placebo effect, due to all the stories Ive read about it. I seem to be immune to Gabapentin. No numbness, Im not dizzy anymore and I feel absolutely fine. I probably got dizzy because I didnt sleep well last night. Its the same with shrooms, or anything else that has to go through my stomach. No effect. I even have to take a triple dose of Paracetamol to cure a headache. I thoroughly believe that my immune system is way too strong, and it just crushes anything unfriendly it comes in contact with. Of course, Im too much of a chicken to try anything stronger, to test my theory.<!-- End Body -->
