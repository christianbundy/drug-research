I suppose the best time to start this is about 5 years ago.<br><br>
I was having trouble sleeping and the doctor gave me a prescription of Zolpidem Tartrate, known here as Stilnox. I was given these because at my young age, at that time 18, Stilnox were non  addictive. (which is definitely not true. ) . At this time however Id only ever smoked a bit of marijuana and alcohol and didnt have a clue what pills people could take to get high, with the exception of valium, though Id never tried and I never planned to. In my inexperienced mind ALL pills were  Hard  drugs. <br><br>
So one night I took my 10mg of Stilnox I took some nights before bed, but this time, just as I was about to get into bed I decided Id clean my room first, after a while I just sort of realized out of the blue that I had been standing for about a minute or so hunched over. Then when I stood up straight I realized I felt like I was very drunk! I staggered down the hallway almost tripping over just giggling. I had discovered the effects of  Zolpidem by complete accident.<br><br>
So every now and again a friend and I would take 1 or 2. and thats as far as it went. But I was at the library one day and saw a book ( which I later stole ), called  Handbook of Modern Drugs. Upon reading this book, which dealt with prescription and illicit drugs, I saw a name that was familiar, Kalma, chemical name Alprazolam. These were the pills my mum took! So on the odd occasion I would steal a couple. At first I didnt really feel much but after about 5 or 6 times I began to notice the effects. My doctor also changed me from Stilnox to Temazepam which to my delight was also in the book!<br><br>
Through out the whole time my drug use was very casual just have some once every month or two.<br><br>
4 years later:<br>
Last year I started 2 get bored and think back to the Zolpidem days. I went to my doctor and told him I was having sleep trouble and wanted some stilnox again, he gave me a script with several repeats. Within about 2 weeks I was taking them everynight, after about 2 months I was taking sometimes as much as 4 a night. Continuously getting scripts from the doctor.<br><br>
Everyday I felt sick with a kind of sickness only heavy zolpidem use produces. I call it a  Metallic sickness because it feels like my stomach is lined out with metal, theres a constant taste of metal in the mouth, I felt SICK all the time, the back of my eyes hurt most of the time. If I looked how I felt, then I must have looked pretty bad. But the lure of stilnox is strong after a while and the effects ( so I thought at the time), outwayed the the bad side of things.<br><br>
While high on stilnox I would often go to take my hat off because it would annoy me greatly, but the trouble was I would never be actually wearing a hat. It just felt like I was . And there were also the Ghosts  .<br><br>
I would be in the loungeroom watching TV, and for some reason I would just think that there were a few people sitting at the kitchen table, some one standing over there leaning against the wall, 2 people looking over my shoulder, Id turn to talk to the person next to me and be completely surprised to see the room empty.<br><br>
This would happen EVERY time. I was also doing things, like hiding stuff in weird places, and totally forget about it until like, a week later when Id find a book hidden at the bottom of my underwear draw, then remembering I put it there last week.<br>
Well after a few months it occurred to me I was either addicted or VERY, VERY close.<br>
The sickness sucked, so I decided to get out while I still could. Even now when I think of stilnox I can feel slightly the horrible, but unique sickness.<br><br>
I havent touched it for about 9 months, and there is absolutely no way I could again, I think if I had even one pill I would spew my guts up.<br><br>
This year:<br><br>
Although Ive given up stilnox ( FOREVER!), Ive been using  using Benzos heaps. The doctor prescribed me 2 mg Diazepam tablets. After my second visit I convinced him to prescribe me 5mg ones which he had absolutely no qualms about. ( Doctors love writing prescriptions, Im sure of that! ) I have a friend who was getting me Temazepam until recentley  when I asked him to get Nitrazepam instead. Im using benzos about 5  6 days a week and of course, at way higher doses than Im supposed to, Im stealing mums Aprazolam. My supply just doesnt seem to run out. My friend also gets me Prodeine Forte. ( 30 mg codeine, 500mg paracetamol). And in addition to this Im buying 10 mg codeine and paracetamol tabs from chemist a couple of times a week and doing water extraction method. Very soon the codeine looses its buzz so I am doing benzos at the same time as codeine to enhance it. Ive been to almost every pharmacy in my area several times and I think some are starting to get suspicious. <br><br>
Ive also ordered some tramadol from the internet and am expecting its arrival any day now,  ( unless it doesent make it through customs) or maybe the police will deliver it instead.<br><br>
I currently have a very good job, but I know Im headed down a very dangerous path, ( one that killed a guy I know last year from an overdose of pills, and his best friend whos a massive pill head too is a COMPLETE MESS). <br><br>
In some ways I hope the tramadol doesnt turn up. But on the other hand I know Ill be very disappointed if it doesnt. I look at my self and get very depressed, I forgot to mention I take Mirtazepine daily for depression, Here I am doing the drugs I thought Id never go near. They may seem like mild drugs, but soon, once they wear off I get VERY angry at the drop of a hat.<!-- End Body -->
