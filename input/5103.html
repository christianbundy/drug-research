Last night was my first experience with a recreational dose of codeine, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I used the cold water extraction to obtain a clear, pale pink solution from one packet of OTC 'chemadeine' pills, each containing 8mg codeine phosphate and 500mg paracetamol. I had first intended to drink all of this, but on second thoughts I decided to err on the side of caution, mainly because I wasn't certain that all of the paracetamol had been removed. I have OD'ed on paracetamol before, and let me tell you all it's a horrible horrible experience.<br><br>
So at about 10:30pm I mixed half the codeine solution (roughly 100mg codeine phosphate) with some coke and drank. The taste wasn't bad at all, just a slightly bitter edge to the coke. Slight effects were felt within 15 minutes, at which point I lay down on the couch and put Air's 'premieres symptoms' album in the stereo. In another 15 minutes I was definitely feeling the effects of the drug, although at this stage they weren't particularly pleasant: dizziness, heavy body feeling and a slight headache (strange given I'd just eaten half a pack of headache pills). I decided that a nice cool bath would be great (it's the middle of summer down here in australia), so I started filling the bathtub, pouring myself a strong whisky and soda while I waited. Lying back in the bath sipping my drink was when the first real effects of the codeine hit me, suddenly everything seemed just right: the temperature of the water, the position of my body, the soft light from the candles reflecting off the ripples on the watermmmm =) <br><br>
I had a great time just lying there blissing out, although I did notice that it was disturbingly easy to forget to breath. Eventually (at about 11:30 I think) I decided to leave the bath for a minute and go smoke a cone of some reportedly very nice sensi. It look me a long time to actually achieve this though, because I found that wandering about my darkened house was SO SO pleasurable that it was difficult to actually force myself to get out my bong and gear. By this time I was in a seriously great mood, my body was feeling amazing. That whisky was just what I needed.<br><br>
In the end I managed to get myself established on my back porch with bong, lighter and a cone of weed, with a small pinch of salvia 5X on top. I don't smoke weed very often, and that fact combined with the extreme potency of the buds put me on another planet. At first the combination of the weed and the codeine was magical. I went to lay back on the couch and put on another Air album, and it was fantastic. I got this amazing glowing sensation travelling in waves up and down my body, and I found that moving around just made it better. I was experiencing some pretty strong euphoria, coming close to a medium quality pill (but in a different way, much more cozy) and hugging myself felt really really great. After Air finished I put on Infected Mushroom's 'Classical Mushroom' album. This album blows me away even when I'm straight, but on any sort of drug it is completely mind-blowing. Although I didn't feel particularly energetic, I couldn't resist the urge to dance, which was fun but not in the way that dancing on pills is fun. <br><br>
While this was happening, I seemed to be sliding deeper and deeper into a drugged out state. After a while the codeine's effects became only very slightly noticable, and I was left with a very heavy stoned feeling, like when I'm really drunk and I smoke a joint of some good hydro... all I could do was lie down and zone out on the couch journeying deep into the incredible music. I must have fallen asleep at some point because suddenly infected mushroom was over and the last song of the Air cd was playing again. I struggled to my feet and dragged myself to bed, feeling very heavilly drugged out. Laying down on the bed brought back a bit of the cozy euphoria I had had earlier, but I was too tired to fully enjoy it. I looked at the clock: 2:30am (4 hours after drinking the codeine) then quickly fell asleep. Woke up at 9 this morning with a heavy 'stone-over', went back to sleep, woke up again 1 hour later feeling slightly more alert. <br><br>
This was a great experience, although next time I probably won't be so hasty to pull out the bong. The weed seemed to overwhelm the more subtle effects of the codeine. The alcohol went well though, it was a good way to boost a relatively small dose up to a very nice level. I wouldn't have more than one or two drinks though, because even after one drink I got fairly dizzy and unsure on my feet. I was glad to find however that nausea was largely absent, I had only a slight bit after drinking a glass of water way too fast (my mouth was soooo dry.) I still have another 100mg sitting in the fridge, and I have a feeling it wont be long before I'm down at the chemists again... Overall a very positive experience, deliciously cozy and happy... I can imagine a lot of hugging would've happened had there been anyone there to hug. Oh and the paracetamol didn't bother me at all, except maybe for the slight headache at the very start (high doses of paracetamol give me headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was definitely what caused this one).<!-- End Body -->
