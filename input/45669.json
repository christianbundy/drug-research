 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAs an adjunct to daily 100mg Zoloft (Sertraline), I have been experimenting with once- or twice-daily insufflated 2C-E. Antidepressants mostly affect serotonin, so I figured this hallucinogen would be like a boost to the antidepressant I take, and fun too.\r\nI am 34 years old and have extensive (albeit 10 to 15 years ago) experience with LSD and psilocybin, also all manner of pharmaceutical uppers, downers and all-arounders.\r\nI tried around 8mg of this 2C-E once (about 6 weeks before I am writing this), and in my over-30-years-old-long-time-since-I-tripped state, it was tooooo much! I was glad when THAT was over. Decent open-eye visuals on oriental carpets, but I got sweaty and felt really hot and couldn't get to sleep.\r\nI take the drug as an aqueous solution, at 1mg/ml concentration, sniffed in equal parts up each nostril, measured with an oral dosage syringe.\r\nI have noticed that this substance provided me with quite a lift first thing in the morning (around 6am), and aided in preventing that after-lunch urge I almost always have to nap, especially when an additional dose is taken around 11am.  Napping at work was counter-productive, but I could get away with it by closing the door to my office. I don't like to, because I always worry that the boss will find out I'm in there sleeping! Not to mention I don't get any work done while sleeping.  So, small doses of 2C-E help with that.\r\nSome very slight, and sometimes amusing psychedelic effects come from this manner of taking 2C-E. I noticed when riding public transportation to and from work that I feel that I can look at people and judge their mental states better than without being under the influence of 2C-E. Definitely still works some psychic magic at these small doses.\r\nCasual 'water-cooler' conversation at work was enhanced, although sometimes too much. I find myself talking a little to loudly.  I think this is from the slight 'adrenergic push' that the drug can have, as Shulgin writes in PIHKAL.  \r\nPhysical exercise was interesting on these low doses of 2C-E, but sometimes it's a little harder to get motivated to do it (I work out in the morning); I'd rather just do something else. The after-effects of exercise are nicer on 2C-E.\r\nAll kinds of activities of daily living were possible at 1mg-2mg once or twice daily of 2C-E. Interactions at the grocery store were sometimes a little more interesting than without it - ordinary things take on a whimsical air.  Sex, however, was unspectacular, in fact some degree of erectile dysfunction was encountered due to the adrenergic aspect of the drug (at least for me, I don't know about the sexual effects it has on females, or on other males, for that matter).\r\nI think this substance is a good way to add a little 'kick.'  I periodically have stopped for a couple days, to let the rapid tolerance dissapate, and have noticed better effects after this short 'holiday.'\r\nAs the reader may or may not know, this stuff can be totally mind-blowing at higher doses. BE CAREFUL if you intend on doing what I am writing about here.  Walking into work with a head full of 2C-E (or any psychedelic, really) was NOT A GOOD IDEA. I could have end up losing my job or arrested or both. \r\nThis dosage of the substance has absolutely no effect on appetite for or taste of food, and no effect on sleep either (except of course I took it at bedtime).\r\nPeace.\n\n\n"
