I would like share a little bit of my history. My name is Joe, I was recently arrested and spent 2 weeks in jail and am now rather isolated from my friends that I had before hand, now Im moving into a more positive environment and I have stopped the use of drugs just for recration and I am now a inspiring psychonaut rather focusing on the spiritual side of drugs then recreational. I have had a long period of isolation since I am now on house arrest, but please dont think of me as a criminal. I have done a lot of reading on this topic of being a psychonaut and also have some experience, but right now I am in a stage of research, as if I were taking classes and lab experiments in order to become a doctor. <br><br>
So I decided that I was ready to experience my first salvia trip. I have smoked it before in the past but I have not ever done this amount and done it for the experience rather than the fact that others were doing it. So the day before my trip I went to the local head shop and bought salvia 20x and a torch lighter and a small pipe with a short stem. I have made my own home made version of Alex Grey's mindfold. If you don't know what that is, its basically a blindfold were u can open your eyes in and still see total darkness. I was very exited about trying it out for the first time.<br><br>
So the day came were I was going to try it. I made the preparations and removed all items that could cause harm and made sure no one was home that would bother me/ walk in on me. I loaded half a bowl of the salvia and placed the mindfold atop my head.<br><br>
At 10am I took one long deep hit and held it in for about 30sec and then took another just the same. Upon taking my second hit I started to feel a sensation through out my body, I started to feel as if I need to hurry up, there was something pushing me to be in a rush. After the second hit I felt energy flowing out of every inch of my skin. Since I was in a hurry I took a final 3rd hit that I held in for 15 seconds. Immediately I put the mindfold over my eyes. The energy I was feeling through out my body had intensified to the point were everything I touched felt sharp but did not hurt. <br><br>
To my surprise when put on the mindfold and open my eyes I could see my room. I was in the exact same spot as I was, on the top right corner of the bed siting with my legs over the side. Every where I turned to look seemed to blur and now that I can think about it, it felt dreamy. Still in the mode of rushing, I was thinking my mindfold was not on, so I kept trying to adjust it but it was on perfectly. I thought 'How can I still be in my room? Am I looking trough the goggles that I spent so much time making sure I couldn't?.'<br><br>
I heard a voice it was a girls voice she said to me 'Joe, silly you forgot to unplug the phone.' the night before I had read on a salvia handbook online that you should unplug to phone so you don't have to worry about answering the phone or not. So when I heard her, I stood up and went to my phone witch was at the other corner of the bed. I rather stumbled over to the phone in a rush and I had not realized I still had the mindfold on. <br><br>
When I walked over to the phone I looked back to where I was sitting, there was a girl and a boy in there teens sitting were I was. They said to me, 'Hurry up! Someones gunna call!' At this moment I was completely unaware of the fact that these people in my room were not there, I felt as if they had always been there. I felt I was still living a reality and what was happening to me felt like I was still living everyday life. It felt good knowing that I wasn't alone.<br><br>
I bent down to where the phone was and I reached to grab it, but I felt nothing. I could see the phone moving with my eyes when I tried to hold it, but I could not grasp anything. Thats when I realized that my mindfold was on, and took it off and then I realized that those people that were there weren't really there. So then I had my mindfold off, and unplugged the phone, my conscience began to tell me 'Joe, its ok those people are there for a reason, you are safe. Lay down Joe, lay down.' I didn't pay any attention to what I saw when I took the mindfold off because I had come to that realization, so I apologize for not being able to share. <br><br>
So I immediately put my mindfold back on and jumped on my bed and hugged a pillow tightly. Again I saw my room and I saw the two people sitting there on the side with their backs to me. I had completely forgotten that I just realized that they were not there. So I said to them 'Guys Im so alive so real!' they both said in monotone 'We know Joe' as if they had done this all before. All this time I had still felt that feeling of energy pouring out of my body and feeling as if I had to hurry up.<br><br>
This is were I started coming back to reality, the colors seemed do dim it turned into globs of light as if I just looked at the sun and now Im looking away and still see it. So I took off my mindfold and began the process of shaking it out and returning to baseline. I looked at the clock and it was 10:16am, I felt like it was only 2min ago when I took those hits.<br><br>
All in all I was very happy with the outcome when I gave it some thought. I think those people were there to comfort me, since I have had a long period of isolation from friends. I think they new I was feeling lonely and were there to keep me company. Yet I do not understand why my trip took place in my room when I was blindfolded, but I hope I will better understand it when I give it further thought.<br><br>
I really appreciate it if you took the time to read this, thanks a bunch.<!-- End Body -->
