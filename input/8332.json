 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI take an SSRI (citalopram) and carbamazepine (for non-seizure problem).\r\nTwo days after my pleasant, mild 1st try of the tincture (dosage: a mere 2.5 droppers diluted with 1 dropper water, taken and held under tongue, spread out over 15 minutes) I decided to try the same dose undiluted. Again, I waited until it had been 12 hours since I'd taken any medication. I split the dose in half, waiting 5 minutes between doses.\r\nNothing much happened at all--none of the enhanced sound or mild eye-closed visuals. It was noisier in the house with more activity, though I kept quiet and still with my eyes shut. About all I got was a more burned feeling to the mucous membrane on the floor of my mouth.\r\nA couple days later I decided to try again. I had had a little digestive upset in the interim--nothing serious, and it was clearing up.\r\nThis time I stayed off meds for 24 hours, which is physically uncomfortable. I waited until things settled down more in the house. Then I put three droppers, all at once, under the tongue, held 5 minutes, and swallowed.\r\nWithin 5 minutes I was feeling a little woozy and slightly drawn somehow into the upper right side of my head. Perspective seemed just slightly distorted, as though I were looking down a mild wide angle lens. I also started to sweat profusely, even considering the hot weather. Unfortunately I also realized I really should get to bed. I definitely felt rather strange, and given more quiet time to observe things, could probably have made more of this experience.\r\nThe next morning, after a night of vivid realistic dreams, I had a strange feeling of having missed something/someone that had been waiting for me the night before in Salvia-land. So, since I left for work early, I made the stupid decision to take the stuff along with me and do it in the car, while I waited for time to go in. \r\nT+0: Before leaving for work, I took both my meds (citalopram 40mt and carbamazepine 200mg). I still wasn't sure I would go thru with it.\r\nT+20min.: I arrive at work and park in a little-too-obvious place. Then I take 3 droppers under the tongue, turn on some relaxing tunes and shut my eyes. This experience was a lot like the night before, though the distortion and wooziness were somewhat more pronounced. I also sweated a lot and felt a little queasy. Silly person, I thought, to do this while still having a slight touch of tummy trouble, but that was as far as it went--no real sick to the stomach feeling.\r\nA couple of early-bird coworkers happened to walk near by, but I was feeling trippy enough to not really respond.\r\nT+30min.: I made another dumb and potentially dangerous move and decided to go into the building. Though still just slightly woozy, I went to my cube and logged in to do a little surfing. Strange thing, though: I found it very difficult to understand text on the screen, though talking to coworkers wasn't hard at all. I could make out words easily, but combining them and parsing the sentence was a real challenge. This lasted about 3 minutes more. \r\nFinally, just as I was starting to return to this world from the fringes of Salvia-land, I was asked to move my car a short distance. That proved no challenge, and the parking lot was safely rather empty too. But walking back across the flat, level parking lot,  it looked as though I were climbing a slight incline. By the time I got back to my desk I was pretty well back to normal, but still had the 'missed someone' feeling.\r\nI WON'T try this again at work or in any other public place--certainly not one with any significant chance of meeting people.\r\nI also learned that the mucous tissue 'burn' (which isn't all that bad, really) left under the tongue is actually worse, for me, if I spread a multi-dropper dose out rather than take it all at once.\r\nOnly problem then is the huge quantity of saliva produced. Hmm: salvia, saliva. I guess I should have expected it. :-)\r\nI'l try again in a few days under thoroughly controlled circumstances and see if I can do some more real exploring.\n\n\n"
