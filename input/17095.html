I had never done amphetamines in any form before trying crystal meth. I was on a road trip to the Okanagan Valley, B.C. Canada, when I began smoking marijuana and eating mushrooms with a good friend of mine (let's call him Trevor). For two days we smoked marijuana and ate about 4 grams of very powerful mushrooms a day; we smoked approximately 6-7 ounces of very potent weed in two weeks, so I won't really mention it. We were perpetually smoking joints and bowls.<br><br>
I started doing crystal meth on the third night of the bender - I hadn't planned on it at all, but when the opportunity arose, I bought a point to experiment with. I took it back to the house I was staying with, but first I purchased five hits of powerful 'double colorless' acid and dropped one (equal to two blotter hits). <br><br>
It was about midnight, and my friends had all gone to bed. I was sitting up with no TV or radio, and no way to make a tweak pipe, so I loaded a small stone marijuana pipe with a nug of weed and topped it with several large chunks of crystal. I sat back with pipe and lighter, and pulled the flame far over the crystal, just allowing it to melt over the weed, not scorch it. The crystal melted into the weed gradually, soaking it and hardening into a brown-green chunk. Then I smoked the nug, finishing all the meth in it. I exhaled, and stood up, feeling a strong chemical rush through my entire body. My heart began to race, and my breathing sped up. I sat down and smoked alternate bowls of marijuana and speed weed until morning, when I watched the sun rise by myself and waited for my friends to wake up.<br><br>
The third day - Trevor and I smoked some weed, and I dropped another hit of acid. The acid wasn't very pure, but it spun me right out for six or eight hours. I was tweaking hard, feeling invincible and craving more crystal, so we went into the city and bought a five strip of very bright, pure acid, a quarter ounce of mushrooms and then walked out to a house and bought more then a gram of large, glassy, pure crystal. I dropped two more hits of acid that afternoon, ate five grams of the mushrooms, and smoked a huge amount of crystal. I was totally ripped on the meth and going 1000 miles an hour; that night, I sat up smoking it like the night before. For the next two days, I ate the last hit of double colorless and did crystal, with no sleep.<br><br>
This is when things start to get fuzzy. I did some PCP with meth, and was steadily eating a hit of blotter acid every morning and tweaking as hard as I could stand every night and day. Around the eighth or ninth day, I found a HUGE roll of pure MDMA in my backpack that I purchased at a rave and lost afterward. I ate it in the morning, and in a couple of hours I was ripped on meth, MDMA, and acid. This is when I decided it would be a good idea to go to the bank and cash some traveller's checks. Well, unfortunately, they were all twenties, and I had to cash around $700 of them- you do the math. That's writing the date, driver's license number, and signing each one, and just try getting your signature to match the ones you did when you were all messed up at your bank at home. I started signing the checks, and eventually I realized I was scribbling all over them. I screwed up each and every check in front of half the bank staff, while clenching my teeth and literally vibrating with amphetamine energy. After showing them every piece of ID I have, I walked out with the money.<br><br>
I ended up going back to the meth house in a few days with another tweaker, ten years my senior, and buying a big pile of shards of glass. We smoked, ate, and did rails for days. I was also eating acid and drinking some nights, but not sleeping or eating anything at all. It was amazing - time just flew by. At night I would sit down and do meth until I thought my heart would explode, and then watch the hands of the clock fly in circles about the face until the sun burst the clouds with full amphetamine vigor. The second batch of acid I got was extremely bright and fun, as well, and very powerful.<br><br>
The cuticles on my fingers were growing patches of meth, and I had a large sore on one finger and on the palm of one hand. This is maybe 13 or 14 days without food or sleep, running around whichever city I found myself in. My tongue had a dime size patch of meth growing where I had chewed through, and my eyes were crusted with meth all the time. By this time, I was entering the beginning stages of a hellish bout with amphetamine psychosis. I had no feeling in my hands, feet, or face, and I was picking away at my skin all over my arms, shoulders, and legs, and using pins and needles to stab at meth bugs. I had to wear a jacket everywhere because my arms weredisgusting. Everywhere I drew blood, a piece of crystal would form. The next couple days I went harder on the meth, and anything else I could find. By the sixteenth night awake, I was in full open-eye hallucination mode.<br><br>
The sixteenth night was hell on earth. I stayed up doing thick three inch long lines of crystal and screaming at three entities who I could undeniably and clearly see right in front of me. I chased them all over the small house, trashing it as I went, and hurting myself badly too. They wouldn't speak to me, but they'd project things into my mind that would scare the hell out of me. I was living with two other people, and they were locked in their room with a chair and a baseball bat, being totally silent while I was completely freaking out in the living room. I ripped the blinds off the windows, overturned the coffee table, broke a chair, etc. I could see the three macabre goblin-like things straight on - in other words, there was no way to tell they were not there.<br><br>
When the sun came up, I was bleeding all over and my heart was going too fast to count the beats. I rode a bus back to my home and slept for five days without moving. My entire body was on fire with pain and I was sick as hell- my fingers, tongue and jaws were so sore that I tried not to move. When I took a shower, I couldn't feel my face and clawed big pieces of skin out of my cheeks- I hadn't looked in the mirror at all, and I had huge scabs on my face. I lost 20 or 25 pounds in the end. I still have scars on my arms and burns all over my hands. Worst of all, my brain felt permanently screwed.<br><br>
On the fifth day of recovery, I received an invitation to meet a friend in Winnipeg, Manitoba. After forty hours on the bus with no sleep, I was TIRED. I met her at the station and we went straight downtown to buy crystal. We got quite a bit of incredibly good crystal, which we snorted over five days while eating mushrooms, tranquillizers, smoking marijuana, and drinking a lot. When we stopped doing the meth, we were high for two days afterward, riding the bus home.<br><br>
I'm checking into rehab now.<!-- End Body -->
