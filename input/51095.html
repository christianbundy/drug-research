I was a chronic marijuana user for about 20 years. I used to smoke every day starting at 5:30 AM before work, then on my lunch break at work, more on the drive home after work, and a bowl or two in the evening. I had an excellent attendance record, received great performance reviews, and progressed from an entry level position up to a department supervisor in my 10 years at this job. I moved to a different state and quit my job and also quit smoking weed. <br><br>
A friend told me that it takes about 45 days to clean out my system for urine tests for chronic users, so I bought some masking supplements just to be safe. 51 days after I smoked my last bowl, I went for a urine test for a job I was offered. I used the supplement (B vitamins and creatine) and passed and got the job. Three days later I gave in to temptation and bought an eighth of an ounce and smoked it over the next 7 days. <br><br>
One week later I got another offer for a better job and was scheduled to take another drug test. So I drank my other bottle of masking supplement and reported to the lab. I was shocked and certain that I was screwed when they told me it was a hair test. After I got home I searched the internet and found this site and also the company that analyzes the hair and concluded that I had no chance of passing. It was 66 days since I quit and I had just smoked for 7 of the last 13 days before the test. And I hadn't had my hair cut in about 4 months. They claim their test detects use from the last 3 months, and that ingested drugs will show up in hair after 5-7 days, and that once it's in the hair it stays there. Well I am happy to say that I did pass and I love my new job. I know my situation is unique and I was lucky, but I beleive it shows how the testing companies exaggerate their accuracy claims, and falsely stereotype drug users.<!-- End Body -->
