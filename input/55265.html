I was first introduced to Salvia 3 years ago. While I have almost always used a sitter, lately it's become increasingly hard to find someone who isn't stupid and can sit quiet for 10-15 minutes.. I've smoked Salvia extract many times with sitters, and everything was fine. So I decided it was time I could do it alone.<br><br>
The only successful way I have ever used Salvia is in a bong, putting the Salvia by itself on a screen with use of a butane lighter. 1 hit was the usual. So the night I decided to go without a sitter, I took my hit as usual. It was around 1:30 A.M. As I held in the hit, the first effects started taking place. I always feel a bit dazed and lightheaded. Then the crushing feeling sets it. Its like a huge weight is dropped on top of me and I cannot move. Its something Ive gotten used to. As I blew out the hit, consciousness blinked.<br><br>
I was at work, sitting at my desk talking with my co-workers that I usually talked with. I dont remember what we were exactly saying, but it was the normal everyday chitchat. Things looked a little strange, but it was a good representation of the office and my co-workers. While we were talking, the walls and floors disappeared. All that was left was a black void, yet all the people and their desks were still there. Then the desks started changing position and turned into a cone shape, where I was at the top looking down at all of them. Despite the immense change, everyone kept acting like nothing happened. Then I faded back into my living room.<br><br>
Foolishly I decided that was not enough and I needed to take another hit. I dumped out half of the Salvia I had left because I was still a bit shaky from the last time. I loaded it up finally and took the hit. I only held it in for about 30 seconds before the blink came again, and the last conscious act I did was blow out the hit. <br><br>
I realized I was looking down at the ground from a height of about 60 feet. I was on a planet much like Earth, but different. There were no different shades of color, only basic colors themselves. It looked animated, but very real. I noticed then that there were enormous legs and feet underneath me. They were not a part of me, I was a part of it. <br><br>
It was like my vision had become a camera, and it panned out from the being I was in. For anyone who has seen the music video for Another Brick in the Wall by Pink Floyd, the masks the children wear are exactly what these beings faces looked like. They were children as well, approximately 100 feet tall. I felt a great sense of evil in them. Each wore a gray, plaid uniform. After getting sight of the creatures, it was like the one I was in healed a wound in her stomach. Everything was black, and I was inside of her. She had no organs but there were people filling her. I would describe my position as her stomach. She started running back to the school and the sense of evil I felt grew. I kept hearing voices saying they were glad I had become a part of them.<br><br>
Then I decided Id had enough and I needed to try to pull myself out. My vision was flashing between the dim outlines of bodies on the creatures inside and a vision of her and others like her running on the outside. Somehow I managed to force my physical body off of the couch, and felt a massive tearing in the back of my brain. It was as if I ripped myself out of her, and I felt sharp pains in the back of my head. My whole body was tingling and covered in goose bumps. All the while the voices were telling me I was being very bad. They said what I was doing was hurting and killing them. I ran to the bathroom and starting throwing water on my face to try to calm down. It is very true tolerance lowers with usage. I checked the clock and it was 2 A.M. I was out for 20 minutes on the second trip. <br><br>
I have since smoked Salvia, even without a sitter. But I havent taken more than 1 hit.<!-- End Body -->
