 "report": "<p>I obtained 3 150ug blotters of AL-LAD from an online vendor. After extensive reading trying to confirm their legitimacy I decided to take the plunge. I allergy tested a 1/16 of a tab 6 days before this experience with no problems. The tabs had only a very very mild metallic taste. Mindset before the trip was excited and happy, the set was outdoors in a field. </p><p>[T-00:00] Me and S take 75ug of AL-LAD on blotter at 4:20PM</p><p>[T-01:05] Another 75ug swallowed. Very slow definitely LSD feeling come up so far but more relaxed. Very mild OEVs and quite strong CEVs. Clear headed but noticeable psychedelic mindstate sets in.</p><p>[T-1:15] Strong metallic taste in mouth. S agrees he is in same state after trying to explain what LSD feels like to to him as he has not tried it. Both of us are very euphoric.    </p><p>[T-1:27] Both noticing color distortions. Came on quite rapidly. Euphoria climbing. Things are breathing. </p><p>[T-1:48] Small pupil dilation. Come on strong now. Major color enhancement, strong trails. Its so uncanny in similarity to LSD. Text on phone swimming about. </p><p>[T-1:51] S: 'Ive got tons of energy, could kick a football around if I wanted to' The combo with the joint we smoked has increased the euphoria 10 fold.  </p><p>[T-1:55] Everything is goo. 'Like walking on a water bed'</p><p>[T-2:17] Very hard to function normally. S just described acid shivers without knowing what there where previously. I get them infrequently throughout the trip. I saw a cloud flash neon colors. The edges of clouds are fractals that enlessly manifest. </p><p>[T-2:22] Had a woaaah moment  looking at the intense patterns in the sky. </p><p>[T-2:40] Keep getting into little loops. Hahah, there is a little bit of mindfuckery going on. </p><p>[T-2:45] Hard +++. About the same stimulation as a very small amount of MDMA. Speech impediment pretty bad, S just said phils instead of pills and I cracked up. We both have twisted smiles on our faces. </p><p>[T-2:51]  I can feel my body shifting with the music. Full on empathy with every little beat in the music. From dark and menacing to open and euphoric. S just tried to tell me this as I was writing it. Very much in sync. </p><p>[T-3:00] Very bad giggles. Laughing feels good. Even writing giggle makes me smile :)</p><p>                                            </p><p>[T-3:40] Hitting a peak I think. Insane closed eye visuals. Mine and S depth perception fucked, S tried to light a cigarette about 10cm away from the tip of it.      </p><p>  </p><p>[T-4:25] Definitely hit peak and now plateau. Fully submersed in the trip. Will be difficult to update till later. Full lysergamide style trip much closer to LSD than LSA (HBWR/Morning glory seeds)                                        </p><p>We messed about with glowsticks in the dark watching the solid trails and a friend came to say hello. Smoked some weed and chatted for a bit. Still a good +++ but a little more coherent now. </p><p>[T-5:40] S notices a decline in the effects. </p><p>[T-6:10] I notice the visuals start to withdraw.</p><p>[T-6:39] ++ now</p><p>[T-7:00] We smoke a large spliff and the OEVs come back full force. Trails get stronger and a glowstick balanced on a bottle starts to crackle with energy and warp.</p><p>[T-7:30] S goes home. I get in to mine have something to eat and play some xbox still tripping mildly.</p><p>[T-10:00] Fall asleep. </p><p>Day after I feel a bit tired but happy and satisfied. The only differences between this a LSD is the shorter duration, far less body load and easier to handle head trips (which could be seen as benefits.) I'd say 150ug of AL-LAD is the equivalent of 100ug of LSD roughly. Both me and S agree it's a good intro dose but we want to try higher. I plan on taking 225ug next time to see if the trip kicks up a notch. It has put itself alongside what I consider to be proper psychedelics: DMT, mushrooms, mescaline, LSD, 4-HO-MET, DOM and 2C-E with one light/medium dose, DOM did the same ;)   </p>"
