I had smoked some marijuana in the past, and had heard how LSD was a great trip.  I had really wanted to get my hands on some good acid, but with no luck at that age.  As a friend had told me once good acid comes to you, but not when your out Looking for it.  His theory 3 years later proved true.<br><br>
One of my buddys, lets call him Hippy Stan, were good friends in High School.  I was living in Salt Lake City at the time, and was introduced to marijuana.  He had told me of acid, and we both wanted to try it.  I eventually moved and lost contact with him, until I was 19.  Ill keep this as short as possible, but I wound up homeless.  I hitchiked to Salt Lake City for some reason... <br><br>
Before the acid, I had tryed Marijuana, Meth, Weed, Shrooms, DXM, All around the ages of 16-18. One day, I ran into my old friend from High School Hippy Stan!  We hung out, I held down a good job and so forth.  Life was grand.  And I had reached around 6 months of sobriety. Give or take a month or so.<br><br>
One Night after work, I came home and Hippy Stan had welcomed himself into my apartment.  Him and his buddy were sitting on my couch, tripping on acid.  I was very reluctant and decided I was done with drugs.  I was already experiencing some HPPD (permanent trails, static at night) nothing too severe and unbearable though.  Was able to hold down a good job and things were great.<br><br>
Later in the night, a couple other friends came over and were really excited that Stan had gotten some acid.  I will Call them J and L.  Stan was starting to trip fairly heavily and so was his friend.  J and L instantly bought some hits from him.  I was out on the back porch, trying to avoid the whole thing, when L comes out and offers me acid.  At first I felt hell no, Im done with drugs.  She was very persistent and wanted everyone to have a good time.  Eventually I gave in and took the hit.<br><br>
I didnt feel much at for about 1 and a half hours, then it hit hard cause Hippy Stan offered me some chronic.  After a few hits, the acid totally overcame me.  I was seeing psychedelic colors everywhere.  All everyone wanted to do was smoke cigarettes the whole night.  We kept going back and forth to the store for Camels.  I remember feeling like I had a never ending cigarette, and could puff on the thing for hours without it going down. Not to mention also looking at Hippy Stan and seeing him turn into satan himself.<br><br>
That was the most intense part.  I was tripping too hard.  I went to my room to try and find some peace.  I looked at the ceiling dazzled as neon colored women danced round the room.  I never felt too panicky thougout the whole trip, but everything anyone said felt so significant, even if it was just small talk.  I came down, felt a little hung over and fryed out the next day, and called in sick from work, headed over to jamba juice and got something good to drink.<br><br>
Over the next few days-weeks though, I started noticing I was having severe mental problems manifest.  Something that I had never had a problem with in the past.  I hit a deep catatonic depression, dyed my hair out black when usually Im hippy like, and started having problems with what I can only explain as psychosis.  I started boarding myself up in my room and thought constantly of suicide.  I eventually was fired from my job, started having severe social anxiety problems which I still deal with, and wound up back home, living with my parents.  Eventually I was hospitalized.  I felt somewhat angry and bitter but have since let these feelings fade.  When I was hospitalized, they transfered me to outpatient mental health at Region 3.  I also realised that my HPPD had gotten more severe, permanent trails which I see to this day and this is 3 years after the acid.  While talking to a doctor, he says that acid or past drug use may have triggered something latent in my brain.<br><br>
What Im trying to say is, my brain is permanently fractured.  Looking into family history of mental illness, there is bipolar, and depression.  I am not anti-drug, but be careful out there.  This IS something I will live with for the rest of my life.  Would I have become mentally ill if I had not used the acid?  I dont know but I do believe that it could have permanently aggravated what I am living with now.  I can say I have dealt with alot of pain due to HPPD and mental illness that may have been triggered by drugs.  It may have come out later in life, but drugs I do believe permanetly aggravated it.<!-- End Body -->
