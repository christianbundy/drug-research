I tried to smoke calea before, which had no major impact -- apart from putting me into a subtly euphorical mood for a while. I didn't remember any special way of dreaming -- Which changed dramatically when the other day I drank a tea of about 5g of Calea. Truly disgusting bitter taste, it had no noticeable wake-state effects, but I had more dreams (obviously counting only those that I remember), longer dreams, and in one of them I even noticed that I was dreaming. Knowing that, I was able to change the dream scene willingly - which was quite of an experience.<br><br>
Anyways, this is my new recipe:<br><br>
Preparations:<br><br>
Inspired by the alcoholic extract recipe, I poured some 20g of Calea into a mixer to chop the herbs into small pieces. Then I added enough vodka to cover the herbs, and mixed it thoroughly until I had a brown, kind of pasty liquid.<br><br>
Five hours later I was ready to go to sleep, so I poured a small fraction, maybe 1/10 of the goo into a coffee filter (which was mounted into my Melitta filter holder), and I got a jigger (4cl) full of mostly transparent brown herbage liqueur -- looks just like Jaegermeister. Since I was not patient enough to wait for the liquid to pass the filter, I accelerated the process by folding the filter and applying pressure to it.<br><br>
Now 4cl of liqueur goes down the throat in one gulp. You can drink it sugar-free. It's still bitter, but bearable, compared to the lengthy struggle that you may spend with an entire cup of hot Calea tea.<br><br>
Experience:<br><br>
I had chosen not to go out clubbing that friday evening, but rather spend it tranquilo at home. A friend came by to visit, we had a nicely prepared dinner, smoked some grass, talked about whatever, fooling around about visions and wishes for our futures, had a beer or two, watched a movie, well, you get the idea.<br><br>
When he left I prepared my dreaming potion as described above. I was surprised by the effects of only aprox. 2g of Calea. After only 10 to 15 minutes, there was a noticeable feeling of comfort and ease, kind of euphoria, reflecting the pleasant evening I had. I though it was the right mood to smoke some more grass, and so did I.<br><br>
Music was still playing when I laid down in my bed and closed my eyes. I was not in a hurry to sleep knowing that the next day was no work but pure leisure. When I came to rest with eyes closed, I noticed concentric grey pattern movement around my eyes. I didn't feel very sleepy, but I had entered into some semi-concious dreamlike state.<br><br>
Dreamlike thinking is kind of surreal, associative. I'm an occupational programmer, so my patterns of thought tend to be restricted by logical constraints. In a way, it freed my thinking. I thought about the people I work with, about friends, and about my girlfriend who was going to come back from her trip to the far end of the world. <br><br>
As I slowly entered into deeper dreaming state, stories evolved from my thoughts. They felt so consistent with reality, and I was given many answers to doubts about my situation and the people involved. I could say that I've seen the future, or maybe even that I talked to god, if he existed for me -- maybe I rather talked to myself, and my own personal jesus that's inside me. Whatever, however, in that semi-concious state I reached conclusions that are far beyond from what I would have figured out with my limited day-time thinking. No, it's not about those seemingly brilliant ideas that you have when you're completely stoned, which then turn out to be obvious and ridiculous the next day. It really gave me some useful longer-lasting insights. Unfortunately, I have forgotten half of them when I fell asleep finally.<br><br>
The rest of the night was still dreamy, I woke up a few times, and for some dreams it was kind of hard to sort them out from reality, because they were just too realistic. For example, the next day I had to call a friend of mine to ask whether we really had arranged to meet or not. The answer was no, but we decided to make that arrangement anyways, and we met at the same place that was arranged in my dream. I won't enter into more personal details here, but to sum it up, Calea made me see the future, or more precisely one possible future, and therefore it gave me a vision of how to shape my future.<br><br>
Further Recommendations:<br><br>
I've seen that movie Waking Life (2001) by Richard Linklater a few days before, so that gave me some philosophic inspiration for my dream worlds. A great movie for any recreational philospher and dreamer!<!-- End Body -->
