7:30pm - I got these seeds with a bit of skepticism. I've done LSD before, the most being 2 hits at one time, so I though 15 seeds might give me that 2 hit experience. I crushed them up, and downed them with a glass of water. No Problem. I did this on an empty stomach.  I started feeling some nausea about 20 minutes later, not so bad, it only lasted about an hour.<br><br>
9:00pm - I started feeling some effects, I started to wonder if this might just be a placebo effect. as more time would pass I would believe that if this was a placebo effect, it was one hell of a placebo effect.<br><br>
10:00pm - I believe I started to peak around this time, it's a bit sketchy. Watching TV, faced started to have that mutating effect. Colors were definitly more intense. My thoughts began to transend far what I expected. This is were one would begin to realize that they were connected to the spirit world. It became an eye opening experience, especially for my personal life.<br><br>
11:30pm - So it was around this time I decided to take this experience to a whole nother level. I smoked a bowl... This brought a whole new mind alteration. A happy, giggly sort of alteration. It also eased my mind somewhat, not that I was having a bad trip, but maybe borderline. <br><br>
12:30am - I decided to watch the Beastie Boys 'Awesome, I Fuckin' Shot That!' This seemed to last for hours. It was a whole new experience. <br><br>
3:30am - after about this time I'm not sure how long the experience lasted because I went to sleep. But I can assure you that these seeds are no joke.<br>
Next time I think I try going with less seeds.<!-- End Body -->
