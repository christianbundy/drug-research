My name is mike, Ive had allot of expiriences with mind altering substances thus including, cannabis,ecstacy,heroin,various pharmaceutical's (xanex,adderal, oxys...etc), lsd, coke, and the list goes on but my memory is shot.<br><br>
I get a text from my dealer telling me he's got some kitty (ketamine) for 40$ a half gram. So being as adventures as I am and with just one day before the new years I decided to buy it, along with 3 hits of really good LSD. Ive done K before this time but it was in a extreamly small dose and I felt the minor effects of it and I liked it.<br><br>
So I called up my friend  T and told him I had all this shit and he was down to get fucked up with me that night. So we get to T's dads house at first I honestly was not sure on how much to pour out so I poured out a little, let T snort his then I did mine, but then for some reason I just dumped the whole bag out and just said fuck it. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. after me and T snorted the entire bag of K we both dropped one hit of LSD. A this point all I remember was me sitting on the couch next to T mumbling words and yelling WHERE THE FUCK AM I!!<br><br>
Now from what I remember I had the most tunnel vision I ever expirenced in my life I can relate it to moxy if u guys know what that is..( foxy moxy anyone??..heh) but anyways time felt like it last for hours and hours on end I was laying on the couch yelling random incoherent things at some of my friends, one of my best buddy's girlfriends was there baby sitting us and I was asking her to fuck like a million times, at this point my friend big T came down  to see what the fuck was going on. I was surrounded by faces, they looked stretched out out, and extreamly bubbly, everything in my world was bubbly, I had absolutely no control of my body and apparently T's father came down and I started swinging my fists at him and I was calling one of my best friends rude names, like fuck you your a dick go die in hell...shit like that. I was such a fucking wreck I had to have my friends pull my pants up because they came down some how...it was the most embarrassing thing I ever experienced <br><br>
I was fucked up to the maximum, my original plan was to do all of this K on new years but that would've been bad..so good thing I got it over with...how did I get home??<br><br>
T, the one I did this K with was driving my car while M, my friends girl was driving behind us to make sure were safe...when sitting in the car. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> I felt like I was in a fucking space ship..EVERYTHING was strecthed out swirling in circles.. I could see every fucking detail of the entire world  my hands looked like mickey mouse and I thought I was going to die by the end of this night because it would never end.<br><br>
We got to my apartment complex, my friend M helped me walk up to my door and opened it for me and I got to my house..no one was home so I went straight to bed.. I was so fucked up I just could not believe it.<br><br>
This was the most intense ketamine trip Ive ever expirenced...I almost lost all of my friends, punched my friends dad in the face while his 8 year old brother was there and all in all I just lost sense of everything I ever knew...<br><br>
I dont think Im going to do Ketamine for a very long time after that day....today is new years eve. 2012 is coming very shortly and Im gonna go get drunk.. HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE...just be safe and know your dosebecause I was fucking stupid.<!-- End Body -->
