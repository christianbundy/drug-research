Semen of the Sun: Unlocking the worlds of Epena<br><br>
Oh my friend, have I got something to tell you. Last night as I was reading my copy of Schulte's 'The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens' my interest in Epena grew greatly. I have been working with various Virola species and preperations for the past 3 years with no success. I had acquired some fine powder which was said to be filtered virola resin. This stock floated around several capable individuals and finally ended up in my hands. After applying various preperation methods to it, I too found it to be most likely powdered bark. I'm not fond of unscroupulus individuals as the natives assured us that this was infact the pure resin.<br><br>
One day a friend of mine had obtained a small quantity of the pure resin and was kind enough to send two grams my way. This beautiful sticky gum is reddish brown in color and bubbles up quickly when heated, producing a pleasant tasting smoke, which did not seem to have any psychoactivity. I had smoked it a few times but did not believe it to be psychoactive. So I took a small glass evaporation dish then took a pinch of the resin, about the size of a pea, and placed it in the middle of the dish. Heat was gently applied to the glass with a lighter from underneath and the resin slowly boiled and bubbled up. No smoke was produced. The resin bubbled up and filled with air. I took a knife and pressed into the resin which quickly became hard. Using the knife, I began chopping the toasted resin up into a fine powder.<br><br>
I then poured it out onto my copy of 'The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens', formed a small line and turned off the television. My wife walked in as I was insufflating the semen of the sun. I gave her a quick heads up that I may be travelling to another world for awhile. Being use to this sort of thing, she gave me a confident nod and bid me farewell as I set off on the voyage.<br><br>
At first, there was no pain in my sinuses but that was to come soon. After about one minute 15 seconds the strong tryptamine feeling was felt pulsing up and down my spine and into my brain. I couldn't help but arch my back and neck behind me and stare up at the ceiling. There was nothing that I would call a hallucination but my visual field seemed to be trying to form some strange patterns, although couldn't quite make out what I was seeing. The intensity of that pineal feeling grew greatly and soon every atom within my body began to pulsate with the energy of epena.<br><br>
I looked over at my wife, eyes rolling back in my head, and asked her how much time has passed. Only about one minute thirty seconds had passed. This level of intensity dominated the experience for probably another 5 minutes. Soon the pain began. My sinuses had just been raped and my face was paying for it. I spent the rest of the night, from here on out until I fell asleep, trying to clear out my sinuses by snorting water and making some strange noises I never knew I was capable of making. After about 10 minutes the effects of the snuff had completely subsided beside the intense pain. When it was over I was certain that I had tasted of Epena. <br><br>
The natives would combine it with various admixtures such as Justicia leaves or Elizabetha bark ash but they also used it alone. I may possibly try adding a bit of ash or Calcium oxide next time. Appearantly 3-6 Coffee Bean sized pellets may also be swallowed to produce a 2 hour experience which comes on within about 5 minutes, but I do not have the quantity to attempt this.<!-- End Body -->
