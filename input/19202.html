It's been a long day, I've had sinus problems all day, and been somewhat zonked from a combination of not not feeling good and taking sinus medicine.  Around 11:00 I had taken a Tavist-D which was making me feel pretty drained.<br><br>
2:00 Mix 5 ml of GVL solution into a shot glass of water.  I have never tried GHB or GVL.  Because my insomnia has been getting steadily worse over the past year, I'm hoping that this will be an effective and legal sleep aid.<br><br>
2:05 Make first attempt to drink the foul stuff.  Take half the shot then chase with coke.  Tastes like moonshine that has been allowed to dissolve a plastic container.  The aftertaste is worse.  The sweet coke smothers the taste for a minute, only for it to emerge more prevalent than before.<br><br>
2:10 Finally managed to force myself to drink the rest.  Throat tried to close up to prevent me from swallowing this.<br><br>
2:20 Rash/flushing that spreads out over my body.  Feels and appears very similar to a Vitamin B6 overdose.<br><br>
2:25 Flushing gone<br><br>
2:30 Convinced I 'feel something.' Light-headed, moderate relaxation.  A friend who has tried GVL before tells me it is probably placebo.<br><br>
2:45 Not really feeling anything at this point, that can't easily be attributed to prior medication, etc.  <br><br>
Conclusion: A waste of time.  Tasted absolutely horrible, no discernible effect.  Diphenhydramine is definitely a superior sleep aid, as at this point (3:30) I'm more awake than when I dosed.  Glad that I got a trial dose before purchasing.<!-- End Body -->
