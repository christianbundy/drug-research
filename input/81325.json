 "report": "<p>Before I begin I would firstly like to state that I am 19 years old and up until mid-2009 I had never tried any entheogenics. I began smoking cannabis in 2007 and up until Dec '08 I tried my first entactogen (MDMA). Up until now I have experimented with a few over-the-counter drugs and have been researching the clinical health of the mental states of consciousness and the effects of psychedelic drugs. Here we go...</p><p>It was a Saturday night and I was hanging out with my good mates N and D. The night began at approximately 8:30. We were all having a party at a good friend's house and everybody was having a great time partying on</p><p>8:45 PM: I ingested half a E and washed it down with a beer or two, socializing was good fun and I was in a collective mind state, (bear in mind I knew about 5 or 6 people out of the 13 or so people there) at this point in time I was just dancing away to the music that was playing.</p><p>8:56 PM: I am still waiting for the effects to kick in, we have now smoked all the cigarettes we had (I dont advise anyone do this when effects are in motion). I drove down to the nearest service station to stock up on supplies, at this point no effects are present.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] </p><p>9:15 PM: back at the party I am starting to feel a slight shift in my state. No major effects yet just, mild mydriasis and a heightened motivation to dance!</p><p>9:20 PM: I decide to take the other half of the E to regulate a sigma effect. My friend N takes 1 blotter of LSD. By this time I feel the effects begin to increase and my mood is beginning to elevate.</p><p>9:35 PM: a taxi arrives and we jump in and drive to another party for our friends 21st birthday. By now I am in love with everyone and my emotions are so strong followed with the pulsating charge. Mentally I am beginning to see a change in perception, my friends are beginning to feel it also.</p><p>9:50 PM: we arrive at the party and by this stage I have reached my first plateau. Socializing has never been easier. In my life I have grown up with very low self-esteem. Any of these feelings are completely eradicated from my mind. I was in total control. Now is the time when I ingested half a tab of blotter LSD.</p><p>10:20 PM: I can feel the LSD beginning to take its hold by this point I am in a state of bliss and my visual field is taking on its effects. N and I stand together and he says to me that we should go back to Ds house cuz we set up his back shed with couches, bongs, and a fireplace. I thought that sounded like a great idea for I wanted to go somewhere and trip out and absorb as much as I could out of the night. As I looked down at the gravel near my feet I stared for approx 15  20 seconds to see very mild movement. Mentally I was relaxed but slightly anxious. I have had LSD a few times now and I have become comfortable with the effects of it. N and I decide to go for a walk and check out the playground that was 50 meters or so away from the party.</p><p>10:30 PM: We approach the park and the light is very dim due to the bushy surroundings and lack of street lights. As I looked at the sand I remember having unusual sensations rush through my body, only mild but still very intriguing. We decide to walk back to the party and gather our friends and try making a move. I feel mild effects from the LSD and the E has taken its full effect. I by this stage am incredibly sociable and get caught up in conversations on how good acid is ha-ha. By this stage according to the Shulgin rating scale I was having a plus-1 (+) experience.</p><p>10:40 PM: N approaches me and asked me when I wanted to take the other half. I was up for it so we both walked off again and took our other half, still feeling amazing from the E and I felt a deep connection to my friends and shared with them my feelings. I had no shame and deep things didnt seem to bother me in the telling of.</p><p>11:00 PM: Ds younger brother came and picked us up from the party. Here is where it started to get interesting. Up until now I was quite simply euphoric and socializing with people I seen. As we were driving I noticed a shift in perception. It felt to me like I had just started coming up: no major effects present, just a comfortable buzz and general conversation about how everyones night is coming along.</p><p>11:40 PM: we arrive at Ds house out in the bush: approximately 60 square meter shed with a sliding door tin walls and roof, steel truss structure with a fire place on the north wall situated in the middle of the shed, with 3 couches and a table. At this stage I was starting to wonder as to whether or not I would feel much of the blotter. I was still raging from the pill. I thought about how I was feeling and felt a strange sensation come over me. Up until now I was paying little attention to my visual field and was more or less captivated by my thoughts. It wasnt until I realized that I was not talking to anyone that I looked up at N who was sitting next to me. I then found that I was beginning to zone pretty hard. His face contorted and his eyes were rotating in circles! I fell into a trance and the longer I looked at him the more distorted he became. I was drawn into it; I looked into his eyes and then it hit me!!! I had moved into a stage 2 experience (++ experience).</p><p>I saw myself in his eyes and as I was sitting there in awe. I flinched and felt a powerful cathexis charge rush over me. Mydriasis was in full effect now. I felt an intense connection with my friends overcome me and that's when my depth perception and clarity of thought elevated to a new level that I have never been before. D then jumped on his pelvic exercising apparatus and began to do pelvic thrusts. I cant remember laughing so hard in my life prior to this event. He then fell off it onto the floor face first laughing out of control. My visual field was totally encompassed by the effects. By now I had moved into the next wave. Everything in my vision was strobing and morphing to unusual designs. I decide to take another half a tab for I had never felt this in control. After sticking it under my tongue we decide to smoke some of the high grade hydroponic marijuana that we had sitting in the bowl. As I pulled the cone I looked at the cone piece and once I had pulled it I sat back and felt my head swelling with an intense euphoria. About 10 seconds later it hit me full force and I was tripping out max!</p><p>From here on I cant for the life of me remember time and it's span. From here on I will describe how I moved from my stage 2 experience to the stage 3 (+++ experience) and here is where the meat of my experience pours forth.</p><p>I was sitting in my chair having bongs and losing myself in the experience when I looked up towards the wall in front of me and could see vivid movement of nuts and bolts scaling up and down the wall. I drew my gaze to the other side of the shed to see that my vision was picture framing and every inch of eye movement would disrupt what was there. By this stage nothing was staying still. Amongst all this chaos I had found deep, deep clarity and an overwhelming sense of power shot through me like a cannon. I could feel the extreme dilation of my pupils. I looked around the room as if I was a god and could create anything with my mind.</p><p>I went outside of the shed to get some fresh air for the shed was completely tripping me out. As I went outside I looked at the ground to see morphing geometrical shapes. This was not all too exciting as the poor levels of light under the sky. Then I looked up and to my amazement the moon had the most vibrant blue and purple aura around it and was beginning to go banana shaped. The stars were infinitely bright and were constantly changing to form constellations. The sky hollowed out, tunneling towards the moon. At this point I felt a presence that I had not felt up until this point. I was in a complete state of mental control: I felt invincible, I thought some very profound thoughts and delved into my psyche, I was prepared for anything. I was dwelling upon the thought of having a bad trip and how it is a concept that freaks the fuck out of anyone to the point where they would never want to go near this substance. I have done highly extensive research on entheogenic drugs and how they all target the 5-HT receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors. I was well aware of how LSD mimics serotonin and I had a positive mind set accepting that once I confront a bad trip I will most likely learn the most about myself in that time for my deep subconscious would be revealed. Instantly after I thought this I felt the most profound sensation of spiritual awareness and was immersed in the knowledge that poured out of my inner-most thoughts. Indeed my in-depth knowledge saved me in this situation for I was temporally insane.</p><p>I returned to the shed and my friends were indeed tripping out just as much as I was. The thing about our experience together is that my friends and I are religiously interested in the human psyche and all the aspects of psychology. I have read books on psychology of human relationships and all of my knowledge seemed to suddenly emerge with a depth and clarity that I have never perceived in my entire life. I had activated the universal mind. Anything I thought about would set off a cathexis charge (very strong energetic charge given of before emotion is felt). I walked down the path towards the house to get a drink. As I looked down I noticed everything looked like Lego: the weeds and grass had a 2D shape and colours would fluctuate through the strains of grass. I was amazed as to how my entire world had changed and my perception of reality was at a cosmic level of understanding yet at the same time I was completely and utterly hypnotized by the bright patterns that had taken over my visual field.</p><p>As I returned to the shed my friends had reached the same level as I had and were smoking more bongs and falling deeper and deeper into themselves. Now is when we decided to have nangs. D was up first. He inhaled the nitrous and covered his face with a blanket to see the visuals. About 15 seconds later he cried out with a fright what the fuck Im a camel where am I are get me out of here!!! N was quick to pull the sheet from over his eyes and assured him where he was and who he was. This was a minor incident that had no major negative after effects, it came around to my turn for a nang. I inhaled the gas and then I pulled the sheets over my eyes. All I could see was blackness with a small static blur in the center of my eyes. As the strobing from the nang took full force the buzz encompassed my whole vision and I felt a new definition of pain. Whether or not it was pain I would never know I can just clearly remember thinking those exact words. I pulled the sheet away from my eyes to see that my whole world was still moving in front of my eyes. As I looked up I felt that I was telepathically connecting to my friends and the longer I sat there the deeper into my trance I went. As I looked at N everything behind him began to take on multilayer vision with a slightly transparent double of what I was actually seeing. The room was overcome by bright green flickering haze and once again I could see my face in the place of my friends head. I had a crazy epiphany that I was on the verge of death but the thought of it didn't bother me in the least. I was so at one with myself that I had felt completely detached from my body and felt that what was in my head was the only thing keeping me in my body.</p><p>I felt that I was at one with everyone in the room, we had a powerful connection and it brought us all together. I sat there flooded with thoughts of wisdom and a clear retrospective view on where my life was heading. I realized that I had been kidding myself all along thinking that I had my shit together. Then it all made sense I was simply passing the time and wasting my potential to sow wisdom and knowledge to those who need it.</p><p>I had reached a critical point now. I was at war with myself and felt feelings that I had not felt since before puberty. I felt a strong feeling of sympathy towards my family and for the first time in my life I had truly grasped just how much suffering I had endured and put my family through. I felt strong love and friendship towards everyone in the room. I was in a Zen state and I didn't want to leave it.</p><p>It wasnt until now that I felt a powerful sensation that I had never felt before in my life. I could hear what my mate was saying in spite of no lip movement from him. I had awakened my ESP. The most bizarre part was when I saw his face, whatever expression he had, I felt. ESP is not what everyone thinks it to be. I gained insight into the situation and realized that time was relative and can be bent to our will. Minutes felt like hours and the entire night lasted an eternity.</p><p>N was in wonderland and D was in a state of fluctuating emotions and thought patterns. There was a tinge of perplexity accompanied by strong emotional charges that kept persisting throughout the lot of us. D decided to switch the light out to see how the visuals would be. He flicked the lighter on and to my amazement I saw what looked like two mirrors facing each other. The light traced off in front of my eyes with at least 100 repetitions. This truly blew me away. I had never seen full tracers up until now.</p><p>I had entered a new dimension. I had become fully lucid and saw vivid shapes lined with a green and yellow neon aura. I looked at my hand to see it age 5 lifetimes in colour and texture. I noticed small octagon shapes emerge with a brightness that astonished me. Suddenly my entire hand was covered in this green glowing pattern and my hand became a 3D pixelated structure resembling the first stages of 3D animation. Skin colour was not there and I became a hollow frame off an ethereal existence. I was complete. I became enamored in knowledge and I could grasp anything that I could conjure up.</p><p>As the morning crept in, light began to bring me back slowly to reality. After it was all over I was in a total state of serenity I carried out the rest of my day with ease and finished off the night with the best sleep I have had in a long time. I plan to do this again. LSD is truly a mind blowing instrument into the human subconscious and I advise anyone who is interested in self-development and personal growth to try this but make sure the set and setting are comfortable and relaxed for this aspect of the trip is crucial in the outcome of a trip. Being somewhere not in your control can prove disastrous. Remember that you can do anything you put your mind to, control your thoughts and emotions for in a situation like this - they can be your worst enemy.</p><p>Peace!!!</p>"
