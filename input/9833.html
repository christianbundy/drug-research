I smoked the half joint slowly. About the third toke I always start coughing uncontrollably. I find it helps to sip on iced water in between. I love the first draw the fragrance and the taste of the pot.<br><br>
I laid on the sofa and listened to Vivaldi's four seasons. I couldn't believe how the music was filling my head and running down to my toes. My head was filled with images wrought by the music. I was in a garden filled with flowers of every colour. I was there reaching out to them, in the bright sun, marvelling at the green grass. I wanted to stay in the garden forever. I felt so relaxed, so peaceful. There was nothing else. No everyday worries. I looked at myself out of the garden. I laughed at me, laying there on the sofa.<br><br>
I walked along looking up at trees moving softly in the breeze. The music was playing on. The trees were trembling to Vivaldi's violin. I saw a large mushroom and sitting on the cap was a plump, laughing, fairy child.<br><br>
Then I was out of the garden, spinning in a coloured vortex. The music took over and I was in a giant cathedral looking up between vast gothic arches. The stone walls and floor made me shiver, so I pulled a blanket over myself. I keep it right there on the sofa, as I often feel chilled when I'm high. Then I was sailing out the stained glass windows, trailing the red, yellows and blues behind me in a vapour trail. I floated to the moon and dripped tears onto the world beneath.<!-- End Body -->
