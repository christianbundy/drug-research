5:50am I smoked the Wild Lettuce extract, first using hot knifing but I figured out it didn't melt and I could smoke it in my pipe.<br><br>
6:00am Feeling hardly anything, so made 2 lines, 1g each and snorted them. There was a clearing of my sinuses and a very noticable burn.<br><br>
6:01am There's a prominent sensation on the right side of my face (I only snorted 1 line in my right sinus). I'm snorting the other line.<br><br>
6:10am The 'peak' (if there is one) is now. The drug is there, I can feel it, but it's on the very backline of my brain. I feel horny, but depressed (a little). I was excited about smoking/snorting the herb, cuz I've been extracting it during the last 8 hours It's like having a good trip of mushrooms, and that slowly going into a bad trip.<br><br>
6:20am I try to masturbate (boredom), but I'm not really getting a hard one, or even having some sexual interests. My thoughts are on nothing particular, but it's not on sex.<br><br>
6:30am Watching Pinky &amp; The Brain, and by the time I watched 2 episodes, I realise I didn't have to translate the English in my Dutch, I just understood the English like it was my first language (Dutch is my first).<br><br>
7:20   Ate some chocolate pudding. I'm now sober (did the food help?).<br><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
In conclusion: I felt sleepy, bit horny at the start (but when I tried, that went away very quickly), at the start a bit depressed. My short term memory was basically FUCKED. When I wrote the start of this report I was still on W. Lettuce, and all the time I think of writing something down, then I write it down and have to think real hard to remember some word I wanted to write down. To tell you the truth, I feel sleepy and relaxed, but I really don't want to sleep.<br><br>
This is like Opium, yeah. It has the unmotivational side effect, but that's the only thing. On Opium I'm unmotivated, but because I'm so content and happy.<!-- End Body -->
