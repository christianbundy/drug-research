<font size="4"><b><a name="preface">PREFACE</a></b></font><br><br>

I first visited with LAZAR at his hillside home 
overlooking the city in the summer of 1980. I had heard of this
chemist for a couple of years and was intrigued by the work
he was doing with synthetic neurotransmitters and the
possibilities which they presented. It sounded to me that he
had come up with a real "smartpill" that actually worked. I
had managed to meet him at a party on one of his rare forays
from his home. It was not so much that he was a recluse, it
was just so great at home that going out was sort of a
downer.<br><br>

I climbed the steps from the parking area where several
cars were parked, nothing flashy just the run of the mill from
Detroit and Tokyo. I rang the bell and waited. Presently
from the rear of the house ambled a middle aged, well
tanned and muscled LAZAR wearing nothing but a towel
around his middle. After an exchange of greeting he led me
through the house to a beautiful and secluded pool where a
few lovely ladies and their consorts were enjoying
themselves in the pool totally nude. I was introduced around
feeling really out of place with all my clothes on. Sensing
this my host directed me to large bedroom and said I could
leave my clothes there. A large, round waterbed held several
small stacks of clothes. Another stack of clothes was on the
floor with the shoes. I undressed, made a pile of my clothes,
and went out to join the others. As I stepped out onto the
patio surrounding the pool, I was greatly relieved that no one
paid any attention to me or stared, other than a glance to
acknowledge my presence.<br><br>

With a slight movement of his head, LAZAR motioned
me to a deck chair next to him. "Welcome to the Lazy Lizard
School of Hedonism," he said while smiling, "This is an
informal, unstructured, no load happening for a number of
my friends and acquaintances who live a more frantic or
hectic life than I do. This allows them to relax and unwind
in a pleasant setting and recharge their batteries so to
speak. Works rather well--most are workers at mundane
jobs or graduate students at the U. doing mundane things."<br><br>

I asked LAZAR if this was his first or last name. He said
that it was the only name and the change was made when he
was staying on Maui for a while. He had attended a Sacred
Fire Ceremony and during that time the opportunity
presented itself to take on a new name of his own choosing.
So he selected LAZAR since he had been called "the Lizard"
around the pool for some time. It was part of a general plan
to simplify his life from a bunch of extraneous stuff. He
wanted to focus his energies in a more efficient manner. We
exchanged bits of our respective backgrounds and I asked
him how he had become interested in the "smart pills". This
name for these compounds is not correct but it is much
shorter than the title for this writing. (There will be more on
what these chemicals do and some suppositions on how they
act in the human body and neurological system.) He said he
had been doing some library reference work and he ran
across a reference to a patent application. The title of the
abstract was: Compounds for improving the capacity for
intellectual work of mammals.(<a href="#ref2">2</a>) This grabbed his
attention
right away and he realized that humans could benefit most
from such a development.<br><br>

Consulting the Author Index of Chemical Abstracts he
found numerous articles by the same man and most of the
articles dealt with psychoactive phenethylamines. Abandoning 
all other pursuits for the next few days he searched
the literature for all of the similar compounds that could be
found. Many were found in obscure foreign journals and it
took some time to round them up, as Xerox copies had to be
obtained through inter-library loans.<br><br>

The first "smart pill" compound made was 2CD or 4-Methyl-2,5
Dimethoxy-phenethylamine
hydrochloride (<a href="#ref3">3</a>,<a href="#ref4">4</a>)
and was tested at several dosage levels. The higher ranges
from 10 to 20 milligrams (mg) produced a state of mild
intoxication with increased sensory enhancement, but with
no hallucinogenisis. Lower levels, from 5 to 10 mg
produced calm states wherein one could read, study, or listen
with excelled concentration and as we found out later with
much better than normal retention. Sensitivity to this
compound varied among the test subjects some finding that
5 mg (or even less) worked just fine for them and others
stated that this dosage was not effective. So every one
worked out their particular level. In those subjects who had
a greater sensitivity to this compound, laughter, hilarity, and
giggling interfered with studying or other learning pursuits.
During this time of initial exploration it was noted that
these materials worked best on individuals who were
inclined to be serious about their study habits. When used
by persons who tended to be less than studious when
confronted with a book or lessons, they would think shortly
of how much more fun it would be if they were playing
catch, riding a motorcycle, drinking beer or just generally
goofing off. In these cases the smart pills were of no
advantage and probably were a hindrance to the overall
process of learning.<br><br>

Another effect which was noted, after perhaps two
months of usage, was that most subjects began making major
changes in their lives. Since many were students at the local
universities some changed their majors, transferred to a
better school, left the area to places where they felt there was
more opportunity, quit the job they had for a better one, got
in a meaningful relationship, etc. A few said it should be
called "courage", because it seemed to give them the needed
push to move onward. Nearly all who were students reported
better grades with less effort. Exams were no longer an
anathema. Many reported that they were no longer bitchy
when studying for finals.<br><br><hr>
<br><font size="4"><b><a name="casehistories">CASE HISTORIES OF SMART PILL USAGE
2CD</a></b></font><br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Carl1">* CARL: Graduate student in chemistry on
Ph.D. track.</a></b></font>
<br><br>

Having completed all of the required course work, he
still needed to fulfill his language requirement. His adviser
informed him that if he could pass the fourth semester of
German with a "C" or better and pass the departmental
written translating test, his language requirement would be
fulfilled. He enrolled in the fourth semester of German
without taking the first three as the department assumed he
would. He talked to LAZAR about two weeks before the end
of the semester and said he was afraid he would not pass the
German course. He asked LAZAR if he had any suggestions,
since he had seen him in the library pouring over some of the
voluminous German chemical literature. LAZAR said he
had some "smart pills" which might help. Carl said he
would take them; he sounded rather desperate. He said he
had planned to study or cram for the final for a full week of
seven days and for eight to ten hours per day. So LAZAR
said he would give him one smart pill for each day of study
and one for the final if he thought it was necessary. LAZAR
also told him that he had a set of index cards with the most
used Chemical German technical terms on them. He would
loan them to Carl to copy, not with a Xerox machine, but by
hand while under the influence of a smart pill. A few days
after the final exam Carl excitedly reported to LAZAR that
he had passed the fourth semester German exam with a "C"
and that during the test when he needed a word it was right
there. He also said that he did not use a smart pill for the
final exam indicating that the learning is not state
dependent. That is, you do not need to be in the same
slightly altered state when retrieving the information as
when learning it. About a month later Carl and LAZAR
crossed paths in the chemistry library and Carl told him that
he had passed the Departmental German translating test and
that he only had to finish his research and dissertation to
graduate. Carl left for a few moments and on returning
handed LAZAR his index cards and a very nicely done
booklet with lettered index tabs and inside was a Xerox copy
of a hand copied short dictionary of German chemical terms.
Carl stated that he was translating German regularly and
found it most useful for his work.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="John1">2CD<br>
* John: Graduate student in chemistry on Ph.D. track.</a></b></font><br><br>

Having heard of the smart pills from Carl, John wanted
to use some for his German studies. He was already auditing
some of the first semesters and when he took the fourth
semester he used smart pills for pre-exam studies and
received an "A" in the course. He got a copy of Carl's short
dictionary of German chemical terms and completed his
language requirements. John felt that the use of smart pills
was of great value in studying for the German and also for
the cumulative exams which cover all of the chemistry
which the professors feel the student should know.
However, after that time, the Chemistry Department decided
to plug the loophole and required students to take all four
semesters of German.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Bea1">2CD<br>

She fully enjoyed music and toyed around with
composing for her own pleasure. One evening while on a
smart pill, she wanted to hear a certain song by one of the
popular artists. She went over to the large shelf of LPs, and
without even looking, pulled out the one she wanted. She
started it playing and went over to the piano and played right
along with the music. Since she could only play by sight
reading sheet music prior to this event she was quite
surprised. She played several other pieces by ear that same
evening and had no problem playing by ear from then on.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Steven1">2CD<br>

I ingested 10 mg before approaching a new project. At
a conference last year an overseas friend and I co-chaired a
symposium. It received such positive feedback that she
suggested we co-edit a book on the topic. So my project was
to write a proposal to send to prospective publishers. The
writing was surprisingly fluid. I had innovative ideas that I
had not conceptualized previously. I worked on my word
processor, and the next day found that I had to do very little
editing before sending the book proposal to four publishers,
one of whom recently accepted it. Good material for
creative thinking and writing.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="lazar1">2CD<br>

He had heard of a visiting lecture series on "Photo
Chemistry" at one of the universities and thought that it
might have some applicationin his synthetic chemical work.
He went to the first lecture in the morning and found that the
content was way over his head and that his comprehension
was not very good. On the lunch break he felt that a smart
pill would be worthwhile trying for the afternoon lecture.
He took 10 mg, a little ahead of time, so that it would be
working when the lecture started. The lecturer began with a
recap of the morning lecture for those who may have missed
it. LAZAR then understood what had been said in the
morning and also understood the content of the afternoon
lecture. Occasionally the lecturer would be standing at the
black board, chalk in hand, and would be groping for the
correct word. LAZAR knew what the word was before it
was spoken and these were words which were not in his
common vocabulary. He finished the two day series with a
good understanding of the principles and techniques
involved in this area of chemistry. Unfortunately it didn't
seem to be useful for his work. What was interesting was
the possibility that he was tuning into the lecturer's thoughts,
as the latter was groping for the correct word, and somehow,
LAZAR knew what the word was before it was uttered.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Meg1">2CD<br>

She felt that the 10 mg regular starting dose was too
much for studying, and seemed to act as a intensifier of
sexual sensations. While making love on the material she
felt wonderfully sexy and had very intense orgasms. One
half a tablet (5 mg) was just about right on most occasions
for reading and studying. She reported a pleasant,
controlled energy and studied because she felt like it and
had very good results from the effort. A follow up
discussion ten years later disclosed that she felt the use of
2CD had increased the acuity of her hearing and that now
ten years later there was no diminishing in that effect. For
most of Meg's studies she used 2CD-DiEt, a compound
which had fewer distracting components to it for her
particular physiology (more on her use of this compound
later under its own listing).<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Arn1">2CD<br>

He was learning the five string banjo to expand his
repertoire of instruments played. He would listen to records 
of the best five string banjo players and would play along
with them. When he got to the very difficult parts he would
"lose it", and have to start over. He just could not seem to
get past the difficult parts. Arn was telling his problem to
LAZAR, who said, "Take this pill now and go right home
and do your play-along thing with your banjo." He reported
as follows the next day:<br><br>

I went home and put on a record and
tuned up my banjo to the record. I had never gotten it tone
perfect before, but I got it exactly on. I then put the needle
back to the start and proceeded to play along with it. After a
few moments I realized that I was playing better than ever
before. When I got to the difficult parts I played right along
with them, not behind or ahead, it was right on. When that
side was done I turned it overand played the other side, then
another record and another. I played all night into the wee
small hours of the morning. I played with authority and I
could do it the afterwards without the 2CD.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Max1">2CD<br>

I am a research futurist who is particularly interested in
visioning of preferred futures and how best to achieve them.
As a practitioner of yoga and various psycho technologies for
enhancing creativity and intuition, I tend to be quite aware of
inner states that enhance or diminish productivity when
writing.<br><br>

I took 10 mg of 2CD as an experiential experiment
when preparing to write a grant proposal. The proposal
focused on a new way to do what futurists call "STEEP
Scanning": the identification of Social, Technological, Economic,
Ecological, Political patterns, trends and issues of
importance, and the translation of these factors into opportunities
and threats useful for decision makers. The problem
I wanted help with was this: How to show in graphical as
well as verbal terms the dynamic systems involved.
As the 2CD took effect (about 25 minutes, although a
subtle energy shift occurred in my body almost immediately)
I noticed that my internal clock speed was increasing, and
that I was thinking and visualizing with increasing subtle
"granularity" (i.e., "many more distinguishable trees in the
forest"). After playing with ideas for some minutes, I took a
toke of a high grade bud of cannabis, which for me often
brings the ability to "see" systems in three dimensions.<br><br>

Wow! The effect with 2CD was strongly synergistic,
I not only started seeing the system of "STEEP Scanning" to
impact analysis in a dynamic (time dependent) way, I saw it
as simultaneously representing emergence in two orthogonal
dimensions implicate (like the proverbial "horn of plenty" in
which fruit emerges from no-thing-ness); and explicate (like
conventional cause and effect sequences). I quickly
sketched exactly what I needed and went off with my wife to
make love, for the 2CD also quickened that aspect of
beingness as well.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Bill1">2CD<br>

His girl friend, who was a very experienced skier,
wanted him to learn how to ski so they could go out on the
slopes together. He took a one hour ski lesson and then a
couple of days later went skiing with LAZAR and his lady.
The first run was a disaster for Bill, who fell down getting
off the lift and kept falling down every ten or twenty feet, or
so it seemed. When they got to the bottom of the first run,
LAZAR called everyone together for a smart pill and then
waited a short while for it to take effect. When the very first
or threshold effects were noted, everyone got on the lift and
went up again. This time Bill did not fall down getting off
the lift and he went ahead of everyone. It was difficult at
times for the others to keep up with him. His form was not
great, but he was really going for it. They all made one more
run down this beginner's slope and then went up some
slightly more difficult runs. By lunch time all were going up
on intermediate slopes and doing very well. Everyone who
had skied previously said that they had never skied better.
After lunch, and a well deserved rest and half of a smart pill,
the whole group went up again. By mid-afternoon Bill had
started to lose it on some difficult intermediate slopes where
LAZAR felt he had no business to be. So everyone moved
down to some easier slopes and all was fine for the rest of the
day. Bill went skiing twice more with his girl friend (the first
time with smart pills) and the next time the four of them hit
the slopes together. Well, the only time LAZAR and his lady
saw the other two was when they went whizzing by at great
speed. Bill had become as expert a skier as his companion
in a very short time. In fact he was so enamored of skiing
that he sort of became a ski bum and lived and worked
evenings at ski resorts just so he could ski all day during the
season. After a couple of years of this the novelty wore off
and Bill came down to earth again.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Ned1">2CD<br>

I took 10 mg in the afternoon, at about 2:00 PM. I was
relaxed, the house was quiet, and I drifted off into sleep - a
normal, after-lunch nap. A half-hour later I woke in a
relaxed, alert state. I felt no psychedelic activity, no
sensations other than a kind of sharpened awareness. After
an hour, I felt that nothing was happening and took another
10 mg. After another half hour it was clear that something
indeed was happening. I felt light and euphoric, but nothing
particular was going on in my mind. I slept lightly for
another hour -- very relaxed, a very refreshing and alert
sleep.<br><br>

I decided that this material was not taking me
anywhere, and that I might as well drive it, since it was not
leading me. In that period of my life I was playing GO on the
computer several hours every day. I had set the level of
difficulty so that I usually win with a small margin, with a
score of around twenty, but I have to work hard to do it. That
afternoon with the 2-CD, I won consistently with scores up
around 100-130! My only sensations were clarity and ease.
Effortless. The clarity penetrated all of my mental
processing, and trailed off in three or four days.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Scott1">2CD<br>

One-half hour in I felt slight euphoria, reading an article
I seemed to fall into it. Nice flow on interpretation and new
ideas. Especially with reading I feel a shift in the eyes as
though they get a little dried out. This, however, is
sometimes seen (depending usually on the dosage--15-20
mg) as positive. With reading I feel my eyes softening into
the article--like a gaze. Breathing goes shallow but timely.
Feel real comfortable.<br><br>

One hour in: did some yoga. Head stand with elbows
position triangularly is real easy. Maintained a steadiness
with the quieting of the mind. I went right into a breathing
that felt new (the position was so...). This I enjoyed very
much. Not strange to me except in typing this
now--opening my mouth I could feel the network of 
muscles there in and out around my mouth. Like the
breathing the more relaxed &amp; "giving in to" the more subtle
feeling I seemed to acquire. From there I could move
consciousness to various parts of my body and feel that area.
My breath is in unison as I shift consciousness there. In 2-3
hours the subtle intensity is gone though I maintain a
calming feeling.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Rod1">2CD<br>

Rod was studying for an aircraft pilot's license so that he
could fly his own plane to business meetings, etc. He was
having a difficult time studying and learning all of the
information that he needed to know for the examination.
Ten 10 mg 2CD tabs used over a period of about one month
were of great assistance in studying for the examination,
which he passed with flying colors. He was amazed at the
ease of learning and the degree of retention, and he
commented that he wished he had had some of these "smart
pills" when he was in college.<br><br><font size="3"><b><a name="Leo1">2CD<br>

After meeting with you, I drove south to meet with
Terence McKenna, who was under consideration as
Technical Advisor for the film I spoke of; since it deals
primarily with the dynamics of the mushroom velada as
performed in the Mazatecan idiom. Terence and I spent the
next day and a half going over the proposed film, spinning
tales and dancing the dance of new friends. The one full day
was spent after ingesting a small (10 mg) amount of 2CD
on my part. It is difficult to differentiate between cause and
effect at this point, but I will tell you that in the space of that
time, I felt as if my brain had been washed in the waters of
some cool, clear, sweet, spring; that some kind of opaque
filmy veil had been flushed away and that cortical tissues
were being exposed to brilliant light. The nature of our
conversations was so intense at times, that I would have to
leave him and go for a short solitary walk because of being
in overload.<br><br>

Now Terence is, as we all know, an authentic "one-and-only"
type person, and possesses, I expect, considerable
shamanic powers, but during those conversations, stuff came
out of me that I had no idea was present anywhere in my
cerebral structures. Ideas were fully formed and clearly and
powerfully expressed without effort or effect. I had
extraordinary flights of mental connections. I felt as if there
was a voice speaking in me that I had never heard before and
that its origins were from some deep ocean of intuition and
profound meaning. What continually astonished me in the
process was that the things the voice was expressing were
things I have never been able to say with absolute clarity. In
other words, they were languaged feelings more than mental
constructs. And these feelings had meanings far more
profound than any thoughts I had theretofore expressed in
my writings or in my personal conversations with other
people.<br><br>

Coincidental with all of this, there began to be delivered
an array of synchronicities that, at times, was overwhelming.
I seemed to have achieved in a kind of lateral drift, a subtle
and magical shift of perception that allowed me a glimpse of
the ongoing miracles occurring behind the mask of
ordinarily-viewed reality. As the veil was washed from my
brain, it was also lifted from my eyes.<br><br>

The words, feelings, thoughts seemed to be coming
from another part of me. It felt as if, for the first time, the
origin of my voice was my heart and what it spoke were the
sounds of my true self which was intact, blessed, worthy,
and deeply in the Tao. I was continually amazed at the ease
with which I could express the most complicated ideas.
How this new voice simplified everything and how, in the
process of simplification, everything said gained the power
of its own authenticity which, somehow, I didn't own, which
was me, but not of me, which came from more than me.
This report may seem rather effusive, especially since
the substance seemed at the time of ingestion, so mild and
barely present, but I intuitively feel there was something still
working chemically and in alchemical combination in the
meeting with Terence and that the "washing" I refer to was
still going on. I would welcome any thoughts from the pool
of your experience on this. Does this make any sense to
you?<br><br>

Lazar's response was: Yes, it makes perfect sense. You
have had a better than average response to this particular
chemical, which released your innate knowingness in a way
that only you can fully appreciate. Many thanks for sharing
your insights with us.<br><br><hr>

The above represents a few of the many trials conducted
with 2CD and one can see that it has a broad spectrum of
usefulness. It was difficult to get the people involved with
these tests to make written reports of what they experienced
with the compound. One should also realize that all of this
data is anecdotal in nature and not admissible as hard
evidence. However, it does point to the great potential of
this particular class of synthetic neurotransmitters. Several
subjects, in addition to Meg, found that 2CD was a little too
strong for them; they mostly felt that it "wired them up"
excessively. The compound was tamed by replacing the two
methoxy groups on the ring with two ethoxy groups and
resulted in 2CD-DiEt (4-Methyl-2,5 diethoxyphenethyl-
amine) which retained the smart pill activity and eliminated
the tendency towards states of intoxication. Along this same
line of reasoning, two other compounds were made where
only one of the methoxy groups was replaced with an ethoxy
group. Since there are two methoxy groups to replace, this
resulted in two more compounds 2CD-2EtO (4-Methyl-2-
ethoxy-5-methoxy-phenethyl-amine) and 2CD-5EtO (4-
Methyl-2-methoxy-5-ethoxy-phenethyl-amine). The first
compound, 2CD-2EtO, did not show any smart pill activity
in initial trials and was not pursued further. The second
compound, 2CD-SEtO, did show some very interesting
properties in this area which will be covered under it's own
heading later on.<br><br>

There is some potential for abuse of 2CD as a
recreational drug, but LAZAR does not feel the problem is
serious. An example of recreational use will he given: A
couple who were familiar with the smart pills asked LAZAR
to furnish enough 2CD for a party of about twenty persons,
The 2CD was dissolved in a sweet flavorful liquor, so that
each ounce contained a moderate dosage. As each guest
arrived, they were handed a small glass containing the
fortified liquor. Everyone downed this offering and
proceeded to the kitchen where they deposited the beer,
wine or spirits which they had brought, as it was a BYOB
party. After a short while, LAZAR noted that the party was
going along very nicely, but no one was carrying a drink
around with them. He noticed that end tables and other
places held nearly full glasses and cans of beverage. Also
everyone was interacting with others present and no
introductions were necessary even though they were
strangers. No one was left out of conversations, or
discussion groups, or the music jamming that was going on
in one of the bedrooms. LAZAR knew very few of the
people there and said he never felt more comfortable at a
party. People would go up to the hosts and give them big
hugs and tell them what a great party it was.<br><br>

We all need a little recreation from time to time, and the
use of a few milligrams of 2CD or similar compounds is
certainly less damaging than several ounces of alcohol and
much easier on the system also. There is no hangover or
dragged out feeling the next morning. At the levels used
there was no intoxication as such, just a loosening up and a
mellowing out. The possibility of the material, 2CD, being
toxic in the doses listed above are very slight as it has been
used in Germany in psychotherapy. There it is known as
LE-25, at doses of up to 200 mg. No adverse effects were
noted at these dosage levels which are more than ten times
the amount used in the above accounts. Most of the dosage
levels mentioned in LAZAR's work are less than 0.3 part per
million based on bodyweight of the individual.<br><br>

How do these so called smart pills effect their
action? Since these compounds are analogous to neurotransmitters,
it is possible that the process is similar to the
difference observed when an automotive engine is run on
gasoline with a higher octane rating and when it is run on
gasoline with a lower octane rating. This is rather simplistic
in its approach and there is more than that to the possible
answer. In working with these compounds at the lower
dosage levels which seem to be optimum for learning it was
noted that the amount of internal dialog was greatly reduced.
With the internal dialog reduced, the information could be
filed in the memory bank of the biocomputer (brain) in a
more orderly manner. Thus, without the static that the
internal dialog represents, the stored information could be
retrieved in a more efficient way since the sorting process
would be simplified. This possible mechanism is all right for
explaining intellectual activity, but it falls short when applied
to the physical/mental coordination area such as music or
sports. However, not being able to know how they work,
does not detract from the fact that they do work.<br><br><hr>
<br><font size="4"><b><a name="2cd-diet">
2CD-DiEt<br>
4-Methyl-2,5-Diethoxyphenethylamine </a><a href="#ref5">5</a></b></font><br><br>

As mentioned earlier, this compound was synthesized to
eliminate some unwanted side effects in some individuals
and yet retain the smart pill activity. In this respect the effort
was very successful and this compound was used more than
2CD for general learning tasks. The dosage used with this material was
a little wider than for 2CD and was generally in
the range of 5 to 15 milligrams orally. Again each individual
selected their own dosage based on usage, optimum results
and intuition.<br><br>

In general the results obtained with 2CD-DiEt were
not quite as dramatic as those with 2CD, indicating a
reduction of smart pill activity, but still made it a good
general purpose aid for learning. Several people have used
this material daily for periods of two or three weeks, without
noticing any adverse effects from a physiological standpoint.
LAZAR feels that this is a very worthwhile compound and
for future investigations the diethoxy substitutions should not
be overlooked.<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="2cd-5eto">
2CD-5EtO<br>4-Metyl-5-Ethoxy-2-Methoxyphenethylamine (</a><a href="#ref5">5</a>)
</b></font><br><br>

This was synthesized as part of the exploration of
position analogs of 2CD and was found to have some
different properties than 2CD or 2CD-DiEt. At doses of from
5 to 10 milligrams (in a few individuals up to 12.5 mg) it was
found to produce a state very well suited for reading with
incredibly good understanding and retention. Some persons
reported that they could "grok" or understand very deeply the
intent of the author when she/he wrote the material being
read. Others reported basically the same thing, but expressed
it in a different way: "I could tell where the author was
coming from when the material was being written." This
compound had a longer time span of activity than the two
mentioned previously, with some people reporting the
material active for up to ten hours. This fits in with tests
done with the compound at levels as high as 40-50 mg which
produced a psychedelic experience lasting approximately 12
hours. There was no visual distortion, and color enhancement
was noted by most. All agreed that it could best be
described as an "art gallery tour", as paintings, drawings,
sculptures, and just ordinary "knick knacks" took on a life of
their own and one could spend many minutes gazing at an
object with intense fascination. No negative feelings were
experienced by any of the testers and everyone agreed that it
was a very smooth and positive experience. Most felt that
they had gained important insights into their lives.
The 2CT2 series of compounds were investigated for
smart pill activity. The parent compound 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-
Ethylthio-phenethylamine was tested for smart pill activity
and the results were not very interesting, so various
methyl/ethyl positional isomers were made to check out this
area. The three compounds that resulted and were evaluated
to some extent were: 2CT2-2EtO, 2CT2-SEtO, and 2CT2-DiEt.<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="2ct2-2eto">
2CT2-2EtO<br>
2-Ethoxy-5-Methoxy-4-Ethylthiophenethylamine (</a><a href="#ref6">6</a>)
</b></font><br><br>

This was tested at levels of from 10 to 20 mg. Test
subjects reported a general heightening of sensorial
awareness and some, but not all, felt it could be most useful
for creative enterprises. Exploring dosage levels of less than
10 mg may prove to be interesting, but at levels of more than
20 mg hallucinogenisis was noted and this condition was not
appropriate for studying. In all cases the duration of action
was shorter that other compounds tested; about four hours
duration was noted in most cases.<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="2ct2-5eto">
2CT2-5EtO<br>
2-Methoxy-5-Ethoxy-4-Ethylthiophenethylamine (</a><a href="#ref6">6</a>)
</b></font><br><br>

This was tested at levels of from 5 to 10 mg and a 
very interesting property of this material was noted: The
effects lasted for 22 to 23 hours and with most subjects no 
sleep was possible during that time unless some Halcion or
Valium was taken to allow a few hours sleep. This
compound was classed as very insightful and useful for
forming new concepts and writing them down. One
disadvantage was that it was so long acting.<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="2ct2-diet">
2CT2-DiEt<br>
2,5-Diethoxy-4-Ethylthiophenethylamine (</a><a href="#ref6">6</a>)
</b></font><br><br>


This was tested at levels of from 5 to 15 mg. The effects
lasted for only three hours and users reported that reading
was very easy with good concentration and assimilation. The
three thio compounds listed above were the only ones
checked for smart pill activity. LAZAR feels that the
manipulations with ring substituents on a dozen or more
other thio compounds could be most interesting and
rewarding. The reason more work was not done in this area
was the passage of the "Controlled Substances Analog Bill".<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="2ce-5eto">
2CE-5EtO<br>
4-Ethyl-5-Ethoxy-2-Methoxyphenethylamine
</a></b></font><br><br>

This was the only compound of the 2CE series evaluated
for smart pill activity. It was found to be like its 5-Ethoxy
counterpart of the 2CT2 series to be very long acting, about
24 hours with little or no sleep possible without Halcion.
Dosages ranged from 5 to 16 mg and it generally took about
two hours for the material to become effective after
ingestion. In one test three subjects took the material
together and read an entire book of over 300 pages, taking
turns reading aloud. The following day after a little sleep,
they discussed the content of the book and found that they
could quote entire paragraphs and their understanding and
retention was excellent. All three were quite impressed with
the entire test. The feeling was that this would be good for
brain-storming or other similar small group activities. They
also felt that the material could manifest philosophical
overtones during the time the material was active.<br><br><hr>
<br><font size="4"><b><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></b></font><br><br>

The foregoing is a brief description of the work which
was done by Lazar and his testing group on a number of
smart pill compounds prior to the cessation due to the
passage of the "Controlled Substances Analog Act" in
October of 1986. This legislation was passed as part of the
so called "war on drugs" and did not specify what an analog
exactly was. With such loose wording the law could extend
to any compound with vaguely similar chemical structure.<br><br>

All of the smart pills listed are rather close relatives of
controlled substances, so not wanting to be a court test case
Lazar discontinued his investigations. Later he felt that it
should be published somehow, so that hopefully in more
enlightened times in the future others could resume the
exploration of new and existing compounds which might
show smart pill activity. There is great need for compounds
that increase the capacity for mental work in humans. The
complexity of living is increasing all the time and the need
to learn more complex things in addition to a greater volume
of knowledge the brain must handle, indicates an increasing
need for materials and techniques which will somehow make
learning easier and of better quality.<br><br><br><font size="4"><b><a name="authornote">A NOTE FROM THE
AUTHOR</a></b></font><br><br>

As you the reader may have wondered by now, the
author and Lazar may seem like fictitious characters. Their
names are fictitious, but the account of the exploratory
chemistry and evaluation of these interesting compounds is
real and factual. The reason for this deception is that the
freedom of speech, as set forth in the First Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States, has and is being
abridged by various governmental agencies such as the
DEA. Lazar did not wish to be hassled, and perhaps fined
and imprisoned for his work on the "smart pills" as described
in the preceding pages. If you feel that this cannot
happen in a free country, you had but read Chapter One of
