 "report": "<p>A Little background first...</p><p>I've been a regular drug user since I was 14, my main drug of choice being Marijuana.  over the past 5 years (I'm 19 now) I've experimented with multiple other drugs, but have only taken a liking to a few.  MY first synthetic experimentation was GHB, and after that, I decided to stay away from everything but weed. this plan worked for quite some time, but when I turned and entered college, I was exposed to cocaine, opium, mushrooms, and very good marijuana (among other things). </p><p>Anywhoo, around february of 05', things went south with my mom, and she kicked me out of the house. I moved in with some cousins for about two months. One of my cousin's friends was a daughter of a Hell's Angel and I associated with many Angel's during this period.  I had heard about Methamphetamine, but had never known the Angels have classically been known as a large maufacturer of it.  Living by the philosophy 'try everything once', one night I asked if I could try some of the crank that they were using, and like any good friend, they said 'ok'.</p><p>I started off with one line, but after 30-45 minutes of no results, I decided to stoop very low, and inhaled it through a lightbulb.  I was hoping that maybe a little bit more would make me feel something.  wrong. I proceeded to stay up until around 4 oclock that morning, but this wasnt out of the ordinary for me; I've always been a nightowl. </p><p>The entire time, while everyone else in the room was high, I sat on the couch, waiting, and waiting to feel SOMETHING. but that something never arrived. so, I decided that this drug sucked - I had felt nothing the entire time; just stupid. </p><p>So, after my first time I decided that this drug wasnt for me, and have had no desire to try it ever again (especially after seeing some family/friends get hooked BADLY, and the toll it takes on their bodies).</p>"
