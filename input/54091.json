 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPrevious experience: Loads of alcohol & cannabis\r\nThe very first time I took HBWR seeds, I wanted to avoid the nausea.\r\nI didn't eat for 6-7 hours. I removed the light-brownish husks with\r\nnails and a knife. I chew 4 seeds for 15 minutes and then I spitted\r\neverything out. It didn't work so well. In one particular moment I\r\nfelt like I was totally numb and later on I felt like I was going\r\nto fell asleep. I also smoked some hashish because I didn't really\r\nbelieve the seeds we're working. And while I was doing this I drank\r\ncouple of beers. I usually drink & smoke alot, but this time I was\r\nso tired after all this shit I just wanted to get some sleep. I\r\ncan't truly tell if I was intoxicated by the seeds or not.\r\nThe next morning, I prepared for the nausea. First I removed once\r\nagain carefully the light-brownish husks from the seeds. Then I\r\nground up 6 seeds in 3 different cups, each holding 2 seeds.\r\nI boiled some mineral water, let it cool down to 60 celsius and\r\nadded that into every cup. I waited for 2-3 hours for the mixtures\r\nto cool down into room temperature. I also didn't eat anything for\r\n4 hours. Just 10 minutes before I started to ingest the actual\r\nmixture, I ate a teaspoonfull of ginger. Some people claim it\r\nhelps avoiding the nausea. The taste of ginger is not so pleasant.\r\nIt burns all the way down my throat and into my stomach.\r\nAfter the 'ginger hell' I drank 2 cups of my mixture, so I had\r\ningested total of 4 seeds. After 15-20 minutes, I started to feel\r\nlight-headed. I had to resist the vomiting. Ginger was still burning\r\nand the seeds really did make me wanna throw up. I knew I had to.\r\nStill, I resisted. It was quite difficult to relax or to walk, I\r\nfelt like I was a bit drunk and I wanted to vomit. I decided to wait\r\nfor 60 minutes, and then I would throw up if I had to. Right after\r\nthis I realized, I could control my feelings quite well. I could\r\nsing along with some piece of music and forget the urge for vomiting.\r\nI believed I could control these kind of feelings, I believed it was\r\nall in my head. I carefully chose good songs to make me feel better.\r\nAnd it did. I also did some things I really like, playing guitar,\r\nsinging & such. All these things made me feel even better. Then\r\nsuddenly, I remembered last night, and I recalled I had feelings\r\nquite like this, and I enjoyed it.\r\nThe only downside, besides the urge for vomiting, was the feeling\r\nof drowsyness... I even made some coffee just to keep me awake.\r\nThen I wanted to drink the last cup of 2 seeds mixture I made earlier.\r\nI drank it and went to see my friend. I still felt like I was only a bit\r\ndrunk. When I reached my friends residence, we watched a video and smoked\r\nsome cannabis. I told my friend what I had done and he didn't seem to care,\r\nI felt like I had no-one to tell this.\r\nThen, from out of nowhere, appeared a new world in front of me.\r\nI started to realize things from a totally new perspective.\r\nI knew I had to leave immediately. The information that kept\r\ncoming from things I did there was too much. I told my friend\r\nI couldn't concentrate for what we we're doing because I was\r\nsomewhere else, doing something else. And then I left.\r\nWhen I was walking back home, I saw a group of people who were\r\nsitting in a bar nearby. They all arose and left the bar as soon\r\nas I walked by. At first, I thought to myself, am I that horrible?\r\nThen I realized they split up because they were going somewhere else.\r\nIt was the relief of my life. And as I continued walking back home,\r\nI saw some elderly people as well, they looked at me and I swear,\r\nI knew exactly what they were thinking. So I reacted differently,\r\nand I saw how it affected them. I believed I could control this\r\nsituation. It was all just a matter of understanding gestures.\r\nAnd those gestures had always been there for me. But only now, I could\r\nunderstand those gestures so well that I could control the situation.\r\nI was quite polite and I enjoyed it. And it made me feel good too.\r\nWhen I got back home, I saw my entire life like a book. It was all\r\nthere. I just never realized it, because it didn't have any meaning.\r\nBy looking any object I own, I saw where it had come from, why it\r\nwas there, why I liked it and why I chose to keep it. I remembered\r\nall the things it had been through, where was it made, who had played\r\nwith it and so on... In my everyday life, I pass by many things\r\nI have gathered throughout my years of existence like it didn't\r\nmean anything to me. Well it does. I just never stop there to\r\nsee and understand the meaning of it all. But this time I could see.\r\nI was so overwhelmingly happy of all the objects I had received from\r\nthousands of different sources it made me smile. It made me cherish\r\nlife itself.\r\nThen I got an another idea. I wanted to record a video of myself\r\nthinking these kinds of things. In case I would forget how happy I was.\r\nIt was a difficult task. I had to remind myself of what I was doing\r\nfor every 5 seconds. I just saw the camera and I remembered every little\r\nrecording the camera had ever recorded and every little detail of the\r\ncamera made me remember where it was damaged and so on... When I finally\r\nmanaged to assemble it, I started recording. It was impossible to speak\r\nthose things which were inside my head. It was all too much. When I\r\nopened my mouth and said something, my mouth froze and I was left\r\nspeechless, dreaming. Every sentence I started, ended prematurely as\r\nmy mind drifted away with the memories I encountered everywhere I gazed\r\nupon. This is when I decided not to record anymore.\r\nI went to my bed to lie down and enjoy. I have no idea how long I was\r\nthere, since time had no meaning at all. Or at least, I didn't care.\r\nThe rest of my trip I embraced life and tried to focus my thoughts\r\nto gain understanding of life. And I did understand. The trip\r\nwas over in about 6 hours or so, and I started to feel the after\r\neffects. I called my friend to come see me and apologized why\r\nI was so rude earlier. He said he understanded why I did it, and\r\nI understanded it too. We smoked some pot, watched some videos and\r\nhad a great time. Afterwards we just fell asleep.\r\nConclusion:\r\nAt the first time, I didn't take enough seeds and my technique was\r\ntotally incorrect. The next time I drank the seed mixtures I was\r\nsuccessful and had just the right amount. I had some slight visuals\r\ntoo, not worth mentioning though. The inner adventure I had was so\r\nmuch more. I still feel happy about my journey, and I believe my\r\njourney was successful because my timing was right. My life was so\r\nperfect at the time it reflected my trip very pleasantly. Also I would\r\nlike to point out the side-effects I had, the terrible nausea at first\r\nand the hangover which included 'foggy' mind, thirst and numb legs.\r\nStill, it was the price to pay and I will certainly do this again.\n\n\n"
