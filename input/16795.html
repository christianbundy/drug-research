I had heard of yohimbe for many years but had never had a chance to try it. A friend had often spoken with me about using a tincture form of yohimbe in coffee and enjoying it's mild psychedelic effects. While shopping for some vitamins I noticed a major supplement manufacturer had begun selling powdered yohimbe bark in capsules.  It was not expensive and after some research on the internet I decided to buy a bottle of the 500 mg capsules.<br><br>
The recommended dosage on the bottle indicated taking one capsule after a meal up to three times a day.  No claims of any effects or benefits were listed on the bottle.  My research on the internet seemed to indicate that it was currently being touted as a 'fat burner' in addition to it's well known effects as an 'herbal viagra'. I decided to try it gradually starting at the recommended dosage and increasing gradually and trying different methods of ingestion once I was confident I was getting no bad effects.<br><br>
The first day I took three capsules throughout the day and noticed no effects at all.  I doubled the dosage on the second day and noticed only a mild euphoric mood starting in the late afternoon and had a little trouble getting to sleep.  The third day I took three capsules in the morning and began to notice very mild effects in a little over an hour. I decided to try the rest of the dosage I was planning to take that day in the form of a tea which I made by dumping the six capsules (three grams of powdered bark) in a Pyrex measuring cup with about eight ounces of boiling water, 1000 mg of vitamin C and simmering over low heat for about 20 minutes.  I filtered the tea through a coffee filter and added a couple of ice cubes to cool it down. I drank it gradually over a period of about 45 minutes mixed about half and half with <br>
coca cola on ice (not terrible tasting but not great either).<br><br>
Within about ten or fifteen minutes of begining to drink the tea I began to experience a more intense effect of stimulation and euphoria.  This increased over a period of about an hour.  I found the effects to be enjoyable but rather mild, slight tingling, especially in the limbs, very subtle tracer smearing visually, rather like pot but with a more alert type of euphoria.  My heartbeat seem to be a little elavated but not at a level of discomfort or concern.<br><br>
At this time I decided to try smoking a small amount of the powdered bark to see what effect it might have on the experience.  I smoked probably only 50-75 mg sprinkled over some shake from some pot.   The effects were immediately intesified and began to become much speedier and psychedelic. Colors seemed brighter and often left afterimages.<br><br>
At this point I also began to notice the sexual effects, I began to feel mildly aroused.  Masturbation was quite enjoyable and orgasm was prolonged and intense.  The overall effects seemed to gradually decrease over a period of around five or six hours.  After this amount of time I felt a little tired and decided to take a short nap, I ended up sleeping for nearly six hours.<br><br>
I have since tried yohimbe both as tea and smoked on at least three different occasions.  I have come to the conclusion that smoking is both easier and much more effective.  An effective dose for smoking is only about 100-150 mg where tea requires at least three grams for even a mild experience.  Mixing the yohimbe with a small amount of pot seems to enhance the psychedelic edge and tone down the speediness of the experience.  One consistant effect I have noticed is the burn out after coming down, I lay down for a short nap and end up sleeping for at least four to six hours.<!-- End Body -->
