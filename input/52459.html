Lets start this tale off by saying I am an experienced tripper. I have eaten so many psylocybin mushrooms that I cant even begin to fathom the amount that I have shoved down the hatch and have had 5 awesome acid trips with a few that were merely 'okay' sprinkled in here and there.<br><br>
So, with that out of the way, the 2C-i experience began at a friends house. I was headed over there to rock out some Guitar Hero on the PS2 with my friends and smoke a few blunts. When I got there, he had a couple other guys chillin in the basement that I had never met before. After a few rounds of the bong, we started discussing a few of our favorite substances and one of the other guys said something about taking 2C-i and loving it and that he had a little extra. I snagged a couple of capsules from him and started to get excited but thought I would wait until I had a full day to take them because I wanted to take them during the day and have a nice 'day trip'.<br><br>
About a week later, I found myself receiving a call and getting an offer for a job that I had just applied for. This was awesome news and I decided it was time to celebrate... enter 2C-i.<br><br>
It was about 6pm when another friend of mine picked me up from my house. She was expecting a night of hanging out and smoking blunts until we passed out, but I had a surprise for her...<br><br>
I couldnt even wait until we got back to her house. As soon as we pulled out of my driveway I pulled out the 2 capsules that I had bought. They were the large 'horse pill' looking capsules that you get from a natural market for making your own vitamins, or whatever, and they had about an 8th of an inch of the white powder at the bottom. I handed one to my friend and we downed them at the same time(both on pretty empty stomachs).<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font><br><br>
We made it back to my friends house and I sat down and ground up some of the bud I had. It was only commercial, however, it was the best I had EVER seen(no seeds at all, very small stems.. it was even somewhat crystally but it was still bricked..) I rolled us a nice little blunt from a Phillie peach cigarello and we sat back and watched TV while we turned it to ash...<br><br>
So, as we are sitting on the couch, I notice that Im becoming increasingly slouched and it feels a lot like the couch is sucking me in. Since my friend had never tripped before, I kind of took on the roll of 'guide' for this experience and I asked if she would like to go outside with me while I smoke a cigarette.<br><br>
We migrate our way to the back of her house and out the back door to the small yard area. The house backs up to a cliff that overlooks a small stream and there is a sort of balcony built in to the side of the cliff where she has a table and some chairs. While I was smoking the cigarette, I looked up through the trees and noticed that the clouds were being sucked in to the tops of the trees. This didnt make sense to me all until I looked at the clock on my phone... ooops... it is now t+1 hour after taking the caps and I know this stuff is starting to come on. We sat out on the balcony for about 20-30 minutes, both kind of in our own world  watching the world transform around us. <br><br>
At one point, I thought I felt a bug on my arm so I looked down to brush it off but it wasnt there. I held my arms out in front of me upside down so that I could see the bottom of my forearm and all of the sudden a 'persian rug' pattern starts crawling out of the crease on the bottom side of my elbow and heading toward my palms. The more I concentrate on it, the more it reaches for my hands and if I look away, it dissapears and I have to focus to make it 'come back'... 'Not quite peak, yet', I thought. <br><br>
We eventually made our way back inside and by this point I know the 2C-i is starting to peak. The persian rug was all over the stuc-o ceiling and it started to swirl around the vents for the heating and A/C. My friend had some cardboard fish taped up on the wall in the living room where we were and they started to swim away from us. We had a pretty good time for a while just checking out all of the action in the room and we deicded to watch a movie to see if anything cool happened(since it was dark outside by this point). <br><br>
We watched a couple movies that I am very familiar with but I couldnt follow the plot because there were too many visuals going on in the background to focus on the characters. The visuals were very 'patterny' which is about the only way I can describe it. For example, in one of the movies, there was a scene in an office and each desk had a desk lamp on it. The lamps were the only thing I could focus on and it looked like they were strategically laid out so that the distance between each one would be the same to form a kind of 'grid' pattern.<br><br>
The rest of the night was a lot of noticing these 'patterns'. The only other strong visual I can remember was how intense lights were. I walked outside and a street light almost hurt my eyes because it seemed so bright and there were 5 individual 'fingers' of light that were waving around coming out of each street light. The persian rug pattern was on just about everything I looked at for a good 6 hours.<br><br>
in summary the visuals are great, the body high is awesome and theres not that 'completely out of my mind' feeling I get when doing something like LSD or psylocybin... at least that is my 2 cents.<!-- End Body -->
