Syrian Rue (10 g) drink consumed followed by <i>Mimosa hostilis</i> (3 g) drink 25 minutes after. No noticeable effects after consuming the Syrian Rue mix.<br><br>
15-20 minutes after consuming the <i>Mimosa hostilis</i> drink I began to feel a rising tightening feeling within my body, similar to the initial effects of drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana.<br><br>
Soon after I observed that the photographs on one wall of my room began to lift out from the wall and float towards me.<br><br>
It was around this point that I closed my eyes for the first time. Soon after closing my eyes I began to sense time and space unraveling. I experienced objects and the atmosphere around me pulling apart and time coming to a standstill. I believe it was at this point that I was entering another dimension. <br><br>
I opened my eyes at this point and could see another space or dimension within my room, existing in the same space.<br><br>
I closed my eyes again. I was still conscious of my body at this point although I was going deeper into another world. Shapes were forming and shadowy figures were moving across my vision while my eyes were closed. They were pointing in different directions and I followed their movements and gestures. I was aware that my head was physically moving to follow them. The figures began to gesture towards my mouth. Reflexively my mouth kept opening. I thought they were trying to put something in my mouth. This happened a few times and I was slightly confused as to what was happening or what it was that they intended for me to do. I began to feel nauseous and could feel that my stomach felt upset even though I was only slightly conscious of my body. It was then that I realized that the shadowy figures were trying to tell me to throw up, that it would be beneficial if I did so and that I could go deeper if I did. I regained normal consciousness enough to open my eyes and reach for my bin. It took a lot of effort to do so and it felt like my arm reached so slowly and for such a long amount time until I finally got hold of the bin beside me. I held it to me and considered throwing up. A part of me didnt want to at the time and so I didnt and the nausea passed fairly quickly. However, in retrospect, I do wish that I had thrown up as that was what I was being instructed to do.<br><br>
I closed my eyes again and entered the other world, however, the shadows were gone. My memory is a little vague at this point, but I remember being in a dark world with a presence that resembled a dark shape beside me. I felt a lot of love and good will coming from the presence, although this period did not last long as the world began to change again.<br><br>
I began to see a colourful world of transforming objects, shapes and textures. Each transforming object or shape was associated with strong feelings and emotions and even experiences/memories. Although I dont know whose experiences/memories they were. By this time I was completely unaware of my body and of my own world.<br><br>
The world shifted to become even more colourful. Entities that resembled small smiling faces appeared and began to transform the world as well as themselves into incredibly intricate patterns with various textures. They shot across my vision and smiled at me, transforming themselves and exploding in amazing shapes. They were being so playful and I laughed at them and I felt like we were laughing together. They were so friendly. They wanted to show me things and kept telling me to look at one thing and flew across my vision and exploded into an amazing image or pattern then flew somewhere else telling me to look then transforming again. By doing this they were imparting knowledge to me. Knowledge that cannot be described but simply felt and understood by the things that they were creating/their transformations. It was all incredibly emotional and meaningful.<br><br>
I became aware of my body at times, and realized that I was laughing at one thing then marveling at another thing then crying with joy at something else. At one time I could feel tears streaming down my face. They would reveal something that would fill me with incredible sadness then something that was incredibly beautiful. I would laugh at them as they played and tell them that they were so cute then all of a sudden be in complete awe as they would show me something completely amazing that my mouth would open in a gasp. I kept uttering I see, I understand as they revealed incredible truths within their activity that contained meaning and significance that defied description. <br><br>
Eventually, they revealed an essential truth about existence. They told me to 'just exist' and not to stress about the meaning or purpose of life. They told me that they exist and that so do I, and that that is all that matters and all that I should do. I understood that that was exactly what they were doing, as they played and transformed. The significance of this was incredible, and I was completely awe struck. I kept repeating just exist and that I understood. I had the most incredible feeling of inner of peace and contentment the whole time.<br><br>
I was also made to understand that at that moment, in my own world, I was not asleep but had awakened within a different dimension, which I had entered by accessing a new level of consciousness. That, in a sense, I had 'woken up', and had been asleep until that point in my life.<br><br>
Being within this world was definitely the highlight of the whole experience.<br><br>
Eventually this world disappeared and I was made to see myself in my daily life and at my work from a third person view. I was told (telepathically) that I spend too much time caring about what other people think about me, and that my ego is my biggest enemy. I understood these things completely.<br><br>
After this my memory is a little vague. At one time I do however remember being in a world surrounded by entities that resembled sea creatures from deep within the ocean. They moved and floated around a strange alien landscape. <br><br>
I felt mostly uncomfortable for the rest of the experience as I think my physical self was interfering with my experience. It was very late and I could occasionally sense my body's tiredness and the need to urinate also. I got up one or two times (with much difficulty and disorientation) to go to the toilet. <br><br>
For the most part I was so far removed from my body and so when I did remember my own world and things that are normally familiar to me, they felt so far away and almost impossible to imagine.<br><br>
I came back to myself around 3-4 hours after the experience began, ate, and then slept.<!-- End Body -->
