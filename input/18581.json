 "report": "<p>I´ve taken the regular dose of both piracetam and Hydergine. I took the first dose yesterday, and other one today. While I´m writing this report I´m under the influence of the second dose, which I´ve taken 1 hour ago.</p><p>I decided to take it after reading other reports and talking to friends, for 2 reasons: 1- I expect taking this 2 smart drugs with ecstasy pretty soon. 2- I´ve been feeling great changes in the way my mind used to work. I forget things much more easily nowadays and sometimes I feel a difficulty that I never had before when exposing an idea. I´m sure this symptoms are due to long term uses of marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol.</p><p>But let's get to my experience. I slept only few hours, and I was feeling pretty tired when I took the dose yesterday. after about 40 minutes, I felt much less tired and I was extremely alert. Then, I went to meet my friends in a pub near my place.  Talking to them I couldn´t stop talking. The ideas flew so easily, and my arguments seemed so convincing that I saw the old me again. (I´m a very inteligent person, my IQ is 152 and, besides, I´m a jornalist, argumentation is my best quality. But nowadays I´ve been feeling I lost part of it.)</p><p>I smoke a lot, but don´t feel like smoking that much under the influence. I also drink a lot, but I wasn´t feeling like drinking either. Nevertheless, I drank anyway - and I completely disrecommend that. You get drunk much more quickly, and when drunk under piracetam and hydergine, the easy flow of thoughts becomes confused and uncomfortable. Also, I started to feel a little nausea. Not like the ones I get when I´m really, really drunk. But a nausea that I once felt under ecstasy - like if I had a air ball stuck in my throat, and I desperately needed to burp.</p><p>But now, under only piracetam and hydergine, here in my work, I´m extremely happy with what I feeling. Ideas flow easily, I have just written a cover issue that I´m really proud of, like once I was of every paper of mine. I´m the old me again, and that makes me feel extremely self-conscious and happy. I feel none of the posible side efects, like headaches or nausea.  The only thing I feel is that I´m alert, concentrated and thinking clearly.</p>"
