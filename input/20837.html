Took 0.5 mg klonopin at 8pm (for the state of the union address). Very relaxed setting of my living room after a nice relaxing day. This is my first time taking any Benzodiazepines. <br><br>
I was prescribed this to help with my fear of flying. Since I am flying out again soon, I thought I would test it at home to see the effects before I got into the air. I have taken Vicodin for flying before and it just made me feel disconnected and anxious. I am hoping this will be something different.<br><br>
I took the same dosage last night and didnt feel too much of anything, except feeling like my legs were kinda weak. But tonight I was doing my college algebra homework and finally had to stop around 1:30 because the horniness and the concentration levels had shifted and 'inequality number lines' werent as much fun anymore.<br><br>
After about 2 hours, I felt relaxed and a bit calmer. Its different from Vicodin in that this isnt a sort of heady, thinking drug. Its more of a fuzzy-wuzzy drug. Just sort of rounds all the edges away from the sharp demands of a day. About 1am came the horniness. It wasnt so much as 'I need to be penetrated' horniness, but more of an 'all over awareness of my sexual being' feeling. Its about 2:40am now (6.5 hours since I took the clonazepam) and the fuzziness has increased and the horniness has increased as well. I have some dry mouth and some dry eyes, but other than that, not a single side effect. I have been able to moderately continue to type without too much problems. I have lost track of some thoughts halfway through them. <br><br>
Its hard to tell if the anxiety wore off after time on its own, or if it was the drug. At 3am, I dont feel any pressing anxiety. Still horny, still have sea legs and quickly getting very tired. <br><br>
This has been a good test to know that just 0.5mg isn't going to help with my future plane trip, but that it is much more calming then the Vicodin was. I didnt feel all that anxiety disappear as quickly as I would have liked for a plane ride. So I believe that the next trial will be with two pills, 1.0mg. <br><br>
If there are any last words about this, they are that it lasts a long time.<!-- End Body -->
