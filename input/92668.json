 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nEveryone always told me that the effects of K2 felt just like the effects of marijuana.  From my experience, this isn't true at all.  The experience was surreal, and more likened to acid than weed.\r\nI'm not exactly sure how much I smoked.  My mom rolled it up like a joint, and we shared it.  I only took about three hits, before I decided I had enough.  My heart started beating out of control, and everything started feeling very, very odd.  It felt like acid, minus the visuals.  Everything flashed like there was a strobe light in the room.  It was really scary, and I hated every second of it.  Luckily, the worst of it wore off pretty quickly.  I'm not sure exactly how long it lasted.  \r\nI definitely don't recommend it for anyone.\n\n\n"
