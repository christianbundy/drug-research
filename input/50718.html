Subjects condition:<br><br>
Subject 1: Took it very easy on the beer and smokes last night so relatively good. Slightly 'just got up' feeling if anything.<br><br>
Subject 2: Mild Headache and slightly unsettled stomach.<br><br>
Time - 13:00<br><br>
T+0mins<br><br>
Weve just measured out 25gms each of Peruvian Torch powder. It looks like a lot of powder to eat Were going to try taking spoonfuls then chasing with water/blackcurrant squash. <br><br>
T+30mins<br><br>
After a failed attempt at consuming teaspoons full of the powder, the biggest problem with which was avoidance of inhalation of the fine dust, subject 2 hit upon the idea of form the powder into a paste, then consuming small amounts of the paste followed by water. This method was successful. So far. We now await a sign.<br><br>
T+1hr 30mins<br><br>
Both subjects report feeling slightly altered. Vision slightly altered though nothing definitive. Confident that the initial effects are being felt. Stomach feeling a little uncomfortable though nothing unbearable. More waves of suggestion whilst writing this.<br><br>
T+2hr 10mins<br><br>
Both in good spirits though no significant progress. I feel some MDMA like effects  constant grin (especially when watching Bill Hicks), nervous excitement, the yawns.<br><br>
T+2hr 55mins<br><br>
No change  Slight MDMA like effects thought nothing spectacular. Going for a walk to the shops.<br><br>
T+3hrs 30min<br><br>
Pleasant walk on a beautifully bright winters day. Slightly heightened awareness of colours and happily content with life.<br><br>
T+5hrs<br><br>
Both feeling minor buzz but not tripping per se. Having a joint to see what happens. All cool though and still enjoying the day.<br><br>
T+15hrs 20mins<br><br>
Going to bed now after a fair few joints, and a few beers. Still quite up but dont want to have to write off tomorrow totally. All in all a very pleasant day, akin to taking ½ an MDMA pill which lasts for 15 hours (pretty cool!). Will try upping the dose to 40  50 gms next time.<!-- End Body -->
