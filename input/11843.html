5-MeO-DMT  I would never have believed it had it not happened to me personally. Ive had out-of-body experiences before with ketamine and again with some particularly potent weed I smoked in Amsterdam, but none of these were to prepare me for where the MeO would take me.  I am grateful now that I bothered to read up on the past experiences of others who have used 5-MeO-DMT.<br><br>
I bought 10mg of MeO and was advised to take only 5mg for my first dose.  It came as tiny, white crystals and was relatively easy to split in half although I have to admit to being more than a bit skeptical when I saw the actual  amount of crystal that was sitting  in my glass pipe.  Being used to dealing with grams of material and pills usually, this was a totally new experience for me. But as they say... size is not everything!  That sentiment will never be proved more correct than this particular example.<br><br>
My bedroom was to be the place where I would begin my journey.  It was familiar and uncluttered, warm and small, covered with quilts and pillows and with a little, background music on. After talking over the potentialities it was time to relax and clear my mind in silence for 15 minutes.  I was now ready.  I was also advised to have a sitter present with me for my first time using this particular chemical.  A fellow medicinal traveler had agreed to be there incase I needed any help while under the influence.<br><br>
The base of the pipe was heated with a blow-torch cigarette lighter.  I had previously tried to use a normal flame lighter but all that happened was the glass bulb turned black and the temperature wasnt high enough or the heat concentrated enough to properly vaporize the crystals.  This time was different.  My sitter plugged the hole in the pipe and started to heat the 5-MeO-DMT.  I lay back on a mattress, holding the pipe in one hand until I could see the white smoke appearing.  5-MeO-DMT first melts to a clear liquid then with further heating starts the process of vaporization.  There isnt much smoke at all from 5mg, again, lulling you into a very false sense of security.  I unplugged the hole and breathed in fully, feeling the warm vapour gently flow down to my lungs.<br><br>
My heart was beating a little faster than usual:  I was excited and nervous.  Its a weird feeling as the effect starts to overpower you.  I felt like my head was being surrounded by needle-like probes, rapidly pushing through my skull and into the dark recesses of my mind.  At that point my sitter took away the pipe, I pulled down the blindfold from the top of my head to cover my eyes and lay down on the mattress.  <br><br>
I was completely motionless almost immediately... blissfully lost in infinity.  I felt like my body was deflating, my essence was being sucked from it.  At the same time, swirling patterns of shades of blue were occupying my minds eye, just how I imagined the beginning of the Cosmos, that elusive primordial soup, to look like... I  was being returned to that space and time.<br><br>
As the rest of my surroundings disappeared and ceased to register with what was left of my body without me in it, I could feel myself  (the word myself here is used not to describe me  my body and who I am in relation to the rest of the visible, material world that we all exist and interact in  but what is behind all of that...the driving force, the pilot guiding us, the controller of our own personal astronaut suit; my essence, my soul, my spirit, whatever you want to call it) being  assimilated into everything that exists outside of this 3-d construct.  I was being made one with the Cosmos and it was being made one with me.  I could feel the sensation of traveling through space of some sort but without having any form; moving in all directions simultaneously but yet just merely being.  I had no purpose, I had no shell, I had no direction, I had no vision, I just was.<br><br>
It gave me a wonderfully enriching awareness to know this, to be shown this.  I feel like I am not alone out there, that once I leave this tactile world, I am an indistinguishable part of everything.  My essence permeates places that I didnt know existed or maybe didnt believe existed.  Its hard not to believe that everything is connected, or can be connected by a force greater than us pathetic, mortal humans after you journey to these places.  It felt safe out theremuch safer than here.<br><br>
After 11 minutes the process started to reverse, almost as if Id now learned what I needed to learn in order for me to move forward in my quest to the next levels.  I was slowly returned to my body, gently and effortlessly.  This particular voyage was over but the start of something bigger was just beginning.<br><br>
After a period of about 15 minutes relaxing and getting my head around what had just happened to me I was able to stand up and move around, completely unaffected by the 5-MeO-DMTwell, in body anyway.<br><br>
Thankfully my mind has been irrevocably changed for the better.<br>
