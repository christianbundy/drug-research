 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was prescribed this med for peripheral nerve pain secondary to a broken elbow.  I was on it for at least two years.  When my extended health benefits ran out I could no longer afford it and had to stop after a very short taper.  <br>This is much worse than withdrawing from a benzo.  I have severe insomnia, depression, tight chest, sweating alternating with chills, inability to think or concentrate properly.<br>Anyways, it has been two weeks and I have only seen a marginal lessening of the withdrawal symptoms.  My Dr. put me on a diazepine (valium) taper to try to make it easier, but it hasn't helped much, not even the insomnia.<br>Word to the wise: don't get hooked on this stuff!\n\n\n"
