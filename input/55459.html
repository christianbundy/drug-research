I began taking Silene capensis in order to gain insight into my dreams, whom I havent heard from in months. Over a week I took an infusion of 1/2 teaspoon of powdered silene capensis 3 times. I mixed this with 1/2 cup warm water and agitated, drinking in early morning on an empty stomach, and waiting several hours to eat. During this time I would meditate on something or someone to allow me an experience, but I acquired no visionary dreams, or any dreams at all.<br><br>
I read a few reports of the oneiric aspects of coleus, so I decided to try it as well. I dried several leaves in the oven at 300F for about 20 minutes. Around 5:45 pm I smoked a medium size leaf, holding it in for about 15 seconds. I immediately experienced a mild buzzing, also in my eyes. I sat in my garden and for about 5 minutes I was utterly captivated by the play of light and shadow caused by the movement of the trees. I was unable to view my thoughts subjectively, and the darted around semi-uncontrollably. My hearing was also increased, and the sounds of the nearby street irritated me greatly. The effects disappeared in about a half-hour. I was disappointed at not being given more, and I foolishly proceeded to smoke three more leaves, to no effect.<br><br>
At about 10:30 pm, I snorted a line of approximately 1/8 of a 1/2 teaspoon of powdered silene capensis. Experienced very slight dizziness, and fell asleep at around 11 pm. I slept lightly and sporadically from then until about 3:30 am. Went back to sleep at 4:00 am, and recieved an extremely vidid, powerful experience. Woke up around 7:30 am, and proceeded to rapidly jot down the dream. Everything was still completely memorable, down to the most minute detail. Right now, at 10:43 am, I can still recall every segment of the narrative, every color, everything spoken, and every emotion it illicited from me. Everything was very strong.<br><br>
The dream itself was involving, intriguing, at times very frightening, and prophetic. I plan on extensively experimenting further with both substances, combined and seperate.<!-- End Body -->
