 "report": "<p>I have tried smoking Kanna a few times previously to this, but this time I decided that it would be much more economical to try it in a snuff.  I only had about 1/3 of a gram left and I took out about a point and used a card to cut the larger pieces of kanna away from the smaller pieces.  Then I took the stuff that was left over and three friends and I proceeded to snort small amounts by placing it on our finger and snorting it... we all did it twice each and got about maybe 100 mg of it into us... </p><p>At first there was a definite 'high' that was similar to snorting a very small amount of cocaine. I thought maybe it was just a trigger because I have not put anything up my nose for over 2 years, but my friends experienced it too. </p><p>What followed was a wonderful experience.. I felt somewhat like I was rushing on mdma, with just the 'high' and no palpations or mashing, it was great.</p>"
