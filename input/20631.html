I was nearly 18 years old when I had my first true high. Sure, Id tried pot before, meaning Id taken a few hits off a joint every now and then when I was younger, but probably never inhaled properly or smoked enough to truly get high. I was a big drinker in high school, especially at this time, as all my friends were. However none of them really smoked pot when we partied, so I was never exposed to it that much and never gave it much thought. Then I became close friends with Katie my senior year and she convinced me to get high with her at a New Years party.<br><br>
I figured, Hey, why not? To me, pot just seemed like another way to get fucked up, the effects probably not much different from those of alcohol, which I was very experienced with. So we rounded up a few of her friends and the five or six of us started passing blunts around in a circle. I told her previously that Id smoked pot before and never gotten high, so she taught me how to inhale properly on a cigarette. I learned (haha) and was ready to get high for my first time.<br><br>
The blunts just kept going round and round and I just kept inhaling and inhaling. I had no conception of how much was too much, so I just didnt stop and kept up with these much more experienced smokers. Finally they we were done, and for the first few minutes I was just giggly. <br><br>
Suddenly I turned towards Katie when she said something to me and the world felt very off-kilter. It was as if every direction I looked in, my perception of that space changed. I told her, Whooooathe world is like a compass with the needle broken. They all just laughed hysterically at me, and I was enjoying it, but then it got too overwhelming. <br><br>
I sat down and tried to concentrate, trying to make sense of what was around me. I suddenly felt very uncomfortable in the situation and said I needed to go inside. Katie and a few others helped me up the stairs and to a bedroom. Once there I sat down on a bed and my eyes adjusted to the bright lights. This is where things started to turn scary for me.<br><br>
Katie and another good friend who wasnt smoking sat down on the bed with me and were joking around, not really aware that something was wrong with me. Suddenly, the friend who wasnt smoking was like, Are you OK? Her words didnt make sense. It was as if shed talk and her mouth would move half a second later. I gripped the bed, trying to force the world to go back together, thinking if I could hold on, things wouldnt split apart like her words were.<br><br>
At this point more people came into the room. I was wondering aloud, How do you get a high to go away? and they just proceeded to laugh and laugh. I didnt want to be laughed at and just wanted to be alone and asked them to leave. Katie and Jessica stayed with me and I started to cry. Then I wanted a bologna sandwich, and told them to go get me one and to leave. I just wanted to be alone, and assured them Id be all right later.<br><br>
They left and I was alone with my thoughts. Time went by incredibly slow, and I began to pick up on things I wasnt previously aware of. There was a hamster in the room, and for a few minutes all I could concentrate on was the spinning of his wheel. Then on the cars outside, the most random sounds amplified in my mind. Then I started getting scared. I closed my eyes and couldnt stop visions. Everything moved in fours for some reason, breaking apart molding and shifting. It was kind of like a kaleidoscope I couldnt get to stop. I thought I was going crazy. I suddenly became aware of my teeth being hot (?) and I thought some ash was stuck in there burning my teeth, and I would die of released teeth toxins. I contemplated calling my mom. I contemplated calling 911. I started pleading with God. Finally I just wanted to sleep to make it all go away. But when I closed my eyes I kept seeing the visions.<br><br>
Needless to say I was fine in the morning. But I have never been scared like I was that night. It didnt turn me away from pot forever though. I smoked quite often after that with Katie, and we have had your typical hilarious, munchie-filled good times. But often times when I find myself in uncomfortable situations, usually with strangers, I get paranoia attacks. Mainly the first time I just didnt know what to expect and it scared me half to death. I completely underestimated pot. But now that I understand its effects and that it <i>is</i> temporary, I can enjoy myself much more. <br><br>
I am not a regular user, but every couple of weeks I will smoke. I have mixed experiences now. I have been high many, many times, and in these times have developed several theories when Im high as to what it feels like. Most often, its a glimpse into the way other people could think, or seeing different underlying aspects of life, be it good or bad. Overall though, pot has definitely been a good experience in my life. Besides that first scare, it truly opens up your mind to think in a different way, and see things in a different light. I see colors more vibrantly, music is an EXPERIENCE, laughter never stops, and foodwell yeah. =) Sometimes I do get paranoia or scared of visions, but I just have to convince myself to relax and take in the moment, and after that I enjoy it. I used to be a very tightly wound person, and weed has helped me relax more. That could be why I had such a bad experience at first, I just didnt know it was possible to think in such different ways. But it is, and when done in moderation, can be a very enlightening experience. I just have to control the experience, rather than it controlling me.<!-- End Body -->
