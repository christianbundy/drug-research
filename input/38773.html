I've used Tramadol recreationally for over six months. I can't help but compare it to Aldous Huxley's mythical 'Soma' in his novel, Brave New World. What it truly excels at, for me, however, is as a rapid-onset anti-depressant, a social condiment, or the catalyst to a memorable rainy day in which nothing really extraordinary happened at all.<br><br>
Even at the highest doses, the main problems with real opiates in general don't rear their head. Sociableness instead of apathy, affection instead of smacked-out bliss, projects turn to gravy, thoughts and emotions flow freely, negative thoughts or emotions are relegated to the back-burner for a day.<br><br>
Perhaps the most striking thing I've found is Tramadol cannot really be abused. If I take more than four 50mg tablets within a 24 hour period, I will simply experience flu-like nausea. Recreationally, I found Tramadol is ideally taken every 36 hours, and no higher than 150mg. I find 100mg to be fine, all around, as the mood-lift is ideal for working/social conditions. With this regime, withdrawal was avoided completely.<br><br>
If taken repeatedly, say, every 15 hours, the law of diminishing returns sets in, as well as some of the side-effects, such as irritability and lethargy, when dosage is finally lowered. re-.<br><br>
A friend took one 50mg tablet, and experienced heavy nausea and pressure in the back of his head.<!-- End Body -->
