I wantd to see what trazodone was like ever since I saw it in my medicine cupboard.  Well, it was bout 4 pm  and I snuck into my kitchen and into the medicine cabinet and took out 4 pills of trazodone which were 50 mg each.  I did not know what I was getting myself into.  I took all of them with milk and about 30 minutes later I felt the effects.  <br><br>
I was not feeling so good!  I felt like I was drunk, but it was not a good drunk.  With the drunkeness feeling came nausea.  I immediately told my parents I was not feeling fine and I ran up to my room.  I decided to watch some tv and that was all I wanted to do.  I could not get up or I felt like I would throw-up or collapse on the ground.  I went downstairs and got myself a snack trying to act normal.  If I would have walked another step I would have barfed!  I ate a little of pretzels and then just wanted to sleep. I fell asleep, with a horrible day awaiting.<br><br>
I woke up feeling like shit, the same way it was the night before but only worser.  I told my mom I felt sick and that I wanted to stay home, and so I did.  That whole day I felt like shit and wanted to do nothing.  By the end of the day the effects were wearing off and I was feeling better. <br><br>
The next day I felt very good for some reason.  That whole day I felt great and nothing could piss me off.  <br><br>
My experience was not good in my opinion and I dont think that I will try it again due to the drunken and nauseating effects.<!-- End Body -->
