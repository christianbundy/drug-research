 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nEver since I went to see The Queers in 1995 my ears have rung continuously. I realized that I would never experience silence again and was very sad. Luckily I heard that ginkgo taken as a supplement can help with tinitus (constant ringing in the ears due to exposure to loud noise). I decided to try it and for about a year took ginkgo . I do not remember the exact brand or dose, it was just something I bought at walmart and took a couple per day. What is remarkable is that the ringing in my ears decreased in volume significantly. \r\nI experimented with taking it for several weeks and then stopping and vice versa and noticed a lag of several days between the onset or decrease in effect. I emphasize that the effect was dramatic. Constant loud ringing like after a concert (left ear especially) and then a low ringing after taking ginkgo. \r\nAfter about a year I discontinued it and noticed that the ringing didn't come back like before. My ears still ring but not nearly like they did before. I do not necessarily attribute the long term improvement of my condition to ginkgo, but I can say confidently that ginkgo greatly eases acute tinitus. This effect has now been well verified in the medical literature. I noticed no effects on my memory or concentration whatsoever.\n\n\n"
