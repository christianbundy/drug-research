What happens when E turns out to be something else <br><br>
I would like to see you add some info to your site about what happens when what you think you are getting is E, but it turns out to be something else more potent and mind blowing.<br><br>
I was very naive and built up this whole myth in my mind about how E was here to save mankind and that it was divine. Not unlike the mexican's indian view of the sacred<br>
mushroom. I had tried other things before including acid, but E was what I was looking for and all other chemicals were inferior. I had had 30 - 40 good E experiences, never a bad one in the lot. I believed it was impossible to had a bad one, always the love and empathy were present. Other things had in the past sent me on a trip to the hell<br>
worlds, but never E. E was divine and from the gods.<br><br>
Anyhow, my source went away and I was without a connection. I searched high and low.<br>
Nothing. Then finally some little green ones came along. My wife and I did one, felt a little something, a slight bit of the love perhaps, must be weak need to have some more. BIG mistake. Nothing happened. O-well, try some more. About four hours later I found out what it was. What takes four hours to come on? You know. Acid. I was not expecting this feeling and I was more than full of the stuff. Just then my wife started getting some congestion in her thought and told me she was having problems breathing. 'O-my god I have poisoned her!' what am I going to do.<br><br>
For the rest of the experience I watched her every breath. I saw her DNA breathing. When breathed unevenly I panicked. In reality nothing was wrong, but I was already down this path and no reference point. Better get out of the house and get some fresh air. Hopped in the car, the road was a giant rubber band, the car a spaceship and everything was furry. My mind was a wreck, fear and paranioa, I was being poisoned the world was evil. After about 8 hours the normal course of that stuff, things started to calm down, although I could not sleep, I felt that we would live. I must have had a very massive dose, the visions were extreme and often disturbing and impossible to control. Without going into the details the thought loops were also very bad. Since it was not E someone had screwed me over, this had never happened.<br><br>
A feeling of total disillusionment followed. I was depressed for a while. Since then when I encounter a new source, I use exterme caution at first and test the ground. I don't want to wind up four hours later in the wrong state of mind. I have never shaken the experience and it still haunts me ( it really was a trip into hell where four hours were equal to 40). I am always very nervous when trying something from a new source. It is important for people to realize, the real thing is a very divine substance, but the devil can wear its clothing so to speak.<br><br>
Rule of thumb, if nothing happens on 1 and nothing happens on two. Stop. Wait four hours. It is better to be safe than sorry.<!-- End Body -->
