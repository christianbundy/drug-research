 "report": "<p>I have done weed most of my life since 18 (Im 27 now), Datura, Brugmansia (4 times each. Didnt like it at all any of the times), codeine based cough syrup (loved it), and SSRI for 2 years for bipolar depression to which in combination with Trichocereus Pachanoi is this report related.</p><p>The first time I tried trichocereus I was NOT taking SSRIs at that time) I put in a blender the green tissue of a 35 centimetres long cut of San Pedro. Pureed it, mixed with lots of a kind of bottled artificial lemon juice (it read 4% acidity, and the ingredients read: Citric acid, ascorbic acid, sugar and artificial flavouring). Boiled this cactus + pseudo-lemon mix for 1 hour. Strained the solids, discarded them. Let the syrup cool and proceeded to the most horrible experience of my life: Swallowing 250 cc of the most unpleasant textured, most horrible tasting thing I could have never imagined in my life. About an hour later the trip started. It was what I guess is called a Full blown psychedelic experience. EXTREMELY intense. Lovely from the beginning to the end. Totally life changing. Never, ever did I go into bad trip feelings.</p><p>A year later I started taking sertraline at 50 mg/day. One year after (a year on SSRIs already) I took San Pedro again. This time due to pure laziness I took the green tissue of around 15 centimetres of the plant and put it in a blender... spines and skin included. Concentrated it without any acid and drank it. About an hour later the trip started (this time I was with a friend). The trip lasted around 9 hours (same as the previous one).</p><p>A couple of weeks later took a larger quantity by myself (while still on SSRIs). And again had a full blown psychedelic experience.</p><p>The conclusion for my own particular case is that being on sertraline didnt affect the experience that much. Id dare to say that didnt affect the experience at all. What influenced the most all of the experiences was the surrounding ambience, the light. Exposing myself to intense light such as daylight or fluorescent tubes always inevitably stopped the experience, then when getting back to low or red coloured light the experience burst again.</p><p>But the absolutely MOST determining factor of both intensity and quality has been being by myself or accompanied. Im quite a lonely person, and tripping alone lets me flow a lot more, I enjoy both ways of tripping but being alone goes for intensity while being with somebody else goes for fun and conversation but always with less intensity.</p>"
