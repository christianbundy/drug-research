6:00 PM----I drank 4 oz of Robotussin Maximum strength cough syrup at Fred Meyers around 6 PM somewhere on the edge of the Pacific Northwest. <br><br>
7:00 PM----At home loading the groceries, the DXM began to take hold. I retreated to the computer/(anti-drug) parents room  and started to robototize rapidly . Surfed to RateMyThong.com and stared at the beautiful asses.<br><br>
Gave the ol parents a Master and Commander DVD so I could be left in cyber-peace. I love Erowid. Ive grown up with this site and Im proud of it.<br><br>
7:40 PM----Thought about Rubix cube and what we have in common with it. I just realized I am in a different life than I was in 2002. Maybe its all a big reality show and Im like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Nirvana is speaking to me.<br><br>
Ate (6) 25 mg Benadryl tablets. <br><br>
9:00 PM----Master and Commander is almost over. I will retreat to bedroom at sign of parents looking in my googly eyes and booting  my ass out for the |||| |||| |||| || 14th time. Good thing I have potential. Cannabis would be great with this high. If I had weed I would have black butter knives.<br><br>
9:25 PM----Cant you trip like I do? Fog in the computer room. This keyboard is hard to see with nothing but monitor light. Im so fucking high and my parents are watching Russelle Crowes British George Washington Wig-style Ship crews fight Napolean in the 1600s.<br><br>
10:00 PM----Parents are in bed. Watch TV with no concentration skills. Mind expanding as I smoke a cigarette and see a big ass white sheet fly by out of the corner of my eye. I am tripping nicely. Happy high. Motor skills altered if not somewhat hindered. Im getting tired.<br><br>
11:45 PM----Dont know what Ive been doing except for thinking and staring at things. Perfect combo of DXM and Diphenhydramine.<br><br>
Off to bed to watch the shadows and closed eye TV. Nice tripping with you. Signing out.<!-- End Body -->
