 "report": "<p>First a little bit of background. At the time of writing this I am 22 years old and a fairly experienced drug user, who especially takes a liking to psychedelics and MDMA. I have tried alleged LSD before (now I'm not so sure it was indeed LSD), a moderate dose of mushrooms as well as 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-B, 4-HO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 4-HO-MET and the almighty N,N-DMT.</p><p>Nowadays I am very cautious about being totally sure the drug is what it is supposed to be so I was very pleased when a couple of weeks back AL-LAD started making the rounds in the RC-scene. I saw an NMR and could confirm the identity of the sample so I decided to take a closer look.</p><p>At the same time a friend of mine offered me some real LSD, he said he had about 6 drops left and that I could eat 2 or 3 if I want. A couple of friends of my friend and my girlfriend who I will call M throughout this report went out to a lake surrounded by a beautiful untouched forest to enjoy bathing, tripping and sleeping in the woods. So far so good, I packed up the AL-LAD and on the first day I tried 1.5g of shrooms. Since the trip wasnt out of the ordinary I wont focus on that but it is maybe relevant in terms of tolerance build-up.</p><p>The next day at around 5 pm my first real acid trip began. I ingested about 1.5 drops of the acid (dosage not really known) and we proceeded to wash out the bottle and drink it between 4 or 5 people (I took a few sips so my total dosage was about 2 hits of LSD).</p><p>I first started to feel something at about T+0:20 when a very mild body load came over me and started tickling my extremities. Not really demanding and nauseating like it often happened to me on 2C-X compounds. It started building up from there very slowly, at about T+1:20 I was seeing the world enhanced, I would describe it as a state between + and ++. I found huge pleasure in wandering bare-foot through the woods, I lived in a big city most of my life so having all those huge trees and all the nature around me really was a new experience. I had tripped in parks and at that lake before (2C-B) but it never felt so good feeling the earth under your feet and hearing little branches cracking.</p><p>At about T+2:30 it stopped getting stronger and I was at a plus 2.5. Trees were wiggling, there was no wind and the lake reflected everything perfectly. It was a beautiful sight to say the least. At about that time the sun started coming down. I realized that I wasnt really interacting with anybody. My mind was racing with thoughts but I was unable to talk to anyone about anything because I felt ridiculous explaining the most simple of things. The other guys all had much more experience than me, especially with LSD since they always had access to this wonderful stuff. M was sitting in the hammock most of the time, she had eaten shrooms and wasnt very overwhelmed too so I decided to take her from our camp down at the lake upwards to a big rock from which you could oversee the whole area and where you had an amazing view. The moment we were away from the others we really started enjoying the trip, the pressure that makes you think you dont want to look stupid in front of others totally fell off and a few minutes in we were laughing hysterically at the way the forest looks like.</p><p>It all looked like in a fairy-tale. There was not a sign that humans exist, not a piece of garbage anywhere, not a single line of paint on one of the trees  nothing. In between the 30 meter high trees there were big rocks covered with juicy-looking moss. I tried telling M the story of Tischchen deck dich a German fairy-tale which I read lately and which was following me the whole trip. Being unable to hold a thought for more than 30 seconds is really a problem when you are listening to a story so I had to tell the story about six or seven times until she got what it was all about. After that we went back to camp and since we thought we could trip harder we each took a blotter of 150 micrograms of the AL-LAD. A friend of mine who took the AL-LAD in the first place said that the 150 micrograms were like a mild, comfortable LSD trip and that  for him  it was indistinguishable from LSD. This happened at around T+3:30 and I was still at the same level as an hour before. </p><p>It got dark an hour later and walking through the forest at night wasnt nearly as fun as when theres light. Everything seemed threatening and ugly, it wasnt really a bad trip but I could definitely feel that LSD can go either way. I thought a lot about if I find nature beautiful or not and I decided that its not easy to say something like that. I think many plants just look revolting and ugly. Then again a forest can be the most beautiful thing ever. </p><p>The AL-LAD enhanced the visuals gravely, all the trees started wiggling around and when looking up to the stars they quickly formed geometric shapes and systems. The visuals were very 2-dimensional though, not much depth as I have experienced it with DMT for example. The peak that started at T+2:30 lasted for another 6 or 7 hours and then I gradually was coming down. I usually have a headache after a strong trip but with LSD and AL-LAD I was feeling just a little exhausted and sleepy. The comedown was enjoyable and rather quick (which I like). All in all it seems to me like LSD is deemed the king of all psychedelics for a good reason: its highly enjoyable with (at least for me) no annoying side-effects to speak of. I am totally and absolutely in love with these compounds and I cant wait to try them again in a more intimate set with M alone.</p>"
