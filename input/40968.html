I was living in mexico for 5 months straight, previously bound to NYC metropolitan lifestyle my whole life.<br><br>
Once I got to mexico, I was somewhat careful on what I ate and drank.<br><br>
I've had digestive problems since I was a kid, however, on my last days in mexico I suspect it was a chicken soup that threw me over the border.  I thought I was going to die in the boonies of mexico: diahrrea and stomach pains for 3 days straight.  <br><br>
Luckily on the third day a friend of mine suggested I try two normal sized peyote buttons.  I had heard earlier of its astringent and anti microbial effects so thought it may help...<br><br>
After chewing and ingesting the 2 buttons (not a particularly strong dose) followed by a little clean water I felt tremendously better within a couple of hours.  Like new.  I even went to the bathroom like a man.<br><br>
It made my day and the next, both physically and mentally. Unfortunately, however, once it was out of my system. back came moctezuma's revenge. <br><br>
I took the buttons around 9pm, effects subsiding by the morning.  The rest of that day and into the evening I was fine and slept alright, but the following day came back the GI upset.  At least my mood was better for the next 2 days.<br><br>
I ate very little that morning and afternoon so that the buttons would have a stonger affect.<!-- End Body -->
