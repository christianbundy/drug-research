This experience occurred this last fall, but I suppose that I will never forget it. I have had experience with several psychedelics over the last few years, including lsd, psyllocibin, and mescaline. Out of these, I would have to admit that lsd is by far my favorite because of the hallucinations, both audial and visual. The mind trip is also wonderful, with its ability to wisk me away to several places in one sitting. But I soon realized that these woodrose seeds have the ability to take me to places that I shouldn't go.<br><br>
Being at my own home, I followed the recipe for preparation that is given in Lance Stafford's 'Psychedelic's Encyclopedia', which recommended grinding the seeds down to a powder, mixing them in water, then straining through a cheesecloth or coffee filter. As the book says, the amides of value are in this liquid. My horticulturist friend who actually grew the plants that these seeds came from gave me the same advice. He had recommended that I start with about six seeds for a good solid experience. I did this my first time and received effects similar to that of a small psylocibin high. Very minimal visual disturbances, along with obvious mind trickery.<br><br>
I waited a few days before trying it again, as I learned a long time ago that doubling up on any mind altering drug two days in a row. So when the time was right again, I made a mixture containing 12 seeds and downed it promptly. This time, I started experiencing wave-like sensations that were very lsd-like. For instance, while relaxing on my bed, I could visually see the bed ripple like water and actually feel my body doing the same thing. This was rather neat, and it compelled me to listen to music. I grabbed my headphones and began listening to the Beatles' magic mystery tour. This is cool, because in the opening title track they say 'The mystery trip' several times in the background. I fell into the music, and began to just float away without any real comprehension of my room around me. Somewhere in the fifth track, I fell into what can only be described as a conscious dream. The only thing was my complete belief that I was awake and in this dream. It felt more real than reality, in short.<br><br>
Except what followed was not at all like any reality I have ever been apart of, at least that I recall. If you have ever watched Jacob's ladder, you can start understanding that what I was experiencing was a strange twist on my day to day life. With every additional step forward, I fell further and further from a recognizable description of life. I will begin explaining this in detail. It was as if I was at a normal day of work, although work did not resemble work. Everything was somewhat different, yet seemingly the same. As time, actually time in hours into days, expired, I began feeding on some strange primordial urge to take out my anger. This manifested itself when I had an encounter with a person who I actually had had problems with in reality. I killed him and his girlfriend. Actually, I don't think you could use the term 'killed' because it was much worse than that. It was more like total and absolute destruction. I tore their limbs from their bodies. It was very, very grotesque. From this point, it only became worse. Substantially.<br><br>
Everyone that became a witness or I felt was in my way died. People that I really do know and care for in reality became a dismembered number. I actually had to enlist the help of a friend who, for some strange reason, was more than happy to help. He took joy in the murders; I only killed out of despair and fear. Finally, I came to the point that I had decided that there was no way out. Pure meat-locker shit. But, suddenly, I realized that I was actually still sitting on my bed at virtually the same moment as when the 'dream' began! A pure moment of eternity! I fell into shivers and a cold sweat, because for a time I still was not convinced that I hadn't killed those people. It took me a while to come back to a decent mental condition; I actually was glad that I was by myself.<br><br>
After this, I decided that I would not experiment with the woodrose, at least for quite some time. Actually, I have only dosed with mushrooms once or twice since. These experiences were much more positive than much of the ones that I have been through before, so I have theorized that this experience strengthened my inner constitution far beyond my previous disposition. I do realize that everything I experienced was a result of my hidden demons and deep seated fear and hatred. I feel that I expunged these feelings in the most safe and productive way that can be done. This has given me a new-found respect for psychedelics in general.<!-- End Body -->
