salvia + 5meo-dmt + caffeine<br><br>
--- Introduction ---<br><br>
Earlier today I had an incredible experience  perhaps my most profound (whatever that means) to date.<br><br>
Here are the basics.<br><br>
Subject:<br>
male, 38 years old, 225 pounds<br><br>
Substance/Dose:<br>
approx. 150mg caffeine (strong cup of coffee)<br>
then, 30 minutes later<br>
simultaneous dose of:<br>
2mg salvinorin (via 2, 25mg doses of enhanced salvia)<br>
about 10mg 5-meo-dmt (eyeball divided from 250mg lot, so + or  50%)<br><br>
Technique:<br>
Like in my last experience combining salvia and 5meo, I load the waterpipe with the salvia and sprinkle the 5meo on top.  I heat the bowl with the lighter flame to melt the 5meo, then place the flame above the bowl, drawing the heat down to vaporize and inhale the 5meo.  After a few seconds I lower the flame to the salvia and finish the bowl in a single inhalation.  Its a delicate process and I had a tough time finishing the dose because I hadnt thoroughly exhaled before starting.<br><br>
From here until the conclusion are my notes from the experience, starting with a journal entry that leads up to the dose, which serves to capture my set and setting.  Annotations are within brackets.<br><br>
-- start realtime notes --<br><br>
9:33am<br><br>
Very excited this morning, and rather stimulated after a cup of strong coffee<br><br>
I knew I wanted to try another experience this morning, to find the time, but in addition to finding the time, it feels right, and it is not often that both opportunity and the right time come together<br><br>
Its a Sunday morning; clock was turned back an hour.  ***** and ***** <names removed> are hanging out in bed.  I told them I was going in to my office to meditate and should not be disturbed, and that Id be out in about an hour.<br><br>
***** knows what that mean; she still doesnt like it.  Last night over dinner I told her my idea for a business based on providing a safe environment for people to have such experiences.  She said it was the dumbest idea I ever came up with and that she didnt even want to talk about it.<br><br>
So what do I want to accomplish this morning?<br><br>
Im trying the salvia and 5meo-dmt combination, but this time with 50mg (2mg salvinorin) salvia  last time was half that much.  The amount of 5meo is in the ballpark of 10mg, but could be + or  50% due to my eyeballing method of dividing up the 250mg lot.<br><br>
During my last experience, or in the reflections, it occurred to me that salvia plays with the fabric of human experience while 5meo plays with the fabric of reality.  Lately, Ive been fond of saying that my two heroes  Joseph Campbell and John Lilly  are two sides of the same coin; it feels, somehow that salvia is like Joe while 5meo is like John.<br><br>
While the 5meo experience is, by itself, interesting, it may not be as useful as others.  Playing with the fabric of reality means that ideas do not really exist  their playground has been obliterated.  And I like ideas.  Salvia plays with ideas  particularly the sense of self.  So by combining these two molecules I am, perhaps, trying to see if a sense of self can exist within the realm of the 5meo chaos  I guess you might call that a transcendent consciousness.<br><br>
I suppose this all sounds simplistic, but to me, naming things and categorizing things are just methods of organization and have no real basis in reality  whatever that is.<br><br>
Other than what I have just written I have no intentions.  Take me where you will.  I feel good, excited, and feel that I am doing something that feels very right for me.  I am open to arguments that it is wrong but havent really heard any.  (Ive heard declarations  this is bad  but not arguments explaining why)<br><br>
I dont like the vision of a future where widespread pharmacological manipulation is daily fare  unless we find/synthesize some new, particularly useful tools.  Instead, for now, such experimentation simply provides glimpses of many typically unexperienced slices of human conscious experience.<br><br>
9:51am<br><br><note: from this point forward i include my types notes taken during the experience. at time had hit enter key in rapid succession removed extra blank lines to make reading less tedious. as finished inhaling and drew fresh air on top glanced time. it was struggled press accelerating out of space.><br><br>

down<br><br>
fears of what!!!!?????<br><br><this next section is uncomfortable to share. when i was young used have in my pants and felt a lot of shame over it. here considered that some current inhibitions shyness may root connection those experiences. don know upon reflection if it true or not but strong idea at the time one had never really captured before. painful think about particularly an incident playing with kids same very enlightening.><br><br>
oh its you<br>
youre bad<br>
youre less<br>
your silly<br>
you have shit all over you<br>
youre diurty<br>
you smell<br>
youre vbad<br>
you smell<br>
shit<br>
making in your pants<br>
great just what i want to talk about<br><br>
maybe thats a connection<br>
to the shame<br>
and inhibitions<br>
bizarre<br><br>
My fear of people is fear that I am being seen as someone who they do not like because I just shit my pants and they want to run away from, like they did, I tried to play into the game to cover my pain and confusion and shame<br><br>
covering over shame<br>
playing the game<br>
I said, in effect, I am going to get you<br>
Im the monster<br>
the ugly one<br>
the one you want to avoid<br><br>
yes, try, marshall<br>
10:11 AM<br><br>
what is worth doing<br>
you must be prompted  remember that<br><br>
provide for health and safety so you and others can explore<br>
thats all that matters<br>
huge implications<br><br>
what is genuinely worth doing other than that?<br><br>
human evolution<br>
has gotten to where I am so healthy and so safe that I can do this<br>
survival is secondary<br>
dangerous thought<br><br>
perhaps tghats all humans can do<br>
explore<br>
and work toward health and safety<br><br>
all of this business and economy<br>
is it all required for health and safety and security??<br>
i just dobn;t understand it enopuigh<br>
the pricioples<br>
the dynaimics<br>
of econoinmy i guess<br><br>
if the goals is ONLY health and safety and security<br><br>
and that should perhaps be the only goal? <br>
along with exploration<br>
which means technologies<br>
which means industry<br>
which means<br><br>
this world of ours?<br><br>
im about 75/80% down<br>
very fully withing consusnes realuity<br>
90% really at 10:16 AM<br><br>
i feel that i have found it<br>
i didnt waste the come down<br>
but i know how to leverage it for real<br>
it must be real time<br>
it must be audio visual<br>
it is religion and performance<br>
it is ritual<br><br>
and you are afriad and have shame<br><br>
how can you get past that<br><br>
by having a safe psychological environment<br>
like friends<br>
what a concept<br><br>
who do you consider such a friend?<br><br>
a friend is someone you can be yourself with<br><br>
christ  didnt mean it that way  <didn mean as an example><br><br>
i am unable to be myself with anyone<br><br>
fuck, how do i change that<br>
by starting<br><br>
just be you<br>
just be you<br><br>
and *****?<br>
shell have to come along<br>
if you want her to and ask her nicely she will<br>
and if she cant, then she cant<br><br>
you must be open vocal<br>
youll sound crazy<br>
but some with <will> appreciate pieces of it<br><br>
wonder what singning would be like during this<br><br>
once youre playing  performing  you can do whatever, say whatever<br><br>
why havent you performed?<br>
lack of talent?<br>
maybe, but i think i have enough to get things going<br><br>
just do your part<br>
do what you do best<br>
dont fake anything<br>
no faking needed<br>
be honest with yourself and everyone else<br><br>
10:21 AM<br>
90%<br><br>
perhaps i dont form stronger relationships because i dont feel that i deserve love<br><br>
you are who you are<br>
you do what you do<br>
just be open and honest about it<br>
the rest will take care of itself<br><br>
yes, i really believe that<br>
or at least, i believe its a nice way to behave<br>
as if<br><br>
<br><br>
10:38am<br>
had a bowl of cereal, chatted with *****<br>
i feel 95% back, slight stoned feeling<br><br>
i like how performance became a solution to realtime audio-visual capture<br>
while not a new idea for me, it was reinforced in a new way<br>
before i was simply thinking of ways to combine interests<br>
here is became a more natural part of it all<br><br>
my transition from non-engaged to engaged is via this kind of performance activity<br><br>
speech recognition software could help as well<br><br>
elements<br>
	percusive typing, keyboard, drum  fingers, hands, arms<br>
	voice, speaking, singing<br>
	and the visual i guess that is me doing this<br>
	and the output of my activity  words<br><br>
For what it is worth, today's technique feels like the best so far  it felt perfect<br>
perhaps expectations were simply fulfilled but it genuinely felt like it combined the self oriented aspects of the salvia with the reality shattering aspects of 5meo-dmt.<br><br>
extremes in exhibitionism<br><br>
10:47<br>
about one hour later i feel 95+%<br>
id wait another hour before driving though<br><br>
-- end of realtime notes ---<br><br>
--- final thoughts ---<br><br>
The combination of salvia and 5meo makes for a truly amazing experience.  I think the caffeine ahead of time contributes as well; hard to know how much.  The space in which I was immediately propelled lasts only a minute or so, but of course it seems like a much longer time  as though the experience reaches completely past the idea and the perception of time.<br><br>
I have read, if I recall correctly, that chocolate (a MAOI?) might increase the duration of that first level.  (Found it: Terence McKenna has mentioned chocolate being a weak MAOI, which could be a reason for the popular habit of ingesting mushrooms with cocoa.  Perhaps I will try a cocoa-coffee mixture in the future.<br><br>
The positiveness of the experience matched the positiveness of my set and setting  very self-fulfilling I suppose.<br><br>
What did I get out of this experience?<br><br>
I have a very busy life, and these experiences  including this one  remind me to consider other paths and other possibilities.  They remind me of my dreams, of things I would like to do with my life.  They help me take stock of where I am, what Im doing with myself, where my head is.  It is all too easy for the months and years to go by so quickly.  Im fortunate to have an interesting career and it pays the bills, but there is so much more; there is the wonder of what existence and reality and consciousness are, and of what is possible to experience.<!-- End Body -->
