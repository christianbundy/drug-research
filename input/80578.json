 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy friend T and I took 710mg DXM each. After about 4 hours of tripping, T threw up. My mom found out, took us to the hospital, and the doctors drug tested me (without consent of course) six hours after ingesting DXM. I tested positive for marijuana, which I had smoked earlier. But I also tested positive for opiates and PCP. \r\nNote: It was a urine and blood test.\n\n\n"
