 "report": "<p>My friend T and I took 710mg DXM each. After about 4 hours of tripping, T threw up. My mom found out, took us to the hospital, and the doctors drug tested me (without consent of course) six hours after ingesting DXM. I tested positive for marijuana, which I had smoked earlier. But I also tested positive for opiates and PCP. </p><p>Note: It was a urine and blood test.</p>"
