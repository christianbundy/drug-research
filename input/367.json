 "report": "\n\n\n\nThis was supposed to be a below-threshold test, but ended up stronger than expected.\r\nEFFECTS:\rRelaxed but not 'tired.' \rFlushed face (almost like having run around the block or something)  \rSlight motor impairment (nothing 'heavy,' but making typing a bit of a chore)  \rZero logic impairment (fully able to play logic games competitively, do math, etc.)  \rSuggestibility (Easy to wander off into unsolicited conversation) \rConversational weirdness (Difficulty picking 'the right word' (A feeling of not being able to express oneself 'properly.' nobody else noticed this however.)  \rMinor hallucinosis (if you could call it that. he could not actually point out something and say, 'there, _that moved_.' it just SEEMED like stuff was moving. note: there was an earthquake at about the time he was having such thoughts.)  \r\nDURATION: \r\nno more than 6 or 7 hours.\r\nCOMMENTS: \r\nNo hangover was noticed. Sleep came easily. dosage was taken pulverized in gelcaps with milkthistle.\n\n\n"
