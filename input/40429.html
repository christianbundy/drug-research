Ok, so I finally received my 10x from my online supplier. I have only experienced salvia once before, when I was not too knowledgable about the plant and someone gave me wayyyyyy too much 15x to smoke, telling me it was a good dose. To make a long story short, level 5 effects, loss of self/reality, weird gravity, etc. It was pretty scary, but I still wanted to try again.<br><br>
Now on to my second time. In my room, I covered up all the windows in order to insure darkness. I took a pinch, ~.05g in my estimates, of the 10x and loaded up my bowl. I closed all the lights, laid down on my bed, and lit up. I had no problem inhaling all the smoke from this small amount of material, and I held it in for as long as I possibly could, probably a little under 30 seconds. I laid back, and waited.<br><br>
It was weird. Even though it was pitch black, I could see everything in my room. Except my room wasn't normal. My bed is in the back left corner, and it appeared that the right wall had been pushed back many many feet. There were these two entities present, didn't really get a good look at them or I don't remember anyway. It felt like they were taking something from my bed area all the way down to the extended side of the room, but I didn't notice any malevolent intent. I remembered thinking, 'wtf are they taking?', and I wanted them to stop. I said, 'This is good', meaning enough, everything is just fine as it is. Then I was suddenly back to reality, just feeling a little weird and a little itchy.<br><br>
All that happened in what felt like under 30 seconds. I was kinda frustrated. The entire time, I knew that salvia was the reason for these effects, and I distinctly remember thinking during the experience, 'Wow, this is nothing. I'm bored.' Also, it was over so quickly. So I decided to do something that was probably kinda dumb. I jumped up from my bed, and slowed down when I realized it was a little difficult to walk. I probably should have waited a little while, but I wanted to try again immediately. I loaded up the bowl again, this time with about 1.5 times as much as the first time. I laid down in the dark again, and lit up again, less than 5 minutes after taking the first hit. Now for the scary part.<br><br>
I don't remember much if anything from the beginning, but when I became aware I was in my room again. Again, even in the pitch dark, I was able to see my whole room. This time there were several entities in my room, my guess is they were smelves. They were busy working, I think rearranging furniture or something like that. Then I realized that in the corner of the room that I was in, the walls were lowered, so I could see over the top. And this is where I got scared: my room was no longer in my house!<br><br>
It looked like my room was in some big convention room, filled with other rooms like mine. The smelves were still busy, and I started yelling at them. I don't remember exactly what I said, or if I really said it, but I asked them what they were doing, why they were doing it, why me, etc. I remember sitting up and leaning over towards my couch and telling them that it was my room, and to stop. Then I started thinking. Usually, when I find myself in a psychedelic state that is scary and too intense for me, I can calm myself down. This time, no. I knew that smoking the salvia had done this to me, but the thought that things would go back to normal never crossed my mind. I thought I was in some kind of twilight zone, never to return. I was soooooooo distressed at the prospect of never getting my life back.<br><br>
Once I started to come down a bit, and realize that it was going to end, I quickly turned my bedside lamp on, to reassure myself that my room was my room again. When I was fully back to reality, I was very uncomfortable. Itchy, nervous, hungry, scared, anxious, tired, etc. All at once. I ran into the kitchen opened the fridge, realized things still weren't right, and took a swig of juice even though I thought it would do something really weird to me. I then ran back to my room, got in bed, tried to get comfortable for a while, and slept for ~4 hours.<!-- End Body -->
