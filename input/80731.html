I tried a couple of herbal smokes that were allegedly laced with JWH-018.  I liked them a lot, and I figured I could save money by buying the chemical itself.  I ordered 2g from an online U.S. vendor, and the package came within a week.  Id heard varying reports on what JWH should look like; some say brown, some say white.  Mine was a quite brilliant white.  <br><br>
I bought a Chinese milligram scale on ebay and measured out 2mg of JWH on it.  It was a very small crystalline piece, slightly smaller than the head of a pin.  The scale was cheap, so its hard to say if it was exactly 2mg or not, but hey, it was probably close.  I stuck it in a $20 vaporizer (also from ebay) and fired it up.  Nada.  The vaporizer was obviously designed for plant material, and was such that I couldnt get the JWH close enough to the heating element for vaporization.<br><br>
At first I was ticked off, thinking I got some bogus JWH.  Then, I decided to try something else.  I stuck some blue lotus (which is, as far as Im concerned, an inert material) into a small wooden pipe along with 2mg of the JWH.  I took four hits, and got quite stoned.  Very much like MJ, but somewhat shorter acting  I was back to baseline in about an hour and a half.  Definite body stone; it was difficult to do anything other than sit on the couch.<br><br>
Buying the JWH itself is much cheaper than going with the herbal smoke blends.  But, from what I hear using too much can lead to a very bad experience.  So, invest in a mg scale as well and youll still come out ahead.<!-- End Body -->
