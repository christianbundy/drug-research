 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis was an experiment.\r\nAt approximately 9:00 p.m., I prepared the liquids.\r\nTwo tablespoons each of commercial kava kava extract,\r\nhomemade marijuana tincture, and absinthe. This mixture\r\nwas put in the freezer to chill.  At approximately 9:30,\r\nI removed it from the freezer and added as much cold\r\nsparkling water as the total mixture.  It turned an opaque,\r\nswirling greenish color - the fabled louche of absinthe.\r\nI downed it in one gulp. The aftertaste was not as \r\nunpleasant as expected - the bitterness of absinthe with\r\nsweet anise overtones.\r\nI was at home, relaxed, with no pressing concerns.  By\r\n10:00 p.m., I was the only one still up.  My lips were\r\nbeginning to feel numb, the sign that the kava was taking\r\neffect.  I was feeling slightly numb in my extremities.\r\nBy 10:15 p.m., I was feeling quite good - even more relaxed,\r\noptimistic and peaceful.  I set up my Dreamachine (a homemade\r\ndevice that produces light flickers in the low alpha range).\r\nI then smoked a small bowl of high-grade marijuana.  As\r\nit began to take effect,  I sat down at the Dreamachine.\r\nThe visual effects came on quite rapidly.  The initial\r\nentoptic imagery gave way to a ceaseless kaleidoscopic\r\narray of color, shape and light, reminiscent of some\r\naccounts I've read of mescaline's effects.  I began to\r\nsee clear images within the swirling vortex, forming,\r\nrising up to full prominence, then being sucked down and\r\nreplaced with new ones.  My spirit soared as I began to\r\nsee _through_ the vortex, into a calm and glowing level\r\nmarked by a stable geometrical pattern. It appeared to be\r\nhexagonal, in glowing green and yellow - although colors \r\nsuch that I've never seen with mortal eyes.\r\nAfter some ten or twelve minutes of this rapt contemplation\r\nof the fiery fractal mandala that lies on the other side of\r\ndarkness, I got up, went to the couch and laid down.  Immediately\r\nupon closing my eyes, I began to see closed eye visuals (CEVs).\r\nThese morphed and transformed as inexorably as the ones\r\nbefore.  After settling in and becoming quite comfortable,\r\nI took up a whipped cream dispenser, exhaled, and took in\r\na moderate lungful of nitrous oxide.\r\nAs I exhaled, I could tell the sensation of air passing\r\nthrough my trachea had already changed. Inhale, exhale. . . \r\nand my body began to experience Pure Pleasure.  I felt myself\r\nascending the World Tree and emerging into the brilliance\r\nof the Living World.  Every joy and pleasure of mortal life\r\nwas a mere shadow or gossamer simulacrum of this experience.\r\nEven as I soared above the canopy into the clear blue beyond,\r\nI knew that gravity was pulling me back.  A long long descent\r\nback to my body, where simply being stoned out of my gourd\r\nfelt like being stone cold sober by contrast.\r\nI put everything away, brushed my teeth, took two ibuprofen,\r\ndrank a glass of water, and went to bed. Got up seven hours \r\nlater feeling fine.\r\nDo NOT attempt this if you are going to be in public.\r\nI intend to repeat this experiment, but not soon and not\r\nvery often.  It was an extreme experience.\n\n\n"
