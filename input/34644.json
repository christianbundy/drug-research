 "report": "<p>This was an experiment.</p><p>At approximately 9:00 p.m., I prepared the liquids.</p><p>Two tablespoons each of commercial kava kava extract,</p><p>homemade marijuana tincture, and absinthe. This mixture</p><p>was put in the freezer to chill.  At approximately 9:30,</p><p>I removed it from the freezer and added as much cold</p><p>sparkling water as the total mixture.  It turned an opaque,</p><p>swirling greenish color - the fabled louche of absinthe.</p><p>I downed it in one gulp. The aftertaste was not as </p><p>unpleasant as expected - the bitterness of absinthe with</p><p>sweet anise overtones.</p><p>I was at home, relaxed, with no pressing concerns.  By</p><p>10:00 p.m., I was the only one still up.  My lips were</p><p>beginning to feel numb, the sign that the kava was taking</p><p>effect.  I was feeling slightly numb in my extremities.</p><p>By 10:15 p.m., I was feeling quite good - even more relaxed,</p><p>optimistic and peaceful.  I set up my Dreamachine (a homemade</p><p>device that produces light flickers in the low alpha range).</p><p>I then smoked a small bowl of high-grade marijuana.  As</p><p>it began to take effect,  I sat down at the Dreamachine.</p><p>The visual effects came on quite rapidly.  The initial</p><p>entoptic imagery gave way to a ceaseless kaleidoscopic</p><p>array of color, shape and light, reminiscent of some</p><p>accounts I've read of mescaline's effects.  I began to</p><p>see clear images within the swirling vortex, forming,</p><p>rising up to full prominence, then being sucked down and</p><p>replaced with new ones.  My spirit soared as I began to</p><p>see _through_ the vortex, into a calm and glowing level</p><p>marked by a stable geometrical pattern. It appeared to be</p><p>hexagonal, in glowing green and yellow - although colors </p><p>such that I've never seen with mortal eyes.</p><p>After some ten or twelve minutes of this rapt contemplation</p><p>of the fiery fractal mandala that lies on the other side of</p><p>darkness, I got up, went to the couch and laid down.  Immediately</p><p>upon closing my eyes, I began to see closed eye visuals (CEVs).</p><p>These morphed and transformed as inexorably as the ones</p><p>before.  After settling in and becoming quite comfortable,</p><p>I took up a whipped cream dispenser, exhaled, and took in</p><p>a moderate lungful of nitrous oxide.</p><p>As I exhaled, I could tell the sensation of air passing</p><p>through my trachea had already changed. Inhale, exhale. . . </p><p>and my body began to experience Pure Pleasure.  I felt myself</p><p>ascending the World Tree and emerging into the brilliance</p><p>of the Living World.  Every joy and pleasure of mortal life</p><p>was a mere shadow or gossamer simulacrum of this experience.</p><p>Even as I soared above the canopy into the clear blue beyond,</p><p>I knew that gravity was pulling me back.  A long long descent</p><p>back to my body, where simply being stoned out of my gourd</p><p>felt like being stone cold sober by contrast.</p><p>I put everything away, brushed my teeth, took two ibuprofen,</p><p>drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Got up seven hours </p><p>later feeling fine.</p><p>Do NOT attempt this if you are going to be in public.</p><p>I intend to repeat this experiment, but not soon and not</p><p>very often.  It was an extreme experience.</p>"
