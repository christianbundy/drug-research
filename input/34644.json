 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis was an experiment.<br>At approximately 9:00 p.m., I prepared the liquids.<br>Two tablespoons each of commercial kava kava extract,<br>homemade marijuana tincture, and absinthe. This mixture<br>was put in the freezer to chill.  At approximately 9:30,<br>I removed it from the freezer and added as much cold<br>sparkling water as the total mixture.  It turned an opaque,<br>swirling greenish color - the fabled louche of absinthe.<br>I downed it in one gulp. The aftertaste was not as <br>unpleasant as expected - the bitterness of absinthe with<br>sweet anise overtones.<br>I was at home, relaxed, with no pressing concerns.  By<br>10:00 p.m., I was the only one still up.  My lips were<br>beginning to feel numb, the sign that the kava was taking<br>effect.  I was feeling slightly numb in my extremities.<br>By 10:15 p.m., I was feeling quite good - even more relaxed,<br>optimistic and peaceful.  I set up my Dreamachine (a homemade<br>device that produces light flickers in the low alpha range).<br>I then smoked a small bowl of high-grade marijuana.  As<br>it began to take effect,  I sat down at the Dreamachine.<br>The visual effects came on quite rapidly.  The initial<br>entoptic imagery gave way to a ceaseless kaleidoscopic<br>array of color, shape and light, reminiscent of some<br>accounts I've read of mescaline's effects.  I began to<br>see clear images within the swirling vortex, forming,<br>rising up to full prominence, then being sucked down and<br>replaced with new ones.  My spirit soared as I began to<br>see _through_ the vortex, into a calm and glowing level<br>marked by a stable geometrical pattern. It appeared to be<br>hexagonal, in glowing green and yellow - although colors <br>such that I've never seen with mortal eyes.<br>After some ten or twelve minutes of this rapt contemplation<br>of the fiery fractal mandala that lies on the other side of<br>darkness, I got up, went to the couch and laid down.  Immediately<br>upon closing my eyes, I began to see closed eye visuals (CEVs).<br>These morphed and transformed as inexorably as the ones<br>before.  After settling in and becoming quite comfortable,<br>I took up a whipped cream dispenser, exhaled, and took in<br>a moderate lungful of nitrous oxide.<br>As I exhaled, I could tell the sensation of air passing<br>through my trachea had already changed. Inhale, exhale. . . <br>and my body began to experience Pure Pleasure.  I felt myself<br>ascending the World Tree and emerging into the brilliance<br>of the Living World.  Every joy and pleasure of mortal life<br>was a mere shadow or gossamer simulacrum of this experience.<br>Even as I soared above the canopy into the clear blue beyond,<br>I knew that gravity was pulling me back.  A long long descent<br>back to my body, where simply being stoned out of my gourd<br>felt like being stone cold sober by contrast.<br>I put everything away, brushed my teeth, took two ibuprofen,<br>drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Got up seven hours <br>later feeling fine.<br>Do NOT attempt this if you are going to be in public.<br>I intend to repeat this experiment, but not soon and not<br>very often.  It was an extreme experience.\n\n\n"
