Unfortunately I came to understand addiction, by experience.  About 6 months ago I first smoked black tar (balcky) (I have never shot up, just free-based).  It was an amazing first experience.  On heroine I feel good, not because something is making me feel that way.  With weed paying video games or eating ice cream or music make me feel good.  With heroine I intrinsically feel good, I feel good just because.  I also tend to drift into what I can only describe as very encompassing day dreams.  I noticed that I became talkative; I have had many great conversations.  On Blacky I could have a debate or day dream about the wall with equal happiness.  I do, however, become irritable.  Loud music or a rowdy party is not a situation that will make me feel good.  <br><br>
I smoked a few times in as many months with no problem.  Over the summer I started a job taking phone calls that I really hated.  I started smoking to get high at work.  When I was high on blacky the job wasnt too bad.  So I smoked more and more, I ended up smoking every day for two weeks.  I was addicted and I knew it.<br><br>
To fix the problem I took a week vacation, I visited my girlfriend across the country.  During this week I went through mild, but still very uncomfortable withdrawal.  For about 2 days I could not sleep, my stomach was very touchy for 3 or 4 days.  The worst part was something I can only describe as darkness/pain coming from the very core of me.  I dont know that anyone that has not been through it can really understand what I am saying.<br><br>
After my vacation I came back home and went back to work intending never to try the stuff again.  About a week later I gave in and took a hit.  From there it snowballed and three weeks later I found myself in a very ad place again.  I was a heroin addict.  That was three months ago.  I have smoked every day since then.  My day does not begin until I have a session.  I have ruined almost all of my friendships and lied to the people closest to me.  I have spent all of my money, lost my job, and failed my classes.  My life was in ruins and I was but a slave to this drug.<br><br>
I never thought that I would be an addict.  That was something that happened to other people, to druggy with no ambition or drive in life.  That isnt me, a strait A student in high school and a 4.0 student in my first year of college.  I was preparing for a body building contest and running marathons vice-president of my fraternity.  I had a great girlfriend, house, apartment, job.....a great life.  In spite of all of that, I am a heroine addict.<br><br>
I have just begun to work very hard at quitting.  I have a new job and my life is beginning to come back together, but what I have lost because of black tar heroine cannot be replaced.<!-- End Body -->
