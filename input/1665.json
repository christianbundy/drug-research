 "report": "<p>I decided to check out Leonotis leonurus. I found only one obscure trip report on the net. I smoked it in a pipe like mj and it gave a pretty strong relaxing effect. First it was barely noticeble, but as I smoked it more, it started to effect me more. Maybe it takes a time to be able to feel the effect. I even made tea of it, which worked really well too. But this stuff is for sure a strong relaxant.</p>"
