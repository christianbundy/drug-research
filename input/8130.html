One day while riding a roller coaster at the local theme park, I was struck in the face by a piece of paper while going down the first hill. Today Id like to share what was written on it with you all...<br><br>
It was just a regular night of my teenage life, I had been smoking tons of marijuana in the past year, and considered myself a veteran to Mary Jane. But on this fateful night something went very, very wrong. I was used to smoking an ounce in the coarse of a few hours with my other 2 friends, will call them Bill and Bob. I had smoked with Bill and Bob previously that morning, same old high, same stupid stoner conversations about nothing in general, and same old cottonmouth.<br><br>
Bill had just gotten a 1/2-ounce from his mom of homegrown kind buds, the kind of erb Im used to smoking, 2 hitter-quitter, very potent. Bill had given me a 15sac for later when I go home. Now I was used to strong mind-altering substances like LSD and MDMA, and others. I knew how to handle situations while high, and was always responsible while high, even while tripping balls. But back to that night, I have a lot of energy in general and often use marijuana to relax and sleep good at night, so after watching the movie Groove, I decided to put an ambient trance cd on, smoke a bowl and just let the music take my away, my usual midnight routine. I consider myself to be healthy in mental and psychical states so being high alone never bothered me. I went into my little smoke den [Trippy paintings and posters, lava lamps, black lights the whole trippy 9 yards] that I turned my walk-in closet into. I then proceeded to pack a bowl, light my incense and grab the lighter. First hit was normal, started to feel light and calm. I had eventually smoked the whole bowl. What happened after the bowl was finished ill never understand. <br><br>
After staring at the carpet in amazement for about [or what seemed like 10 min] I noticed that I was higher than Ive ever been from marijuana. I said out loud [never have I talked out loud to myself while high] Wow! Im really, really fucked up!!. This kind of freaked me out, I then started to think out loud, whatever I though, I involuntary said out loud. I was starting to get paranoid as to why I was doing this, I then thought it was because of no distractions to focus on [i.e.: cds, TV, ect...] and stood up to go into my room. When I stood up though I got an incredible head rush like from sitting down for a long time, this I thought was hysterical for some reason and laughed for about 2 min straight. The whole time talking out loud to myself. When I went to put my cd in, I couldnt focus on the buttons good enough to work the cd player [this was very freaky because I can function fairly normal while high] I settled on watching TV. <br><br>
While trying to watch TV I felt this very strange, warm, tingling sensation in my chest. I though it felt cool but I instinctively felt my heart. It was beating at an insane rate! I started to panic [while still talking out loud]. I then realized that I shouldnt panic but instead try to calm down. I then lade down on my bed taking deep breaths and holding them in the exhaling slowly. This worked extremely well and my heart slowed to a relaxed pace [around 65-75bpm]. Then it became a little too relaxed. While feeling my heart, it was still beating slow but would stop for 1-2 sec then start beating again, then stop again. This scared the shit out of me. At this time I realized I wasnt just high, it was like I was tripping balls. I thought my heartbeat might be my imagination, so I felt my pulse in my right wrist. To my relief, it felt normalfor a minute. My pulse seemed more screwed up then my heartbeat was, it would pulse every 3-4 sec while my heart was going nuts because of me being scared. <br><br>
I soon gave up on trying to calm down. The more I tried to relax and calm down, the more I would get scared. I started to pray to God, to help me calm down, but I couldnt get out 2 words before forgetting what I just said. I was tripping HARD! I tried to read the bible the church people on TV sent me but could only get to 'On the first day' and then I would go illiterate. I tiered up thinking I was going to die. My heart was still out of control, my pulse wasnt even noticeable, I couldnt read, my memory was gone and my vision was full of slight pattering. I then considered going and waking my parents to take me to the hospital, but didnt want to get arrested or something. My dog came up and scared me shitless after jumping on me. I hugged my dog and started to talk to her. When I realized I was doing this I started to cry. I thought I wasnt ever going to see tomorrow. I laid down next to her and hugged her with one hand on my heart and cried softly. Then I woke up... <br><br>
The next day with my TV and lights still on, it was about 1:00pm I felt normal except for a fear burned into my mind, the fear of what went on that night before. I talked to my friends who smoked the same erb by themselves that night too, but nothing out-of-the-ordinary happened to them.<br><br>
Now, 1yr later, I have gotten over my fear of Mind-altering substances. I've done MDMA a couple times and tripped a few times. But havent smoked again. I'm going to try just a little erb with Bill and Bob this weekend and see what happens. I really want to smoke again but am too afraid. Sorry this is so long but I needed to tell my story and accept what happened if I want to smoke again.<br>
Well, wish me luck!<!-- End Body -->
