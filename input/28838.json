 "report": "\n\n\n\n[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]\r\nI was exploring in my grandparent's basement looking for pills when I happened upon a bottle marked chloroform. Despite the warning that inhalation was extremely dangerous and caused cancer I brought the bottle up to my room looking forward to a new high. I tipped it bottle over onto a washcloth once and brought it too my face, inhaling through my mouth a few times.\r\nI started to feel a little numb and funny so I stopped and the high quickly intesified into a nitrous like buzz. I felt extrememly numb and relaxed, and my whole body was buzzing like crazy. I also saw mild visuals, and sounds were echoing. The high overall was very similar to nitrous, but it lasted for about five minutes instead of thirty seconds.\n\n\n"
