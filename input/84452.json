 "report": "<p>This report is merely a warning, or rather an experience very different from any Ive read thus far, so Ill try to keep it short and sweet. </p><p>Me and my friend recently purchased some mephedrone online to give it a try while it was still mostly legal. We started off by divvying it into a little over 100 mg piles that we both proceeded to swallow. Within an hour or so my friend began to feel effects such as mild euphoria, heart pounding, alertness, increase in mood, talkativeness, jaw clenching and a somewhat uncontrollable twitching. All in all for my friend this was quite a positive experience. I, however, felt nothing more than a caffeine-like alertness but even then its likely that was placebo. Generally speaking, even as time progressed, the drug worked fine for my friend but did literally nothing for me at all. I was pretty astonished because I am not really a heavy or frequent drug user at all, so its not like I could have some sort of strange tolerance or whatnot. The doses were basically identical and they were from the same batch. It just made no sense. </p><p>I tried to think of any variables that could possibly have affected this result. I had used 200 mg of modifinil the night before for some studying but the effects had long worn off. I was somewhat sleep deprived and I had a slight cold starting to set in. With that in mind, I decided to test it one last time in a control scenario by tonight taking 250 mg of the mephedrone and again, pretty much nothing. Maybe 90 minutes or so in I suppose I was more awake/alert but nothing that couldnt be out of the ordinary. Overall the drug did basically nothing to me for some mysterious reason despite working fine for my friends. It just goes to show how true it is that peoples bodies all react different to drugs and in this case I was seemingly (and somewhat irritatingly) immune to this one.</p>"
