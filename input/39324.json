 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have been a fairly common user of almost every drug available for the past 2 years.  I have used mushrooms, ecstacy, dxm, cocaine, crystal meth, various uppers and downers all about 10 times apiece. I have also been a daily pot smoker for roughly 4 years.\r\nLSD was never really available to me though it recently has.  I have only used it a few times and on my fourth use I took a single hit that was of moderate strength and then another approxamitely three hours later.  After tripping for a very long time and eventually coming down and passing out, I awoke to find that I still had visual 'trails'.  It is very similar to the effect that the mouse pointer is capable of doing.\r\nIt has been roughly 4 weeks and I have ceased all drug use in an attempt to see if it would cause the trails to dissipate.  It has seemed to have little effect as I still see them on any fast moving objects.\r\nHPPD has not interfered with my living but it becomes very hard to look 'hand talkers' in the eye.  My focus tends to drift to the visuals that occur.\r\nI previously have been prescribed to xanax (used for recreational purposes only) and I will be attempting to use it as a treatment as I've read that the benzo catagories may have an effect. I hope that the benzo will have a dampering effect or that this problem will go away with time.  \r\nSince the other visual-inducing drugs never caused this condition despite excessive dosing and use, I would warn that lsd was most certainly the drug that caused this and that one might consider using other psychedelics if one feels the need to use them.\n\n\n"
