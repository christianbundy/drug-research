on this evening 100 mg of dipt was consumed along with a large amount of marijuana.  The effects that occured first were the stereotypical deepening of voices followed by slight visual distortions.  Sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether visuals are really there or whether or not they just exhist very vividly in your minds eye.  Either way patterning began occuring as well as an effect which seemed like changing of camera lenses every so often resulting in different views of my surroundings.  After a few hours i began to see the music playing on the stereo through winamp visualization like patterns in my minds eye.  Remember, if you like your friends don't play music like circle of dead children while your on large doses of psychedelic drugs.  The music in itself produced no real negative effects but rather made the atmosphere seem a little sour due to a bent pitch version of music which is a little dark for my taste in the first place.<br><br>
This experience was fun.  I suggest when trying this substance for the first time starting with approximately 50 mg.  Anything more might be a little uncomfortable due to communication becoming slightly difficult.<!-- End Body -->
