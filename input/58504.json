 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter first reading about propylhexedrine, I was curious, but also somewhat hesitant. From what I had read, it definitely seemed to have potential as a stimulant, yet there are many reports of people experiencing moderate peripheral stimulation. It seems increased blood pressure leading to throbbing headaches isnt all that rare and certainly an unpleasant side effect. However, curiosity eventually got the best of me and I gave it a try. I bought an inhaler at a local pharmacy. I pulled off the top and took out the cotton. Dividing it into two, I stuffed it into two gelcaps. The following was written as throughout the experience.<br>4:17 Took half the cotton in a gelcap. Feel normal, relaxed, its been a laid back day. Blood pressure (Bp) 125/71 pulse 74. Normally it would probably be lower, but Im slightly anxious just having swallowed something Ive never tried before. Just a regular Saturday. I intend to write a final paper for one of my classes. My stomach is empty.<br>4:30 Slight stimulation seems to be noticed. Could be placebo. Feeling slightly more focused and  motivated.<br>4:48 Definitely stimulated. Mild going towards moderate it seems. Second half swallowed. Feel energetic, want to get things done.<br>5:00 Bp 132/64 pulse 64. I feel clearheaded, but not as focused as I wish I was. Full of energy.<br>5:15 A general sense of well being is felt, but not much euphoria. Hopefully its still yet to have peeked. Feel clear and stimulated though.<br>5:35 Mostly the same, slightly more effects. Mild euphoria<br>5:47 Warm buzzing in the back of my neck. More euphoria, feels easier to get into things.<br>5:57 Bp148/76 pulse 60<br>6:17 Euphoria seems to be increasing. I feel happy to do anything I need to. Im hesitating on starting my paper cause im not sure where I want to go with it. A small shot of 25% alcohol was taken cause it seemed like a good idea. (This was not enough to have any significant effect) Tingles being felt throughout my body, my hair tingles when touched. Seems to come in waves a little bit.<br>6:48 Very sped up. Very pleasant attitude, been working on my paper some as well as sipping some tea. An increase in libido is noticed. 178/83 pulse 60. Hope the blood pressure rise will chill itself out a little.<br>7:02 Bp 170/94 pulse 62. Slight headache in the back right side of my head.<br>7:10 Went into 174/101 for a little but now back to 164/94 65. Its still high but Im glad its not going up. I do not really feel any significant negative effects from this however, I feel great. Im now going to stop worrying about blood pressure.<br>7:15 swallow 4mg of perindopril to lower blood pressure, though its not a major concern. At the moment I think the euphoria is lessened, but maybe its a wave or Ive bee worrying about my blood pressure too much<br>7:35 Bp170/89 pulse 59. Bp is getting better, euphoria is good but may be diminishing.<br>7:45 Still trying to figure out if Im past the peak, tingling still there, but I think I remember more. Jaw clenching is now noticed. Feel generally happy still. Finish tea hoping to give a boost. Bp165/89 pulse 64<br>8:08 157/87 pulse 63.<br>8:25 Effects are lessening. Not really hungry but going to try to eat.<br>9:28 Definitely on the downside, but no crash really. Still stimulated.<br>10:52 Still slight buzzing in my body present, but all the really worthwhile effects went away. Dont feel a bit tired or hungry (I did eat a sandwich just to get something in my body at one point), dont think Im getting to sleep anytime soon.\n\n\n"
