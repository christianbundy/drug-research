I've been suffering migraines for as long as I can remember. I've tried all sorts of aspirin and drugs, but the only thing that seems to help is a lot of sleep. And even that only works when I have 7-8 hours to devote.<br><br>
I finally got fed up and went to my doctor who prescribed me Gabapentin, which I had never heard of.  She warned me, since I had a history of suicide attempts, that this medication is extremely dangerous to overdose on. I was to take one 300mg capsule before bed every night for a week, and if that didn't help, I was to take 2 capsules. <br><br>
Since I had been taking this before bed, I never really felt the side effects. But the first night I took it, I felt like I was having a little trouble breathing. I just figured it was my mind and went to sleep. One pill a night wasn't helping so a couple weeks ago I upped to two pills. I forgot to take them one night and took them before work when I remembered. When I got to work, I was feeling a little dizzy. (Luckily I work as a receptionist and sit all day.) But I noticed I was feeling a sort of opiate high. My body felt good, I was very talkative and friendly. <br><br>
I have tried almost all the common drugs out there (with the exception of meth, PCP and speed), and I was growing quite fond of pain pills. But taking Gabapentin gets rid of my cravings. And I am now migraine free!<!-- End Body -->
