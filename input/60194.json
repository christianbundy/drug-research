 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis is an initial report on an 'attack dose' of pharmaceutical grade Piracetam. Two weeks previous I had started back on a DMAE regimen (4 250mg bitartrate daily). I also maintain a restricted carbohydrate diet with no sugar intake, and as Piracetam supposedly potentiates glucose levels, this was a curious situation.\r\nSummary:\r\n6:00pm(ish): Ingested 12 800mg capsules, on a semi-empty stomach. \r\n7:30pm: Slight bodyload. Pressure and warmpth felt. \r\n8:00pm: Vision and color acuity slightly sharpened.\r\n10:00pm: Nootropic effects present, mood overstability, undistracted, heightened attention span.\r\n12:00pm: I lay down. Oddly, though, despite being very mentally awake, I feel very physically willing to rest.\r\nComments\r\nPiracetam's inital effects seem to have three basic characteristics:\r\n- Mood nulling. The 'Mr.Spock' effect. This is actually a very curiously amusing effect, it is also one of the most noticeable. Informal emotional involvement, including music and sex, seems ancillary, distracting, and uninteresting.\r\n- Logical and associative thinking. Organizational, procedural, and logical tasks seem as blocks to be readily fit into respective places.\r\n- Logos. This is a clear nootropic effect. The symmetry of objects take on an 'interesting' appearence, however without any emotional or abstractual gravity.\n\n\n"
