A few friends and I had recently heard of the influx of ketamine, or K in our community. We decided to all experiment on it together in my friend Charlie's apartment. So it's me, Jim, his girlfriend Erin, Charlie, Andrew and Amanda, who made herself scarce the entire night. I'd snorted a small amount once and got a pretty decent but short lasting buzz that was mellow and relaxed. But we'd heard of the K-hole, which was a certain point the user would get to in which we were told control was lost and a person would be stuck in his/her own little world and pretty much stay motionless in a stupor. We made sure to snort enough powder to reach the K-hole, and it was nothing like we had been told. First Erin began to sing along to some music. Though her voice is soulful and rich, I happen to be a professional musician and composer and I recognized that her voice was quite out of tune. However, I hadn't exactly enough control to say it politely, so I stammered out something like 'Erin, your voice has so much potential, yet your singing just isn't right' She looked at me with the devil in her eyes, as she was so used to getting flattering remarks about her singing, and she said, 'You telling me I can't sing?' I thought for a moment and said, 'Well...yeah. That's exactly what I'm telling you!' <br><br>
All of a sudden, right then and there, I entered the K-hole in full. A mass of noise surrounded me as I barely noticed Erin grabbing a pillow and beating me with it. All of a sudden I felt I was a dictator, or a general from long ago. I think I felt I was Mussolini, as I raised my fist and pumped it back and forth, shouting that Erin was nothing more than a mindless pouty child and I hadn't the time to fool around with her little games and horrid singing. I lifted her and tossed her onto the bed, where she bounced and squealed for Jim to do something about it. Jim walked up to the bed as I was marching triumphantly from my latest victory in battle. He grabbed me from behind (I'd been headed toward the bedroom to wage war against the frightful Chipmunk Christmas Album that was playing there) and he said, 'You threw Erin on the bed!' I looked at him and spouted off frighteningly fast, 'Why yes I most certainly did and I'll do it again should the little foul beast of hate get in my way. What have you got to say to that?' He looked at me in the eye and he collapsed on the bed in a fit of laughter. I was not angry by any means, just pumped up and determined that I was going to have my way and that it would be so much fun for somebody to state otherwise as I would nonchalantly invoke my wrath upon them. <br><br>
Now that Erin and Jim were out of the way I marched into the bedroom with no further distractions. I heard all kinds of yelling in my ear...ahhh yes. These were my soldiers and officers getting pumped for war! I saw myself strutting along around the room with a bright red cloak and a huge audience. I didn't actually THINK that they were there. I recognized that this was my altered reality and I was going to live in it as if it were in fact THE reality. I got lost in my heroism and though I still heard the dreadful music of the furry cartoon demons, I was too caught up in my glory and power that I forgot about my conquest. I simply paced around the room a few more times, gave my people a salute, heard their emphatic chants and cheers, and walked out of the bedroom, which was now my kingdom. I then lost it as I re-entered the living room.<br><br>
A deafening white noise invaded my ears and I felt the urge to fight something, though I couldn't figure out what it was. I felt that I was some warrior of chaos that needed to bring doom upon an enemy. Then everything faded to a soothing, wavy calm. I walked into the kitchen, where Andrew and Jim were trying to have a conversation but they were lost in their own little world. I looked at Andrew. I began to hum a low-pitched note and I drew it out. Andrew hummed the same note. Jim frantically tried to carry on his bit of conversation and then said, 'You know what? Fuck it!' and consequently hummed the same note with us. Charlie came out of the kitchen and joined us, the four of us standing in a square, evenly apart from each other, filling the entire house with the low-pitched, perfectly in-tune hum. We maintained that note for about two minutes. Erin started to freak out. She grabbed Jim and tried to pull him away from the rest of us. Jim pressed his palm against her face and pushed her away while we continued our hum. Erin scratched and bit and Jim looked at me and said, 'Remember what you did last time? Do it again!' I said, 'Very well, continue the humming, for I shall return,' and again I picked Erin up and threw her on the bed. <br><br>
When I returned, everybody was too busy laughing at what they'd just seen to carry on the hum. We started to come down after that, and we entertained each other by saying the most off-the-wall things from our own imaginations that made no sense, hence, they were hilarious. The highlight of the night was definitely this mysterious hum all the males among us had gathered to perform. It had filled the entire house with a full, rich sound of magical proportions, and we'd all stayed perfectly in tune with each other. There was a sort of mystical experience we all felt and remembered about it, though we couldn't quite place it. I think it was just in the raw power and ability to band together and create something so profound despite being in our own respective K-holes, completely apart from one another. A unity, a clarity and a beauty was brought forth and remained for at least three minutes as we simply hummed one low note and brought a peace to an otherwise chaotic night.<!-- End Body -->
