 "report": "<p>I had one large cup of passion flower tea, and at first, I was mildly relaxed, and had a 'buzz'. After about 10-15 min, it kicked in more and my body felt very tingly. I decided to have another cup, and another 10 min later, I felt a warm sensation sweep over my body - especially my appendages. For me at least, the psychological effects were calming nerves a lot, and gave me a sense of well-being and appreciation for subtle truths.</p><p>I watched TV for a while, and this understanding was quite clear. The beauty of people, especially the opposite sex made me feel very comfortable and safe. I also went outside into my family's garden, and felt a wonderful connection with the plants and the birds enjoying the seeds and spacious trees there. It is also important to note, that while experiencing this plant, even though my mind was in a altered state of consciousness, I had clear thinking and a strong ability to reason. If anything, the calming effect allowed me to look outside of myself to be more objective about the world around me.</p><p>This plant does not give 'the best high'. It is a mild, yet potent teacher plant. It has a lot to teach, and is a great way to calm nerves, soften mental prejudices/blocks, while still giving a pleasurable 'high'.</p>"
