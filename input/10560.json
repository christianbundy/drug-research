 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHi, I would just like to give a little warning about Gingko Biloba.\r\nI am an 18 year old swedish student that for some time has taken Gingko pills. (pure EGb 761) Two per day. And when I for two days forgot to eat them I became Extreamly tired. (!)\r\nI didn´t manage to get out of bed at all for a day, hardly able to lift my arms, feeling tired for several days following. I meen I could get out of bed but in the same way I probably can run five miles at top speed to if I tried...\r\nI am now taking them again and feeling fine but I thought you should know the story.  I don´t think it´s such a big deal and I don´t know if this is a single case with just me but...  knowledge is knowledge.\r\nHave a great time and care about your friends and fellow people.\n\n\n"
