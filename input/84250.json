 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHere is some information on my psychoactive use, I am a regular user of Marijuana, Mushrooms, and Alcohol, I have done N,N,DMT, LSD, Ketamine, MDMA, Cocaine, Heroin, and many pharmaceuticals. I ordered a gram (1000+mg) ('99.5% pure') of JWH-018 from a trusted site. After nine hours of trial and error of finding a good dose (3-5mg) I was extremely 'high', I would say I did around seven 3-5mg hits (I didn't have a scale, so I divided my gram into around 400 tiny key bumps).\r\nNext day I woke up at around 11:30 am, oddly I was feeling great very energized (not like I would after a day of smoking some really nice bud). So I was like what the hell I'll just wake and bake (bad mistake), as I had forgot I woke up early in the morning and did a hit to help me go back to sleep. So I loaded up a dose about that I would say was 7mg (it was a normal dose and a half) that was my second mistake.\r\n (T)11:45\r\nAfter I dosed I smoked a cigarette, then I noticed something odd, I was the highest I've ever been in my life, it wasn't bad at the time...\r\n (T)12:?\r\nThen things turned for the worst, I started noticing some intense visual like I would get from mushrooms (things growing, morphing etc) that's when I knew something was wrong, I started getting this ringing in my head... it got louder and louder and louder, until I felt like there was a heart inside my head that was beating like a drum...\r\n (T)12:45\r\nI started feeling some nausea, so I went to the bathroom... last thing I remember was the room was spinning and it was like a full on mushrooms peak (colors and geometric shapes where moving all along my morphing walls)\r\n (T)?\r\nI woke up on my bathroom floor, with the drum beating in my head again at the loudest its ever been (I thought I was about to die) then suddenly it stopped, I was completely fine, I was not high anymore at this point (so I thought...) I decided I would jump in the shower, (taking a shower always helps me relax or calm a bad trip)\r\n (T)1:30\r\nAfter getting out of the shower I smoked a cigarette and sat on my couch and watched some tv, but for the next hour, every like 5-10 minutes my head would start having the drum beat inside of it and I would be tripping my balls off, eventually it went away.\r\n (T)3:30\r\nI eventually became sober (feeling great, and energized)\r\nMy brother had some of the same effects when he did around a 7mg? hit, except he kept seeing his closest door open (when it was closed) and some monster thing in there..lol\r\nSO some fair warning I would suggest NOT doing over 5mg of pure JWH-018.\n\n\n"
