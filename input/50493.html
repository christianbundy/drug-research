While looking on an internet site for herbal ecstasy, I came across these seeds which were described as having LSD like effects. I've had lots of experience with stimulants such as MDMA, Cocaine etc, but no hallucinogenic psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms. I've allways been interested in trying LSD but was scared off by possiblility of a bad trip. These seeds however were described as being much milder and a much shorter trip.<br><br>
They arrived within 2 days and I decided to do them that weekend. After reading the experiences on erowid I decide to take 6 seeds (the minimum amount of seeds which still gave positive results) using cold water extraction to try and avoid nausea. I removed the husk, mashed the seeds up in a mortar and pestle, placed them in a small bottle and half filled it with water then left it for 3 hours, shaking the bottle occasionally.<br><br>
I then strained the mixture, ate a small amount of the pulp (1 or 2 seeds) and threw the rest away, leaving me with a muddy brown liquid. It smelled woody, like my hands would smell when I was 10 years old and had been out climbing trees and playing in the woods. I mixed it with some fruit juice and and drank it over a period of half an hour on an empty stomach(2:00pm). It tasted quite nice, like blackcurrent ice tea. I'd say my mindset was pretty neutral but I was quite nervous.<br><br>
As I finished the drink I started to feel the effects, I felt slightly drunk but with a different sort of intoxification, I played on the computer for a bit but started to feel tired and not with it, so I lay on the sofa and watched TV. My girlfriend came in at that point and started making lots of noise which annoyed me excessively.<br><br>
Over the next 2 and a half hours (T + 1:00 - T + 3:30) The feelings intensified, I felt more drunk more tired and I also started to get flu like symtoms such as diziness, and it felt like I had a hangover. Nausea began to build and I went to the tiolet to see if I could be sick. I had one heave but nothing came out, as soon as I did that however I started to feel much better, relieving the nausea.<br><br>
I was now at the peak (T + 4:00) and while most of the effects were physical, I did notice some mental effects. There were some quite strong breathing of surfaces, strong light and shade changes and some sparkling of objects, I also had a couple of giggling fits, no increase in thought patterns though.<br><br>
It may have been quite pleasant had it not been for the physical effects which were still too unpleasant. I lay on the sofa looking out of the window for a while at the leafless branches of a large tree swaying in a strong breeze which looked quite nice.<br><br>
After this, all the effects described above started to fade gradually untill about T + 6:30 when I felt ok to eat someting. by the time I went to bed at T + 8:30 I felt totally normal, a little giggly still maybe, and I slept normally.<br><br>
Summary- I feel that the dosage I had was probably too low, and that there is probably a threshold I need to go over in order to trip properly and get rid of the nausea. However I will probably not be trying these again. A stronger dose will probably enable me to trip properly but I would still need to encounter the physical effects I had initially and stronger, in order to get to that point, which i'm not prepared to do as they were just to unpleasant.<br><br>
Overall the effect was one of being food poisened, or of being extremely ill, rather than being nicely intoxicated.<!-- End Body -->
