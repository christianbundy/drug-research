Dose: 200 mg BZP (benzylpiperazine)<br><br>
Setting: I'm on a two hour drive to visit my bf.<br><br>
Experience: with most other drugs, much experience with stimulants. First time with BZP.<br><br>
Note: I am taking corticosteroids for an allergic reactions (40 mg prednisone/day). I don't think that this affected my BZP experience at all but I wanted to note it regardless.<br><br>
1:45 am<br><br>
I am driving up in my car to Sacramento to see my bf. I've had a pretty shitty day -- running around trying to find a big paycheck that got lost in the mail -- and I'm tired from not sleeping enough, and just generally feeling stressed out and depressed. My fatigue is beginning to bother me a bit though, as I drive very poorly when sleep-deprived. I decide impulsively to take some of the BZP I have on hand...<br><br>
(Note: I do not recommend driving on a drug the first time you do it, and in hindsight I can see that my judgement was perhaps poor. Still, I am very experienced at driving on stimulants (and I drive better than normally) and I am safe driver in general...and I knew enough about BZP to gauge that I'd probably be fine to drive on it. Furthermore, I WAS feeling rather tired and it seemed like BZP wourld be better to drive on than sleep deprivation.)<br><br>
1:55 am<br><br>
I swear I can feel some effects already...I don't really know how to describe them...my head feels a little different, there is an uneasiness in my stomach, and overall I feel ever so sightly altered. It amazes me that I could begin feeling it so soon....my stomach is fairly empty, other than a handful of vitamins I had taken an hour beforehand....possibly these increased the absorption of the BZP?<br><br>
2:05 am<br><br>
Yep, it definitely wasn't placebo that I was feeling earlier...the same general 'weird slightly fucked up' feeling is growing. My eyes feel different, maybe like they are dilated? My neck has been bothering me all day and I notice a slight headache creep up towards the base of my skull...seemingly a result of the BZP.<br><br>
2:15 am<br><br>
At this point I am begining to feel some pleasant effects. Mild euphoria (not too different from amphetamine-like euphoria), a nice feeling in my head, though NOT in the same place of my head that I get a good feeling on amphetamines. I find myself wishing that the BZP sensitized this particular region of my head -- but oh well. I can still feel that nagging little headache too. My eyes continue to feel weird, as if they are wiggling around a bit, but they still feel tired. Overall, I'm still tired, which I find annoying as I was hoping the BZP would wake me up...<br><br>
I give my bf a call to tell him where I am and doing so definitely picks up my mood a bit. I put on some cds -- first Madonna and then Tori Amos -- and I'm having a fairly pleasant time driving along listening to the music.<br><br>
2:30<br><br>
Yep, I'm still coming up but I feel a (mild) body high now (some skin sensitivity in addition to an upper chest/torso glowlike warmth) and my head-euphoria is still increasing. The little headache seems to have dropped off into the background and while I am still aware of it it no longer bothers me...still feeling tired at this point. I'm also feeling slightly confused (as I do on a strong dose of MDMA coming up) -- I want to skip to the next song on my discman and my fingers get confused spatially, thinking there are three buttons when there are only two. This annoys me, as I don't like feeling confused (even if only so slightly) and I miss the clarity of amphetmine/methamphetamine.<br><br>
There is a distinct speedy quality to the drug (even though I don't really feel alert yet?) -- my thoughts are rushing through my mind more quickly, and my obsessive-compulsive thoughts and anxiety are noticeably worse.<br><br>
I notice that unlike on other stimulants, I don't feel insanely horny. However, about 15 minutes before arrriving at my bf's, I start feeling a little horny....I think it's mostly mental, though, and not related to BZP. On a side note, a few hours later we have sex and I realize that I am not gonna come...or at least, not without substantial effort. Sooo, BZP does seem to delay orgasm...<br><br>
3:00 am<br><br>
I seem to have evened out/plateaued at this point and I'm feeling in a nice place...not amazing, but pleasant and comfortable. I am still having some nagging thoughts but I've become more used to them.<br><br>
4:45 am<br><br>
At this point I begin truly coming down, though it is, like the comeup, exceptionally gradual. I have never experienced a more gradual come up and come down on any other drug. 4-methylaminorex is somewhat similar in its comedown but again, not as smooth. <br><br>
Interestingly, it is really only at this point that I stop feeling slightly confused, and begin feeling actually alert/stimulated/woken up.<br><br>
7:00 am<br><br>
I am at baseline now, and able to doze off.<br><br>
Next day<br><br>
No noticeable lingering effects or hangover. Noticeable but not severe lack of appetite -- comparable to low doses of amphetamine sulfate orally.<br><br>
I'm not particularily interested in trying this drug again, despite how cheap and available it is...not really because of any negative effects, but simply because there were few really positive effects. I might try it in a different setting and mindset, though, as that may have had some effect...Overall, though, I'd just rather do other stimulants...especially as I try to be moderate with my stimulant use...I want to save my getting high for better drugs.<!-- End Body -->
