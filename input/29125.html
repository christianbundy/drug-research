I am an intellectual. People often wondered how I got into drugs. My parents were devastated. They were ignorant. My mind is my worst enemy.<br><br>
I had been caught smoking pot at the end of the summer, well not actually caught, told on, and stopped. 2 months pass and depression begins to kick in. Then I remembered coffee. I drink coffee nearly everyday, I love the boost in mental activity and the change in my personality, and the enlightenment of my general attitude towards being alive, but I soon outgrew coffee. I'd heard a lot about Adderall and yesterday, after drinking three cups of extra-strong, black coffee, I decided that I wanted to try some. My good friend Mike has pretty bad ADD, and offered me 35 mg for free. I love my friends.<br><br>
I was psyched the night before but rather nervous. Thanks to the loads of information online my mind eased, and I was comfortable with trying a new drug. I had chosen to do it the next day in school.<br><br>
I woke up, tired as all hell, wishing I was dead for about the third week in a row. But then I remembered, this day would be different. I took a quick, relatively long, shower and made myself a cup o' java and headed for the bus. I was slightly buzzed on the caffeine, and I was full of apprehension towards what was to come.<br><br>
I arrived at school and saw Mike off in the corner and headed towards him. He slipped me the pills and I immediately headed towards the water fountain to gulp them down. I can control my emotions very well so I knew there was no reason to be nervous; I would not be caught. It is important to understand that I was not nervous at all about this experience, because I have heard it takes a lot out of the tweak. <br><br>
I popped the pills, headed to French. I was wondering if they had kicked in because I hadn't eaten anything and I was still feeling peppy from my coffee. I was wrong.<br><br>
About halfway through French class, 45 minutes after I swallowed the pills, it hit me. I was suddenly aware of EVERYTHING in the room. I turned to my friend Matt and started reciting the outfits of everyone in the room. My French vocabulary seemed to have tripled and I started popping off philosophical insights, in French, about a reading in the text book. All tiredness in my body evaporated. I felt warm and fuzzy. My feet felt like they were enwrapped in a warm blanket. My thoughts flew through everything that I could think of. I would have walked 500 miles, and I would have walked 500 more. No, I would have RAN them, and LOVED it.<br><br>
The bell rings and I am tweaking. This is approximately 50 minutes after consumption. My thoughts are clear and nicely connected, wonderfully dictated by my consciousness. I arrived at English to find we were assigned a five page, 8.5'x11' packet to read and have a quiz on today so I decided to test the drug. I open up my binder and begin to read the packet, our teacher gives us 5 minutes to study. I finish in under 3 minutes and talk to my intellectual friend David. We have a quick, well argued debate about the nature of intelligence, which as we determined, was evil. I could have had the entire debate with myself, as my thoughts seemed more objective and my bias seemed almost irrelevant. We watch a brief movie about Elizabeth, Queen of England and then take the quiz. I am 100% sure I got a 100%. I started using direct quotes on the quiz and was done nearly 10 minutes before anyone in the class. I was focused and loving it. Class ends, 1 hour and 35 minutes after downing the ups. I head to Gym.<br><br>
Can you say 'euphoria?'<br><br>
It was close to that of oxycontin, way back when I used to swipe them from my dad. If I died, it wouldn't have mattered, but as I put walking to gym, 'But if I did die, society sure would suffer.'<br><br>
I had great apprehension for gym. We were going to be playing volleyball, and I felt like a god. I knew that I could beat everyone in the gym at volleyball, and our team massacred our opponents, mostly accounted to myself. I was running for the ball nearly 50 feet away and bumping it all the way back to my team and running back to spike it and gain a point. I ruled and I knew it and I loved it. In the meanwhile, I was talking to people I had never talked to before. I met a bunch of girls and hugged a few of them. I don't know why, but I felt unusually considerate. I wanted to apologize to people I had wronged, something I do not normally do.<br><br>
3 hours after I took the best drug of a lifetime, I feel that I have peaked, but I am still feeling the effects. The warm fuzziness is gone but I am a polynomial factoring machine. I fly through my homework, get through my last two classes and head home.<br><br>
I never usually do much at home, and today was not much different. I fiddled on the computer, drew (which was REALLY, REALLY fun, creativity and perspective seems to have been enhanced), and watched 'Sorry,' Flips new video. I was still pretty hyper and went online to chat. There were no more awkward silences or trying to find a topic. I got punted offline 3 times for typing exceedingly fast. (For those that don't know, when you send messages too fast and close in succession, the network will kick you offline. Me and my h4X0r buddies used to do that to kick people offline, but they fixed it. It is known as 'scrolling.') This is 6 hours after consumption.<br><br>
It is now 12:38 am, about 17 hours after taking it, and I can't sleep, but I am fine with it. I haven't really felt a very harsh crash. Maybe it will come tomorrow, but I hope not. To anyone wishing to try this drug, definitely research it. I've heard accounts of kids in my school going into seizures and the like.<!-- End Body -->
