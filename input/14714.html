I was originally prescribed the drug for severe depression.  It sure helped me, allright, a little too much!  It put me into a manic state, which got higher and higher with each day I was on it.  The mania made me feel invincible, so energetic, non-stop talking/ moving/ laughing.  It felt great, especially after being so depressed for so long.  It made me feel like I can accomplish anything.  I would get up early and not even be tired from lack of sleep.  I would go out and exercise like running (like a maniac lol) without hardly getting tired.  <br><br>
The problem is that it just made me too crazy and I was bound to get into trouble with it.  So they took me off it and it faded away quickly.  But I thought, what if I just took a smaller dose than they gave me?  Wouldn't it energize me without making me manic?  So a couple years later (now) I decided to find out.  So I took some more and sure enough this is just what it did.  I felt happy, confident, energetic, optimistic, etc.  It was great.  <br><br>
But after a while it seemed like it was fading away, like it was all a placebo or the effect was just in my mind.  So I raised the dose but still no effect.  So I really don't know what to think of the stuff but I'm now going off it to see if I feel any different.  Another person I know who took it for depression also said that it made him manic.<!-- End Body -->
