Let me preface this by saying that I rarely feel compelled to write reviews, of any sort, of *anything*, much less something I could pick up at the local store.<br><br>
So I've been a chronic insomniac for years. Decades, really. The real trouble I've always had is the actual drifting-off-to-sleep component of rest -- I'd toss, I'd turn, I'd get up, smoke a cigarette, get a drink of water, and repeat the entire process over again.<br><br>
I opted to try Melatonin, in a 3-milligram pill form, after attempting Valerian (no go, by the way, and it smells like utter hell, too). I popped a 3-milligram tablet, waited a moment, popped another one to be safe, and waited about a half hour.<br><br>
A sense of drowsiness kicked in -- nothing that would really impede me from driving a car or anything, but it was getting noticeably difficult to keep my eyes open. So I headed off to bed and after a few minutes of fidgeting and getting comfortable, shut my eyes and tried to sleep.<br><br>
And sleep I did. Awesome sleep. Incredible sleep, where I didn't wake up in the middle of the night to take a leak or pet the cat or wander around aimlessly and bleary-eyed. I just slept, and dreamt, and woke up feeling more refreshed than I'd felt in years.<br><br>
My dream recall had apparently improved as a result, too, as it'd been the first time I'd actually remembered a dream in quite a while.<br><br>
I've been taking one 3-milligram tablet of Melatonin per day for roughly a month now, and honestly feel better than I've ever felt. I feel more awake during the day, and when I rouse myself in the morning, there isn't even an urge to go back to sleep. I'm just alert and awake. <br><br>
That's honestly never, ever happened before.<!-- End Body -->
