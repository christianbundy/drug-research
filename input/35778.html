Doc gave me Soma as an alternative to Robaxin (methocarbamol) for recurrent debilitating tension headaches, said take one every six hours as needed. Let me say from the start that I have some VERY odd medication reactions, so am extremely careful about what I take. I make sure people know what I took when and to make sure I check back in at a reasonable time.<br><br>
Next headache, I took one. OMG that stuff is the absolute all time best deterrent to abuse, it is AWFUL, worse than Robaxin in taste. I lay down, thought my head was going to fall off and felt like I'd had a stroke on one side of my face, kind of frozen, typical of my major headaches.  Muscles finally started to ease up, I rolled over and I passed out, but this wasn't 'sleep' by any means, it was unconsciousness, blank as unused paper and black as tar.<br><br>
The aftermath was a bitch.  All my muscles ached, I hadn't moved an inch in, wow, a solid several hours and the headache? Well, the tension part was gone, sure enough. The hangover was damn near as bad.<br><br>
I went back to Robaxin and have stuck with that, although it is losing efficacy as I develop tolerance over time.  I hate the dissassociation of many perfectly legit drugs, and strive to avoid the effect, I'm very attached to my brain and look forward to a long and fruitful association.<!-- End Body -->
