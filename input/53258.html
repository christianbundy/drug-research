The first and so far only time I tried acid resulted in just about ruining my new years eve 2005/6 that I had been anticipating for the better part of 6 months. Some friends and I went to a drum and bass gig a few towns away, we had each got some acid and extacy to take over the two nights respectively.<br><br>
Nighttime fell on the first night (new years eve) and my friends decided to kick things off by hotboxing the van and having a session inside. My first mistake was to participate in this. I should probably preface this next part with an explanation of my relationship with marijuana - it always without fail makes me incredibly paranoid, introspective and unable to do anything physical without great effort. The only reason I keep doing it is social pressures and the hope that the next time will be different. Unfortunately it wasn't.<br><br>
I managed to put the tab in my mouth before the weed overtook my mind. People who tried acid from the same source we got ours all marvelled at how strong it was, and I was recommended just taking half my tab. Not listening to this was my second mistake. My girlfriend took a full tab and I didn't want to seem like a wuss, plus I usually have a high tolerance for alcohol and other substances, plus I was keenly looking forward to the psychotropic experiences I'd read about. Bring it on I thought. Jumping into something headfirst is something I always avoid from now on.<br><br>
We went to go dance, it was about an hour to midnight, and I was beginning to experience the uneasy feelings of the weed I smoked earlier. 'Why the fuck did I do this to myself... AGAIN?' I thought to myself, coupled with many other anxieties relating to the fear of ruining this night when there was so much anticipation toward it. I lost my 2 friends I came with and was just dancing with my girlfriend on autopilot while my mind was blocked into an introspective loop. My attention nervously shifted from the DJ on stage, to the crowd in front of me, to my girlfriend, to my own dancing, and back again. I worried about getting lost, I worried about bumping into people, I worried about making a fool of myself. I waited and wished dearly for the weed to leave my system, but this was obvioulsy not going to happen in a hurry, there were people all around me blowing weed smoke everywhere. Pricks.<br><br>
My internal monologue continued its paranoid rant as I began to wonder about the acid I just dropped. What if this horrible introspection I was feeling was a symptom of this new drug I tried? I tried to think logically and came to the conclusion that was I was feeling was more typical of feelings associated with weed (paranioa, introspection) than acid (hallucinations etc.) So basically at this point I was praying for the weed to wear off and hoping the acid would treat me better. This was new years for gods sake!<br><br>
My already fragmented hold on reality began to worsen around when the countdown for new years began. When midnight struck, I had planned to give my girlfriend next to me a big smooch as per tradition. When this happened however, I realised what a fucked up state I was in. I suddenly realised that I could barely see and was struggling to stand up. I managed to plant one on her and mumble 'Happy new years' but I was so unsure of what was going on I feared I had just kissed a total stranger in front of her. I tried to keep dancing and ignore my weakening physical state but I eventually realised that I was going to faint if I didn't do something. I quickly left my girlfriend and went outside of the dancing area to sit down and rest. I clutched my head and curled up under a tree, waiting for some of this poison to leave my body. I probably looked pretty foolish to those near me but I was out of it to sit up in any kind of dignified way. I sat there for probably half an hour hoping like hell I got better so I could enjoy the music I'd waited so long to experience.<br><br>
My girlfriend eventually found me asked what happened. to my surprise when I went to reply, I had lost my ability to speak. It took all of my mental energy to muster a sentence like 'This, I don't.... bad.' The fact she was tripping as well made it especially difficult to communicate. I was feeling so awful at this stage my hopes for recovering and having a good night had dispersed and I just wanted it all to go away. I tried my best to tell my girlfriend to take me back to the tent so I wouldn't just pass out in the open and risk being trampled or frozen overnight. Walking, speaking, finding my way around, in fact everything was just about impossible to do, I felt like I was in a dream. I kept blacking out, and began to fear that I would die, either from overdose or exposure. At one point there was no doubt I had reached the end of my life, and sadly thought of my poor mother having to deal with it.<br><br>
To make matters worse, finding our way back to our tent was a nightmare. All our friends we encountered were tripping as well and were of no help - I remember thinking, 'Fuck, is anyone at this gig NOT ON ACID?'. We got there eventually and I had a drink of water and curled up with a blanket and finally gave into the urge to pass into unconsiousness I had been feeling for the entirity of 2006.<br><br>
There you have it. For me the mixture of weed and acid basically caused me to black out and miss a concert I had waited many months and driven many miles for. Thankfully I recovered for the second night and had a great time on extacy. I haven't touched weed since this, nor will I ever probably. I may try acid again, but at a much smaller dose.<!-- End Body -->
