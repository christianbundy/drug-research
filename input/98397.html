I have been consuming sinicuichi as an alternative to cannabis, and have found the two plants very disparate in effect.<br><br>
I am aware that the traditional method of consumption entails soaking the fresh leaves for a day in the sun.  Rather, I soak dried leaves in the sun for just a few hours, until the water resembles a golden sun-juice.  The taste of the tea is inoffensive, most like flower-vase water as another submitter has noted.<br><br>
The effects tend to set in as soon as I begin drinking.  Most notably, my sense of color is highly sharpened.  Drinkers of sinicuichi have noted a 'yellowing of vision.'  In my opinion, this is due to the finer precision with which one is viewing sunlight.  Light seems to take on substance, is soft and creamy-gold.  <br><br>
Sinicuichi is noted for its auditory effects.  I have not noticed these as much as the visual.  Sounds do seem softer and somewhat more distant.  Sitting down at the piano, a delicateness with and attentiveness to music is much easier to manage than usual.  I have experienced intense auditory hallucinations from cannabis use but have yet to from this plant.<br><br>
There is a certain dilation of general awareness, particularly of one's perception of time.  While watching TV, I do not hear a speaker's voice as sequential statements.  Rather, it all seems to tie together and I am momentarily unable to distinguish what they have said first.  This effect is not as disturbing as it may sound.<br><br>
There is a calm tranquility induced, but very little like that of cannabis.  This peace is very clear, and I am allowed to meditate on my problems with an enhanced objectivity.  There is none of the 'cloudy' or delusional awareness that comes with cannabis.<br><br>
Most importantly, sinicuichi imparts a sense of 'oneness.'  Listening to music I am unable to distinguish myself from the musician--the sensation is as if we are just alter-egos.  I am filled with an almost overwhelming sense of love, and get strange urges to handle insects nearby as if they are my friends.  <br><br>
All in all, I have found sinicuichi a valuable plant that is surprisingly obscure.  When drinking sinicuichi I often feel like a stately Mayan emperor, reclining in the sunlight.  The benefits of the plant are absolutely to be explored and made use of.<!-- End Body -->
