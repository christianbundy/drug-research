Lotus is an old friend, I have had many experiences with the flower of the Nile.  I started with joints mixed with weed or alone, then the tea, both were very relaxing and some visuals with higher doses. <br><br>
But every time I soak the lotus in wine for up to 2 days and consume, I get a stimulant effect.  I could drink a glass or 2 of the lotus wine and continue to drink the rest of the night without getting too drunk and little hangover.  I wanted to see how a larger dose felt so I soaked 10g lotus in 1/2 bottle resling wine (2 glasses), for five days.  On the night of the fifth day I drank the two glasses with some of the plant matter.  The mix was extreamly bitter compaired to the usual 2day soaking.  It had a dry aftertaste that the wine alone dosn't have.  The first effects were felt within ten minuets, the usual warm head (wine), and clearness of thought and a feeling of wanting to converse with everyone (lotus).  I am normaly introverted and like to sit quietly. <br><br>
Normaly it stops there and I have a great night.  But I kept going higher and feeling more energized.  It had only been a half hour since ingestion, and I was higher than I've ever been on lotus.  It felt like I had taken a rail of coke.  I had to walk around and couldn't stay in one place long.  I found myself pacing around my house and yard incredably jacked up.  My heart was pounding and my body felt like every cell was vibrating, strong CEVs and visuals 1 1/2 hours.  Then I droped down to a normal feeling of lotus and wine.  I cant stress how uncomfortable I was and I will not let it soak so long ever again.<!-- End Body -->
