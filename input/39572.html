It was a eulogistic experience, while feeling emotional charge and strike. this was my first experience with (AET) but I was not too nervous about talking it. I remember getting out of school and taking the train in Manhattan. I was going to meet w/ this friend of mine who had got Xanax and Zoloft for me. When I got to the city I gave him a call and went to his apartment. He showed me the things he had gotten and he asked me if I wanted to take some AET. I had no idea what it was, &amp; I was originally planning on taking some acid or smoking hash. Sadly neither acid nor hash was around and I was in no mood to walk all the way over to the Park just for some acid. So I decided to stick with the idea about taking AET, and I was very spirited when I found out how similar the drug is to MDMA.<br><br>
I took the AET around 5:30pm, it took about half an hour to start in. around 6:00pm I was totally fucking wired. I was sitting on the couch and could not feel my legs. The room got very dim and I felt a peaceful yet aggressive vibe. It was like a trance. It was like having dreams while wide awake. AET is basically a hypnotic induced drug, &amp; I was very easily sedated while on it. There was very mild euphoria which surprised me, &amp; the effects of Ecstasy were just way more vibrant in some aspects. with AET their is no bright light effect, colors dont get vivid they only appear with much more range. I smoked some haze that I found lying around to intensify the AET. when I stopped smoking I could feel the rush in my arms. I was not expecting the pot to kick into the AET that fast.<br><br>
Unlike E their were no comedown effects. I felt very pleased, I had no disappointments about anything from the AET, it was a generally all around good experience.<!-- End Body -->
