 "report": "<p>I have used Ambien on only 3 different occasions (once with alcohol, which was quite stupid.) From my 3rd experience (10-20mg, different doses at different times) with Ambien on, I have experienced mild visual and auditory hallucinations when sober.  The auditory hallucinations consisted of semi-loud beeps and cracks, and ceased a day or so after the high, however, I haven't done Ambien in more than a month, and I still experience visual hallucinations such as seeing translucent/ghostly insects fly past and around me (once I saw a rather large butterfly fly from my knee), as well as kicking something on the ground and realizing that it wasn't real.</p><p>Now this isn't exactly inhibiting my daily life in any way, I'd just like to make it known that Ambien isn't exactly a 'harmless' drug.</p><p>PS: This doesn't seem to happen to everyone, the guy I did these Ambien with hasn't experienced hallucinations of any kind whatsoever.</p>"
