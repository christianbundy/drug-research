 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had purchased some incredible (and incredibly expensive) mushrooms 2 weeks prior to this trip. The wait for the weekend was a long, but worth while one. When I met up with the rest of my friends (M, J, A, S, N, and K) they had already purchased their dose for that night. After smoking a few bowls and chatting about past trips, we headed inside the house to consume the mushrooms.\r\n8:00pm\r\nI had heard about soaking powdered mushrooms in lemon juice to increase visuals, and after soaking 1 gram of powdered mushrooms in lemon juice for an hour, I took it all in a shot glass, then consumed the rest of the mushrooms by chewing and swallowing. It was now 8:30 and things started to feel nice and slow and weird. I was staring at the carpet, and watching it inflate and grow, and I completely zoned out for about 10 minutes. After snapping out of this trance, I realized that J had been asking me for a CD over and over again for the past 10 minutes. I turned my head, and the shrooms were kicking in at full force. I looked outside and watched the night sky turn into a strange shade of daytime, then back into the night sky, and it kept changing.\r\nI could tell that this lemon juice method was working well, because I had never achieved visuals this vivid, this fast in previous trips. I looked at S's Pink Floyd shirt which showed a man sitting in a chair, beside a lamp, watching TV. I then realized that S himself was sitting in a very similar chair, next to a very similar lamp, watching an almost identical TV. This completely blew my mind. I tried to sit down and meditate, but the closed eye visuals were extremely intense. I kept seeing rainbow coloured pyramids with eyeballs in the middle (as seen on the back of a U.S 1$ bill) fly towards me.\r\nAfter opening my eyes, I noticed that S, K, and N were under the pool table. I huddled over and sat with them under it. It looked as if the bottom of the pool table stretched on forever and ever. I then looked at S's face, and noticed that it was completely upside down. He also said the same about mine. Right after, I received the most intense hallucination of the trip. I felt ice cold water dripping from my fingertips, and I looked down and ice water was dripping from out of my fingernails. I had no idea where this water was coming from, but it smelt like the freshest cleanest purest water I have ever smelt. I tried to drink some, but as I put my hand up the water dripping disappeared.\r\nS was complaining that the candle he was holding had melted to his hand, and had taken the place of his index finger. But after a few minutes, he didn't seem to mind. I left the pool table, and tried to sit down on the couch. I then ran right out of the room, into the bathroom, grabbed a bar of soap, and brought it back to the room. All of  sudden I shouted 'FUCK! WE HAVE TO GO! AT SIX O CLOCK! TO THE SHOPS! THE SHOPS! WE NEED SALAMI!' N then said 'SALAMI SHOPPING AT SIX!?' and we repeated that for a good 15 minutes. I looked at the clock and noticed it was 6:00. This destroyed me because 1, the clock was broken (didn't know) so the time had been stuck on 6:00 for the past few months, and 2, I couldn't handle the fact it was 6:00, because if it were, I would be salami shopping and not in this room. This confusion caused me to walk in and out of the room about 100 times. Every time I walked in the room, the same people would do the same thing, at the same time, and say the same things as the time I walked in before.\r\nAnother friend of mine then walked in the house, and for some reason I freaked on him about asking me for tea. This seemed very odd to him, on account of he didn't say a word to me, let alone ask me for tea. I walked away from him, and turned on the dryer.\r\nBack in the room, we all decide to put on coats and snow pants. We do this, and then sit by the fire place. After about 10 seconds of sitting, we remove all the clothing.\r\nWe repeat this entire sequence about 20 times.\r\nAfter more insane conversation, I start to notice reality coming back to me. Me and S go for a walk, and see more slight hallucinations as we go. As we get to the store, the shrooms hit me again, and I could no longer figure out how the buying process worked. I gave the teller $5.00, took a can of pop, gave him another 25 cents, put the pop back, grabbed 14 cents from the change tray, and left the store.\r\nAs we get back, the shrooms have completely worn off, and I attempt sleep. After about 2 hours of listening to music, I doze off and wake up tired the next morning.\r\nOne of my top 2 mushrooms trips for sure, simply because of the sheer insanity and ridiculousness of it.\n\n\n"
