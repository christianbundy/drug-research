Went to this trance rave at the Stratford Rex called 1500 micrograms with this chick and her sister etc. Started drinking and smoking weed straight away then dropped the three trips and drank and smoked loads more. At about 5am I bumped into a friend and he said 'have some k' so I said 'give me a line' and he just gave me a note and said snort it out of the wrap so I did. Sniffed as much as I could up each nostril one after the other, must have been about 0.5g, then immediately these sort of cogs rose up from the bottom of my vision, drowning me. I squinted watching the ravers bobbing and moving and the lights. I think I might have sat down or just slumped on the dance floor.<br><br>
I was in limbo, and I could see spirals coming at me with heads on the end. The heads were telling me 'you're going to hell' but I said 'I know hell hell doesn't exist'. To this they replied 'hell must exist if you accept the concept exists'. I knew I was going to stay in limbo anyway, and that the heads were wrong. The heads were in some way the beings responsible for the implementation of fate, though I knew they were just chumps for trying to control people in the physical world when they can always escape this control in their minds and dreams.<br><br>
Then I could feel hands on me in my dream, fully submerged in unconsciousness, and I came round to the sound of beeping, white walls and childrens drawings. There were two nurses, and I thought I was in the back room of the club. Then I realised I was in white chapel hospital with a tube stuck in my arm. I told them I wanted to leave and that I was fine and they said I had to wait for the doctor. I pulled the drip tube out of my arm and it went pop and all this blood spurted out of the hole, and I tried to get up and leave but they wouldn't give me my clothes.<br><br>
Then the doctor came and they put the tube back in my arm and I passed out again. I woke up at 9am and they let me go, and I was still shaking and stuff. Basically I passed out in the club at about 5am and they called an ambulance, and I didn't wake up until 9am, while the club had shut at 7am. That date didn't go too well, but pretty successful for a 4 hour full immersion k-hole!<!-- End Body -->
