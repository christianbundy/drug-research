Recently I acquired a bag of Ethylcathinone. I had tried the substance before - at a concert and really liked it - the euphoria was amazing. I split the gram I had, by drawing a long line of Ethylcathinone and then separating it into even parts, so everyone got an even amount of it. <br><br>
I met with a friend who had just took it an hour ago, and he said he never felt so good in his life. I had taken the substance before, so I smiled and became a bit inpatient to go back home and dose. <br><br>
I had smoked a joint about four hours before taking the Ethylcathinone and I believe the effects had completely diminished. I weighted out the half of the bag I had (I had around 200 mg) and ate it taking a glass of water to wash away the taste. I heard many reports of Ethylcathinone being very nasty to insufflate, but in my opinion eating it is worse as its taste is very bad. <br><br>
T+0:40 - I'm expecting it to hit me already, but nothing is happening<br>
T+1:20 - Still nothing happening except for stronger pulse<br>
T+1:40 - Chatting with friend who dosed the same amount at the same time as me - we decide to draw a line<br>
T+1:50 - Slightly stimulated<br>
T+2:00 - Pulse rate increases, music sounds slightly better<br>
T+2:38 - Drew another two lines of about 30 or 40 mg each. A bit painful, but it's a nice kind of painful.<br>
T+2:50 - Stimulated and concentrated, nothing more.<br>
T+3:00 - Friend tells me he's feeling the euphoria - I feel nothing.<br>
T+3:20 - Disappointed, go to sleep.<br><br>
In the morning I found it quite difficult to get out of bed, and I'm not sure if it has to do with the substance or going to sleep at 3 in the morning. My friend is about 60 or 70 kg in mass and is about 1,75 meters tall. I am two meters tall, also 70 kg, but very, very skinny. Just some additional information. Also, before taking the substance I ate meat for the first time in three weeks, so that might have affected my metabolism. Anyways, I would suggest not taking the substance orally, but drawing a few lines. I had 200 mg, but I was concerned about taking too much and started very slow. But that's just from a single experience, so don't take it as a rule. Peace!<!-- End Body -->
