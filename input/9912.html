Okay, Im sitting around one day wanting to get high. I have a lot of LEGAL options. DXM. Hmmmmm. Nah, hate the hangovers, heard about to many OD's. Nutmeg. Nah, hangover plus I vomit and my mom thinks I been drinking as usual. Mint extract (98% alcohol), My mom will know I've been drinking. St. Johns Wort. Maybe. Nah, its only fun with friends. Hey I got oneCATNIP. My cat loves it, why wouldnt I?<br><br>
I read that you smoke 5 bowls 4 a 'weed like experience.' I do to many sports to smoke so I chewed it like chewing tobacco. put a lot under my tongue and some under my back teeth and sucked. Began to feel a buzz ten minutes later. Then, I remember all cats do is smell it. So I put my mouth up to the box and breathed in (no I dont do inhalants). Holy Shit!!!!! I felt awesome. Plus I was really dizzy and couldnt walk right. And I was as happy as a hippy! YIPPY! It smells really good, too. It acted as a stimulant and everywhere I touch it felt really really cool. Color got lighter (like stankonia but no where near as intense) then darker then repeated.<br><br>
Overall, Im gonna do this shit... A lot. It was awesomely cool, and really fun. I want all people to try this cause its so fun. Not as much high as fun but I'm definitely high but just feel like I'm having fun!!! Its pretty tight!<!-- End Body -->
