This is the first time I have ever had a whitey. For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'whitey' it basically means you have a bad reaction to weed (or any other drug) and become very cold, drowsy, nauseous and feel distant from reality.<br><br>
I have been smoking weed regularly for about 5 months now. Usually 4 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. Since I have started I have not been without weed for more than 8 days.<br><br>
Now, I will explain the story.<br><br>
It's a Thursday night, and I have arrived at the after party of the school formal ready to get baked. I meet up with some guys and we go to the back of the house to construct a bong. We each have 2 cones then move away from the house as not to get caught.<br><br>
After 15 minutes or so we walk down to the back of the yard behind a large tree and each pack more cones. At this point I have had 4 cones and decide to stop. Also, prior to the weed I have consumed 1 beer and 1 can of Jim Beam and Coke and about 3 cigarettes.<br><br>
So, I head back up to the house and make my way outside to where the majority of people are. I light another cigarette and start talking to people. At this time, it would be about 5 minutes since I've had the weed.<br><br>
10 minutes after I've finished with the weed I start to feel a bit light headed so I sit down on a ledge. I guess my skin was starting to go pale, because one guy stopped in front of me and said 'Fuck man, you're chucking a whitey. You're gonna pass out and start spewing soon.' This gets me worried and I move to a chair about 1 metre away from me.<br><br>
It's now 15, maybe 20 minutes since I smoked the weed. This feels completely different to my normal highs. I am cold, very, very cold. Similar to the cold sweats I get after taking tramadol and falling asleep. I have a huge headspin which I do not usually get from weed, but I guess the cigarettes added to this. My friend gives me his jumper and I put it on and rest my head in my hands. I'm feeling sick and tired and still very cold.<br><br>
30 minutes after the weed. Sitting on the same chair, just staring blankly at the ground. People are starting to come over and ask if I'm alright. I do my best to tell them I'm ok and I just need to sit down and be on my own. Now, people have started pulling up chairs and sitting in front of me. This is not fun at all because they keep moving my head to look at my eyes which apparently were very red and bloodshot, more so than usual after I've smoked weed. People keep constantly poking at me and saying things like 'Let's put his hand in water so he pissed himself' or 'Let's draw a penis on his face.' This was frustrating because at this time I could hardly move or open my mouth. All I wanted to do was sit on the chair and close my eyes.<br><br>
50 minutes into it and the crowd is still big. Different people coming and going. Most of them are telling me how bad it is to have a whitey and all the things I can expect to happen. For a minute I start to feel better and open my eyes to look around. Then the nausea comes back and I close my eyes again.<br><br>
Shortly after this two girls come over to me and check my pulse, but they push a bit too hard and I have trouble breathing. This makes me even more nauseous and I aim my head over the side of the chair. Then, someone grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me. This is what caused me to vomit. But this is good, I feel much better now. Not great, but better.<br><br>
I am given a glass of water and some paper towel to wipe my mouth.<br><br>
Now it is maybe an hour and ten minutes since I have smoked the weed. I can feel the come down happening. My mouth is starting to get saliva in it, but still very slowly. I get up from the chair and walk over to the big fire and sit down. This brings my temperature back up and I start to feel good. At this time it is about 1:30 in the morning. Other people come and sit by the fire with me and I am able to communicate a little bit with them. I spend the most of the remaining time at the party sitting in front of the fire. At about 2:40 I get up and meet with my friends and tell them that we are getting picked up at 3. I am feeling normal again now. No sickness and I am able to talk. I almost feel like smashing a few more cones or having some more drinks but decide against it.<br><br>
It's 3:00 and we leave. We arrive back at my house and go to bed at about 3:30. <br>
I remember sometime in the morning waking up with an incredibly bad cramp in my left leg which lasts about 5 minutes. It reminds me of the cramps I get after I've taken Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, except a lot more painful.<br><br>
I awake about 12:00 and notice my left leg is still very sore and tight.<br><br>
Although this experience was bad, I think it is good that it happened (although it would have been better if it was not at a party) because now I know what to expect and do in the future if this happens - just sit down away from people, keep my eyes still or closed and just wait to vomit.<br><br>
This has not put me off weed, alcohol or cigarettes, but in future I will only smoke weed once I have finished drinking and not worry about cigarettes at all seeing as they give me huge headspins and lower blood pressure.<!-- End Body -->
