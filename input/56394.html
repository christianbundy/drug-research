I recently acquired a couple ounces of sassafras from a local health food store.  The woman at the counter told me the most common use was flavoring homemade root beer, but I had heard that when concentrated it was like a very mild, organic extacy.<br><br>
I started by dumping two ounces of the red bark into boiling water.  After about a half hour of boiling, I strained out the bark and boiled off a little more water.  Im left with about a cup of dark, reddish brown liquid.<br><br>
I'm a little sick today with nothing to do and ran out of all my keef last night, so I decide to give it a go.  I start brewing my favorite black tea: Darjeeling Mango.  Im pretty sure the caffeine won't detract from the effects, hopefully it will add to them.  After pouring the tea I add my usual one generous spoon of sugar, and then two generous spoons of the sassafras brew.<br><br>
T: 0:00- Tastes delicious! Mango with a hint of bitter root beer.<br><br>
T: 0:02- bye bye tea, even the chunks didnt taste bad.<br><br>
T: 0:06- playing team fortress now feeling slight body high maybe a little more than the caffeine.<br><br>
T: 0:15- Game is really fun, feel pretty floaty and nice, calmness spreading throughout me.  Laziness but I also feel clarity.<br><br>
T: 0:27 laziness increased a little, some nausea, maybe because I havent eaten anything, gonna go eat.<br><br>
T: 0:38 That food tasted almost better that when I'm stoned, and the sun felt great.  Im going to go put on some more black tea.<br><br>
T: 0:45 Im feeling sober now, although with a feeling of relaxation and wellbeing.<br><br>
In terms of narcotic value the dosage I took was not very effective, at no point did it give me extreme euphoria like I was hoping.  It did have a nice overall feeling, at that dosage it was like a wellness tea.  I feel relaxed and somehow healed.  I hope to get better results with a higher dose, or boiling of the water to make powder.  <br><br>
