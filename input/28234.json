 "report": "<p>Me being an avid user of marijuana I have struggled with failing grades in school. This was mostly caused by tests, I could not remember anything that I needed to. I had no trouble with anything else although I had a bit of trouble remembering names. Ginko Biloba was my solution. It has affected me is subtle way yet has changed my life completely.</p><p>I have been taking Ginko Biloba for about 2 months now. I have notice a LARGE increase of general energy, and my memory has increased 10x. I have gotten 90+ percent on all the tests I have taken after 2 weeks of taking ginko biloba 3 pills daily. I could not believe the change.</p>"
