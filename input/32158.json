 "report": "<p>After many unsuccessful experiences where I vomited violently before I could metabolize the brew, a few random chances, and alot of exploration I've finally found a process to get the most DMT per glass of Ayahuasca with the least nausea (I still got naseous though).</p><p>I don't eat or drink anything at a minimum of 6 hours before, preferably 9 hours before. On to the preperation. </p><p>Preperation time: 1 day and 1 night for processing.</p><p>Syrian rue has to be the most horrible tasting thing in the world, next to hungarian goulash. I grind my syrian rue with a coffee grinder, go to the store and get some gelcaps, open the gelcaps, spill the contents, and spend a helluva lot of time pushing grounded rue into them. I like to dust off each gelcap after I'm finished fabricating them as to avoid tasting it.</p><p>Ingredients:</p><p>1 fresh lemon</p><p>3 dissovable/grindable vitamin C tablets</p><p>1 ounce of mimosa hostilis (or whatever DMT plant you prefer) per 2 people</p><p>sugar</p><p>cut T-shirt</p><p>large pot</p><p>small pot</p><p>clear plastic/glass container to store in freezer</p><p>1. Put 1/3 lemon juice, 1 vitamin C tablet and 1/2 pot of water into the small pot </p><p>2. Throw mimosa into simmering water (don't boil or you run the risk of evaporating the dmt)</p><p>3. simmer for 45 mins</p><p>4. place T-shirt over the large pot as you pour contents of small pot into it. </p><p>5. place contents of the T-shirt back into another pot filled with the same mixture. </p><p>6. repeat 2 more times. </p><p>7. discard root bark after last time </p><p>8. feel free to filtrate again if the remaining mixtures looking kinda chunky. </p><p>9. place remaining liquid into clear container and let sit overnight in the freezer. </p><p>When your ready to consume:</p><p>1. Bring mixture out to thaw 6-9 hours in advance to injestion.  It can be microwaved but I prefer room temperature brew compared to hot brew. Don't remove the ice from its container as it will mess up the whole purpose of freezing it: sedementation. </p><p>2. When it has properly melted you will notice 3 sedementated components: a dark poop looking substance at the bottom, a slightly darkend liquid in the middle, and some nasty grey stuff floating at the top.</p><p>3. Use a paper towel and remove the crap floating at the top. </p><p>4. Top off the clear looking liquid into a drinking glass careful not to disturb the poop, add as much sugar as possible without making it a syrup, usually 4 spoons is fine. </p><p>5. Drink up but not too much. If I drink till I'm full, I vomit very early. I take only about 2/3 cup.</p>"
