 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Warning: While substituted phenylpiperazine and benzylpiperazines are known compounds used recreationally, plain non-substituted phenylpiperazine -- mistakenly equated with BZP in this report -- is not.]</p><p>Recently having just ordered some 1-phenylpiperazine Hydrochloride 97% aka BZP [although hard (in terms of convincing) to get, still legal in the UK], I decided to try the substance straight away (having been reading everything on it that the web has to offer). It was late morning and I had just essentially woken up. </p><p>12:45pm </p><p>As I had no way of accurately measuring the chemical and knowing that I was intending somewhere between 50 - 200mg I decided to fill a gelatine capsule which I estimated as 500mg and then empty it out cut it up into 5 sections and ingested just the one, I.e hopefully 100mg. I think the main problem was either the dosage was too high (accidently) and/or I had a completely empty stomach. </p><p>1:00pm </p><p>Feeling very panicky now, pupils very dilated, nausea and very hot. I was very worried I was having a bad reaction (like you hear about with mdma very rarely), and seeing as I have never actually had any kind of amphetamine or ecstacy I thought that this might be quite possible. Anyway, the next two hours were the worst, I had to strip down completely and use lots of cold flannels to try to cool myself down as well as controlling my water intake (not too much, not too little).</p><p>3:00pm </p><p>Start to feel a bit better, but still very dizzy. </p><p>5:00pm </p><p>It seems any positive effects are happening now, feel slightly speedy but in a more controllable way. </p><p>12:00 (midnight)</p><p>now feeling close to baseline but have been fighting what feels like semi-flu/cold like symptoms for the last few hours. Mainly headache, feeling flushed and dizzy. Pupils also still dilated.</p><p>3:00am</p><p>I can't say I feel in a completely normal mind frame but I feel tired and think I will finally be able to sleep. I just hope tomorrow morning is not brought with a migraine [as read about in other BZP reports] as right now I don't appear to have any kind of headache.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>If I am to try BZP again I would like to firstly have a very full stomach and secondly in a dose thats more like 20-50mg and NO MORE, also a proper weight measured by an accurate balance mainly for reasurance. </p><p>Also a side note, this experience may well have been a positive one because the first 2 hours on this drug showed me how important my sanity and health are to me and led me towards different thoughts about my personal use of such chemicals.</p>"
