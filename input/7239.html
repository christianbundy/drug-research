Firstly, let me say I have tried many different hallucinogens (LSD, PTP, 2CB, Mushrooms (4 or 5 varieties), Nutmeg and DMT.  Of all these, DMT was the closest to what I experienced with Salvia.<br><br>
I bought 1 gram of Salvia from a local shop in the UK, and a small water pipe to take it with.  Drove home, the sun shining and a warm feeling of anticipation.  When I got home, I cleared the front room up, drew the curtains and sat down on the floor.  Having taken DMT, I knew how fast the effects could come on, so placed about 1/5 of the phial (about .2 grams) into the bowl, set the bong on the table and readied the lighter.  I had seen the notes to have a sitter present, but again, having taken DMT and THINKING that I knew better, I proceeded to light the bong all aone in my house.<br><br>
I picked it up and took a large hit which I held for about 20 seconds, as I took the bong away, I noticed there was still a lot left, so took a second hit, placed the bong on the table, and as I did so, my reality began to slip away.<br><br>
It's hard now to describe what I was feeling (I took it about 1 1/2 hours ago), the first thing was I felt scared, I wasn't sure why at first, but then someone told me I shouldn't have taken the second hit, I didn't see anyone, but people were talking in my head.<br><br>
I looked at the bong and started to panic, I felt that I had done something VERY wrong, but did not know what.  I felt that I had to get out of the room, and quickly went up the stairs to my bedroom, here I laid down on the bed, I felt that I was getting sucked into the bed and would drown in the quilt, so tried to get up and go back downstairs. <br><br>
It was at that point that reality took a good step back and things started to go really weird.<br><br>
My left foot and leg seemed inextricably attached to the upstairs of the house, where my right foot and leg seemed to be attached downstairs.  I honestly felt like I was stretching and blending into the house, becoming one with it, I also felt if this happened then I would be stuck there forever.  I don't recall getting downstairs, but was suddenly at the kitchen sink with the bong.<br><br>
I was hurriedly trying to clean it out, and get rid of the evidence, it was only now that I really recalled that I had taken the Salvia, and as this reality struck, the effects lessened and I gained control of my body again.  I sat outside for a few minutes in the sun and really came back down, there was a weird minute or two where the 2 realities seemed to combine and I couldn't be sure what was real, then my cat jumped on my lap and I calmed right down.<br><br>
The time this elapsed over was about 20 minutes.  I wrote down the time when I took the salvia, 3.20 and it was 3.40 when the cat jumped on me and I remembered to check the time.  For another 20 minutes or so, my senses, especially sound and sight were heightened, and I felt slightly uneasy.  Within 1 hour of taking it, I felt back to normal.  <br><br>
It's rather strange, during the trip I felt very uneasy, scared, and REALLY believed I had done somthing Terrible, although I did not know what.  When I finally remembered that I had smoked Salvia, the scariness went away, as I just reassured myself that after 15-20 minutes it would all be over.  However, after 45 minutes or so, I looked back and enjoyed the feeling, there were moments when I felt I had every answer (if only I knew the question!) and the merging with the house, although very scary at the time, was also somewhat enjoyable.  <br><br>
Next time I do it I will have somebody present that I trust, probably my fiancee.<!-- End Body -->
