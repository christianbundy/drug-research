Last night, I decided to try smoking valerian root based on the relatively small number of reports I have read about using this method of intake.  The valerian root I used was in powdered form and was emptied out of a 1,600 mg capsule.  The bottle indicated that the capsules contained absolutely no additives whatsoever, just pure valerian.<br><br>
I filled a small bowl with the valerian powder (which smelled rather pungent) and sat down, ready for experimentation.  As I drew the flame through the powder, my lungs were filled with a very harsh and bad-tasting smoke, which I couldnt hold in for more than 5 seconds.  I instantly coughed out the hit, despite the fact that I smoke marijuana habitually (just about every day). <br><br>
Just to warn you, the smoke smells terrible and one hit can almost instantly stink up an entire room.  I took another hit, this time noticing that the valerian pretty much smoldered instead of burning cleanly.  This hit was smaller and I was able to hold it in for a while.  The bowl was finished and after 5 minutes I was feeling nothing, so I decided to smoke another bowl. <br><br>
The second bowl was bigger (even though I never finished it), and I was able to hold in two more good-sized hits.  After finishing the last hit I became slightly lightheaded (probably from the inhalation of such harsh smoke), and decided to stop smoking the nasty substance.  I felt a very slight amount of relaxation, but I have decided that this was probably a placebo-type effect.  I fell asleep about 30 minutes later, at my usual bedtime.<br><br>
Overall, I do not suggest smoking valerian root.  In my opinion, valerian is best taken orally, as it is intended to be.  I have achieved great results by orally taking one or two of the 1,600 mg capsules used in this experiment and suggest this to anyone looking to achieve mild relaxation/sedation or a better nights sleep.<!-- End Body -->
