 "report": "</p>\nI went to my friend's house one nite just to hang out, expecting the usual pot and liqour.  My friend knew that I was getting pretty bored of weed, it just didn't do much for me anymore.  So she got some coke for the nite.  I walk in and see her pouring wite powder on to a cd case and she smiled at me.  I knew exactly what it was, I had talked to her about trying coke for a while. My friend had done this plenty of times before, I'd trust this girl with my life.  </p><p>She took a regular playing card and put it over the coke, and pressed down on it, to crush up the rocks. She crushed it up really well and seperated a thin line for me.  She told me to figure out which nostral was the clearest and gave me the tube, then told me to be sure I put the right end in my nose, which I did. I put it in my nose, covering the other nostral and snorted the line she gave me.  I shook my head and sniffled a little, waiting to see how I felt.  After a few seconds I felt a little lightheaded, and I felt my nose draining back in to my throat. </p><p>After about 3 minutes, I did another line.  I stopped at four, I didn't want to over - do it my first time.  We started playing cards, and before I knew it, my front teeth went numb.  The roof of my mouth was pretty numb, and my hands were shaking a little.  I was petty hyper, but not enough to make me get up and run around, I was feeling damn good though.  Just having a good time, I didn't feel totally different, just really happy.  Unlike when I smoke pot, I can hold a train of thought easily on coke, and I can focus.  The downside, though, is that right when it wore off.. I wanted more.  We already snorted the bag, but I wanted more.  Everyone I know that tried coke did the same thing.  I didn't go crazy over it wanting more, but it sure would be nice.</p>"
