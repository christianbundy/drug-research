 "report": "<p>Voyagers/participants: A & B      Date: 9th August 2004</p><p>Timeset: approximately 23:45  23:57                   </p><p>Dose: 3.5grams Syrian rue ingested 1hour prior to ingestion of mushrooms, 7 grams dried Psilocybe Cubensis consumed within hot chocolate. 3 bulbs of Nitrous Oxide and one hit of Salvia 5x extract.</p><p>Setting: near by village, (scenic, one of the most beautiful places in England)</p><p>Mindset: Positive, experience previously arranged for the day before however my friends foot complications made a delay. This was the first time this particular friend and I were tripping alone together for along time. He was the first ever person I tripped with and I was the first person he ever tripped with. We feel quite 'connected' as a result of the experimentation with psychedelics. </p><p>The Experience:</p><p>The mushrooms were anxiously made into magic chocolate before ingestion making sure to have ingested the Syrian Rue about 1 hour prior to dosing Teonancatl.</p><p>As we left for our journey the feeling was slightly elated and satisfactory. My normal everyday perception had been once again charged with a beautiful, happy and enigmatic contrast; which bore no resemblance to what we see in our everyday lives. Everything was full of infinite depth; the smallest insect or drop of water was ringing with eternity.</p><p>We walked away from the house to be met by a mechanical grinding as if a machine was eating the Earth; we endeavored to discover what this strange, alien noise was coming from and hence walked towards the domineering sounds direction. We ended up at a railway station with a large behemoth of a machine cleaning the railway lines. </p><p>Auras were now becoming more and more apparent on the orange street lamps. The body load from the mushrooms was a slight discomfort; however, we trudged towards the river; talking of our metaphysical knowledge and discussing meaningful things within our lives. As we came upon the river we looked into the tranquil water glistening with the light reflected from the road. Our minds had become Pandoras box absolutely everything we could have ever wanted was with us locked inside the magnificent human brain; chaos, bliss and ecstasy: what we see in our everyday lives was what we decided to see. We headed of down a dark path towards some benches and sat. Normally the reduced light would create a darkened and frightening atmosphere but this time we were at one with what we were feeling. The dose we took was not small and I began to think I maybe wouldnt be able to handle it, this feeling passed surprisingly quickly. After smoking a couple of cigarettes we decided to set off once again.</p><p>We walked and again gazed at the glistening light on the river. We set off walking to absolutely no-where in particular just mindless wandering. By walking around we felt a multitude of different atmospheres, emotions and realizations. We decided then to walk down a very dark alley in which I saw something (yellowish light) passing just below my waist level, I was again in the familiar world of hallucinations where I so longed to be. </p><p>In gazing into nature a trip through time and evolution took place bearing the contrast between man and nature. A spider sat centered in the core of its web which had been made visible by the previous rain: the spider would sit there waiting for its prey long after we left; the chains of life became perceived and comprehended in our own brain thanks to the divine psychedelic chemical. </p><p>All creatures have existed eternally in the divine essence, as in their exemplar. So far as they conform to the divine idea, all beings were, before their creation, one thing with the essence of God. (God creates into time what was and is in eternity.) Eternally, all creatures are God in God. So far as they are in God, they are the same life, the same essence, the same power, the same one and nothing less.</p><p> - Suso</p><p>The feeling we had for the first hour and a half was not the normal mind-fuck that we were used to, it was a serene and tranquil atmosphere I attributed this to our favorite setting and the fact that we were tripping together again. We did not smoke any cannabis in the come-up and as a consequence it made the trip a lot clearer and cleaner. As we were on the move for the most part of the trip, music did not play a vital role as it would normally.</p><p>At this stage the body load was most discomforting and so we decided to head back to the benches. We walked through a graveyard with the gate left open; it was as if it was left open for us and us alone. I stared into the direction we were going and sudden confusion of not knowing where I was and where I was going became apparent but soon passed as I familiarized myself with the new and abstract landscape I was experiencing. On greeting the River once again I felt at home; the blood of the Earth was flowing past us shimmering in light. We sat and smoked some light cannabis bearing in mind to smoke the potent green a bit later. As I stared into the river the streetlight morphed on the surface of the water and as I blew the smoke the reflected light flickered within the cloud of sweet smelling cannabis. As we proceeded down the darkening path a building set in an enclosure by the riverside was giving off some awesome light that made us gaze into it. Everything became pixilated to quite a degree at this point.</p><p>As we approached the benches it was a good hour and a half into the trip. The effects at this stage were quite apparent; however, little visuals were seen and so we thought that a nice amount of strong marijuana would do the trick. I do recall slight spirals and a red dot entering my vision at this stage but I wanted to go further. We smoked two joints and were very aware that the trip was increasing in its intensity. We talked and concluded that the two of us together provided the exact right atmosphere i.e. not too many people to talk to but enough to be alone and relish in cosmic existence. What was about to come was un-imaginable.</p><p>We loaded up some nitrous oxide into the whippet and filled the balloon, my friend took the first hit and by this stage I was losing control and becoming reasonably confused with some anxiety. I loaded up the next balloon and inhaledThe clanging from the nitrous ceased to be a noise but instead became what I was; I inhale deep, hold and then breathe in and out into the balloon several times. Stars engulfed my vision followed by a enlarging image of pink, white and purple diamonds, this was no visual: I was actually a part of what I was seeing-experiencing-feeling, life on Earth at that point meant nothing to me, I was somewhere very, very far away - an OBE maybe? It was pure bliss. Nitrous for me is now so familiar when I am tripping it catapults me to a comfortable, ever-loving and ever-changing state of consciousness. </p><p>Our next decision was to smoke some Salvia 5x extract. I placed some Salvia into my blue glass spoon and lit it with the blue-flame lighter. I made sure not to choke on the smoke but still inhale every bit I could; in holding a lungful of diviners sage the classic Salvia effects took place. Having never tried synergizing Salvia with mushrooms or Syrian Rue I had no idea of what to expectThe Salvia took me into its familiar world; one which I am not totally comfortable with; I remember not being able to feel, recollect or have any knowledge of what I was or what I was doing. I said to my friend Im not sure if I like this, fuck! My friend then took a hit of it while I was still contemplating what the hell was going on. We hurriedly loaded up some bulbs and about five minutes later my friend exclaimed try some of that its fucking amazing! I filled my balloon and set off on my journeyBreathe in and out, in and out; I instantly let out a satisfactory sigh of pleasure. My eyes recoiled upwards and I was met with the same place I entered before when I previously inhaled nitrous. My head and neck were strangely erect as I experienced bliss and profound revelation. The only thing I think I can describe this experience as is Nirvana, a state of Samadhi or joining with the divine ground of all existence.</p><p>Having realized his own self as the self, a man becomes selfless; and in virtue of selflessness he is to be conceived as unconditioned. This is the highest mystery, betokening emancipation; through selflessness he has no part in pleasure or pain, but attains absoluteness.</p><p>- Maitrayana Upanished</p><p>After this awe-inspiring revelation my brain was fluctuating effortlessly into one state of consciousness to the next. My friend uttered some verses of poetry whether it was recited or thought up during the trip I do not know; but it profoundly moved me. It let me catch a glimpse to his inner personality. I felt inadequate as I was acting kind of funny as in weird after the Salvia and Nitrous yet my friend kept talking but I was not capable to communicate that well this surprised me as normally I would be able to communicate with this particular friend very easily.</p><p>We decided it was time to head back to the house; the temperature was not too accommodating being cold. As we walked along the riverside path I had a torch on the path on which there was a pebbled texture, as we walked hundreds of patterns and visuals emanated off the pebbled path it was intriguing. We passed under the many streetlights as ghosts lost in a world full of deceit and arrogance. As we walked I kept exclaiming wow! Far-out! I just couldnt help myself everything was just way cool. We sat again to smoke a cigarette (being incapable to roll any cannabis) and my brain kept shifting in outlooks and perspectives. The afterglow from the Nitrous and Salvia was awesome and we were in pure sensory delight. We eventually made it back to the house, I was nervous as I did not think I could handle my friends parents. It was night so they were sleeping but a fair amount of paranoia hit me at that point.</p><p>We headed to my friends room where we read some art books: which were simply fantastic, the paintings were just so real. I listened to some music (Tool, Enigma, DJ food) before finishing the night off by watching one of those electric balls and finally falling asleep.  </p><p>Conclusion: </p><p>Tripping with my best trip buddy certainly gave a satisfactory edge to the trip. I also learnt that tripping in a group of two is extremely beneficial to the experience. My friend made an extraordinary breakthrough during this as normally when he doses this high he gets quite freaked yet he handled himself extremely well this time and even inhaled Nitrous and hit some Salvia. We both made it clear that this was the best we had EVER felt in our lives and I feel rejuvenated and ready to take on anything and everything that comes my way. I find when we are left to the boring, monotonous drive that is our everyday lives we lose what we actually appreciate and feel good about ourselves, tripping brings it all back and I will never turn my back on tripping after that experience it was enlightening and provided guidance.</p>"
