There is no need for blind faith when you can experience that in which you believe.<br><br>
We were to pay the Head a visit; before departing: two of us consumed a brew, carefully prepared a few days earlier:<br><br>
I had taken 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and crushed them, leaving them to soak in boiled water before straining the liquid through an old t-shirt  Separating the none soluble, stomach-irritating fats, from the water-soluble psychoactive amide  being LSA, the naturally occurring precursor to LSD. Shared the tea with one other person.<br><br>
I have some experience with the seeds and was expecting to peak in about three hours, to reach a mellow plateau from which I could soak in the surroundings.<br><br>
An effigy of Buddha meditated on the brew as it brewed.<br><br>
After a beautiful five mile cycle along the beach, we reach Hengistbury Head. We rise to the top as the sun sets deeper, casting fantastic reds &amp; oranges into our atmosphere. <br><br>
The third member of our group ingests roughly 80mg of MDMA.<br>
In a place like the Head you could experience euphoria without ever adding extra chemicals to the swirling pool already you. We decide not to without ever making the decision<br><br>
One moment rolls on, before our eyes the intense beauty of day morphs to a beauty more subtle.<br><br>
In the moment.<br><br>
We lie a top the Head, a mellow plateau, sitting one hundred and eighteen feet above sea level<br>
Upside down, near the edge and all I can see is Sea,<br>
And Sky!<br>
And the curve of the Earth!!<br><br>
In the moment.<br><br>
The sky darkens, the wind chills<br>
We cover ourselves in a blanket plenty big enough for three.<br><br>
In the moment.<br><br>
The curtains are drawn back and we are allowed to gaze upon the greatest show on Earth,<br>
The Universe<br>
We look out from a point.<br>
We travel.<br><br>
In the moment.<br><br>
Three highs become one, then many.<br><br>
I lose myself in the stars, the longer I gaze upon them  the more I see.<br>
The only times I slip back from ecstasy are the times I tell myself:<br><br>
Its happening<br>
Response:<br>
I dont need to know thanks, Im already there.<br><br>
Sitting here, writing this <br>
I am confronted by a memory in a different category to those recalling everyday experience. A memory less focused on what happened, more on what I felt. A memory that is crystal clear but open to suggestion, a living memory that I know still has the power to teach me<br>
I felt what happened,<br>
It felt a bit like this<br><br>
LOVE<br><br>
Im unreasonably happy.<br>
Im filled with the most intense Love I have ever felt.<br>
Mad, directionless Love that flows out of me as it flows in:<br>
It blows through me as the wind blows over<br>
And I have a feeling that, like the wind, its movement is circular.<br><br>
As I lose consciousness of my body, I too become Love<br>
And I move with it.<br><br>
Having experienced such Love, and all it inspires. I cannot doubt that God exists,<br>
For I have known God in his purest manifestation, God as Love: <br>
And so I realise that God is Love, the very same force <br>
That which inspires creation.<br>
That which creates creation!<br><br>
The Human experience of LoveGod, known to lie behind the words of the term Mystical experience, is both old &amp; new, eternal &amp; transient:<br>
It is a fountain that human beings have been swimming in and drinking of as long as we have been apart  And we have always been a part<br>
LoveGod:<br><br>
The illicit truth of every Religion.<br>
A muse that inspires the whole Human race.<br>
The source of all existence  <br>
As simultaneously spiritual and material beings, not only is our Consciousness born from it, Our Body as well.<br><br>
My hand is inexorably linked to thoughts of my hand. <br>
He is an expression of my consciousness, of its will to reach out<br>
To Touch.<br><br>
One cannot exist without the Other because: One and the Other are One and the same. <br><br>
LoveGod is a paradox, being every word we utter and the gaps in between  <br>
Explained equally inadequately by Good &amp; Evil, Negative &amp; Positive,<br>
Simultaneously both and neither <br>
It is being in the same moment as becoming, it never began and it still hasnt ended<br><br>
And so we find The Human Condition:<br><br>
I grow within<br>
And on this strange world:<br>
An impossible tapestry,<br>
They try to unfurl.<br><br>
Without knowing what to ask,<br>
They question each thread:<br>
Does it start when Im born?<br>
Does it end when Im dead?<br><br>
I grow within<br>
And on this strange land:<br>
An impossible tapestry,<br>
Woven of its own hand.<br><br>
Dont search for the answer,<br>
For the answer will come.<br>
Stand back far enough:<br>
Two merge into One.<br><br>
And so we find the Human race:<br><br>
In our relentless search for the answer (which is so ridiculously simple no-one stands a chance of comprehending it) we have neglected the beauty of all that provokes question.<br><br>
And so we find ourselves<br><br>
There is nothing as perfect for now as the ecstasy of the infinite question:<br>
The eternal involvement of self with other; finding out without asking a thing.<br>
A passive exchange of energies, of information <br><br>
If we concentrate on pursuing the answer, as opposed to cultivating a passive acceptance of the fact that the answer is immanent, we do ourselves no favours<br><br>
First: We miss out on the ecstasy of the infinite question, in other words <br>
We do not gain full enjoyment from our involvement with the outside and the inside worlds;<br>
This involvement is to be marvelled at, celebrated, cherished and explored<br><br>
Second: As we dream of the most sacred thing, we neglect the fact that everything is sacred.<br>
This, combined with an unawareness of the inter-connectedness of all things, has contributed to the widespread destruction of our Mother Earth, Gaia:<br><br>
She is our Garden yet we trample her plants and slaughter her animals, we suffocate her skin with a layer of concrete, pollute the air she breathes and the water she drinks with our foul concoctions<br><br>
She is our Garden, the tree is our life  and we still forbid our children free run of her fruits<br><br>
How I yearn for free run of her fruits<br><br>
The Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I consumed belong to a family of Gaias fruits termed Entheogen meaning God Within:<br><br>
Many Entheogens having been helping Human beings find LoveGod since we first looked outside of meat for food. They are gifts <br>
First from God,<br>
Then from Our Planet.<br><br>
There is nothing less human about looking to nature for Mind food than there is about looking to nature for Body food <br>
Yet the former lies well behind in the acceptance stakes  At least in so far as many Societies, with their Governments and Religions, are concerned.<br><br>
*  *  *  *  *<br><br>
The drugs had worn off.<br><br>
We emerged from the woods, into which we had retreated after our Mystical experience a top the cliff, and lay once more under the blanket.<br>
The sound of the Sea, its partner the wind thankfully absent, soothed us to sleep.<br><br>
I awoke cold &amp; damp but energised &amp; joyous.<br>
Climbing back up the Head in order to reach the warming rays of the morning Sun, I was sent two messages  arriving as thoughts<br><br>
The first, from God, said:<br><br>
No-one dies.<br><br>
The second, from Our Planet, said:<br><br>
Its not too late.<br><br><br>
