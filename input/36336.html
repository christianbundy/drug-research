Substance - 2CI<br><br>
Setting - at home in my apartment alone<br><br>
Experience level - 3rd trip<br><br>
I got home from work and messed around on the computer for about 2 hours, and at around 8:30, took about 50 mg of 2CI.  This, I thought, was pretty much the same dose as I had taken on my last trip, which was quite incredible, and lasted for about 6 hours, and I was able to sleep easily after the comedown.  This trip was quite different. Apparently, minimal increases of dosage can result in catastrophic consequences.  I'll relate the entire thing here.  <br><br>
In all, the trip was very confusing.  At the onset, I felt slightly nauseous, and was expecting this because my last trip started out that way.  I remember lying on my bed thinking 'hey, old lady nausea, you be not welcome here' and laughing crazily.  The nausea passed and I tried to get up out of my bed, but it was very dark in my room with the computer and lights turned off.  I got lost in the corner of my room, which was very dark, and just kind of wandered there bumping into the wall for about 5 minutes.  <br><br>
I finally had the presence of mind to turn on the light, and found my doorknob.  By this time, I was hallucinating so strongly that it was very hard to see.  I wandered into the kitchen and noticed that it was 10:00.  I stood there in the kitchen and just got lost in the confusion.  I really couldn't see anything, the visuals were tearing up the room so much.  At this point, I started slipping out of reality for minutes at a time, and when I would come back, I would be just a LITTLE scared.  I was glad I was at home and not somewhere else where I couldn't have complete control.  <br><br>
At one point I found myself in the kitchen saying 'GET A GRIP ON REALITY ASH' as I noticed my mangled hands blending in with the kitchen counter.  I looked at the clock again and it was 10:10.  It had felt like an eternity had passed since I started tripping, and I started trying to remember things from earlier in the evening, and found that my mind just wouldn't work.  Everything was a confusing, chaotic mess.  the trip continuted in this manner until about 2:00 in the morning, when things started to get a little less confusing.  <br><br>
I found a book I had been reading earlier before I started tripping, and picked it up.  It was a fictional analysis by Noam Chomsky of The Lord of the Rings.  The entire thing was absurd, and it took me about 2 hours to read 7 or 8 pages (it was VERY hard to see the text because of the way my mind was destroying everything visually but I finally slogged through the entire thing because it was HILARIOUS.  I must have lost several ounces of water just from the tears from my laughter.  At this point, it was almost 4:00, and the trip didn't seem to be tapering down at all visually.  <br><br>
I went outside on my balcony (we are lakeside) and noticed the town across the lake on the horizon, brightly lit.  My mind created a great, organic, very high tech city on the horizon.  Tall, curving skyscrapers grew from the lights of the real city, and the whole thing was lit in a very tron-esque way, with lots of edges and curves lined with glowing green, blue, and red lights.  Radiating from this city was a network of roadways, flying through the air towards me and in all directions including away from me.  Vehicles of light flowed along these roadways like blood coursing through a high tech, artificial, glowing vein.  It was incredible.  I stared at this for a LONG time.<br><br>
Finally, at about 5:30 am, I was getting very tired but the trip wasn't coming down fast enough for my liking, so I took 2 neurontin (which have been enormously helpful to me in the past for sleeping) and by 6:00 I was asleep.  I slept for the next 26 hours and woke up mildly tired but feeling completely normal.<br><br>
All in all, this drug is fun in certain ways, but mostly just produces mass chaotic confusion for me except in low doses (12 mg) where its only like a mild acid trip and rather boring.  I didn't experience any 'revelations' or anything spiritual, and I probably won't do this again.  I've had my fun with it.  It wasn't a bad trip at all, just... pure chaos basically.<!-- End Body -->
