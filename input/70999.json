 "report": "<p>I was diagnosed with herpes zoster (shingles) in November of last year, and after anti-virals and 2 bottles of percocet, I was doing ok, no pain at all.  Around February of this year, I started to get pain in my arm, the same kind of pain I had earlier, but less sharp, more like a dull ache that would become worse with movement.  I went back to my doctor and told him and he gave me Lyrica aka pregabalin, at 75 mgs 2x a day.</p><p>I am a regular pot smoker, it helps me sleep and also helps the pregabalin work better.  This stuff is strong, it had me zombied out for days.  That went fine for 2 months then the pain came back, it came to the point where the pills would do nothing more than aspirin.  I called my doctor and he increased my dosage to 100mgs 3x a day.  My pain is under control now, and I never got any bad side-effects from the medication, just good pain relief. I would not suggest it on its own from a recreational standpoint, maybe combined with weed or a few vicodin.</p>"
