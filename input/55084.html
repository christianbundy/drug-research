So, I said that I would try the seed tea a second time because I found out that you have to use bulk seed, not bottled seed. I used a 1.52 lbs of bulk organic seed and the same method of extraction as my first report, only this time I only soaked it for 2 hours instead of 4. My state of mind was tired. I can never sleep, even with sleeping pills, so I had been awake for around 30 hours or so. I was also hopeful that this would go over much better than my first experience. Also, this time I gave the seeds a second wash, just to make sure.<br><br>
The liquid was darker than the first batch, which was a good sign. I drank .5 ltr in ten minutes, just as my first try. I figured that I would drink another .5 ltr in 30 mins.<br><br>
T+25min: Heavy feeling. My body is totally sedated, but my mind is fine. Compareable to the high I can get from orally taking 60mgs of Morphine. I don't find Morphine as pleasant as percocet or others in the 'oxy' category. It provides more of a heavy feeling.<br><br>
T+30: Ingest the other half liter of tea.<br><br>
T+60: I am in full blown morphine like high. I wonder if I drank too much on an empty stomach, and decide to consume food.  I feel like I ate around 75mgs of morphine. I'm not tired, and moving is easy if motivated.<br><br>
This state lasted for about 4 to 5 hours when it started to fade rapidly. I never got the itchies (Damn!), but it was pleasant. I will not be doing this again only because I prefer every other opiate to morphine, and thats basically all you get out of this.<!-- End Body -->
