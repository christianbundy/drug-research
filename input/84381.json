 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nfirst experience\r\n=====================================================\r\narrived at friends house who said that they had sum mdma powder did i want it, knowing me i said yes without a second of thought but noted to them that my medication (antipsychotics) counter the effect of amphetamines and didnt expect much to happen. so i emptied out the bag and snorted to small lines about a half a point in total. 10-20 minutes later i started to feel really good simliar to what ice is like or really good speed. Increased heart rate and brain functions enhanced, i told them i didnt think it was mdma and they fessed up and said they werent sure what it was but i wanted more. so i rang up the guy who gave it to her and asked what it was and if i could get any more and i was told its mdpv otherwise known as meow. i had an excellent nite and stayed up all nite talkin and playing music\r\nsecond experience\r\n=========================================================\r\ni got a 50bag (2.5 points) snorted 2-3 little lines and gave 4 other people a little line 20 mins later everyone was high as and jibbering rapidly and i still had more than half of the bag left. this drug is similar to ice in that it enhances my mood and like speed it increases awareness and artistic abilty. i didnt sleep that nite and went for a jam the next day and had a ball played music for about 8 hours strate with minimal breaks. \n\n\n"
