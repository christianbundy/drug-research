I have been a sufferer of cluster headaches for 4 years. Each year I tried a different prescription drug to treat my pain. Halfway through  each cycle the beast reappeared and I suffered for about a month with no relief. My pain has been dismissed by doctors as migraines ('because there are almost no female suffers')I think because there is almost no way for them to treat it. I myself am a medical student and I concede that the amount of research and the amount of teaching related to this disease is minimal.<br><br>
Until this year in september (the usual date of the start of an attack) I was contemplating suicide annually. This year I tried Mushrooms as prescribed by other cluster sufferers who had already discovered this wonderful miracle. <br><br>
The day after I felt the classic symptoms of the beginning of an attack I drank 2g of dried mushroom tea, tripped for about 5 hours and today 2 weeks later I still haven't had a hint of an attack. <br><br>
I still feel anxious, it's difficult to believe it could be so easy and I will not be so naive as to think I am cured so easily, but as soon as the beast threatens to appear I will be out there visiting my local illicit drug dealer for a gram or 2. No matter what the cost.<!-- End Body -->
