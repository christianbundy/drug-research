I decided to pick up the salvia the day after I discovered a local shop that carried it.  I purchased 1 gram of 10x extract for 35$ which came with a page of back round information and instruction on salvia which I found respectful of the suppliers rather than selling it as a pot alternative.  I eyed the bag of dark crushed leaf, suspicious of its potency or power.  Me and my companion who I will refer to as G drove down to the waterfront and walked out onto a small peninsula and sat next to a welcoming tree on a large rock.  The peninsula looked across the iced over, snow covered lake as the sun began to set.  It was a beautiful, mostly private (with the exception of the occasional dog walker), calm and safe environment.<br><br>
I packed a small amount of marijuana into my small hand pipe, to ensure the crushed leaf would not be sucked through the bowl, and poured a bowl full of the leaves from their small baggie.  I took the first hit holding the lighter above the herb as to burn it its hottest and held a lungful of smoke for about 15 seconds.  Then G proceeded to take a hit before passing the pipe back to me where I mimicked once more what I just explained.  I slid the pipe into my pocket and said Dude, wow.<br><br>
G didnt respond.  Which seemed appropriate and I let the silence engulf me as I just sat.  My heart had been pounding prior to my hit but I now felt comforted.  Things felt slower and comforting.  I didnt realize what exactly was happening until about 3 minutes later when I began to babble to G about this time bend concept.  I explained to him that I was in a bend in time.  I could visualize it in my head as a half circle being morphed and bended or melted.  I felt as though after I took the hit time was slowed down or just bent.  It sounds like useless babble even to me now, yet, during the experience I could grasp this concept very well and it seemed obvious to me that I was in a bend in time.<br><br>
I tried to close my eyes and I began to visualize my body splitting into two separate pieces yet; I was more fascinated by the natural patterns and designs around me.  I did not feel out of control at anytime like I have experienced many times with mushrooms.  I felt very calm and comforted by something intangible.  G was not as satisfied with his hit and suggested that I pack another bowl.<br><br>
I packed a bowl in the same way I stated earlier and aloud G to take the first hit this time.  I was more aware of the affects as they came over me this time.  Many people have described heaviness or pull downward with this drug; yet, I experienced an instant lightness and clarity.  It did not seem appropriate to be chatty while in the experience and I felt as though I connected most with it while being silent and listing and the few people who walked by did distract me from my concentration.  I began to notice a pattern in old dried moss or algae on the rocks near my feat.  I saw thousands of tiny crystals all within many flower shaped blotches of this dead fungi.  I tried to explain this to G by mumbling look at that rock I rambled about not judging the rock and excepting it, and that you could see its natural beauty once you just excepted what it had to offer you.<br><br>
This also was not something I successfully expressed in words.  All words seemed clumsy to me and I could not express the thoughts I was having logically through speech yet they were very clear to me. Its hard to gauge the actual extent of the experience and how long it lasted because the comedown seemed very gradual and I believe that the herb is capable of much more than this and I may have only reached threshold effects.  I am very interested in exploring deeper levels of a salvia trip and seeing where the plant plans on taking me.  All together I would say this drug has been pleasant and calm and I did not experience anything unpleasant.<!-- End Body -->
