Ive used Tramadol off and on for about a year, usually between 200mg  300mg.  To me its the most pleasant social opiate-like high because it lacks the drowsiness that often accompanies hydrocodone, oxycodone, opium, and heroin but it maintains a stable euphoric feeling of connection with people around me.  <br><br>
Usually a high starts about thirty minutes after ingestion and a seeping rush follows for about an hour.  Then I pretty much feel waves of relaxation and analgesia and this lasts a good 2  3 hours more.  I usually like taking it in the evening because it gives me vivid, pleasant dreams at night, but on certain occasions Ive taken it early in the day and the pleasant social feeling lasts pretty much all day.  Whats most interesting and unique about Tramadol is its speedy quality that intensifies with physical activity.  <br><br>
After a relaxed evening with some friends, I sometimes go for long long walks because the more my body moves the more speedy and euphoric and intense the high becomes.  Ive tried a wide variety of opiates because its easily my favorite class of drugs and while Tramadol does not produce the most intense waking-dream high it allows for a more socially functional high.  And if youre looking for the waking-dream, Tramadol is great to take if Im going out with friends to a movie I know is terrible.  When my body is at rest, the drug reverts back to a more traditional hydrocodone-type high.  Then with movement, the speedy feeling returns.<br><br>
The effects of Tramadol are difficult to describe but generally I would classify it as an extreme mood boost that often, in my case, allows me to work out problems more clearly and less self-destructively.  Its not exactly a real high in like a trippy sense but more like a boost (the kind of boost some people experience with smaller amounts of alcohol, but minus the impairment).<br><br>
When I started using Tramadol I only did it on weekends but during a particularly boring and depressing time in my life I did up my usage to almost daily and I did develop a tolerance.  However, the eventual withdrawal I experienced was peanuts compared to what many people describe with other opiatesa little diarrhea and a few headaches that Asprin fixed.  I think the diarrhea comes from constipation relief, although Tramadol doesnt constipate me very noticeable (but it does make my waste have a harder consistency, not to be graphic).  <br><br>
Also, other side effects Ive experienced is dry mouth and sometimes drowsiness when driving for many hours.<!-- End Body -->
