I recently aquaired 1gram of mdai from an online vendor, it's appreance was white crystals and had a very sweet smell and taste to it.<br><br>
The night arrived that I had put aside to try it. I took 200MG orally at 11pm.<br><br>
t+0.30- feel a slight tingle in my legs but feel at baseline<br><br>
T+1.00 - I think I'm comming up, it's feels strange it's like comming up on MDMA but without the mental effects<br><br>
T+1.30 - I'm defantly up now my mind feels cleared and relaxed and the music is sounding good, but there's no stimulation at all.<br><br>
T+2.00 - still feeling relaxed and having a good conversation with my friends , my pupils are huge but still no stimulation even though my teeth are grinding .<br><br>
T+3.00 - decide to walk to the garage to buy some more smokes, everything feels nice and calm  and we are still chatting away.<br><br>
T+4.30 - effects feel all but gone now and decide to go to bed and sleep comes pretty easy.<br><br>
Next day- Wake up feeling pretty sick and I soon am. I can't keep anything down for the next two hours but after that passes i feel fine with no other negitive effect.<br><br>
In conclusion this subtance has a Lot of similaritys to MDMA mentally and physically, but it feels like something is missing, probally due to the lack of stimulation, next time I will try with a low dose stimulation to see the effect.<br><br>
Be safe<br>
