After smoking a bowl one day in the park, my buddy Cracker finally showed me and my brother a datura tree. It was a normal day, after lunch time and we were all felling pretty good. The white flowers were big, but I still managed to eat four of them, as vile as they were. This is where the remapping of my brain began. The next few hours I spent in the hot sun. <br><br>
Within the  first three hours of taking the flowers, I could hardly move my limbs. I was experiencing a slow tranquilization. Shortly after school got out, I went home for a nap. Already I was experiencing the dreamy state associated with the poison in datura. As I got home, my head was almost gone.<br><br>
I passed out at some point, and then I'm quite sure I had to get up and leave my house. My father told me that I was basically sleep-walking. I was walking around Berkeley, with no clue in my head of where I was or what was happening to me or what I was on, but I did always have a cigarette. I can't be sure what happened between the point where I passed out and the point where the cops picked me up trying to pick up an apple I hallucinated. They handcuffed my dissociative ass and told me to sit down and wait for the ambulance. <br><br>
The cops picked me up a good 2.5 miles away from my house. I've read a book about datura since then, and it called the Devil's Weed as an immensely powerful ally, giving me the most ability to manifest hallucinations. It invigorates my body, and I guess that's how I got so far. What really sucked was that I had only boxers, a t-shirt, and one shoe. The ambulance took me to the mental hospital.<br><br>
At the mental hospital, I was still tripping hard. After I signed lots of forms and such they dosed me really good with some pills, anti-psychotics and tranquilizers, probably. I didn't sleep for the first couple nights. I kept thinking there were people hiding in the curtains on the windows of my room who were talking about me, and then my brother and an ex-girlfriend would come from under the curtains, and somehow we escaped the hospital and got into a car, and parked in an alleyway. <br><br>
At this point I got out of my bed in the mental hospital room and opened the door, which opened onto the hallway of the hospital. They told me to go back to bed, so I did. This happened again many times, like a recurring dream. The bed I was sleeping in appeared to be made out of dead, or even alive, aborted fetuses. In the bed next to mine, I hallucinated dog-human hybrids, struggling to breathe. After quite a while of handling the fetuses, I switched beds. On the end of the bed, I thought I could see a joint. I tried to rip the joint out of the sheet, but it appeared to be attached. I also hallucinated a burrito in the blanket. <br><br>
On the ceiling, Ren &amp; Stimpy and Star Trek were on. At another point, I was blind. One day at the hospital, I hallucinated a boat race on the wall, and Arnold Schwarzenegger was being assassinated. <br><br>
This was one of the most stupid things I've ever done.<!-- End Body -->
