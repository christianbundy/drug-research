I began with 44mg, insufflated, and chased it with a mouthful of water, tilting my head back to allow moisture to permeate into the membrane area and encourage uptake.<br><br>
Nearly immediate results; visible tracers, feeling of displacement.<br><br>
Within 20 minutes I felt a physical sensation of gravity shifting -- instead of gravity pulling down, it was pulling back somewhat (as though I was accelerating). [side-note: the gravity-shift feeling was very similar to a Salvia Divinorum exprience almost exactly a decade ago.]<br><br>
Inspired by the physical sensation of propulsion, I went for a walk.<br><br>
Before my walk I made preparations; insufflated another 44mg, totaling an 88mg dose including the 44mg from 20m prior. Took a drink of water (tilting my head back and allowing the moisture to soak into the membrane) and excited the imbibement by smoking 30mg THC.<br><br>
I walked to one of my usual places of divination. It was a short walk, ~50m at a 55° incline, then ~40m planar, then ~200m slight varying decline, resulting in the arrival at the location I consider to be my Nexus of Spirit.<br><br>
I then performed a few basic rituals (pleasantries, followed by deconstruction of the Self into a Point through incantation and relaxation of the material Self) and was immediately catapulted into cosmic travel  depths reached previously only through nigh abandonment of the corporeal self. [It is a worthwhile distraction here to note that going 'Outside The Gates' is considered, by some, to be breaking certain Law  dogma easily sidestepped by those understanding of the parting words of Hassan-I Sabbāh.]<br><br>
Primordeal creation and Grand Structure, all at once, and with it a sense of direct communication with a distinct being. Perhaps what the OTO would classify as the HGA, though it is worth noting that strong undercurrents of Nibiru energy were abound.<br><br>
No specific message was conveyed, other than a feeling of success in establishing communication.<br><br>
Then, a wash of Earth realm as I opened my eyes to focus on the stars above, reassuring me of my safety and connection to this sandbox we all play in.<br><br>
Sat up, trundled on home, reflected, and munched on a tomato.<!-- End Body -->
