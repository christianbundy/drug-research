We tried these once before and they worked quite well...this time we prepared high concentrated tea with eight seeds by using little water.  After crushing the seeds and letting them soak for about 3 hours,At about 6:15 we mixed in some orange juice and drank as fast as we could...I didn't manage to drink all of it. As always an hour later my stomach hurt some and I ended up vomiting up my lunch which I knew I shouldn't have eaten in the first place...dammit.<br><br>
So another hour passes, then another hour passes. (This is the wierdest part about these drugs. You feel wierd for like two or three hours, and don't think anything is going to happen.) anyway, the lassitude was quite heavy, and my stomach still felt a little bad, but then everything started to change. Staring at things is always awesome because they move and look cool. Thinking and talking was fun because it was hard to communicate the amazing ideas we were thinking.  We also got this overwhleming good feeling that's hard to explain.<br><br>
We ended up sitting in a field for a while and looking at the stars and trees which were amazing...almost too amazing. and continued on our journey around our campus...finally at about one in the morning I was tired so I went home to bed...oh yeah...we always smoke a little green to help the trip kick in, it relaxes me...so consider that.<!-- End Body -->
