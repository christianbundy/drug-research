I had smoked weed for almost a year before this experience happened and I had never had any negative side effects. I was with a couple of friends who had smoked longer than I had.  It was around 6:00 at night, when they packed the first bowl. The four of us passed it around, and I took about 5 good hits. Then we went downstairs to chill for a little while in a comfortable room. Nothing special.<br><br>
About 45 minutes later (about 6:45) We went upstairs to the dining room, which was moderate size with a table and some shelves. It was kind of dark, but cozy. They packed up another bowl. Everything was normal until my second to last hit. As I inhaled I felt totally breathless like it was caught in my chest and I couldn't even cough. I felt like I was going to throw up but I just took another hit and sat on the floor. Maybe about 15 minutes later is when it started getting interesting.  Everything started going extremely slow and I couldnt tell if I was dreaming or awake. I was excited that this was really good weed. Then the room (we were now in my friends room, and I was sitting on the floor, leaning up against his bed) started swirling around and I began to feel really frightened. I told my friends how I was feeling and they were just like well it's never happened to me but its probably just a bad high and you should wait it out. <br><br>
At this point it was very hard for me to tell what they were saying, and I couldn't associate one thing with another. Time was going slower and slower, and my heart was beating faster and faster and faster. I got extremely paranoid and couldn't stand up straight. My legs were shaking and I was shivering violently. I thought that I was having a heart attack and I kept thinking about dying. Then I would think that I should lay down and try to sleep it off, but every time I tried to lay down I would feel like I was twisting and falling into a deep dark hole that I could never wake up from. Then I would start shaking even more. At this point, my friends were really scared for me, but they kept telling me that I was going to be Ok. After a while of trying to see straight (the whole room was moving around me and breaking like a mirror and then sliding back together) my heart was still going wicked fast and I couldnt tell if I was breathing. I couldnt communicate with my friends because I was so out of it. I finally must have passed out because I woke up in her living room what seemed like hours and hours later. Im not sure if they carried me there or if I walked, but it was actually only about 9:00- about 2 hours since we'd smoked.  I was high, as I usually feel after I smoke, but a little more dizzy than usual.<br><br>
I'm not sure exactly why this happened to me. The weed that we smoked could have been laced, or it could have just been something that happened inside of me. I cant explain how incredibly scared I was, and I didnt smoke for a couple weeks after that. But I learned one thing- always know who youre smoking with and know your limits and expectations! I think, also, have fun with what your doing- thats the point of life, but know that it can end at any moment and be careful to make everything you do worth it.<!-- End Body -->
