 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have taken shrooms before but not since I have been taking prozac. This time I did not have any hallucinations even though others who took the same amount of the same shrooms did. I don't know if this has anything to do with the prozac. I also was very emotional. Whenever something reminded me of my boyfriend who died recently I started crying even though I wasn't realizing it. Then I'd be laughing my head off. I don't know if these extreme mood swings were caused by the prozac either. In my past experience with shrooms, I was just overall in a very happy mood. I felt queasy in the beginning, but not enough to be sick. The trip didn't last long, only about 2 hours.\n\n\n"
