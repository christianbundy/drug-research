 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have a long history with drugs, dating back to the early 90s. With a few notable exceptions (heroin, meth), if you can name it, I've done it. One category I tended to avoid, though, was man-made chemicals. I did do PCP for a while in the mid 90s, but otherwise I tried to avoid anything that wasn't natural. I've done cannabis, nitrous oxide, LSD, shrooms, PCP, crack, Ecstacy, etc. Recently all my sources for everything have dried up. My normal dealer has decided to 'go clean' and won't get anyone anything anymore.\r\nI had been clean myself for about 5 years, but had recently been getting interested in the synthetic cannabinoids. I purchased two grams of AM-2201, which (as of this writing anyway) is still legal in most of the US. I mixed 1 gram of AM-2201 into about 200mL of 70% isopropyl alcohol. I then dumped that solution over about 55 grams of Marshmallow Leaf. I mixed it up good and let it dry. I had essentially made a homemade version of Spice. (Though, I believe, Spice used mainly JWH-018. However, AM-2201 is a chemical analogue and has similar effects, but is supposed to be considerably more potent.)\r\nI loaded up my bowl with .11 grams of my blend (which should have about 2 milligrams of AM-2201 in it) and smoked about half the bowl. I felt the effects immediately. My trip was weird at first. I 'felt' stoned, but nothing else was changing. Music didn't start sounding better than normal, my thought processes didn't change, etc. It was a bizarre synthesis of being high and sober at the same time. After about 15 minutes, I decided I needed to be higher. I dumped my bowl out (mistakenly thinking I had smoked it all) and refilled it, stuffing in about .15 grams this time, according to my scale. This time I smoked the entire thing.  I noticed marshmallow leaf tastes almost exactly like weed. It was weird. I enjoyed the taste, though.\r\nThis is when things got interesting. I felt a pressure coming down on me, like my legs were made of metal. I felt like I could move them if I really wanted to, but had no such desire. The 'feeling' of being stoned got more intense and my thought patterns changed. I started wondering about nature and trying to figure out deep psychological issues I feel like I have.\r\nThen, interrupting my thoughts, I realized I was incredibly horny. I decided to fix this with my hand, and did so. I'm sure no one cares about the details on this. However, it seemed to have a secret purpose, so to speak. As I was going about it, it seemed to clear up a lot of ambiguity on relationships in my personal life. Various fantasies acted out in my head that lead to a better understanding of several girls I've been speaking to recently. I'd been trying to determine if any of them might have feelings towards me (and if I did towards them, for that matter) and this seemed to straighten everything out. Even now, the next day while I'm stone cold sober, I think I got everything right last night.\r\nAfter finishing that, I reloaded my bowl (quickly and sloppily: didn't weigh, but I estimate it was around .6 grams) and smoked about half of that to help maintain my high. At this point, I realized I was freezing. I was clenching my jaw so much I could barely speak. It's like a pressure was building up and pushing it upward. The rest of me was shivering. I jumped in bed (realizing my legs worked just fine) and pulled three blankets over me.\r\nI laid in bed and felt all the warmth slowly build over me. I could visualize little tendrils of heat lashing into my body in an attempt to drive the cold out. I laid there for about 10 minutes and then felt totally warm. The jaw clenching and shivering were gone. I often had this reaction on weed as well if I was cold, so it wasn't new to me. I laid there a while longer, not trying to keep track of the time. After a while (maybe another 15 minutes) I realized I was mostly sober. I put on a cartoon and watched it. By the time it was over (~22 minutes) I had decided I was completely back to baseline. I noticed I had kicked my covers off and was no longer cold.\r\nIt was overall a good experience.\r\nTimeline on this trip:\r\nT-0: At baseline, Smoked my first hit\r\nT+10 seconds: Felt first effects.\r\nT+2 minutes: Effects peaked. ('Stoned but sober')\r\nT+15 minutes: Smoked second bowl.\r\nT+17 minutes: Finished bowl, effects feeling more intense.\n\n\n"
