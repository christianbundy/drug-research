Well, after a rather rousing show at a local club, I went back to a friend's home and utilized a Fifth of Whiskey to an unexpected end.  Over the course of about an hour, I consumed the entire fifth straight and proceeded to become very drunk.  What must be understood is that I was doing this drinking only for the sake of being drunk.  I had not intented, nor had I ever heard of Alcohol (besides in the Uncharist) used spiritually.  <br><br>
Well...I, needless to say, felt very groggy very quickly.  I sat down in an overstuffed armchair with my feet up and instead of passing out, as would be typical, I felt myself 'slip' into a quasi-trance state.  With my eyelids fluttering, I was still perfectly aware of my body; sensations were normal (I could feel the cool evening breeze flowing through an open window).  But quickly, I had the sensation of moving OUT of my body, away and upwards through the top of my head (an odd one of a kind feeling).  I only then, after realizing I was in fact FEELING this that I began to actually SEE myself below.   Keep in mind this was like a division of consciousness here; I could still feel my body and feel myself away from it.  <br><br>
At this point I made the choice to concentrate on myself aloof from my body.  Well, quickly I was flying away from my body, away from the house...like I was being pulled away instead of directing myself away.  Well, I was pulled out into the sky, away from the city, away from the state away from the country until I was actually in space flying away from Earth and the Moon.  I went through a few asteroid fields as I cleared the solar system and continued outwards with increasing speed.  Moving away from the expasiveness of the galaxy, I watched it solidify into the spiral that characterizes it. <br><br>
On the same tolken, I was soon far enough away that It was like a mere star and every other galaxy about was the same; reduced to single points of light.  These too then began to coalesce until I was looking back at the universe at the point of the Big Bang; looking at the waves of energy that themselves created and formed into what appeared to be gyrating atoms.  These atoms TOO solidify into matter...and this matter, as I removed myself away from it further and further...I realized was a hair on my head!  I then gasped and sat straight up in my chair...laughing uncontrollably.  The entire experience took me less than a couple of minutes (by looking at the clock).<!-- End Body -->
