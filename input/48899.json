 "report": "<p>I've been taking Suboxone on and off...well, basically whenever I can't get my heroin. It was fuckin great the first time I took it, but then again, I think that was only because I was withdrawing (and when I withdraw it's nasty and horrible, seein as I've been doin opiates since I was about 13) and it was an opiate. Withdrawals are only stopped by OPIATES! </p><p>Well, I will say that based on what it's actually used for, it works great...Like if I do H while I'm on it within about a day and a half...I can't feel the H. Which is really a waste. Plus, suboxone not only tastes fuckin horrible, it does not reach 1/10th of the high I get from heroin. And I do heroin for the rush, which suboxone does not provide, plus, suboxone makes it really hard to sleep and feels like somewhat of an upper. So in conclusion...HEROIN KICKS ASS!!!!</p>"
