 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all I'd like to give a quick description of myself, I'm 17, go to college I have no mental/physical problems whatsoever and have only previously taken mushrooms that I pick myself (Psilocybe Semilanceata). I first found out about these seeds on the internet and was immediately intrigued. I had read every review going and made my mind up that I would give these seeds a shot. I ordered 50 of them from a trusted source. They arrived and I prepared them as follows:\r\n1. Peeled off all the outer layer plus the tougher fuzz underneath, this took about 2 hours or more (seriously!). I used a knife to scrape. They can be very fiddly and because they are very small they kept slipping out of my grasp. I also noticed some were darker than others, dark brown to light brown.\r\n2. Once I had finished this tedious task I smashed them up with a hammer, they were in a small sealed bag as I did this. I kept on hammering them until they were into minute chunks.\r\n3. I then opened the bag and tipped its contents into a glass, the smell was quite strong!\r\n4. I then boiled up some water and waited for it to cool, once it was warm I poured a small amount into the glass and left to brew. \r\n5. The following day I woke up and took hold of the glass that had been brewing throughout the night, the water was a olive green and there was seed matter floating on the top.\r\nI looked at the time and saw it was 9:00am. I felt slightly tired but was all the time thinking Just drink it down and then its done with. So I took one massive mouthful and swallowed. It didnt taste all that bad. Only until I drank near to the end it suddenly hit me that this stuff actually was foul, YUK! I drank the remaining seed gunk at the end. Phew, glad that is over with, I thought to myself then pulled the duvet over me and began to rest.\r\nAbout 20 minutes of laying in my bed my stomach began to feel bloated and slightly uncomfortable, I had to lie in a certain position to feel ok. Another 20 minutes passed and I felt nauseous. I got out of bed and walked to the toilet and sat beside it waiting for the sickness to take effect. I have read so many reports stating sickness so I was prepared for that eventuality. There was a constant need to burp, I sat there burping, each time thinking if there was something going to come up. Until I got so mad that I stuck my fingers down my throat and wretched, I did this twice, still not sick but a whole lot better for doing so. I got up and walked back to bed feeling quite strange. I took a nap, which is very unusual for me, and woke up 10 minutes later with the effects in full swing. \r\nI got out of bed and tried to walk, my legs felt very stiff, quite heavy and my balance was altered, I nearly fell over. My head felt light, definitely a high feeling I walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, my pupils were dilated a lot, which gave a good sign to my intoxication. I decided to go for a walk to the shop. When I was walking it felt as though I was floating (its very hard to describe) quite pleasant and when I looked behind me a strange feeling of unfamiliarity swept over me, things seemed different but at the same time I knew exactly what I was seeing was familiar, strange. Euphoria was present, I seemed happy within myself.\r\nI stopped walking and stared down at a lake and watched the ducks thinking how nice nature is. Lots of other things that wouldnt usually interest me did that day. There are not many visual effects of HBWS if not any at all. I had one minor hallucination (if it was one) as I was walking down the road I looked over at a tree and thought I saw someone standing there but quickly realised it was just the tree all along, this was around the peak of the trip. I walked into the shop and grabbed some lunch only to see one of my Dads mates in there. As my thinking was altered, I felt as though my talking was too and it became a battle to appear normal when chatting to him. I made it quick and said Bye.\r\nThe walk was long and the effects were slowly wearing off on the way home. I got home and started to eat. Things became tastier and I noticed the flavours were more apparent in what I ate, this was nice. I still felt high and a bit tired. I feel as though the initial sick feeling really spoils this drug, but apart from that I would have to say the effects are nice and last quite long mine from 9:00am-2:00pm theyre good for a day with nothing else to do. I will eat some more but not just yet.\r\nAnyway I hope this experience of mine was useful I have given very accurate facts as to what happened. I would probably suggest to people who dont like feeling or being sick not to have these as they will almost definitely make do that to you. In my opinion these are no comparison to mushrooms but they are different in their own unique way, mushrooms is visual, mind bending and euphoric with no sickness. They are good for someone wanting to come off other drugs Id imagine.\n\n\n"
