I don't remember what type of acid it was.  I just remember it being a 'gel tab' full of purple shit that was sour as fuck.  I was 14 at the time and when I took it nothing happened for about half an hour to an hour.  Then all of a sudden everything just got completely fuct up.  I remember talking to my friend and every word he said was rhyming (he was doing this on purpose because he knew I was tripping) and it was freaking me out.  Well after he left I just sat in my room and listened to music.  I couldnt even tell what CD or song I was listening too.  I decided to take a shower and went to my closet to get some clothes.  When I opened the closet a bloody human hand fell out and touched my leg, I didnt think anything of it though.  I just sort of kicked it back into the closet grabbed a shirt and some pants and headed up to the bathroom to take a shower.  Well halfway up the stairs I remember thinking, 'What The FUCK!! OH MY GOD!'  <br><br>
So I ran back downstairs and opened my closet again.  Nothing was there.  'Ok Good' I thought, as I turned around something caught my eye.  It was a puddle of blood on the floor and slowly I began to see a dead body.  I immediately began to freak out.  I blinked and it was gone, but then it was there again! WTF!  Well I thought to myself, must be the acid and didnt think anything about it.  As I was taking a shower time seemed to slow down so much, I actually believed that I had transcended space and time boundaries and that I was in a slow motion world.  Well I finished taking my shower and everything was still slow as fuck.  Until my mom came out of her room and said 'Hi.'  She did this in about .0002 seconds and before I knew she was even there she was gone.  I dont know how long later (all the clocks were displaying some sort of fuct up symbols and the analog clock's hands were so blurred I couldnt tell where they were) but I ended up outside, and it was dark as shit.  I remember trying to open a window to get in, but this window was about 7 feet off the ground, at the time I was only about 5' 5'.  <br><br>
This was the craziest shit in the world.  The window looked like it was about 20 feet over my head but when I reached for it my hand stretched to accomodate for this.  The next thing I knew I had a knife in my hand and the next thing I knew after that was that my hand was bleeding.  I couldnt get in the fucking house! AND now I was fucking bleeding!  'Oh know' I thought 'What the fuck am I going to do?? Im trapped outside and the sky is trying to eat me and Im going to die.'  My neighbor comes outside about a minute later and says 'What happened to your hand???'  I said something along the lines of 'Smick smurgen with cut an. . . I DIE!'  I dont remember much after this but I do remember that I never stopped tripping. I woke up the next morning hearing gun fire, and seeing the wall melt.  <br><br>
2 weeks later this was still going on.  I didn't do anything about it till about a year ago.  I took 15 xanex at school, plus 20 blood thinners in an attempt to kill myself.  I ended up falling down the fucking stairs and getting busted.  They searched me and found my remaining xanex and remaining blood thinners.  Our Nazi (School Campus officer, formerly a navy seal or some shit) brought out a huge book with every pill in it and they started looking it up.  I said, 'Well I'll be dead in about (looked at my watch) 5 seconds.'  'How many did you take son??!' said officer peabody. 'Oh about 15 of the blue footballs and 20 of the yellow capsules, why?  You dont think I like speaking in english? Well your wrong, im speaking english right now! SEIG HEIL!'  well I was in an ambulance, then I woke up and I was drinking charcoal, then I was in a stretcher going down a narrow hallway, then I had to walk to a couch!  You know how hard this shit is?  I had to get interviewed. . .interviewed for what I was thinking.  <br><br>
'Where am I?' I asked the old fuck asking me questions.  He said 'Your at Summit Ridge Mental institute. . .'  Well a few days later I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and now Im on like 9 medications and it totally blows. so all you little fucks that think you can buy euphoria for not more than 5 dollars a hit, think again.  You may end up killing, yourself or someone else.<!-- End Body -->
