 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHi,<br>Sorry for my bad english first.<br>Here's a small report of Methoxetamine aka M-Ket. My previous drugs experiences includes : 2C-C, 2C-D, 4-HO-MET, Salvia, Mushrooms, LSD, BromoDragonFLY, Alcohol, Marijuana, DXM (which was one of the worst).<br>So it was my real first time using a dissociative except for DXM when I was younger but I didn't like it at all.<br>I also have anxiety disorder and easily prone to panic attacks with imminent sense of doom. It was also the first time that I snort a drug !<br>So I was reading a lot about Methoxetamine and after 6 months being in possession of my bag, I finally decide to do it for good.<br>I could describe the Methoxetamine experience in 3 phases:<br>1. Physical Sensations<br>2. Dreamy feeling<br>3. Sleepyness.<br>I took my scale and proceed to measure accurately 5mg no more, no less.<br>I did a very small line and I insufflated it. It doesn't have any taste, no burn. I then sat on the sofa and put the TV on.<br>The experience last 4 hours.<br>10:00 PM : 5mg Insufflated<br>10:05 PM : No alert<br>10:10 PM : First alert in my fingers, tingling sensations, not really pleasant nor unpleasant. Just weird<br>(Didn't really note the time here)<br>My upper body feels warm, got a weird pressure in my chest. Heart start to race a bit. I took my blood pressure and heart rate with a device - BP is elevated and my resting heart rate is at 125 beats per minute which is high.<br>I feel a bit panicky, feels very hot and warm, I'm a bit unsteady.<br>Panic is high, I took hot clothes and I'm going outside to take some fresh air to calm down. I decided to walk in the street to change my mind.<br>I can feel it now, my gravity and my balance feel slightly off, It feels like my body is bouncing on the right side. I'm going to a night shop to buy a pack of cigarette. The road seems weird, I feel very light and It feels like I'm walking on clouds! <br>I bought the pack of cigarettes (Smoking is unhealthy for your health ;) ) and I'm walking back home. I still have this weird pressure on my upper chest. It feels like I need to take deep breath. I'm fearing about the CNS effect (breathing depression) but I try to remains calm.<br>Back at home, I sit on the couch and close my eyes. I feel light and warm at the same time. It's pleasant now! I have a strong desire to redose a small line but I refused to do it. <br>Now I just feel 'emotionless', just plain good. Still have some tingling sensation in fingers, foot and mouth. Again this is weird.<br>I took my blood pressure and heart rate with the device. The blood pressure is all right now and my resting heart rate is at 75 BPM +/-. Anxiety is all gone :)<br>It feels like a vivid dream now, slightly unrealistic and the feeling of my room is 'warmer' than usual. I'm just happy to sit and watch my surroundings.<br>Methoxetamine seems to relief my pain and stress. I'm very happy that it slow my heart rate (My usual heart rate when sober is 90 - 110 BPM which is high) but with MXE it calms me and I'm happy that my resting rate is lower than usual ! I could see a lot of benefits for depression.<br>I need to take a piss, my balance is still a bit off. It's funny! I just don't care about nothing, I'm just happy to be me.<br>The pressure in my upper chest is gone, I can breath normally, I don't need to take deep breath anymore :) I feel serene and sleepy now.<br>It's 2:00 AM in the morning and I'm just blown that so much time have passed. I think that only 1 hour have gone since I took the Methoxetamine.<br>Effects decreased rapidly. I'm baseline now, I don't notice any comedown except for some gaz build up and maybe little nausea.<br>2:30 AM : Effects are totally gone, I'm going in my bed to sleep.<br>Next day, 11:00 AM : I'm awake and spend a good night! I'm very lucid and normal. No hangovers noticed.<br>Well, I'm extremely satisfied that I have tried Methoxetamine. I was a bit panicky/anxious at first but then theses sensations are gone quickly. Methoxetamine could have some serious health benefits but I could notice that addiction could be a problem since I was having a urge desire to redose when I was peaking.<br>I'm sure that I will explore Methoxetamine in the future and I will probably increase the dose just a bit (very small incremental dosage) and work my way up. I just need to be at ease first.<br>Anyway, it was nice preview and I'm glad that I done it :) I don't know if the Methoxetamine was degraded because I had it for 6 months approx. and it was unopened OR I may be ultra sensitive but 5 mg was plenty for me!<br>Take care and have fun\n\n\n"
