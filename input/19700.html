I am writing to speak on the loss of magic associated with Mdma. I have used Mdma for four years. I've rolled about one hundred-two hundred times, and consumed about 800-1000 pills. I've found the loss of magic effect as more of control over my roll. I've also found as have my friends who take it with me that we can control the negative side effects such as jaw clenching to the point where there non-existent. <br><br>
I can't begin to explain the effect Mdma provides me with now. I no longer really get overwhelmed or the body sensation as in the beginning. Instead I experience extremly clear thoughts and a sort of physic intuition. It's as if now the drug allows me to tap into a higher form of my own mind. I have however noticed side effects in normal life both negative and positive. The worst effect during use I termed E-glitches -- a sort of break in reality into the reality of the drug. After effects Ive noticed days up to months later include seeing sparkles which look like electric currents that ascend up walls,objects,etc. I also notice dizzy spells when standing a few days after use and unusual dreams and a dull ache in my head when I awake from sleep up to four months since last use. I just decided to give my take which isnt full detailed as of yet but I'm working on a true report for the future. I also believe Mdma control to be sort of a god-like mind experience but as I've noted only certain people experience it in this way usually seasoned users who have learnt control. Thank you<!-- End Body -->
