Fun effects are virtually gone.\r\n12:30\tdelayed reaction time\r\n12:43 \tmy music sounds clearer\r\n1:15\tvalerian tea taken.  sleep\r\nNEXT DAY\r\nI feel well rested and have a sense of well-being.  I recommend KavaKava in a social setting, but it's not mind-altering to any noteable degree.  At least not for me.\n\n\n"
