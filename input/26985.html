This method of tripping made feel very, very ill. <br><br>
Not able to get ahold of any sort of grinding device (pepper grinder, coffee grinder), and after using a hammer to try to pound the seeds didn't do much of anything, I decided I would end up having to just chew up the seeds. Note: For the previous few days, I avoided all foods and medicines that should be avoided when taking an MAOI. I started by chewing up a small portion of my dose of Syrian Rue seeds. This was probably the worst taste I have ever encountered, and I struggled not to vomit from the taste. I somehow managed to make it through the entire (almost) half ounce of Syrian Rue seeds. I then proceeded to head to the park, with my Morning Glory seeds in my pocket, where I planned on spending the rest of the day.  On my way to the park, I tried to notice any effects the Syrian Rue alone might be having at that point. There wasn't really anything, except for an occasional subtle change in depth perception for far away objects (watching the subway train turn the corner in the station, my vision seemed to be sort of rounded out, like looking through a glass bottle or something), colors seemed slightly brighter, and music was somewhat clearer. <br><br>
About 30 minutes after ingesting the Syrian Rue, I was at the park and decided it was time to chew up the Morning Glory seeds. I had seven 1.5 g. packs of Heavenly Blue, and three 1.5 g. packs of Flying Saucer variety seeds, none of which had any kind of warning about the seeds being treated. The taste wasn't nearly as bad as the Syrian Rue, but my throat was reluctant to take them down. I could feel that my body definitely wanted to vomit them back out. Luckily I had some Hawaiian Punch that helped a great deal in getting the seeds down. Soon afterwards I began to feel extreme nausea. I had expected some nausea, but I had no idea it was going to be anything like this. I struggled to find somewhere good to lay down (I wanted to be in a secluded area of the park somewhere in the woods). I found a decent spot, and laid there waiting for the effects to kick in for at least an hour and a half. <br><br>
Finally, something started happening. But it wasn't really what I expected. Instead of a feeling of a trip coming on, I started to feel very stoned, as if I had smoked a good bit of some decent marijuana, although the intense feeling of being sick didn't go away. I started walking around when I first started feeling slightly stoned, hoping to dissuade the nausea, listening to music on my headphones. The nausea was absolutely terrible and I had to sit down. The stoned feeling grew and grew, but the sound of the music made me sure a trip was to ensue. Possibly an hour or so after first feeling stoned, the trip started happening. There weren't really any tracers, except for a few seconds of them a few times throughout the experience. Also, walls and objects didn't really breathe like they do on mushrooms, and I didn't experience the dreamy state mushrooms provide either. My vision never became blurry either. It was basically as if my external world turned into a fragmented 2-dimensional painting.<br><br>
The first 2/3 to 3/4 of the trip was very pleasant (actually, pretty damn incredible at times) aside from the extreme feeling of sickness. I was very happy, and provided myself with great insight on music, lyrics, text I had been reading lately (Castaneda, Leary). But the sick feeling never went away, and it got so bad I decided I absolutely had to get home.  That's when the trip turned sour. I remained pretty calm and collected, but I kept running into shady New York characters who appeared as horrible monstrous and demonic humanoid figures. I managed to keep good distances from them, but getting home proved difficult. I ended up getting lost in the subway system, because I couldn't tell which way the trains were going, among other difficulties. I didn't get too hysterical or anything, but the mental state I was in I recognized as what people with true dementia must experience. Luckily I was able to retain my sanity in such a state.<br><br>
When I got home and looked at myself in the mirror, the face that an hour ago I was admiring as wonderfully beautiful now looked horribly disfigured and ugly. I took a shower, and felt an overwhelming desire to shave. That didn't go too well, hallucinating blood spurting out all over my face, but in retrospect it could have been much worse. I took this final portion as a horrible lesson in how I sometimes perceive myself. After cleaning up myself, I went directly to sleep, feeling incredibly ill. <br><br>
The next day I was very nauseous and suffered terrible diarrhea and difficulty eating all day and night. Do not do what I did and just eat the seeds right out of the bag -- horrible mistake.<br><br>
Additional note: closed-eye visuals throughout the entire experience  only involved female posteriors...haha. It was actually kind of annoying because I was hoping for something a little more shamanic.<!-- End Body -->
