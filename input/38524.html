This experience was about my 3rd time trying foxy, however I have never tried it at this high of a dose (and the dose was definitely high). The whole thing started at about 11 o'clock when I arrived at my friends house. We both took about 10 mg of foxy when I got there. We played some on the Xbox for about an hour and then listened to music for 15-20 minutes. Foxy comes on slow, first its just some tingling and some possible stomach discomfort ( however I thought it felt good ). And minute by minute the buzzing takes over my whole body. <br><br>
Anyways back to the experience. After about 1 hr and 15 mins we redosed, about 15 more mgs, thinking that this wasnt strong enough yet. We played some more xbox for about 20 minutes then went outside. (as the night progressed I lost track of time so I am estimating) Being outside was quite fun. The trees looked very interesting, incredibly big, and walking through the leaves was very fun. After the walk outside that consisted of about 30 minutes we went inside and took another 20 mg. <br><br>
Then we lied down turned the lights off and listened to music. When I looked a my friends face it was one of the scariest things I have ever seen. However. I can control it if I can just get a grip on reality and tell myself that I am just seeing things. So eventually once we got used to our faces the trip was great. Crazy ass tracers, I mean CRAZY tracers even the music had tracers. Lots of color morphing. The ceiling was also moving like crazy, looked like water was running on it. And the walls were wavy as hell. Everything was very  colorful. It looked like the room was full of stars. This intense color, face morphing, sound morphing, color morphing etc lasted probably 30 mins - 1 hr but seemed like forever. Coming down on the drug was actually not too bad at all. Tracers ga-fucking-lore and colors. <br><br>
This lasted for about 2 hours then they started getting less intense. When I woke up I was soooo....soooo...soooo cracked. I mean fuck...I was dead. I looked LIKE SHIT felt like SHIT and everything was SHIT! Not that the experience was bad. But it was so intense I think I've gotten all I need out of foxy methoxy.<br><br>
At 40 I really lost all sense of reality and was too fucked up to do anything thinking.<!-- End Body -->
