I am well experienced with strong drugs.  I can handle taking 10 hits of acid without ever getting paranoid.  I've taken acid and dxm, which is the most intense mix of drugs ever.  So naturally I wanted to try PCP and see what all the fuss was about.  <br><br>
I didn't intend to mix it with meth earlier, but the guy with the PCP was tweaking and he said it was safe and he mixed it lots of times so I shrugged and smoked one fat rip of crystal meth.  An hour later I smoked a joint with a line of PCP in it.  This is mixing the strongest tranquilizer with the strongest amphetamine.  I was worried after the first hit that it wouldn't get me very fucked up, but by the time the joint was finished, there was no way in hell that I could stand up.  I could kind of stumble if I used all my strength, but I was way beyond walking.  I was just kind of so jacked that I didn't hardly know what was going on.  I could barely stay conscious.  The guy who brought the stuff over was sitting up and talkative, but I could barely move.  Later I crawled into the other room and took one more hit of crystal meth thinking it would wake me up.  After the hit, I laid back on a bed and damn near passed out.  I was so faded that I was in a dreamlike state even though I was awake.  Later I remember taking a gravity bong rip with PCP.  I spent the rest of the night laid out on a couch unable to move or see straight.  It felt like I would imagine a 12 ounce dxm trip would be.  After 5 hours, the guy who sold us the PCP said he came down off it and felt sober.  He's some crazy hardcore tweaker.  When he said he was down, I still couldn't even walk.  <br><br>
The next day I smoked a bowl and felt like I was full on tripping on PCP again.  It instantly made me so tore up that I could pass out.  I felt intoxicated for a few days straight.  A lot of that was probably due to smoking the meth with it.  That was my only experience with PCP.  If I were ever to do it again, I would make sure I have a good 3 or 4 days to recover from it.  Seriously, if I smoked it on a Friday night, I don't know if I would be recovered by Monday.  I don't know if it was just that bomb or if it was the meth that made it so crazy.  I've heard of people going crazy on meth but I couldn't even stand up, let alone get violent even if I'd wanted to.  I'm no lightweight either.  I can take 10 strips of acid casually.<!-- End Body -->
