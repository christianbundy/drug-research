Using ecstasy to aid therapy<br><br>
I am a fan of E, having tried many different drugs, mostly in a concentrated effort to find new 'doorways' to understanding myself.<br><br>
I am a mother of three, my partner and I professional musicians, and responsibilities dictate that I don't get to trip on anything as often as I might otherwise. I have been involved in a very intense Gestalt-type of therapy (only experiential rather than traditional therapist-patient) with some friends of mine for about a year and a half, with the principle aim being 'making the subconscious conscious' and raising actual intelligence/creativity in the process. I found that much of the very hard work I was doing in working through my insecurities and coming to know myself worked very well in combination with E.<br><br>
Sort of like: in 'the work' I struggle towards a goal I am only dimly aware of. I take E, and am inside the goal, but without a road map of how to get there 'for real'. After a time I was able to sustain the clarity of experience for as long as a week (after the same minimal dose, only once a week). My supply dried up, and I am only a little closer to my goal (still moving, albeit at a frustrating crawl). I am very interested in the glimpse I get of the outcome-state in this process, which is one of great clarity and uninhibited creativity.<!-- End Body -->
