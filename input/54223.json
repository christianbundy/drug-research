 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAbout an hour or so ago - popped 150mg of tramadol (Ultram) hcl (three\r\npills so far). \r\n12:38pm (now) - popped one more to make it 200mg after reading up on the pills online a little bit. feeling mildly sedated but still up at \r\nthe same time. i like this high a lot. i'm waiting for my \r\nfriend to deliver my weed to me. i can't wait for the full 200mg\r\nto kick in so i can see what this stuff is all about.\r\nlistening to The Futureheads and it sounds alright. i may be\r\nchanging the music soon.\r\n12:42pm - decide to change the music to Gnarls Barkley. definitely feeling the \r\npills but i'm not used to them so i don't know what to be expecting\r\nor anything. i'm going to continue reading about the pills. the \r\nbody high kind of feels like ecstasy. somewhat euphoric. mild \r\njitters etc.\r\n12:48 - my weed is here!! i'm going to roll up a skimp cigarillo and see if the\r\nweed heightens the high at all. i find myself making a lot of typing\r\nmistakes. finishing up a cigarette. thinking alot about Gnarls Barkley\r\nand how genious the group is. breaking up weed as i write this.\r\n1am - blunt lit. hands were very clumsy and shaky while rolling it. it's very\r\nsmall but it will do the job. sweating mildly. very jittery. almost\r\nuncomfortable but the weed is chilling me out as i type this.\r\n1:05 - blunt is becoming a roach. feeling very good. very very good. sedated.\r\ndreamy. very good. realizing tramadol and weed is a very very very very\r\ngood combo. i may roll up another cigarillo in a little while if i'm\r\nfeeling up to it. dazed. i fall into very deep dazes in with the music\r\nevery once in a while. thinking about putting on some ambient/electronic\r\nmusic. hot hot heat is playing at the moment. feeling very lazy.\r\n1:08 - Mouse on Mars - Idiology album begins. i put on a pair of stereo headphones at 1:10. feeling wild. music is very loud in the headphones.\r\n1:14 - turn itunes visualizer on. the visualizer puts me in a daze.\r\n1:17 - slightly numb in my mouth for some reason. i decide to put on a crazy\r\nsong by rjd2. no more visualizer for now. very fucked up. smoking a\r\ncigarette. this report is going to be very interesting to read. i've\r\nbeen reading many reports similar to what is unfolding here. this drug\r\n... tramadol.... i like this drug. although i got these pills for free..\r\ni would, without a doubt, pay for more. they're very good. i just seem\r\nto keep getting more and more fucked up. I LOVE IT..\r\n1:21 - reading over my report so far. i like it. this is just getting started..\r\ni can tell. RJD2 - 1976 is BANGIN' in my headphones. Ghostwriter by\r\nthe same band begins... sounds very good. music is becoming a journey..\r\neach song is a different journey. all the music i'm playing right now\r\nis instrumental/electronic. so no lyrics. i'm thinking about putting\r\non some good rock. feeling very good. i go get a cup of water and\r\nturn the light off in my room at 1:25.\r\n1:26 - Such Great Heights - The Postal Service begins... this music is so\r\namazing. the heart put into the songs. the postal service is genious.\r\nthe pills are great. but i'm just gonna let it flow from here on. the\r\nmusic causes tons of emotion.. it's all wonderful. i lovvvve this. closing\r\neyes liping the lyrics. when i close my eyes the music flows through me.\r\nminor CEV's. my body is moving in all sorts of ways to the music. sort\r\nof dancing while sitting down. i don't dance. good feelings are all over\r\nthe place at 1:29. \r\n1:30 - brand new colony - the postal service begins... i IM a friend. mild\r\nnausia begins. the music is great. i like the faster pace of this track.\r\nthere's no way i would want to drive on this drug\nnote.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated.\r\n1:36 - explosions in the sky starts. i just changed into my night time clothes.\r\nfeeling good but tired. debating whether to smoke more weed. myspace\r\nis a very very useful tool. one of the best thing's i've seen in the\r\n2000's. the music is wonderful as usual.\r\n1:43 - music is great. talking to two friends. feeling good. getting\r\ninto deep conversation about drugs with one of my friends. almost\r\ncoming down. i wanna smoke more weed. i don't feel like rolling a blunt.\r\nfeeling dazed and tired but happy. the music is fueling me at the moment.\r\n1:53 - i turn the light on to roll up a cigarillo but i'm trying a different\r\nmethod of rolling. (using joint roller). hoping it'll work.\r\n2:01 - mini blunt lit. burning nice and slow. it's like a fat joint-sized\r\ncigar. rolled with perfection. it hits like a dream.i'm gonna be \r\nripped.\r\n2:07 - the blunt is almost done. i can't believe i just texted the girl of my\r\ndreams.\r\n2:10 - blunt is done. i'm having a flirtatious text message conversation with the\r\ngirl of my dreams. WHAT?! i'm for real. explosions in the sky is one\r\nof the best of all time. simple as that. i just felt a very euphoric\r\nfeeling. it was very random. but it was welcomed once it came on. this\r\ndrug is WILD.\r\n2:14 - i spark up a cigarette. the album 'The Rescue' - Explosions in The Sky is\r\none of the most emotional albums i have ever heard. this band has so\r\nmuch heart. i love finding REAL MUSIC. Day Three - explosions.... this\r\ntrack is unbelievable. i'm happy. almost ready for sleep. the cigarette\r\nis very good. camel lights are very rich.\r\n2:18 - appreciatin' my cigs. lol. this drug is minorly similar to ecstasy which\r\nis unbelieveable. the marijuana jets this drug out of control... but i\r\nlove it. this music is CRAZY. \r\n2:21 - i've calmed down a lot since the beginning of this trip report. i like\r\nit a lot more now than i did then. my mind wonders easily now. but\r\ni can bring it back very fast. the music is still fueling me. this\r\nwould be nothing without the music. the soundtrack to this night is\r\nclassic because it made my night for me.\r\n2:24 - i decide it's getting late and that it's almost time for sleep. it will\r\ncome easily in the state i'm in at the moment. i'm on track five of an \r\n8 track album. i think i'll finish it and go to sleep. i couldn't\r\nNOT finish this album. it's too good to be ended so quickly. i'm surprised\r\nmusic is this appreciated on this drug. i'm wondering if i'm one of \r\nfew that have used this drug for it's opaiate ability and not just for\r\nback pain or if a lot of people use it for this. i love this drug.\r\ni'll defiitely come out of this trip with more kowledge...\r\nwhich is very good. i may or may not do these again. i have enough for \r\ntwo more trips equal dosage to the one i'm on now (200mg, four pills).\r\nas a side note i will mention that i broke the pills in half before\r\ni took them so the effects would come on quicker. just incase i forget\r\nthat small bit.\r\n2:30 - smoking a cigarette. this girl is so cute. i wish she was here next to \r\nme right now. on track 6 going on track 7 now. i tidy up my room a bit\r\nbefore laying down to go to sleep. flipped the light off in the begining\r\nof the seventh track. my legs feel kind of numb. i like it. laying down\r\nis gonna feel so good. mildly sweating. thinking about that girl that i\r\ncan carry on a conversation so well with.\r\n2:36 - begining of the last track of the album. this is about it for the night!\r\ni'm just gonna chill to this song. close my eyes and melt. the track is\r\nmildly upbeat. this it for the night. i'll update in the morning.\r\n2:38 - i turn off the computer and lay down for sleep. the trip has been long \r\nand good.\r\n[next day]\r\n12:07pm - i feel very worn down today. very lazy. these pills definitely come\r\nwith a hang over. nothing too bad. but i can tell it's there. my\r\nmorning has been bad because there's a kid that has been blowing up\r\nmy phone since 8am and he has not stopped calling. i guess he needs a\r\nride somewhere. but yeah, after a shower i'm hoping i won't feel so\r\nworn down and tired today. i'm going to read over my report from last\r\nnight. \r\n12:19 - falling asleep last night, from what i can remember, was very easy. i\r\nremember my body was twitching a lot. way way more than usual. the\r\ntwitching was definitely caused by the pills. i kinda remember having\r\nminor CEVs before falling asleep which were kind of keeping me from\r\ncompletely relaxing. i'm really tired still. bout to get in the shower.\r\n12:25 - i hop in the shower.\r\n12:43 - exiting shower. realizing that i came out of this trip with a lot more \r\nthan i originally thought i came out of it with. i'm having the urge\r\nto try something new! i want to impress someone or go to the beach or\r\nsomething i don't normally do! i want to adventure somewhere that i've\r\nnever been. i have a feeling this trip has pushed me to try new things.\r\ni don't know why or how exactly... but i like it. still feeling mild\r\neffects. feeling refreshed after my shower. i feel motivated but tired.\r\nit's all good. i may or may not expiriment with these pills again soon.\r\n[EDIT!]\r\n1:08pm - slight nausea led to projectile vomiting everything out of my stomach (just water). it was horrible but i feel better now. i hadnt eaten last night or this morning, so maybe now i'll eat something. i was not expecting that.\r\n2:30 - first bit of food in 15 hours. slice of pizza. not much of an appetite but i know i need to eat. I'm basically forcing it down.\n\n\n"
