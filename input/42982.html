It was on the last dying trails of and LSD trip that I decided, I would like to kick it up a bit and see if I can go back into outspace, and that I would smoke a bit of 2C-I to tickle my brainmeats a bit more.<br><br>
Now, I have done 2C-I five times as of this writing, the 2C-I that I have had has been obtained from two seperate research chemical companies, and I can be pretty certain about its authenticity, fluffy cotton candy like puffs of ickyness.<br><br>
I seem to have a differant responce to the substance than most, after injestion, even on an empty stomach, it takes 2:30hrs to hit my feelers, 3:00 to 3:30hrs to peak, two fellow explorers have the same timeline, and one feels it in 30 minutes and peaks at 1hr, I dont know why the huge variation in time for this chemical to take hold...<br><br>
My dose range is also higher than listed, as well as for the two with the long wait, our 'sweet spot' is 40mg.<br><br>
Back to the story, I had wanted to avoid the 3hr wait by smoking the 5mg(eyeballed from a premeasured 40mg dose) 2C-I in a freebase pipe I had purchased for DMT and other such journeys. <br><br>
The smoke was horrid, burnt my lungs, but didnt make me cough. After exhaling, the burn kept getting worst, I became asthmatic, and had alot of trouble breathing, I felt like a layer of my lungs had been stripped away. I lay on the couch and tried to breath, I got slight visuals, for a breif momment, and then they where gone. My breathing kept getting worst, after about 1:30 to 2hrs, I was having so much difficulty breathing that I was feeling faint, and fearing passing out, my lungs still hurt. <br><br>
I asked a friend to drive me to the emergency room. I was given sabutimol(spelling?), ventilin, in an oxygen mask, after telling the Dr. I had accidentaly mixed bleach and amonia while cleaning the washroom. Once the asthma subsided, and my lungmeats stopped spasming, I felt alot better, I was breathing normaly, and no longer felt like I was passing out. My lungs where sore all day, and still a bit sore in the morning, but nothing serious. <br><br>
I think that If I had had an asthma inhaler(I had asthma as a kid) I could have avoided the whole hospital bit, but the pain itself is enough to make sure I never try to smoke 2C-I again. However, I still love the stuff, I'm going to the zoo on 2C-I in just a few houres, but I will never complain about the 3hr come up again, well, that not true, im sure I will, But I wont be trying to do anything about it anytime soon....<!-- End Body -->
