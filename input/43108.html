After spending many months researching various substances, I decided that I really wanted to try 5-MeO-DMT. It was the end of my senior year in high school and I was in good academic standing and prepared for my first year in college (or so I thought, lol) In the previous months leading up to the experiment my friend M and I had hit our bustling little suburb town with a fun little ditty known as 2C-E. But, that is another story. <br><br>
I wanted to try 5-MeO for three reasons: one, because of the short duration, yet profound effects when smoked or inhaled; two, because the substance was still legal and easily obtainable; and three, I felt that it was warranted given my situation (full ride to college with an allowance). I figured in my 18 years of wisdom that I had earned the right to try something new.<br><br>
Having relatively little experience with hallucinogens and psychoactives, it goes without saying that I was a little nervous and anxious about inhaling something so powerful. In the months prior to the experiment, I had taken 2C-I on one occasion and 2C-E on several with good results from both. I had previously dosed on LSD (November 2003) at A Perfect Circle concert and had an absolutely amazing experience. Also during my senior year I dabbled a bit in some painkillers and benzodiazepines. I have also smoked pot, and drank since my sophomore year.<br><br>
With all of this leading up to the experiment it was finally time to try 5-METHOXY-N,N-DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE. Since I was rather inexperienced, I didnt have my trusty crack pipe on hand to aid in vaporization so I rigged one up out of aluminum foil (mmm) and a straw. I then placed the chemical into the pipe and held the flame so as not to burn the material. I could see the cloud of smoke begin to form and a million thoughts raced through my mind. Are you sure youre ready for this? Do you think you can handle this? What if something goes wrong? I knew not to dwell on these thoughts but instead closed my eyes and took one breath that I will never forget.<br><br>
The sensation took over immediately with the words Oh my God! fumbling from my lips. My friend M managed to grab the pipe just as I let go and my head hit the steering wheel. Note: We were outside of Ms house and I was in the cab of my car but was *not* driving. I remember seeing a world full of glowing, iridescent colors, where all objects seemed alive and pulsating, full an underlying energy. Then I went into the Void<br><br>
Now, I took the advice I read off other experience reports and made sure I had a sitter present. I am glad I did too because to this day I still get a kick out of his p.o.v. of my experience (he tells it with more creative insight)! <br><br>
Apparently I entered into the Void and began panting very heavily and in very rapid succession (to the point where it is impossible to imitate) with an audible undertone of ha-cha-cha-cha over and over. He said I continued this for about 5 minutes then I suddenly pointed to the cabin light inside my car and made an unmistakable humping motion for another 2 or 3 minutes. On top of this I was chanting in a tongue familiar only to those who have been inside the depths of hell. It was as if you were possessed by Satan himself. M said. Over the course of the next few minutes the chanting morphed into This is so badass. This is so badass. This is so badass, until I finally opened my eyes and saw my two friends staring at me wide-eyed through my car window with a look of total shock. When I awoke? my body felt as if it was entirely liquid. They started laughing at me as they pointed to a mirror so as I could see the huge grin on my face. The body sensation was so pleasant that I couldnt help but smile. I laughed at my reflection and then opened the door to my car.<br><br>
Even after I opened the door, I couldnt exit the vehicle. The feeling I had in my limbs coupled with the heaviest, blissful euphoric buzz I have ever experienced were enough to keep me stationary a least for a few more minutes. I finally gathered the will to get up and managed to walk up the driveway to the circle of chairs we had set out earlier. I sat down and enjoyed the after effects of 5-MeO. By this time M and T had gone inside and insufflated 20mg each and were ready to begin their journey with MeO. When they came out I was still sitting in the circle and handed M his Indian flute. I knew as soon as I saw him that he needed something comfortable and familiar to distract his attention away from the effects of the drug. It seems as though M has a negative or adverse reaction to everything except alcohol. Ambien has been know to keep him speeding all night and into the next day. Weird. He avoids using and has remained sober for quite some time. I am very proud, impressed, and inspired by that.<br><br>
As he began playing the instrument the waves of music pulsated through my body and reverberated through my consciousness. I was affected deeply by his melodies and enjoyed spending the remainder of the experience listening to such a heartfelt and *inspired* performance. We spent the rest of the night smoking cigars and retelling the many stories we have shared in our 10+ years of friendship. Definitely a night to remember<!-- End Body -->
