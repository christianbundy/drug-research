I am a reasonably well balanced thirty something who has a good job, a circle of friends and who enjoys life. I have never been in any trouble; just an 'ordinary Joe' who works, pays the bills and has holidays once a year.<br><br>
I visited some friends in another city about 600 hundred miles away for a long weekend.  We had a couple of joints and then they asked me if I like to do some 'charlie'.  Well I had always wanted to try the stuff so I said yes.<br><br>
After my first line I felt really good, warm, positive, confident and chatty.  The whole experience felt really good.  I returned home with 2 grams 'just to socialise with' but as soon as I got through the door I was snorting the stuff.  The following week I felt totally lost without coke.  So I drove 600 miles to get some more.  This time 4 grams.  Before I knew it I had my friend post it to me every week. I could not believe how much I was spending on the stuff.  This went on for about 4 months.<br><br>
Pretty soon it got to the point where I could not leave the house without 4 - 5 heavy lines.  I knew I was in trouble when one day I was on my hands and knees, with a straw up my nose, looking for traces of coke on the floor.<br><br>
I had a nervous breakdow/depression and was off work for nearly 4 months.  Perhaps the breakdown would have happened any way but the charlie certainly sped it up.  <br><br>
I have not touched the stuff in over three years and I certainly could not stop thinking about it for two years.  I even used to dream about it!  I'm ok now.  Back to being an ordinary Joe who is a little wiser and who doesn't need any drugs now.<!-- End Body -->
