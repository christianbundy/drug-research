I awoke one morning feeling more ill than I have before...severe abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea. These symptoms worsened, and I was puking up bile so we went to the hospital. I knew it was my appendix failing very quickly.<br><br>
Not long after getting there, I was given an injection of meperidine for the pain...I was told I might see things by the nurse, and being an explorer or psychedelic mind states, became quite excited.<br><br>
Well very quickly after the injection, I sank into a warm, heavy, dreamy, eyes closed state, and had no desire to converse with my mum or anyone else there...definitely not a sociable buzz! My pain and discomfort evaporated near immediately. This buffering of pain seemed to last all that eve and into the next day until my surgery. Prior to the surgery I calmed my heart down to 40 beats per second, which impressed the surgeons present, and I had the surgery and an injection of morphine afterwards.<br><br>
The next day when I woke up I walked out and left despite the discomfort as the ward I was on was depressing, filled with dying people.<!-- End Body -->
