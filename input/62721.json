 "report": "<p>I wouldnt say I get a buzz off Phenobarbital, or any schedule IV downers for that matter (unless Im smoking herb).  Its more of a calm.  It makes me more likely to fall asleep than Xanax, and like all schedule IVs, I dont like the feeling of the set in.  I feel incoherent, confused, and drowsy.  I find them much more enjoyable if I build a tolerance by taking a small dose a few hours before the real one.  Or I take a medium dose and fall asleep on a night I dont have to work in the morning.  The next day I take a large dose throughout the day and Im ready to have fun.  These are the only drugs I do that with.</p><p>I have to say benzos are a lot better, although memory formation is much worse with them.  Phenobarbital never made me forget a whole summer like benzos did.  </p><p>There is clarity present with pheno that isnt there with benzos. </p><p>Phenobarbital at 300 or 400 mg makes me feel kind of drunk, but more coherent and apathetic.  A lot of dragging the limbs and leaning against things goes on.   Nothing close to Schedule II barbs from what I hear.</p>"
