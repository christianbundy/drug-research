This was defiantly an experience I believe should be shared with others. Let me first advice others its not usually smart to dose extreme portions with psychedelics, especially research chemicals. On this night I took 75mg of 2c-I. I had dosed several times before, but never exceeding 40mg, and never having a bad time. While using 2c-I could bring about the most intense beauty from the world for me. Although this experience was amazing it was more scary than anything. <br><br>
We took a capsule and waited, and waited, and it seemed like it had been hours, and Im sure it was, and nothing. Two of my friends who hadnt tried 2c-I before doubted me, they didnt believe anything was going to happen, and as time passed even I began to wonder. We walked home, a far enough walk to induce some sort of buzz, but nothing. My friend and I took more capsules, he took one and I took two. We figured what the hell? We even called the person I purchased it from and told him about the situation, he was dazzled, he even drove 100km to see us and make the return. It was during that hour drive that this hurricane hit us. <br><br>
We were dumb founded, I believe when he arrived we were standing in a dark garage giggling, even in the dark we were unable to escape the visuals. It was amazing. I always found the visuals unique, so digital. I compare it to being stuck in a computer game with cheesy 3D graphics. By the time the next capsules hit me I was struck, I didnt know what to think. I had never been that high in my life. I believe I saw a portal to the universe through a door, I was so scared to go through it all night. <br><br>
Eventually I was hallucinating so much that my vision went completely black and white, and parts of the world started to peel away and be replaced by what I can only describe as Space, that shit passed the world. I had some adverse physical conditions. I began to convulse, I was so scared, and this is where I began fearing for my life. At one point I couldnt stop throwing up, it made me feel better though, getting it all out. <br><br>
I remember how slow time passed, it was driving me crazy. When I least expected it the sun rose and I was so relieved, although still amazingly high. We walked and walked and walked and eventually ran into a flock of wild turkeys, it was the most ridiculous site, apparently they are common to the area. <br><br>
All and all it was a moving experience, I had a great time and learned a lot, Im glad I did it, and dont regret anything, but CAUTION! Dosing too much psychedelics is probably bad for me.<!-- End Body -->
