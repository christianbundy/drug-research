 "report": "<p>\nThrough experience, I've found that for me personally, the best way to walk with nutmeg is to injest the pulvarized nut (I use Indonesian) at bedtime prior to the day of the stroll.  Because of the potential harm to kidneys etc. I would never do more than two nuts at once...one and a half is a good-sized dose for me.  It may cause some loosening of the bowels, so be prepared for that.  The effect is noticable upon awakening, and there are varied effects throughout the day.  It can be very heavy so I wouldn't suggest too much activity or the need to handle too many difficult physical or mental tasks.</p>"
