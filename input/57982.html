I made the seeds (2) in the microwave (about 35 second on high each) and took off the covers of the seeds and ground the insides up.. They have a kinda plastic/fragile feeling, yellow and green, but they ground up well. And so I added edible lime to activate the seeds. I made 2 lines and snorted a 1/2 of the first line to see if they work.....o yea they work!!!! I might add that they dont hurt at all if I wet the inside of my nose with water.  <br><br>
(note: I have never tried anything except different varieties of pot but thats all)<br><br>
I lay down and my face started to get very very hot like my face was a 1/2 inch from a fire (this might me ok hot for some ppl but I love the cold, like I take -20 degree showers and I love it) so my neck started to get hot too but being greedy I wanted 'totally awesome amazingness new world things' so I finished the first line but tried a 1/15 of the next line but decided to stop because I hated how hot my face was!<br><br>
This is where it got weird. <br><br>
I lay back down and started to stare at the ceiling light in my room to see what would happen but I started to feel sick to my stomack and stayed as still as I could. Staying still helped my stomach but increased the power of the trip. I ended up saying 'why did I do this to myself....' and 'omg Im going insane' I looked into my headboard mirror and I looked orange and I thought I was gunna just burn up. I kept looking and saying that about 3 times until I felt really sick and ended up puking in my trashbin in my room (because I ate lots of food before trying the seeds!) Then the trip went into hyper mode!!! My computer screen turned the brightest blue Ive ever seen, the color was so 'basic' it was wierd.....the helium tank in my room and no inpurities but was just a purfect orange even tho normally it has tons of black scratches! The white ceiling it my room was sooooo flat and purfect I had to stair at it for a long time, o yea sooooo smooth. The light and tv dont change but everything else does!<br><br>
A little bit later I rolled over onto my stomach and looked at a pillow on the floor and it had a face...so.......I started talking to it lol I knew I was insane but it was ok. Last thing I could remember was when I was laying down and I looked at my hand and it was plastic, like a huge life-like baby doll hand lol soooo cool. It would change when I moved my fingers but thats all I can remember so yea I only took 1 and a 1/15 seeds but Ive never tried a psychedelic before!!!<br><br>
Well all I have to say is if I could extract the 5-meo-dmt from it so I don't get sick, then I will try it again but until then I bought 1,000 seeds for $20 (500 yopo, 500 celbri) so Im all good.<!-- End Body -->
