 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell, to begin with... I'm a heavy smoker smoking about 26-33 cigarettes a day. But despite this I never realized what a powerful euphoriant nicotine can be in sufficient amounts until I had my first experience with a nicotine inhalator. I started with a cardridge which contained a 'filter' with nicotine in it (10 mg). I started to draw looong puffs for about half an hour then I thought it was time to replace the cardridge. \r\nDuring the beginning I sensed some archetypal signs of being on something, distant silent voices and a slight paranoia which passed. I puffed away for an hour or so. Nothing spectacular. Then I decided Id go see my downstairs neighbour. This was the best idea! Almost immediately at her presence (puffing all the time) I began to feel euphoric. I started to smile and the smiling turned into laughter. I felt as if there was no force in the universe that could bring me down or hurt me. I thought this must be better than crack! The high, and it definitely was one, though only lasted about 20 minutes but it was worth it. After that I tried to get back to that pleasurable feeling but no matter how hard I puffed  No effect. So thats about it. I tried to renew my best high ever some weeks after but puffing for about half an hour produced nothing but a pretty depressing shower of thoughts  no high whatsoever. \r\nAll in all I learned to respect the nicotine in a new way and regard the experience as one of my all time highs  ever. No paranoia or sometimes so dreadful expansion of the mind. Just pure solid euphoria - a king feeling.\r\nTomi\n\n\n"
