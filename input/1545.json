 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo good friends and I decided to take a weekend and trip on DOB.  My<br>initial expectations were of a trip very much like 2C-B, but spanning<br>sixteen to twenty hours and fueled by the presence of amphetamine.<br>What occurred was something not entirely different, but not something<br>I'd been anticipating.<br>[T+0h] Saturday noon.  After I munched on a breafast of bacon and eggs, <br>we three wanderers each ingest 2.5mg DOB dissolved in distilled water.<br>Mixed with orange juice; taste imperceptible.  Here goes.<br>[T+0:30] First twinges of a psychedelic drug in my system.<br>[T+0:45] The psychedelic is clearly taking over my brain.  Interacting<br>with the world around me is difficult.  If I know nothing else, it's<br>that I'd better get the hell outta public view.<br>[T+1h] Two of the three of us arrive at a Safe location.  We have a<br>friend who'd volunteered to drive us around that weekend, and so we<br>wait for him to get ready to take us home.  We step inside (out of the<br>sunlight) and immediately my field of vision explodes into<br>characteristically 2C-B visuals.  I notice as well a wave of<br>amphetamine crash over my body, and I am soon feeling like the<br>strongest man alive.  I help my chauffeur lug some very heavy cargo to<br>the van -- effortless.  This shit is SPEEDY.  I am smoking pot because<br>I am compulsed towards it; it seems like a good idea to head off any<br>GI discomfort at the pass.<br>[T+1:30] We two arrive at home and meet the third, who's been coming<br>up on the same schedule.  At this point, when I am in a darkened area,<br>I am completely unable to distinguish visual effects from real<br>objects.  Amphetamine high is still CRUISING.  <br>[T+2h] I am so amped, I could gnaw the head off a puppy.  Fortunately,<br>the fact that my entire perspective is moving, breathing, pulsating,<br>billowing, and crawling keeps me from doing anything useful.  More<br>smoking, and it is noticeably hard to keep it together long enough to<br>pack a bowl.  I am floored.<br>[T+2:30] I am thanking my lucky stars that I am going to have to<br>interact only with people I know very well for the next 20 hours.  I<br>am quite sure that I am having a good time, though -- still feels like<br>2C-B, but HARDER.<br>[T+3h] I would trade a kidney for a pack of Bazooka gum.  I have been<br>becoming more and more disoriented with my surroundings throughout the<br>whole three hours, and it is here that I would call myself 'lost' in<br>my own house.<br>[T+4h] A delightful, non-tripping-his-eyeballs-out friend shows up,<br>and we three enjoy talking to him.  I think it is at this point that<br>the trip begins its second leg; the 2C-B visuals start to fade (very<br>slightly, at this point) and get the hell out of the way, and a very<br>profound, intellectual DOB experience begins.<br>[T+4:20] I pack a bowl.  'See you in 12 hours, guys.'  *rrrrrrrip*<br>[T+5h] I can feel a slight tension lifted from my body as I<br>simultaneously feel my brain kick into high gear.  I eat something<br>because I can somehow tell I need to.  <br>[T+6h] Over T+5-6h, I am able to clear the visuals out of the way<br>(although they're still _very_ strong) and think, think, think.  I<br>suddenly questioned every fact about reality I'd taken for granted.  <br>[T+7h] The amphetamine din has settled into a dull roar, and I am<br>leading my appreciative brain through an odyssey of metaphysically-<br>deep insights into the real and perceived worldview I call 'Reality',<br>leaving open at every corner the chance for anything to be possible.<br>The three of us are happily and hungrily announcing and discussing our<br>current thoughts.  We are settling down into a dark room in the middle<br>of our house, almost like a cocoon, each person in turn putting on the<br>music he believed to be perfect for the situation.<br>[T+9h] We are devouring any knowledge we can, eager to share our<br>amazing experiences and contemplations.  We eat when we need food,<br>drink when we need water, smoke when it feels right.  I feel as though<br>I'm overseeing my body at a higher level than I ever have; I have a<br>good and innate sense of how to take care of myself (food, water, <br>pot, music) without dwelling on the individual feelings and pains in<br>my body.  It is apparent that the 'peak' (T+1-8h) has passed and the<br>effects are beginning a very slow, gradual taper.  Three non-tripping<br>friends appear, and it is very comforting to see faces from the<br>outside world.  We talk and enjoy each other.<br>[T+12h] Less visual, more brainy!  DOB thoughts are leaving me<br>dumbfounded.  I am anxious to wrap my brain around any scenario I can<br>conceive.  I have a correct and instinctual understanding of<br>electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, organic<br>chemistry, algorithmic mathematics in such a way that I can simply<br>'feel' in what trend a particular system will act.  By possessing this<br>deep understanding of physics and mathematics, the rules of my<br>universe, I can detect patterns shared among wildly different systems<br>(the ties that bind between social, chemical, and physical<br>interactions).  I cook pasta for the six of us, and as it is<br>well-received I ponder the satisfaction of crafting something for my<br>friends and having it appreciated.  <br>It's interesting to note that this experience was more what I would<br>call 'Ecstasy' than MDMA is.  My past drug experiences were<br>embarrassed and belittled by the DOB's gravity, its unique<br>characteristic of allowing me to invent a constant stream of Heavy<br>Shit for my mind to happily plow through.  I felt like I'd never<br>thought about anything so important; my most fundamental concepts of<br>reality were shaken to the core for the first time, and in comparison<br>it makes the visceral high of a 'quality' MDMA or mushroom trip seem<br>positively rude.  Whereas MDMA might allow me to reach a comfortable<br>synergy with the people around me, DOB provided a glimpse of what it<br>might be like to achieve Nirvana, to exist as pure thought.  When it<br>comes right down to it, this is why I ingest psychedelics.  This is<br>what it's all about.<br>I had some very momentous insights into heritage and family ties, from<br>my relationship with my dad to my kinship with the creatures from<br>which I evolved.  I was given a chance to grasp the infinity of the<br>universe; understanding its specifics was clearly out of reach, but I<br>understood why it was acting how it was acting, on the whole.  DOB is<br>completely orthogonal to the emotional realm; it does not alter my<br>mood at all, and only allows me to enjoy it because I enjoy thinking.  <br>[T+14h] 2am Sunday, and it is here that things really begin to screech<br>to a halt.  Our conversation becomes less frequent, and I become more<br>introspective.  It's time to let the music take over.<br>[T+16:20] 4:20am and I'm keeping true to the previous afternoon's<br>promise.  We are content to keep ourselves warm, hydrated and fed, and<br>bathed in music.  Very faint visuals.  Coming down, no question about it.<br>[T+20h] It is around this point in time when each of us three dozes<br>off in turn; we're right on the tail end of the DOB's effects.<br>[T+22h] At 10am Sunday, I declared the DOB's mental effects 'over'.<br>[T+33h] After a full day of doing stuff and feeling generally ok, it's<br>sleepytime. :)<br>DOB tore me a new asshole.  I cannot describe it without its power<br>making itself apparent in my speech; DOB will forever hold a special<br>place in my heart, a place earned as a Truly Psychedelic Drug.  If<br>treated with respect, I believe DOB can show us how awesome the<br>human condition can be.\n\n\n"
