 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo good friends and I decided to take a weekend and trip on DOB.  My\r\ninitial expectations were of a trip very much like 2C-B, but spanning\r\nsixteen to twenty hours and fueled by the presence of amphetamine.\r\nWhat occurred was something not entirely different, but not something\r\nI'd been anticipating.\r\n[T+0h] Saturday noon.  After I munched on a breafast of bacon and eggs, \r\nwe three wanderers each ingest 2.5mg DOB dissolved in distilled water.\r\nMixed with orange juice; taste imperceptible.  Here goes.\r\n[T+0:30] First twinges of a psychedelic drug in my system.\r\n[T+0:45] The psychedelic is clearly taking over my brain.  Interacting\r\nwith the world around me is difficult.  If I know nothing else, it's\r\nthat I'd better get the hell outta public view.\r\n[T+1h] Two of the three of us arrive at a Safe location.  We have a\r\nfriend who'd volunteered to drive us around that weekend, and so we\r\nwait for him to get ready to take us home.  We step inside (out of the\r\nsunlight) and immediately my field of vision explodes into\r\ncharacteristically 2C-B visuals.  I notice as well a wave of\r\namphetamine crash over my body, and I am soon feeling like the\r\nstrongest man alive.  I help my chauffeur lug some very heavy cargo to\r\nthe van -- effortless.  This shit is SPEEDY.  I am smoking pot because\r\nI am compulsed towards it; it seems like a good idea to head off any\r\nGI discomfort at the pass.\r\n[T+1:30] We two arrive at home and meet the third, who's been coming\r\nup on the same schedule.  At this point, when I am in a darkened area,\r\nI am completely unable to distinguish visual effects from real\r\nobjects.  Amphetamine high is still CRUISING.  \r\n[T+2h] I am so amped, I could gnaw the head off a puppy.  Fortunately,\r\nthe fact that my entire perspective is moving, breathing, pulsating,\r\nbillowing, and crawling keeps me from doing anything useful.  More\r\nsmoking, and it is noticeably hard to keep it together long enough to\r\npack a bowl.  I am floored.\r\n[T+2:30] I am thanking my lucky stars that I am going to have to\r\ninteract only with people I know very well for the next 20 hours.  I\r\nam quite sure that I am having a good time, though -- still feels like\r\n2C-B, but HARDER.\r\n[T+3h] I would trade a kidney for a pack of Bazooka gum.  I have been\r\nbecoming more and more disoriented with my surroundings throughout the\r\nwhole three hours, and it is here that I would call myself 'lost' in\r\nmy own house.\r\n[T+4h] A delightful, non-tripping-his-eyeballs-out friend shows up,\r\nand we three enjoy talking to him.  I think it is at this point that\r\nthe trip begins its second leg; the 2C-B visuals start to fade (very\r\nslightly, at this point) and get the hell out of the way, and a very\r\nprofound, intellectual DOB experience begins.\r\n[T+4:20] I pack a bowl.  'See you in 12 hours, guys.'  *rrrrrrrip*\r\n[T+5h] I can feel a slight tension lifted from my body as I\r\nsimultaneously feel my brain kick into high gear.  I eat something\r\nbecause I can somehow tell I need to.  \r\n[T+6h] Over T+5-6h, I am able to clear the visuals out of the way\r\n(although they're still _very_ strong) and think, think, think.  I\r\nsuddenly questioned every fact about reality I'd taken for granted.  \r\n[T+7h] The amphetamine din has settled into a dull roar, and I am\r\nleading my appreciative brain through an odyssey of metaphysically-\r\ndeep insights into the real and perceived worldview I call 'Reality',\r\nleaving open at every corner the chance for anything to be possible.\r\nThe three of us are happily and hungrily announcing and discussing our\r\ncurrent thoughts.  We are settling down into a dark room in the middle\r\nof our house, almost like a cocoon, each person in turn putting on the\r\nmusic he believed to be perfect for the situation.\r\n[T+9h] We are devouring any knowledge we can, eager to share our\r\namazing experiences and contemplations.  We eat when we need food,\r\ndrink when we need water, smoke when it feels right.  I feel as though\r\nI'm overseeing my body at a higher level than I ever have; I have a\r\ngood and innate sense of how to take care of myself (food, water, \r\npot, music) without dwelling on the individual feelings and pains in\r\nmy body.  It is apparent that the 'peak' (T+1-8h) has passed and the\r\neffects are beginning a very slow, gradual taper.  Three non-tripping\r\nfriends appear, and it is very comforting to see faces from the\r\noutside world.  We talk and enjoy each other.\r\n[T+12h] Less visual, more brainy!  DOB thoughts are leaving me\r\ndumbfounded.  I am anxious to wrap my brain around any scenario I can\r\nconceive.  I have a correct and instinctual understanding of\r\nelectricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, organic\r\nchemistry, algorithmic mathematics in such a way that I can simply\r\n'feel' in what trend a particular system will act.  By possessing this\r\ndeep understanding of physics and mathematics, the rules of my\r\nuniverse, I can detect patterns shared among wildly different systems\r\n(the ties that bind between social, chemical, and physical\r\ninteractions).  I cook pasta for the six of us, and as it is\r\nwell-received I ponder the satisfaction of crafting something for my\r\nfriends and having it appreciated.  \r\nIt's interesting to note that this experience was more what I would\r\ncall 'Ecstasy' than MDMA is.  My past drug experiences were\r\nembarrassed and belittled by the DOB's gravity, its unique\r\ncharacteristic of allowing me to invent a constant stream of Heavy\r\nShit for my mind to happily plow through.  I felt like I'd never\r\nthought about anything so important; my most fundamental concepts of\r\nreality were shaken to the core for the first time, and in comparison\r\nit makes the visceral high of a 'quality' MDMA or mushroom trip seem\r\npositively rude.  Whereas MDMA might allow me to reach a comfortable\r\nsynergy with the people around me, DOB provided a glimpse of what it\r\nmight be like to achieve Nirvana, to exist as pure thought.  When it\r\ncomes right down to it, this is why I ingest psychedelics.  This is\r\nwhat it's all about.\r\nI had some very momentous insights into heritage and family ties, from\r\nmy relationship with my dad to my kinship with the creatures from\r\nwhich I evolved.  I was given a chance to grasp the infinity of the\r\nuniverse; understanding its specifics was clearly out of reach, but I\r\nunderstood why it was acting how it was acting, on the whole.  DOB is\r\ncompletely orthogonal to the emotional realm; it does not alter my\r\nmood at all, and only allows me to enjoy it because I enjoy thinking.  \r\n[T+14h] 2am Sunday, and it is here that things really begin to screech\r\nto a halt.  Our conversation becomes less frequent, and I become more\r\nintrospective.  It's time to let the music take over.\r\n[T+16:20] 4:20am and I'm keeping true to the previous afternoon's\r\npromise.  We are content to keep ourselves warm, hydrated and fed, and\r\nbathed in music.  Very faint visuals.  Coming down, no question about it.\r\n[T+20h] It is around this point in time when each of us three dozes\r\noff in turn; we're right on the tail end of the DOB's effects.\r\n[T+22h] At 10am Sunday, I declared the DOB's mental effects 'over'.\r\n[T+33h] After a full day of doing stuff and feeling generally ok, it's\r\nsleepytime. :)\r\nDOB tore me a new asshole.  I cannot describe it without its power\r\nmaking itself apparent in my speech; DOB will forever hold a special\r\nplace in my heart, a place earned as a Truly Psychedelic Drug.  If\r\ntreated with respect, I believe DOB can show us how awesome the\r\nhuman condition can be.\n\n\n"
