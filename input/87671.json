 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've had an opportunity to trial a interesting new compound over the last couple of weeks NBOMEe 2cc (25C NBOMe) or 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine or 2-4-chloro-25-dimethoxyphenyl-N-2-methoxyphenylmethylethanamine<br>Set and setting: At home. bored on a weekday.<br>First trial at 300umg sublingually, using the liquid measurement method at 100ugm,s per drop. Three drops were applied to a paper towel and were held under the tongue for 15mins. A slight numbing is noticed but this could a result of the alcohol the substance was dissolved in.<br>30mins nothing really noticed at this point<br>45min slight stomach discomfort noted<br>60min starting to notice some color brightening and a slight energy push...<br>75min coming up now. Color intensification increasing, a mild euphoria noted <br>90 min Nice...effects are very manageable. visuals are like 2C-C visuals but, with a nice body high and slight energy push. No real negative body issues noted.<br>90min -160min went for nice long walk around the neighborhood.The body feels good and mentally feeling quite in control even though I'm tripping at low +++<br>300min I notice the energy push is waning a little. visuals still going ++ to +++<br>300min - 360min body high slowly decreasing and visuals have decreased to ++<br>480 mins back to baseline total duration is about 8 to 9 hours<br>Second trial 400ugm sublingually<br>Same effects as above are noted: euphoria and energy were increased somewhat. Visuals were still close to the same level low +++ level. Very 2C-C-like in nature.<br>400ugms seems to be a good working dosage. Be careful going higher with this one though. I've heard reports of increasing negative effects going past 1mg.<br>Better be safe then sorry....;-)<br>All in all a very worthwhile and novel new compound. Its not a very introspective chemical, but more of a rave or party drug. Not in your face like MDMA but a special chemical in it own right.<br>cheers\n\n\n"
