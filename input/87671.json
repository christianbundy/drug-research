 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've had an opportunity to trial a interesting new compound over the last couple of weeks NBOMEe 2cc (25C NBOMe) or 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine or 2-4-chloro-25-dimethoxyphenyl-N-2-methoxyphenylmethylethanamine\r\nSet and setting: At home. bored on a weekday.\r\nFirst trial at 300umg sublingually, using the liquid measurement method at 100ugm,s per drop. Three drops were applied to a paper towel and were held under the tongue for 15mins. A slight numbing is noticed but this could a result of the alcohol the substance was dissolved in.\r\n30mins nothing really noticed at this point\r\n45min slight stomach discomfort noted\r\n60min starting to notice some color brightening and a slight energy push...\r\n75min coming up now. Color intensification increasing, a mild euphoria noted \r\n90 min Nice...effects are very manageable. visuals are like 2C-C visuals but, with a nice body high and slight energy push. No real negative body issues noted.\r\n90min -160min went for nice long walk around the neighborhood.The body feels good and mentally feeling quite in control even though I'm tripping at low +++\r\n300min I notice the energy push is waning a little. visuals still going ++ to +++\r\n300min - 360min body high slowly decreasing and visuals have decreased to ++\r\n480 mins back to baseline total duration is about 8 to 9 hours\r\nSecond trial 400ugm sublingually\r\nSame effects as above are noted: euphoria and energy were increased somewhat. Visuals were still close to the same level low +++ level. Very 2C-C-like in nature.\r\n400ugms seems to be a good working dosage. Be careful going higher with this one though. I've heard reports of increasing negative effects going past 1mg.\r\nBetter be safe then sorry....;-)\r\nAll in all a very worthwhile and novel new compound. Its not a very introspective chemical, but more of a rave or party drug. Not in your face like MDMA but a special chemical in it own right.\r\ncheers\n\n\n"
