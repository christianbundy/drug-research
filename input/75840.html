Note: Bought 50 seeds from a trusted source, did not ingest food for 5 hours prior.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 24 seeds of H.B. Woodrose is considered an extremely high dose, see H.B. Woodrose Dose Chart]</font> <br><br>
Well I had a night with nothing planned and only one appointment the next day so I figured I'd try them out. Started out with 5 seeds, chewing for about 5-7 minutes before swallowing. Then I moved on to 8 seeds and then I took the rest, chewing them the same way. For the first half an hour there wasn't much of a feeling, maybe a little buzz that felt like drinking one or two beers. Another thirty minutes after that and I started to feel giggly. Everything seemed more entertaining and simple tasks seemed infinitely more interesting.<br><br>
In another 30-40 minutes I started to have hot and cold rushes, I also felt fully aware of my surroundings and I was getting very light visuals. I was talking with a friend and I kept licking my lips and feeling all of the hair on my upper lip, at one point I really had a craving to lick my dogs eye (haha yeah). After 10 more minutes had past I start getting more intense visuals, my friend was morphing between Lucy Liu, Elvis, and John Lennon. In addition to this when I went to the washroom and looked in the mirror I turned into a snowman for about 5 minutes and this caused me to freak out a little so I started splashing water on my face. Doing this seemed to cause the snow to melt away (lol) and I was underneath. After staring at myself for another moment I started to morph. I would get taller and more fit, shorter and larger, etc. Eventually I just left the washroom because it was freaking me out a bit and I couldn't remember what I looked like so I just left the washroom to go back with my friend.<br><br>
At this point I wasn't sure what to do, I wanted to do something fun that would maybe intensify the visuals but I just ended up talking with my friend for an hour while he morphed around into celebrities. Eventually the effects were calming down a little (effects started at 9:30pm, didn't calm down until about 2:00am) and he decided to go home. When he left I went to put on a hoodie because I was cold and spent 20 minutes trying to put the damn thing on before I gave up. So feeling a little cold I decided to walk around the house and all of a sudden I started to remember all sorts of things from my childhood, it's like they were flowing into my head (the memories) and I couldn't stop them. And not just a normal 'oh yeah I remember that.. her name was so-and-so right?', I could clearly see the memories, it was almost as if I teleported back in time and was re-living them. It was very intense and made me analyze my life so far. Really made me think about certain choices I've made.<br><br>
After the memories started to fade I really wanted to get some sleep so I didn't miss the appointment in the morning so I just spent 20 minutes getting ready for bed (all I had to do was change and pull the covers up but that seemed impossible at the time), once that was done I hopped in bed and the room started spinning and I was thrown into the sky with fluffy sheep, clouds and beds floating around. I had this huge smile on my face and I thought this was the best thing I had ever seen and I felt so warm and comfortable. After a few moments I actually drifted off to sleep however (just a note, bedtime was about 3:30am).<br><br>
In the morning when I woke up my head felt like there was mild pressure on it. It was a little uncomfortable but not as bad as a regular headache. In addition to this my pupils were dilated and I was quite sensitive to light. <br><br>
Overall I felt this was a great experience. I saw new things, I was able to reflect on past choices and experiences and overall I feel I learned something from this. I haven't taken them again since but maybe soon when I have some free time or more reflecting to do.<!-- End Body -->
