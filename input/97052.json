 "report": "\n\n\n\nTo follow is a very delightful poem that was recited to me while enjoying the experience with several friends one evening. It is a poem written especially about ecstacy and how the world could benefit from its beautiful effects. I knew when I heard it I would be memorizing it to share with anyone and everyone that would listen and believe that with people loving one another around the world, we could all truly live in ecstacy...\r\nLITTLE PILL WHITE AND ROUND,\r\nGULP OF WATER, TURBO DOWN!\r\nANXIETY NOW, CAN'T STAND OR SIT,\r\nJUST WAIT, DON'T WORRY, IT WILL HIT!\r\nIN HALF-AN-HOUR YOU RISE INSIDE,\r\nEVERYONE LOVES, NO HATE TO HIDE.\r\nEVERYTHING'S GOOD, THERE IS NO WRONG,\r\nIF THE WHOLE WORLD SWALLOWED IT,\r\nEVERYONE WOULD GET ALONG...\r\nWORLD PEACE I HAVE A VISION,\r\nCANNOT BE OBTAINED THROUGH RELIGION;\r\nBUT CAN BE RESOLVED CHEMICALLY.\r\nTHERE IS A GOD CALLED XTC!\n\n\n"
