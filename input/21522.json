Some material (\n</p><p>Approximately 2 fl oz (~59 ml) of naphtha (Ronsonol lighter fluid, all I had left) was added, and the jar sealed.  The jar was agitated, producing a milky liquid layer atop a layer of seed grit.  The jar was then set aside in a cool, dark location and agitated at irregular intervals for 25 hours.</p><p>Separated solids from solvent using a coffee filter.  This process was unexpectedly slow, taking nearly an hour.  Stirring the seed mush with a pin seemed to help accelerate the drainage of the solvent.  Again, some material (\n</p><p>Placed the coffee filter containing the damp seed mush on several thicknesses of paper towels to dry.  The seed mush was spread out to speed evaporation and a couple of paper towels placed on top to absorb the last of the solvent.  The filtered solvent was discarded.  The Mason jar and its lid were thoroughly rinsed in warm running water until no trace of naphtha odor remained, then left on paper towels to dry.</p><p>After 30 hours, the seed grit was fully dry, with no remaining scent of naphtha.  This was then returned to the clean Mason jar and overproof Scotch whisky (59.5% ABV) added to make a total of 4 fl oz (~118 ml).  The jar was then sealed, shaken vigourously, and left in a cool, dark spot.  The jar was agitated at irregular intervals, and the seed mush steeped for a total of 2 days, 7 hours.</p><p>Again separated solids from solvent using a fresh coffee filter, this time retaining the solvent and discarding the now-spent seed mush at the end.  Filtration took ~30 minutes and was expedited by squeezing the damp seed matter near the end to extract more liquid.  The liqueur thus produced was sealed into the clean Mason jar (jar and lid cleaned as previously) and stored in a cool, dark location until use.</p><p>The liqueur is estimated to contain slightly less than 4mg LSA and less than 2mg of other, related psychoactive agents at this point, allowing for losses in the entire process.  The total volume of liqueur is ~3 fl oz (~89 ml), and the entire process took 112 hours (4 days, 16 hours).  My intention is to divide this into 2 equal doses.</p><p>Dose #1</p><p>T+0</p><p>Measured out 1.5 fl oz (~44 ml) LSA-Scotch liqueur, diluted with half as much (.75 fl oz, 22 ml) spring water, and drank it down over a period of 2 or 3 minutes.  The aroma of the liqueur had an earthy tone not normally associated with the Scotch whisky that was used as solvent.  The flavour was unpleasant, but bearable.  The aftertaste was more unpleasant and made me want to gag, but a swig of water fixed that.</p><p>I had been smoking cannabis for several hours previous to ingesting the liqueur, and hoped that the combination of this and the ethanol would alleviate or prevent any possible nausea.  I took a few more tokes now for good measure.</p><p>T+1:30</p><p>Started coming on hard at around T+1h.  Steadily building since then.  Barely able to type, getting hard to think coherently.</p><p>T+3:30</p><p>Looks like I peaked early again, and not nearly as high as I expected to.  I'm drinking the rest of the liqueur now.</p><p>T+5</p><p>Another slight come-up and some mild but fun OEVs (mostly colourful sparkles), but nothing Earth-shattering going on here, as evidenced by the fact that I can still type and form somewhat coherent, if run-on, sentences.  I'm beginning to conclude that MG extractions are a waste of time and one should just pulverise and eat the seeds.  Sometimes the 'old-fashioned' ways really are best, after all.</p><p>T+6:45</p><p>Dang, coming down before it ever got really interesting.  Feeling almost baseline now.  No spiritual insights this time.  At peak, some mild euphoria and OEVs (already described), but never even came close to 'breaking through' into tripspace.  I conclude that MG is best ingested directly rather than attempting to extract the LSA as it seems much more effective.  By the way, no nausea at any time.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>LSA Extraction is not worth the time and trouble.  This experience was educational, and moderately recreational, but useless spiritually.  In comparison with direct ingestion of MG seeds, direct ingestion produced more profound effects with much less source material (4.5g direct vs. 12g extracted Heavenly Blue seeds).  My next effort will focus on a larger direct oral dose.</p>"
