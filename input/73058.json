 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt was a rainy day \r\nI had a headache\r\nThis\r\nI have to say makes for an interesting tale of facets, of euphoria, of wellbeing and of love.\r\nI had commitments last night, I had promised a friend that I would go to his gallery opening I had also however just received a curiousity, the methylone.\r\nI was never really one for social event such as gallery openings\r\nFor those who dont know, it generally an ordeal for those who dont enjoy small talk, wine and large groups of insecure people gathered in one space.\r\nHowever this night I decided I would try the methylone\r\nI hadnt eaten anything for a number of hours so had pretty much an empty stomach.\r\nI dont have scales\r\nSo I worked old school\r\nDividing the yellowy powder with a card,\r\nTipping it into a glass of water\r\nA little stir\r\nIt tastes slightly bitter\r\nBut not unpleasant\r\nThe time now is about 7.10pm\r\nI am on the phone to my friend with whom I will join later\r\nI tell him that I am drinking this stuff\r\nI finish the phone call \r\nI feel clearer\r\nIts now 7.20\r\nmy headache has pretty much gone\r\nit normally take me a while to get out the house\r\nbut I was on the bus by 7.30\r\nand the bus journey was nice\r\nI felt great\r\nAnd clear headed\r\nWith no feelings of paranoia\r\nI didnt worry about the other people on the bus \r\nI am listening to music, it sounds good, but it is good. A DJ set from Berlin. It just enhances my good mood.  Im tapping my feet a little but I dont feel like I want to burst into dance!\r\nI get there and there at about 8pm\r\nI felt as free as a bird\r\nI flitted around talking to many people, those I knew, those I didnt.\r\nI felt as though I was full of positive confidence, the kind which is not full of ego. \r\nEveryone is drinking, I dont want to drink. I dont really like it anyway. \r\nI have nice conversations, very caring. Conversations flow easily with everybody, even those that I dont like. Again there is no paranoia which I might feel on E or mdma. My mind is clear. I am able for the rest of the night to deal with all kinds of social situations which I may have otherwise found challenging.\r\nI clocked my friend \r\nLets call him MP\r\nOf course as many faceted as the world is I could not just go up and speak to him.\r\nOh no for tonight, in this setting anyway, we were to play a little game.\r\nFor no one was to know that we really knew eachother  yes, its true artists are a bunch of no good scoundrels!\r\nExchanging glances every so often, I began to feel that enhanced sex drive similar to mdma but with out the confusion.\r\nI floated around looking at the artwork\r\nI didnt feel the forced need to mingle \r\nIt came very naturally \r\nI was very comfortable in the space.\r\nSpeaking is easy, with only one notable minor drug sounding,slur!\r\nAn hour went by \r\n9pm ish\r\nI felt the need to smoke more than usual, as I dont smoke cigarettes much anymore\r\nBut, as with many drugs\r\nI enjoyed heart felt conversations with friends.\r\nEventually after much circulating\r\nWe decided it was time to leave MP and I\r\nWe went out separate ways\r\nMeeting at the bus stop\r\nYes!\r\nNow it was time to go to the circus!\r\nYes, literally.\r\nWe happen to live in a city which once a year, for one month only, experiences its population more than double, and this toy town comes to life with music, cabaret, theatre, dance etc.\r\nApproaching 10pm\r\nWe kiss \r\nIt feels great\r\nWell it always feels great \r\nBut the methylone in my brain and the previous situation of sexual tension makes this kiss explosive.\r\nWe go to a bar\r\nI am totally loved up \r\nAgain not like mdma really, you see I dont like mdma too much as it makes me feel a bit confused and paranoid, its like on mdma my feelings are not true. They are just chemical. \r\nWith Methylone I felt I could let my guard down completely, and let the drug take its course. I see now why its sometimes called Ease.\r\nI ask MP if he would like to join me down pleasant street\r\nWe order juice and tonic water\r\nI dose his drink with about the same amount as me\r\nIt is 10.20pm\r\nI am still flying\r\nI feel fantastic\r\nAgain within 10 minutes MP has joined me\r\nAnd we cant keep our hands of one another\r\nSmall rushes of euphoria come in waves, remaining just at the right level to remain tucked within the inner self.\r\nWe talk about how we feel \r\nTruly and honestly \r\nAnd its beautiful\r\nThere is no false e-talk here\r\n10.50 we head off to the circus\r\nit is still raining heavily\r\nand when we get there the que is long\r\nwe continue kissing under our umbrella\r\nneedless to say we are both very much hedonists!\r\nThe que isnt too bad, I decide to drop a very small about of acid.\r\nSmall as I dont want to override the methylone first time round, small also because we are going to the circus, and really there isnt need to enhance the experience too much!\r\nThe acid came on quickly. Although at this small dose gave me that slight headache and feeling in the top of the mouth sensation. \r\nThe performance was great, twas Le Clique in fact\r\nI love that sort of thing anyway, I really enjoy this time of year here, as people like MP and I are always this way, and for this month many others come into town, other performers and new friends. I feel really happy in this new environment\r\nI am even starting to get a little full of myself\r\nI begin playing up to the circus/cabaret vibe, I am also wearing my soviet generals outfit one of them. This is normal for me though!\r\nWe both enjoy the acts\r\nMP I can tell is feeling that increased sex drive I mentioned earlier\r\nWe go out at half time \r\nAnd enjoy cigarettes and dirty dancing in the rain.\r\nWhen we leave the circus it is about 2am\r\nThe rain looked beautiful on the ground\r\nWe wished we could go home\r\nBut in our situation this was no possible \r\nWe had to eventually go our separate ways\r\nHowever horny we were!\r\nA taxi home\r\nA kiss goodnight\r\nI am home\r\nIt is nearly 3am\r\nI go into my room\r\nI think im tripping\r\nAs to my surprise I see a shape in my bed\r\nThere is someone asleep in there!\r\nI deal with the situation\r\nIts one of the lost boys of never EVER land\r\nI am surprised at my cool ability to deal with the situation\r\nHe is promptly evicted \r\nI decide to have a joint\r\nUnexpected OEVs!\r\nControlable though, nothing too heavy.\r\nI shut my eyes\r\nIn a bid to hope that sleep will come\r\nI hear the sounds of rain outside becoming distorted \r\nIntense CEVs!\r\nWoah\r\nI had no idea! \r\nThese CEVs were where I saw the really synergy between the acid and the methylone\r\nThey had the slight dark side of acid, with similar colours. However the bliss was there which carried me through nicely into dreams of utopia with MP.\r\nIn all this was a very pleasant experience \r\nBetter than I had expected\r\nThere is only one thing I worry about \r\nAnd that is, I would be tempted to use this chemical more often for events such as openings and the like.\r\nI awoke early\r\nTypically feeling as though I never slept\r\nI feel great though\r\nA little tierd\r\nBut full of positive energy \r\nI hope MP feels this good\n\n\n"
