 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt was a rainy day <br>I had a headache<br>This<br>I have to say makes for an interesting tale of facets, of euphoria, of wellbeing and of love.<br>I had commitments last night, I had promised a friend that I would go to his gallery opening I had also however just received a curiousity, the methylone.<br>I was never really one for social event such as gallery openings<br>For those who dont know, it generally an ordeal for those who dont enjoy small talk, wine and large groups of insecure people gathered in one space.<br>However this night I decided I would try the methylone<br>I hadnt eaten anything for a number of hours so had pretty much an empty stomach.<br>I dont have scales<br>So I worked old school<br>Dividing the yellowy powder with a card,<br>Tipping it into a glass of water<br>A little stir<br>It tastes slightly bitter<br>But not unpleasant<br>The time now is about 7.10pm<br>I am on the phone to my friend with whom I will join later<br>I tell him that I am drinking this stuff<br>I finish the phone call <br>I feel clearer<br>Its now 7.20<br>my headache has pretty much gone<br>it normally take me a while to get out the house<br>but I was on the bus by 7.30<br>and the bus journey was nice<br>I felt great<br>And clear headed<br>With no feelings of paranoia<br>I didnt worry about the other people on the bus <br>I am listening to music, it sounds good, but it is good. A DJ set from Berlin. It just enhances my good mood.  Im tapping my feet a little but I dont feel like I want to burst into dance!<br>I get there and there at about 8pm<br>I felt as free as a bird<br>I flitted around talking to many people, those I knew, those I didnt.<br>I felt as though I was full of positive confidence, the kind which is not full of ego. <br>Everyone is drinking, I dont want to drink. I dont really like it anyway. <br>I have nice conversations, very caring. Conversations flow easily with everybody, even those that I dont like. Again there is no paranoia which I might feel on E or mdma. My mind is clear. I am able for the rest of the night to deal with all kinds of social situations which I may have otherwise found challenging.<br>I clocked my friend <br>Lets call him MP<br>Of course as many faceted as the world is I could not just go up and speak to him.<br>Oh no for tonight, in this setting anyway, we were to play a little game.<br>For no one was to know that we really knew eachother  yes, its true artists are a bunch of no good scoundrels!<br>Exchanging glances every so often, I began to feel that enhanced sex drive similar to mdma but with out the confusion.<br>I floated around looking at the artwork<br>I didnt feel the forced need to mingle <br>It came very naturally <br>I was very comfortable in the space.<br>Speaking is easy, with only one notable minor drug sounding,slur!<br>An hour went by <br>9pm ish<br>I felt the need to smoke more than usual, as I dont smoke cigarettes much anymore<br>But, as with many drugs<br>I enjoyed heart felt conversations with friends.<br>Eventually after much circulating<br>We decided it was time to leave MP and I<br>We went out separate ways<br>Meeting at the bus stop<br>Yes!<br>Now it was time to go to the circus!<br>Yes, literally.<br>We happen to live in a city which once a year, for one month only, experiences its population more than double, and this toy town comes to life with music, cabaret, theatre, dance etc.<br>Approaching 10pm<br>We kiss <br>It feels great<br>Well it always feels great <br>But the methylone in my brain and the previous situation of sexual tension makes this kiss explosive.<br>We go to a bar<br>I am totally loved up <br>Again not like mdma really, you see I dont like mdma too much as it makes me feel a bit confused and paranoid, its like on mdma my feelings are not true. They are just chemical. <br>With Methylone I felt I could let my guard down completely, and let the drug take its course. I see now why its sometimes called Ease.<br>I ask MP if he would like to join me down pleasant street<br>We order juice and tonic water<br>I dose his drink with about the same amount as me<br>It is 10.20pm<br>I am still flying<br>I feel fantastic<br>Again within 10 minutes MP has joined me<br>And we cant keep our hands of one another<br>Small rushes of euphoria come in waves, remaining just at the right level to remain tucked within the inner self.<br>We talk about how we feel <br>Truly and honestly <br>And its beautiful<br>There is no false e-talk here<br>10.50 we head off to the circus<br>it is still raining heavily<br>and when we get there the que is long<br>we continue kissing under our umbrella<br>needless to say we are both very much hedonists!<br>The que isnt too bad, I decide to drop a very small about of acid.<br>Small as I dont want to override the methylone first time round, small also because we are going to the circus, and really there isnt need to enhance the experience too much!<br>The acid came on quickly. Although at this small dose gave me that slight headache and feeling in the top of the mouth sensation. <br>The performance was great, twas Le Clique in fact<br>I love that sort of thing anyway, I really enjoy this time of year here, as people like MP and I are always this way, and for this month many others come into town, other performers and new friends. I feel really happy in this new environment<br>I am even starting to get a little full of myself<br>I begin playing up to the circus/cabaret vibe, I am also wearing my soviet generals outfit one of them. This is normal for me though!<br>We both enjoy the acts<br>MP I can tell is feeling that increased sex drive I mentioned earlier<br>We go out at half time <br>And enjoy cigarettes and dirty dancing in the rain.<br>When we leave the circus it is about 2am<br>The rain looked beautiful on the ground<br>We wished we could go home<br>But in our situation this was no possible <br>We had to eventually go our separate ways<br>However horny we were!<br>A taxi home<br>A kiss goodnight<br>I am home<br>It is nearly 3am<br>I go into my room<br>I think im tripping<br>As to my surprise I see a shape in my bed<br>There is someone asleep in there!<br>I deal with the situation<br>Its one of the lost boys of never EVER land<br>I am surprised at my cool ability to deal with the situation<br>He is promptly evicted <br>I decide to have a joint<br>Unexpected OEVs!<br>Controlable though, nothing too heavy.<br>I shut my eyes<br>In a bid to hope that sleep will come<br>I hear the sounds of rain outside becoming distorted <br>Intense CEVs!<br>Woah<br>I had no idea! <br>These CEVs were where I saw the really synergy between the acid and the methylone<br>They had the slight dark side of acid, with similar colours. However the bliss was there which carried me through nicely into dreams of utopia with MP.<br>In all this was a very pleasant experience <br>Better than I had expected<br>There is only one thing I worry about <br>And that is, I would be tempted to use this chemical more often for events such as openings and the like.<br>I awoke early<br>Typically feeling as though I never slept<br>I feel great though<br>A little tierd<br>But full of positive energy <br>I hope MP feels this good\n\n\n"
