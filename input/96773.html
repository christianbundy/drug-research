After being a recreational user of Marijuana, opiates, DXM and other pharms, I decided to have a go at utilising a herbal smoking blend containing JWH-018. I decided to discontinue my use of Marijuana it caused a lot of issues with family and friends and use these smoking blends instead. I generally order 6g for £10-12 so it seems like a great deal, particularly in comparison to Marijuana. <br><br>
I got my Rizla and got about 1g of the blend. The blend is Damiana based with JWH-018 laced into it. I spread the herbs onto my Rizla and rolled up a nice lil' bifta. Went outside, played some music (Marie from Vybz Kartel, y'all should listen to it)... Sparked up, about a quarter way into the blunt, I started feeling as though I was standing further back than I was I listened to the music and became engrossed in it Marie, you are for me, me no care who disagree, she and me Marijuana-ananananaaa <br><br>
I felt spaced out, euphoric, as though I was flying, I could feel a smile on my face. I smoked and smoked with the music and it felt as though me and the music were as one. I went on the computer with my sister and put on the annoying orange on Youtube and laughed so so much. I got the munchies and ate some crisps. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I will be doing it again.<!-- End Body -->
