Well, here goes. My friend is a cocaine addict, and came across MDPV recently. He hasn't used in a couple of years, but also never started or got involved in a program. Anyway, he came across MDPV at a smoke shop, and got some. I FINALLY got a hold of him 3 days later. I picked him up from work, and he proceeded to tell me about his binge (Also throwing in there that its like pure 100% Colombian cocaine). <br><br>
Needless to say, the seed was planted. About a week or two later, I went and picked some up. All I can say is....WOW. This stuff is serious business. The high is euphoric, I feel busy, light on my feet, capable. <br><br>
I bought either 1g or .5 g, but only did a slight amount at a time (insulfated). My first dose was about 3-4 ml in length, very small. I felt that in about 10 mintues. Not strong, but enough to know it was there. I watied about 20-30 minutes, and did a line about a little less than a .5 inches. That was my regular dose about every 2-3 hours, until later that night, when I cut my time between doses to about 30 min. For about 5 doses. About 4-5 hours after my last use, I felt absolutley HORRIBLE, and threw the rest out, flushed it down the toilet. I felt cracky, not like myself, not able to get words out of my mouth. Feeling like a drug addict. AGAIN. (I JUST got off H about 2 months ago, maybe I'm replacing addictions, but I digress). I took 1.5 mgs of Klonopin about 8hrs after my last use, drank about 3 beers, and went to sleep around 3am. Woke up at 9am feeling great, no issues, completley fine. BUT, my mind got a taste for the Euphoria, and again, I got it around 9:30am from my local smoke shop. Its the next day now, 8am after staying up all night, and god dammit, how I WISH I never got any of those damn 'bath salts'. I keep using more when I come down, trying to avoid the comedown. It is really harsh. I feel really cracked out, and like I want to crawl out of my skin. The only way to avoid it is to do more!! I have a line in front of me, but every time I do it, I feel worse on the comedown. Also, the high and feelings of coming down last MUCH longer after I've been doing a bit of it. Ive bought it 3 times, totaling about 2 grams total, ingesting about MAYBE a little over a gram. This stuff is REALLY potent, and if I do too much, I have a feeling that I'm gonna be sorry.<br><br>
In closing, don't do this drug. Just DON'T DO IT!!<!-- End Body -->
