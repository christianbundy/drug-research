I have experimented with many a strange plant and several novel new compounds. The most recent to catch my interest was MDAI. I read that it was a serotonin releasing agent that was considered non toxic. Sounds promising, I thought. I purchased a few grams of it from an online vendor that I trust. When it arrived I found it to be a small bag of nice, white granules with an odd chemical odor.<br><br>
I set it aside for a few weeks until this morning. I woke up feeling very hyper and adventurous so I decided to give MDAI a try. Because I am on a rather high dose of an SSRI medication, and I was in no mood for a bad interaction, I decided to play it safe and take the MDAI in small increments.<br><br>
I measured out 100 mg and divided it into four neat little piles. I was very excited. I was feeling impatient, so rather than put it in capsules, I snorted the first line. Nothing happened. After waiting fifteen minutes, I snorted the second line.  I started going through cycles of nervousness and giddiness, but it was purely psychological; the drug had not started to work yet. After fifteen minutes I snorted the third line.<br>
Now I was starting to feel something. It was a strange sensation in my mind. I could tell I was altered but it was quite different from the MDMA-like effect I was expecting.<br><br>
I snorted the fourth line. I began to feel very silly. I turned on some music and could not stop dancing in weird, exaggerated movements. I also felt the urge to talk to someone. I called my sister and chattered away until I ran out of things to talk about. After hanging up, I measured out 50 more milligrams and proceeded to snort the whole pile, for a total of 150 mg. The drip was starting to annoy me so I made some hot cocoa. It was fabulous! I had a second, then a third cup of it while pacing around. I still felt chatty, but there was nobody to talk to so I started babbling all sorts of nonsense to myself as I danced around being just plain silly. My mind was very uneasy at this point (75 minutes after the first line) I felt all loopy and detached. My body, however, felt fantastic. I kept rubbing my chest and arms as I bounced around to the music babbling to myself.<br><br>
2 ½ hours into the trip, the hyperactivity and silliness went away quite suddenly and I became very mellow. I turned off the music and was greeted by silence. I laid down on the couch. I heard the hiss of the wall heater and the twitter of a bird outside. Other than that all was sublimely quiet. I felt absolutely serene.<br><br>
I was startled out of my reverie by my alarm clock. I had an errand to run. I was very glad it was close enough to walk. I enjoyed the walk there but when I got there I noticed all the people in line chatting away. Normally I don't mind that I am a loner. But at that moment I became keenly aware of my inability to connect with other people. I became profoundly lonely. I was depressed all the way home and when I got home I was so miserable that I wished I did not exist. I moped around feeling self pity, guilt, and despair for about an hour. It was now 4 hours into the experience and it seemed like the drug was quickly wearing off. I was tired of being miserable so I took a stiff dose of Kratom, which seemed to help immensely. I am now back to normal.<br><br>
So, will I take it again? Hmm. I don't know. If I do I will not bother snorting little lines I will just swallow a good 200 mg maybe with some sort of dopaminergic stimulant. I am glad I tried it, but I am not sure I actually liked it. If taking an SSRI or an MAO inhibitor, I personally would be cautious on my first time to avoid serotonin toxicity.  It really is kind of a weak drug considering how much I had to take; nevertheless, it was interesting. As always, be safe!<!-- End Body -->
