2C-E<br>
Dosage: 5.2mg<br>
Set: Stable and relaxed.<br>
Setting: Sunday in the house with wife and 2 house cats.<br><br>
This was my first experience with 2CE.  I couldnt find a report of a single dose this low for 2CE.  I am a firm believer in getting familiar with the shallow end before entering the deep end with any substance.  And of course sharing these experiences is equally important.  So here it is.<br><br>
12pm  Took a crumb from the bag of 2CE to make sure there werent any lab mix-ups.<br><br>
2pm  Still at baseline so I take 5.2mg.<br><br>
3:30pm-8:30pm  This is the duration for what was a very light peak.  <br><br>
The overall effects at this dose for me were: <br>
- Surfaces have a soft glow.<br>
- There were light waving hallucinations are only noticed when I stare at the floor for longer than 20 seconds.<br>
- My energy was increased and transformed into a giddy, nervous tone that was fully manageable.<br>
- My thoughts are a bit jumbled but I was still able to take business calls as well as talk to my mother on the phone.<br><br>
Conclusion: Although not a dose I would repeat again, it worked as a friendly introduction to what I expect to be a challenging ally.  It was a light enough effect that I would consider doubling the dose for the next trail.<!-- End Body -->
