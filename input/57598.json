 "report": "<p>I have been taking Piracetam for a month, now and have enjoyed its subtle, immediate effect of a certain stillness of the mind. After about a half hour or so, at 2400mg, a creeping calm begins its flow over me and I feel very in touch with all that is around me. </p><p>With a healthy intake of Kerouac, Jon Krakauer, and Hunter Thompsons books, I must say that this stuff seems to synergize all of these notions and ideas that have been floating around in my head.      </p><p>Also, I have been finding that throughout the day, I have gotten wisps of old long forgotten memories from my childhood. Its pretty absurd, and I laugh when it happens, but I'm starting to think that it may have something to do with the Piracetam.</p>"
