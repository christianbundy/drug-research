 "report": "<p>I take 6mg of clonazepam daily, so the 15mg dose I took this morning was kid's stuff.  I decided to purchase a bottle of kava extract (40% kavalactones, app. 2000mg kavalactones per bottle).  I tried 800mg kavalactones and, pleased with the mild anxiolytic, euphoric, and very strong muscle relaxant effects that were brought on after about 30 minutes, I decided to down the rest of the bottle.</p><p>T=0:10</p><p>Anxiolytic effects more pronounced; euphoria and muscle relaxation still moderately strong, but not changed since the 800mg kavalactone dose.</p><p>T=0:20</p><p>Feeling VERY sociable (a wonderful feeling for a social phobic such as myself); euphoria much stronger; muscle relaxation has practically turned my legs to jello.  No cognitive dulling of any sort.</p><p>T=0:30</p><p>Effects continuing from 10 minutes ago, though exponentially stronger.  I feel as if I could take on the world, if I could just make my muscles work properly, lol!</p><p>T=0:45</p><p>Just one thing to say--how can this stuff be legal???!!!!</p><p>T=1:00</p><p>Not much change from the 30 minute mark, aside from some pronounced OEV's, CEV's, and an almost LSD-like distortion in spacial perceptions.</p><p>T=5:00</p><p>The effects haven't subsided in the least in the past four hours, and I hope they never do!</p><p>~Anxiety level (1-10) -- 0; very disinhibited, in fact.</p><p>~Muscle relaxation (1-10) -- 10; and this is saying something, considering that not even Flexeril, Soma, Elavil, or Zanaflex have helped with my fibromyalgia.</p><p>~Pain relief (1-10) -- 10; I had a moderate headache before taking this, as well as the constant muscle-aches I deal with day to day.  All eradicated.</p><p>~Hypnotic effect (1-10) -- 1; I don't feel sleepy in the least. In fact, I feel mildly stimulated.</p><p>~Aphrodisiac effect (1-10) -- 10!!!  Jerking off was quite an experience, lol.</p><p>T=8:00</p><p>Still feeling the effects strongly, though the hallucinations have subsided just recently.  </p><p>T=12:00</p><p>Most effects subsided, except for moderate muscle relaxation, anxiolysis, and pain relief.</p><p>T=15:00</p><p>Back to baseline.</p>"
