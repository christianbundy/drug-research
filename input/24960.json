 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI take 6mg of clonazepam daily, so the 15mg dose I took this morning was kid's stuff.  I decided to purchase a bottle of kava extract (40% kavalactones, app. 2000mg kavalactones per bottle).  I tried 800mg kavalactones and, pleased with the mild anxiolytic, euphoric, and very strong muscle relaxant effects that were brought on after about 30 minutes, I decided to down the rest of the bottle.\r\nT=0:10\r\nAnxiolytic effects more pronounced; euphoria and muscle relaxation still moderately strong, but not changed since the 800mg kavalactone dose.\r\nT=0:20\r\nFeeling VERY sociable (a wonderful feeling for a social phobic such as myself); euphoria much stronger; muscle relaxation has practically turned my legs to jello.  No cognitive dulling of any sort.\r\nT=0:30\r\nEffects continuing from 10 minutes ago, though exponentially stronger.  I feel as if I could take on the world, if I could just make my muscles work properly, lol!\r\nT=0:45\r\nJust one thing to say--how can this stuff be legal???!!!!\r\nT=1:00\r\nNot much change from the 30 minute mark, aside from some pronounced OEV's, CEV's, and an almost LSD-like distortion in spacial perceptions.\r\nT=5:00\r\nThe effects haven't subsided in the least in the past four hours, and I hope they never do!\r\n~Anxiety level (1-10) -- 0; very disinhibited, in fact.\r\n~Muscle relaxation (1-10) -- 10; and this is saying something, considering that not even Flexeril, Soma, Elavil, or Zanaflex have helped with my fibromyalgia.\r\n~Pain relief (1-10) -- 10; I had a moderate headache before taking this, as well as the constant muscle-aches I deal with day to day.  All eradicated.\r\n~Hypnotic effect (1-10) -- 1; I don't feel sleepy in the least. In fact, I feel mildly stimulated.\r\n~Aphrodisiac effect (1-10) -- 10!!!  Jerking off was quite an experience, lol.\r\nT=8:00\r\nStill feeling the effects strongly, though the hallucinations have subsided just recently.  \r\nT=12:00\r\nMost effects subsided, except for moderate muscle relaxation, anxiolysis, and pain relief.\r\nT=15:00\r\nBack to baseline.\n\n\n"
