 "report": "<p>I've used anti-depressants for some time, mainly Effexor XR, which I started shortly before becoming sexually active. I did not know at first (I had other issues on my mind before starting this medication) but SSRI's are well known to interfere with one's sex drive and in my case, ability to achieve orgasm during intercourse. </p><p>Once I had learned that my inability to reach orgasm with a partner was not completely in my mind, but possibly a side effect of my medications, I consulted my psychiatrist. His suggestion was to try ginkgo.</p><p>It was certainly not a lightning bolt cure, but it was very helpful in achieving the satisfaction my partner and I were looking for. It helped sensitivity in the penis and lowered the amount of time taken to reach orgasm by far. I usually take around 120-200 mg when I expect to 'need' it, though I have yet to figure out how much more or less beneficial it is to take it daily.</p><p>There has been little research done thus far for delayed ejaculation from SSRI's, and even fewer options to treat it. This is a good start if you're having problems in bed, I would highly suggest trying ginkgo before thinking about stopping your medications or using a 'drug holiday' plan.</p><p>Beware: Ginkgo has a potent and nasty after-taste.</p>"
