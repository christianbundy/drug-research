===&gt; SUPER QUICK I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES VERSION 
<br>
IN A NUTSHELL: I smoked some 10X extract and tripped into a childhood-themed vision. Salvia is a personal experiance, not a party drug. I highly reccomend it for its potential in personal insights and for its relatively short recovery time (the time in which I lost all control lasted only about 10 minutes).<br><br>
===&gt; THE NORMAL VERSION 
<br><br>
Intro:<br>
I had long been intriugued by Salvia divinorum. I had been drawn to its affordability, legality, and its promise. If the experts were true, I would have had an interesting vision that would help me reveal inner truths within a managable timeframe. This turned out to be true. The only other chemical that might have been in my system was some 'Kava Kava' extract from hours earlier. <br><br>
Prep:<br>
Truth be known, I'm a terrible smoker, I just can't smoke without coughing, so much so that it ruins most of my cannabis experiances. So it takes a lot more 'tries' for me to land that perfect hit. Half-filling two bowls in a small water pipe, I used up about a quarter of my one gram bag of 10X extract. <br><br><br>
Pre-Effects:<br>
While I was loading the second bowl, I felt the Salvia 'wind'. I hate to use a geek metaphor, but it was like I was on the recieving end of one of those Jedi 'mind-push' things. There was just an overwhelming force driving me to move SouthEast. Giving in, I plopped onto the bed and lit the second bowl. I held it in as long as I could, and let it go.<br><br>
THE TRIP:<br>
this is kind of personal, but I made sure to write down what I had experianced and I don't want to lie to any of you who are looking for honest experiance info, so here is what I saw.<br><br>
'I immediately regressed into the mindstate of a child, I felt as if I was in the hands of a weird hybrid between donald duck and goofy, I kept my eyes closed, but I knew that's what I was carrying me, the whole time a children's song I used to listen to played in the background, and then someone was trying to hoist me onto their shoulders, I resisted, because I didn't want to put my cratch in close contact with their head, then I thought about  oral sex, I slowly began to think and manipulate the way I was being carried. once I regained concious thought, I quickly snapped out of it and calmly walked upstairs'<br><br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Examining the nature of my trip w/ my therapist, I was able to make personal insights and discovered inner truths. I sought an honest to god vision and I got it. I am a big guy who smoked a relatively substantial amount (though inefficiantly)of potent extract to achieve this effect. The one gram bag cost me 8.99 from an internet site.<!-- End Body -->
