I had been wanting to try nitrous from a cartridge for some time.  I had tried it from whip cream cans twice.  The feeling wasn't too bad, but I wanted something stronger.<br><br>
So one day me and a few friend got some nitrous cartridges.  We were all sitting on a table under some trees behind someone's house that wasn't home.  I smoked a few bowls of weed about half an hour before this, so I was already feeling pretty baked.  So they cracked a cartridge in a balloon for me first with a cracker that one of my friends had.<br><br>
I had heard that you could pass out from not getting enough oxygen to your brain, so I started to take some deep breaths when they handed me the balloon to get oxygen flowing through my brain.  Then I breathed out all the air in my lungs and started inhaling the nitrous.  I kept on blowing it in and out of the balloon.  When I first inhaled, it tasted sweet, and nothing happened for a little while, then it hit me.  All of a sudden I could see and feel my body start to almost black out.  My body started to feel tingly all over.  Then this echo came that just took over all of my hearing.  All I heard was just a wooshing echo over and over.  All the things my friends were saying to me I couldn't understand.<br><br>
My friends were making loud, long noises around me.  I could feel my body and my mind start floating away from myself.  Everything around me moved slow, like a strobe light effect, and looked fuzzy.  The whole time I was still breathing in and out of the balloon for what felt like 30 seconds. <br><br>
Then I just couldn't help but laugh at everything around me and lost all of the nitrous left in the balloon.  I looked around me to see my entire world through this wierd, flashing checkerboard pattern.  Then I just felt my body go numb and felt myself slowly fall back and just layed down on the table.  Everytime something touched me, it felt like it was going through me and touching my insides.<br><br>
When I was laying down I was just staring at the trees above me moving in the wind.  The trees seemed to vibrate along with my body.  I could feel the wooshing echo throughout my entire body.  The colors around me seemed to fade together, like the color of one of my friends hair seemed to blend in with the trees around him.  When I felt like I could move again, I sat up and started laughing at everything around me and at how incredibly powerful this drug actually was.  I could still feel the nitrous very stong still after about 10 seconds.  My body felt very light and floaty like I was flying.<br><br>
Then everything started to gradually go away.  First with the echo, then things started to look normal again.  My body, though, still felt numb and floaty, and was still vibrating for quite some time.  <br><br>
The immediate effects lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  My body felt the effects for a few minutes though.<br><br>
After that, I watched my friends take the same crazy trip I did.  I have smoked pot alot, drink, and occasionally trip on lsd, but no trip was as crazy as the nitrous trip I took.  It was truly an experience no one can possibly forget.<!-- End Body -->
