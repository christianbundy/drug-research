I had heard about Ice (4-methylaminorex) and it caught my attention. It seemed almost too good to be true, and also extremely rare. I had also been interested in methamphetamine so when I found an 'Ice' connection I naturally jumped at the chance. I was expecting high-grade meth, but the thought that it might be 4-MAR stuck in the back of my mind. I had tried meth once before and had a mild experience, I also have experience with amphetamine.<br><br>
When I acquired the Ice I was very eager to try it. There was no fear or anxiety present. In fact, a huge load of anxiety had been relieve a half hour earlier, so I was in a very pleasant mood. As I was sucking in the smoke I was waiting for the rush of meth to hit me. I was disappointed upon exhaling and feeling nothing yet. So my friend and I took two more hits each and put it away and waited.<br><br>
After about a minute or so I felt it coming on. It was a rush, but not in the classic sense of the word. I didn't feel like I was being shot up by a rocket or anything of that nature, and it wasn't physical at all. Instead it came on slowly and very smoothly. It was as if I was gently lowering myself into a very warm pool very slowly, except the pool was filled with euphoria rather than water. The feeling could not be described as anything else but euphoric. It was definitely a stimulant in that my thought process was sped up, but not in the way that methamp and regular amp do by allowing you to process more thoughts. It was more like my brain became more efficient, discarding information that wasn't useful to my current mental process. I definitely felt smarter. The euphoria is a very distinct euphoria, although it does have some parallels to MDMA. The experience is for the most part more introspective than meth and other stimulants, but the urge to talk is still there. But the conversation is very philosophical and enlightening rather than amphetamine rambling.<br><br>
A couple hours later I had to go to a restaurant with my friend's family. I had no problems acting normal, except for the fact that I did not eat much. Forcing that sushi down my throat was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. <br><br>
The initial rush lasted about 30-45 minutes. After that the 'warm pool of euphoria' became more room temperature. The euphoria was there, but subtler. I became a little drowsy after the rush wore off, and a slight hint of depression due to the fact it was gone. So what do you do when you want that rush again? Smoke more, naturally.<br><br>
I smoked more of it about 6 hours after my intial hits. I then continued to take hits about every 45 minutes for the next 6 hours. Each time I loaded about 10-15 mg and smoked it all. The rush never came on as good as the intial one, but it was definitely still there, but dwindled in intensity each time. During most of the time I was on the phone with a person who I don't really enjoy talking to normally, but at the time I did not care. I began to get physically tired after about t+3 hours of hitting it the second time, but my mind was speeding. I started to feel less and less intelligent and more and more like a babbling moron. I wasn't even aware of my thought process anymore, it just happened. I had obviously not expected to sleep that night.<br><br>
About an hour after I stopped hitting it I noticed a slight tingling sensation in my extremities and the left side of my left foot. This tingling very slowly spread from my pinkies to my ring fingers and slowly over most of my hands and feet. I got very scared and had what I guess was a panic attack. My heartrate jumped to over 180 bpm and my veins were so constricted I could not even see them. I worried endlessly about these physical phenomena for the next 8 hours or so. At one point my face began to become tingly and numb, but I just reminded myself to take deep breaths and that I'd be fine, and it eventually went away.<br><br>
Over the next three days, especially the first, I felt significantly altered. I felt less intelligent, very lethargic, and sickly. I vowed never to do 4-mar again during that time, but a week later I gave it another try. I learned from my mistakes, I just got carried away the first time. I just need to control my usage a little more so I don't overdo it. <br><br>
I am so certain that this what I have is 4-MAR because everything I have read about it seems to match my experience (i.e. euphoria, introverted, not as speedy, etc...basically everything I mentioned). I have also since my experience tried real methamphetamine and it was a lot different and much more similar to regular amphetamine.<br><br>
Overall I think 4-methylaminorex is a wonderful substance. I have since used it (wisely) in several different settings, school being one of them. I actually wrote possibly the best essay I have ever written while on 4-MAR. The only problem I have with it is the severity and duration of physical effects. I usually notice vassoconstriction for at least 24 hours and it continues on and off for about 48 hours. And my fingers almost always get a tiny bit tingly. There are two general rules I follow: never use more than I need to get full effects, and never use for more than three days in a row because the effects diminish and physically it is very taxing.<!-- End Body -->
