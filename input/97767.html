At 2:50pm, alone at home on my sunny day off, I decided to try out this new meditation enhancement given to me by a friend. The instructions (verbal) were to empty a single capsule and prepare for nasal administration. There was a thin line about an inch long - not quite sure what the weight was (mg) or whatever- just took my trustee on his word.<br><br>
Immediately upon inhalation my nasal cavity felt cool, like menthol, then a burning sensation. This made my eyes (rather the one eye) water and drip down my cheek, and it took a second for me to adjust to the newfound awareness of the inside of my face. It wasn't too intense but it had no numbing effect like some other nose-drugs do.<br><br>
Maybe 2 or 3 mins after sniffing, I took a bong rip of some cannabis and got in the shower to enjoy the onset.<br><br>
Almost immediately, I begun to see lines around the edges of the shampoos and soaps. The design on the shower curtain begun to sway and jiggle and the colors in the light and my luffa were very vibrate. My nose, still ripe with discomfort, began to drip the chemical flavor into my throat which made me gag a couple of times but I forced myself not to spit anything down the drain. I did, however, rinse my nose out to try and relieve some of the discomfort.<br><br>
After my shower I felt rather disoriented. My movement seemed to lack precise control and I had a lot of mucus in my mouth. I felt I had to brush my teeth which caused me to gag again, this time throwing up in the sink. After the heaving subsided I gave myself the classic psychedelic pep-talk everyone needs when they're taking something good for the first time:<br><br>
'you took a drug, don't worry...this will wear off. You looked it up - 4-6 hours so ENJOY IT!'<br><br>
At my own advice I dressed myself and went outside for a tobacco cigarette. I noticed that my muscles in my chest were very shivery and tense- either from the 2C-B, or from being a smoker who just took a shower- regardless, the smoke made me relax a little and set into a whole new reality of swirling color and geometric movement. There was a slight breeze rustling the leaves on trees, which to me looked like whirlwinds of free-floating leaves swarming the tops of the tree trunks. The colors almost seemed hard to identify. I couldn't really tell if the leaves were yellow, or orange, or blue, or green... It was almost like looking at those shiny hologram stickers or those cars that change color when they turn...<br><br>
I came inside after my smoke and laid on my bed with the daylight seeping through the blinds leaving stripes and shadows everywhere... Which is always a pleasure on a good hallucinogen. The visuals were awesome! I watched the colors and shadows dance for a little bit, the passing cars giving movement to the display and a soundtrack of inconsistent rumbling and vibration. Never before has LSD or Fungi ever induced this level of sustained open eye visual entertainment- and to tell you the truth I don't even think I closed my eyes once during the trip.<br><br>
Looking back I can say that it seemed like it was hard for me to get comfortable in bed, or just standing, but nothing like some LSD trips I have had where I constantly feel like I need to stretch... This just took a couple deep breaths and a change of position so I moved to the couch and found a stand-up special on TV. Unlike mushrooms I didn't find it hard to use technology like my phone or navigating the programming guide- I seemed rather coherent- just crazy visuals. <br><br>
After my comedy special was over there were only slight lingering effects... My teeth were a little chattery- but no grinding or tense jaw feeling. I noticed the time was about 5:30 when things started to calm down. By 6 I felt normal again. I had a slight headache (possibly from watching TV in the dark) and a tense neck... But I felt mentally stable and back to normal by 7.<!-- End Body -->
