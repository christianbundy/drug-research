Main Info:<br>
My friends and I (about 16) decited to take 'E' the day before halloween.  It is currenty 2 days later and my body has taken a beating.  I really found the experience enlighting and has taken me to a place that no one can experience unless they take the drug themselves. I made some life changes during the time that I took the drug, and it opened my friends and I to a totally new world.  The effects that we felt or at least I felt was all inhibitions went out the window and I made out with quite a few girls.  It was not a sexual but a sensual thing.  Food tasted better, and I loved candy.  OH MY GOD was candy great.  One of my friends had a not so good trip and found himself scared. I don't think he was really ready for the experience.  All I can say is that the fealing was great and I feel that I truly found myself during that time, but I do express warning to people that are not ready for the 'E'xperience.  <br><br>
Rambling:<br>
My closest friend told me that our friendship will never change and that we have become closer from what has happened, I truly beleive this and I think that anyone who does  MDMA should try to keep the feeling that you had from now on, and I feel that I don't ever need to do another drug, let alone do MDMA again.<br><br>
Positive Effects: <br>
Euphoria, all inhibitions thrown out the window, kissing felt great, candy was awesome, and finding myself, try to keep the feeling that I had from now on inside of me.<br><br>
Negative Effects:<br>
Day after back pain, and time is slowed almost to a hault.  I did not want to stand at all, but rather sit all day long.<!-- End Body -->
