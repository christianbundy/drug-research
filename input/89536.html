One day I woke up pretty late and had missed my class and decided to not go to school that day. Everyone else in the house had gone to work so I had the whole house to myself. I went downstairs to eat and found an empty brownie pan on the kitchen countertop, and being a bulimic I scraped the pan clean of the crumbs and continued to eat until I felt a little nauseous and went back upstairs to surf the web. <br><br>
Im not sure how much time went by but I noticed the screen moving in and out. I thought maybe I was just getting tired but when I looked away from the screen to the rest of the room, EVERYTHING was moving. I immediately started swearing and was confused as fuck. I had no idea whether or not it was really happening. I slowly made my way to the bathroom, holding onto walls trying to stabilize myself while I walked there. I was already nauseous before, but the movement of everything around me made it worse. My body had started to go numb and tingled whenever I touched anything, which made it very difficult to throw up because I didnt know if it would land in the toilet or not, or if I was even throwing up. <br><br>
I make way back to my room and sit on my bed and frequently checked outside to see if anyone had come home yet so I could verify that I was real; if I was alive; or that I wasnt actually stuck in a dream state. For a while I thought maybe I had fallen ill of a psychological disorder and would never get out of this hazy state. And if that was the case I didnt want to live anymore.<br><br>
Its pretty scary looking back at it because at that point I was about to intentionally harm myself. I told myself that I would go downstairs, grab a knife, and cut my arm. If I could feel anything than this was real and I wasnt in a dream. I sat there for probably 3 minutes contemplating whether I should or not, and played out the consequences of if I was in the real world and was going to actually cut my arm. I finally snap out of the crazy talk and tell myself not to be stupid and cut my arm. Instead I pinched myself until I could feel some kind of pain and I concluded that I was real. But after a few minutes of pinching I couldnt feel it anymore and became scared again. <br><br>
I went over to the window sill again to check for people  no one. Then without thinking, I slam my forehead into the window sill and feel a slight pain. I smiled in relief and sat back of my bed. I dont know at what I point I realized I might have gotten high off the brownies, but I stated saying to myself Just go to sleep, sleep it off. When you wake up, everything will be back to normal. <br><br>
I threw up one last time into the trashcan and lay down on my bed. However, every time I closed my eyes it was like I was looking through a kaleidoscope  an image in my room multiplied a million times and constantly moving into different shapes. I couldnt sleep, and I guess the things I saw with my eyes closed made me think of Legos because at a point after that, I thought I was a Lego person and freaked the fuck out. Id have to open my eyes and remind myself of where I was and every once in a while slap my face so Id keep sane. After a few minutes, I curled up into the fetal position, threw the covers over my head and kept saying to myself, just go to sleep, just go to sleep, until I fell asleep.<br><br>
Im not sure how much time had passed, but I woke up to the sound of the cats running around in the house. It sounded so loud, like they were right next to me. I felt like I had super hearing because a few minutes later, one of the housemates came home from work even her walking up the stairs sounded like it was right next to me. <br><br>
This experience was so scary for me, especially since I was alone and didnt even realize that I was high until later.<!-- End Body -->
