I ordered an assortment of herbs from a well established website.  The damania looked a lot like the small leaf trimmings from an actual marijuana bud with some thin twigs thrown in.  The raw herb smells a bit like earl grey tea, definitely pleasant and floral.<br><br>
I loaded and fired up the large bowl of my newly carved grandfather pipe and immediately choked on the harsh smoke.  It tasted nothing like it smelled in the bag.  I managed to get through the first bowl, but couldn't hold onto the smoke for any length of time.  It did make the inside of my mouth tingle a bit, which I have gotten with bides (Indian poor man's cigarettes) so I can't be sure what, if anything, this indicates.  There was surprisingly little cottonmouth, but I also didn't really inhale at least half of the smoke.  I felt a little lightheaded but it was difficult to tell for sure, so in the interest of science I puffed my way through a second bowl.  I definitely feel a bit floaty and relaxed, although motor skills do not seem even slightly impaired.  Thought processes are a bit slower, but no less lucid.  <br><br>
In conclusion, dealing with the super harsh smoke is not really worth the effects.  I will try to re-hydrate some of the herb in hopes that it will make the smoke a bit smoother.  I also think the size of the pipe bowl may have conspired to make the smoke harsher then it would have been with a more reasonably sized pipe. Tonight I will try it in a tea in hopes that it will the same effects without having to put up with the nasty smoke.<!-- End Body -->
