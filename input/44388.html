Let me try to put together what the hell happened to me last night. I have absolutely no idea what it was, but it was very very deep and profound and it is for that reason that I decided to write a report on it. We finally managed to get our hands on some nn-dmt, we had traded some 5meo for it, of which we had enough ourselves.<br><br>
The preparations were  as they were each time  filled with nervousness and anxiety, but in a good way. I remember saying to myself after the last time, theres nothing to be nervous about. Whatever happens happens and thats it. Just make sure you dose right, youre with friends and you feel good. So that was what I did. I have tried 5meo-dmt two times before, both of which were at 12 mg. and pretty intense synesthetic experiences. No visuals, just all emotion, feeling and senses blended together. <br><br>
We loaded up a pipe made out of a plastic bottle with a glass pipe in the bottom, kind of a dry bong. Put cigarette ashes beneath and on top of 36 mg. nn dmt and sucked all the smoke in in two big tokes. I even had time to lay down easily and say goodbye just before I took off. I really had to concentrate to get visuals with my eyes closed and as soon as after a minute I felt it all slipping away, which it did in about four minutes. A little frustrated about the superficial trip I had, having had no insights or deeper understanding whatsoever, I thought about doing an experiment for the sake of comparison. This meant: trying another dose, but this time of 5meo-dmt. After some contemplation, me and my friend (who had also had nn) decided to go for it.<br><br>
This time I went first. Somehow Bluetech was playing, just like the first time I tried 5meo. At first I wanted to try it without music, but I guess it helps me to get a grip. Thats why I like ambient with a little beat in it as well. For the linearity of it all. Well, as I said, I went first. I inhaled the smoke  again in 2 tokes  and this time I didnt even have time to exhale, I was thrown back and washed over with an intense psychedelic patterning which seemed to be coming straight from the centre of existence.<br><br>
According to my sitters it looked as if I was fighting for survival, closing and opening my eyes, holding my hands in front of me as the Indians say thank you. It truly felt like saying thankyou though, but in a universal kinda way. I only felt love, amazement, puzzlement and extreme gratitude for being allowed to be part of this. I dont deserve this, why me? I wanted to cry but couldnt stop grinning. It felt like the whole world had come to a stop and I was walking the line between worlds. Dont remember where those words came from, but they sure as hell mean a lot to me now. Walking the line between worlds. I am a pretty agnostic person I guess, but this was one religious experience. And well in a non-God kinda way ;] <br><br>
I am hereby fully convinced of the madness of the judeo-christian, Islamic way of putting God, putting forward all these stupid rules of not having sex before marriage. Things like that cant have anything to do with a God. Everything is everything, is love, is energy, is existence, is whatever. I dont know I really dont know but this must have been the deepest thing Ive ever felt. This is not a drug. This is a portal, a gift from beyond. I desperately want to know the meaning of it all but I dont and doubt I will find out and doubt if it can be found out even . I am still in extasy and still trying to make sense of it all. <br><br>
This is by no means a drug in the fun sense of the word, even though it was all very positive to me. Pure love, peace and energy, gratitude and amazement. I still feel nothing but respect and must say this is not for the faint-hearted but only for the true psychonauts.<br><br>
