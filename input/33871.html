Now I have experienced and experimented with this substance since I have discovered it almost 5 months ago.  I have been careful and selective with my approach to it, sampling and experiencing it in very spaced out intervals.  Perhaps it is due to my unique physiology, but when I smoke Sceletium I find its effects hit when instantaneously and strong.<br><br>
Since I have experienced it the effects of this substance over and over, I will sum up the shared defined characteristics that Sceletium has shown to me (and my unique physiology).<br><br>
I usually smoke my dose in a water bong.  The effects are noticed literally 5 seconds after inhalation.  Immediately I get this rush of intensity and extreme anxiety.  I find that EVERY single time I smoke while sitting I am standing and pacing back and forth within 1-2 minutes.  I have heard comparisons of this substance to MDMA and while I notice comparable effects (slightly positive), like energy potentiation and motivation, there are negative effects that I believe outweigh the positive ones (personal preference).  I did not like the fact that I felt extremely anxious on this, as I already have mild anxiety issues.  <br><br>
Also, there is a ringing in the ear and rapid acceleration of heart beat that adds to the discomfort of the anxiety aspects.<!-- End Body -->
