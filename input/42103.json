 "report": "<p>I bought some wild dagga leaves on a website. I didnt find it to be effective, and hard to smoke. Later, I bought a large amount of flowers at the wholesale price.   I found out flowers to be effective, smoked in rather large amounts (1 or 2 big cigarettes of pure flowers), but far from being a 'marijuana substitute', and expensive. The taste is mild, but the smoke wears on the lungs, even if not harsh while smoked. </p><p>I had the possibility to buy a large amount of flowers at the wholesale price.  As smoking dagga seems unfriendly to the lungs, I had the idea to try somme 'quid method'. Sublingual absorption works sometimes, like with LSA or Salvia. I chewed something like 0.5 g (or a little less) for 15 minutes, without swallowing the juice. The taste is stronger than expected, very close to the smell of the dagga leaves. It's a bit bitter, in a way which reminds me of Salvia, but with an unpleasing taste. The aftertaste is hard to wash. My tongue feels a bit numb first, but then a little burned. Dagga seems to be 'corrosive'.</p><p>The effects are definitely stronger than those produced by smoking the same amount. The onset is hard to notice.  I'm rather happy. I feel sedated, but I'm able to work and I'm enjoying what I do. I feel a bit stupid, but my mind is producing the right words and concepts at a proper speed, simply, I'm not aware of my mental process. The effects are not strong but nice. </p><p>What makes me unhappy about dagga is the corrosive effect on the lungs if smoked, on the tongue if chewed. It reminds me of tobacco.</p>"
