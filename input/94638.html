To start I'll give a little background info about myself Ive been doing various drugs since the age of 15 and by the time I was 19 I had done almost every drug I could get my hands on Im also quite experienced with hallucinogens acid, shrooms, dmt ,k, never  peyote,  never very high doses just shit would move,melt, spin, and look really cool aside from dmt and k obviously those are trips. but I really only smoke weed regularly, weed was always a favorite and it still is. <br><br>
I do not have a addictive personality what so ever I feel very gifted.  I literally have tested my brain by doing very addictive drugs just to how they felt and I knew  I could stop and I was able to stop each time with no troubles or ever even caring to do them again. And well save the best for last! haha I dont even smoke cigarettes!  although iv smoked a total of 10 in my life when I was really messed up but anyways now on to the the story....<br><br>
Mdma was always hard to find I my area so I recently got a shipment of BK-MDMA (Methylone) and its great stuff very close to mdma in my view and Id do it at clubs or a rave a few times a month or at just chillen at home bonding with friends. it really will bring two people very close and make great friends. <br><br>
T 0.00 I ingested 250mg in a capsule as my friends c and d also did and we relaxed and began smoking high grade marijuana (as we do 10+ times a day every day)<br><br>
T 0.30 Im starting to feel small waves and tingling through my body and it was very pleasant. I redose as so did my friends with another 250mg capsule<br><br>
T 1.00 Now Im definitely feeling it! Its that feeling you get when a little kid on Christmas day walking down the stairs, or going on a vacation to paradise or even a roller-coaster. My body feels amazing with all these beautiful sensations running through it!  Haha I and my friends couldnt stop talking. We were talking very fast and having deep deep conversations, everyone was loving it! (This made us now very close friends)<br><br>
T 1.30 - 2.00 The second pill kicked in and we were all in complete euphoria. We slowed our talking and enjoyed the amazing euphoria and we also continued smoking haha<br><br>
T 2.30 my friends had had enough and wanted to just keep smoking enjoying the euphoria, (the comedown of Methylone after 2-3  redoses  becomes very sedative and I  dont want to move much then around 6-8 hours I generally fall asleep.  I never went much further then 500mg. I began taking small 50mg (not scaled but quite close) bumps up my nose every 15-30minutes<br><br>
I actually started losing track of time so the next times may be off.<br><br>
T 4.00 I felt the first pill starting to come down and I had a mixed effect of sedation plus stimulation  and euphoria from the bumps that I just did. when the sedation started I said fuck it and ate another capsule.<br><br><br>
T 4.30- ? Through the rest of the roll,  I was no longer rolling I went on a full out TRIP :) and it was lovelyyy Im just very fortunate I had close sober friends by:)<br><br>
THIS IS WHEN WILDNESS STARTED!!!!!<br><br>
My wall consist of long wood planks going horizontally maybe 8 inchs tall and  6 feet wide and theres prolly 8 planks going across the wall kinda like a board walk I guess you could say. All the wood had grain with swirls and stuff all over it regularly and above them towards the ceiling hung a dream catcher and 2 picture frames one on each side.<br><br>
Then I looked at the wood grain very close to see millions and millions of tiny tiny termites crawling through the grain! I had to ask if I really had termites??  it freaked me out, my friends came over to check I out and said no and they gave it a close look and said I was tripping! from then on it was purely awesome:)<br><br>
This trip keeps getting crazier, like really crazy, just with zero mind fuck at all!  You guys are probably thinking methylone trip? This guys nuts ahaa!!! No such thing, methylone is a stimulant. NO this all is possible and I did it. METHYLONE CAN BE A HALLUCIGEN!<br><br>
Now every wood plank was its own world I saw countless 'all seeing eyes' blinking and watching me. There was a plank with nothing but wild life and a desert, monkeys swinging from trees and many preastoric animals. One board was an ocean with various fish Ive never seen they looked really old, one I remember clearly was a crocodile like fish swimming across my wall IT WAS TRUELY AMAZING!<br><br>
Those were all 2d hallucinations now the 3d starts :) As Im watching a stampede of lions, elephants, buffalo, every fucking animal in the jungle running across the plank, I see a REAL spider about the size of a half dollar. he crawled up into the dream catcher.<br><br>
I once again freaked out not knowing if it was real. I said Chris, a spider just crawled in the  dream catcher. he checked it out, nothing. Now the fun started. I look at the planks again, it was just wildness and I keep seeing more and more real spiders. then I looked at at the dream catcher to realize it was a nest. I knew it wasnt real but it was a real as it gets. And in this nest there were big spiders, tarantula sized caring millions of babys all over there back. I could see eggs and all it was a nest and middle sized ones would just crawl around the web. They were scary but I loved it.<br><br>
I watched momma spider wiggle her massive fangs and venom dripped down on my bed. At this point I could control it and I knew everything that looked real wasnt according to my sober friends.  I watched a middle sized spider making a very silky web and slowly drop down on my chest. I asked if there was a spider on my chest they checked and said no so I touched it and it melted into me.<br><br>
Coolest hallucinogen Ive ever taken. If I didnt have sober friends it would have been a train wreck, so be safe people.<br>
T8.00-9.00 Hallucinations slowed. nothing but things in the corner of me eyes and little shit like when Im coming off of lsd<br><br>
T 11.00 I fell asleep. Best trip of my life this was my first report so sorry for mistakes but I hope you all enjoyed and further research should be put into methylone unless that was consider a true overdose? I had fun. BK-MDMA is a hallucinogen!<!-- End Body -->
