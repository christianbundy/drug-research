 "report": "<p>\nTramadol (tramadol hydrochloride)</p><p>A lot of people in my country (Lithuania) enjoy a new drug, easily available in pharmacy stores without any problems. Personally, I don't like it because it produces a kind of state which you can experience on opiates. I am not an opiate fan; I better smoke weed or eat some shrooms. But still, there are several reasons why this drug is so extremely popular here:</p><p>1. It is a very cheap way to get high (a pack of 20 pills, containing 50mg of the substance per pill costs only 2$) </p><p>2. It can be used (and of course is used) by opiate users as a substituting drug when heroin (also a very popular drug here) is not available. But Tramadol is addictive, I think it is more mentally addictive than physically, personally I know a number of people who can not live a day without this shit.</p><p>3. It is legal and sold even for children.</p><p>4. People are stupid enough to take it regularly.</p><p>Thats it, thanks for reading.</p>"
