I had first tried mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) a couple of times (taken with several weeks downtime between doses) in oral amounts of 200 mg taken in a capsule. While it was enjoyable, it seemed somewhat like MDMA-lite. I had heard of people who said they were compelled to re-dose on it, but such people were usually snorting the material (which is said to be fairly painful). <br><br>
Then a friend and I each had an oral dose of 225-250 mg (I forget for sure, I just recall that we upped the dose), and we were both surprised to find it substantially more euphoric, with waves of good feeling. An oral supplement dose taken a few hours later of around the same amount also produced strong waves of euphoria, although perhaps a bit less than the first time.<br><br>
Since then we each had one more 'double dose' experience that wasn't much to write home about, at a lowered dose (maybe 200-225 each dose); it was fun, but without the waves of euphoria. Like when the magic leaves from MDMA after one has done it too many times. <br><br>
Then we tried snorting 100 mg, which is a lot of material, and it burns and feels a bit peppery too. I got high, but wasn't blown away. My partner, Meatbag, got very strong rapidly commencing euphoric effects, but they wore down to run-of-the-mill joy pretty quickly. We redosed with a 200 mg oral, and that never brought back strong euphoria, but a lingering good feeling hung around longer. We weren't really compelled to redose; we just wanted to evaluate this approach since so many people report it as having value.<br><br>
Now with methedrone (4-methoxymethcathinone), for me, the situation is different. Both times I have taken 200 mg orally in a capsule without having eaten anything previously, and remembering to drink adequate liquids. The effects come on noticeably but light. It is sort of like a low dose of MDMA. However, I actually don't feel like talking to other people, so for me it doesn't seem that much of a social drug. It inspired me to get some work done in my garden which required a trip to a Home Depot. I had no trouble riding my motorcycle for the 40-minute round trip, but I felt somewhat standoffish when having to deal with the store clerks. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font>  Back at home, I enjoyed the day of planting, but there was a bit of angst forming around the edges. Increasingly, I felt the fast approach of a strong come-down that I could tell was going to leave me substantially lower than the base state I started out the day at. I did not intend to redose, so I got to experience that crappy low, which felt as though it was worse than the mild high I had gotten in exchange. <br><br>
I tried methedrone once more in a similar use pattern (without redosing), and I very much got the sense that this is a drug that is pretty much BEGGING to be redosed. Because of how uncomfortable the low is from one dose, I am hesitant to want to redose this compound. The high does not seem interesting enough for the low. I doubt that I will revisit this drug anytime in the near future. I don't think that methedrone is a very good replacement for mephedrone; at least not for me.<!-- End Body -->
