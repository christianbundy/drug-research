My grandmother gave me some Tylenol 3s and I heard about how much fun they could be. Unfortunately, tylenol tends to upset my stomach, so I went about extracting the codeine by way of a method I found online of dissolving crushed tablets in warm water and then cooling the water, filtering and drinking it.<br><br>
I dissolved 11 tablets each containing 8mg of codeine. Unfortunately, after I cooled the solution in the freezer, I set the cup on the counter and went to get the coffee filters off of the fridge and knocked down a box full of top ramen on top of it and spilled it all over the counter. After a few minutes of cussing and screaming I told myself it was no big deal because it's just a stupid fun drug that I got for free.<br>
So I soaked up what solution I could from the counter with napkins and wrang them out into the cup. Surprisingly, I had not lost much of the extract at all, so I added a few drops of lemon juice concentrate, swigged it down, and sat down with my guitar to play along with Pearl Jam's new live album... This was about ten minutes ago.<br><br>
20 minutes: My stomach feels a little tight and I'm getting a warm feeling coming up over my shoulder. I think it's working!<br><br>
40 minutes: I'm feeling warm and hazy. I think this will be the extent of it. My stomach is a little uncomfortable but not so much that it's ruining my mood.<br><br>
50 minutes: I'm still coming up, surprisingly. I feel a little slow, a little groggy. Music sounds real nice. I'm having trouble keeping my eyes and thoughts focused. This is really surprising me that it's having this much of an effect on me. I haven't had much to eat today and my stomach is growling so I'm gonna go try to make some food.<br><br>
1 hour 15 minutes: I've peaked. Food tastes delicious-cheese quesadilla with garlic and onion powder sprinkled onto it. The sensation of eating seems to be bringing me up a little more. If I wouldn't have spilled the cup, I'm sure I would be feeling a little more buzzed. Next time I'll have to try 13 pills and be more careful. My breathing has slowed a little. I feel good overall. The food settled my stomach after just a few bites. I'm gonna go lay down and listen to some music now.<!-- End Body -->
