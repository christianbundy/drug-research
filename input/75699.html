I heard about the seed's psychotropic effects from a friend and decided to read up.<br><br>
I tried once with poorly grounded seeds and threw them up and had no effects whatsoever.<br><br>
The second try I was more determined and I ground them up more thoroughly and put 4 tablespoons in some applesauce which tasted horrible.<br><br>
Almost immediately, I felt sick to my stomach. I tried to keep it down. My girls and I went to a sauna in a beautiful apartment complex with koi fish, and a jacuzzi. I enjoyed the place, but felt sick for 30 minutes before I threw it up. <br><br>
I was enraged, and I threw the rest of the seed in the thrash and told my friends it was stupid and that I did not want them to feel like I did, because they were planning to take it if I felt good.<br><br>
I was irritated and upset, why didn't it work for me??? I continued to stay warm in the jacuzzi. We left to my friends house and smoked a few bowls of weed.<br><br>
After being stoned and watching everyone talk, I noticed that I seemed to be very entertained by how quickly my friend Cheylea was talking. I was very consumed in her conversation, and wondered why I was staying so quiet instead of engaging in conversation.<br><br>
I soon realized that I was seeing patterns move slowly and the blanket on Dario's bed was moving like the sea. I explained to my friends that (3 hours later) I was feeling the effects!<br><br>
But I felt extremely uncomfortable explaining myself, and started to become overwhelmingly self conscious. I felt like my friends were not interested in what I was feeling and I was afraid that I was the only one feeling this way. I had been in a a silly argument with my boyfriend that morning and almost completely lost the meaning of why I was upset. I wanted to go to the store to buy something to eat and see him. <br><br>
When coming down the hill to my boyfriend's work, I had an overwhelming epiphany in my own voice telling me to tell the truth. The speed of the thoughts were growing increasingly and winding into different thoughts.<br><br>
While in the grocery aisle, I suddenly found it impossible to make a decision. And lost interest in food very quickly when my dear friend Kimberly plucked a piece of bread in my hand and told me it might be interesting to taste on the psychedelic drug.<br><br>
Her words appealed to me, so I put it in my mouth, with immediately absorbed all the saliva in my mouth and became and inedible gum. I was confused and uncomfortable so I bought a soda.<br><br>
My boyfriend got off work and I explained to him that I was no longer angry and I was under the influence. I explained to Cheylea and my boyfriend Adrian that if I did not talk to them, I might 'float away'. I felt that if I was alone I might seriously lose my mind and end up in a mental hospital. My thoughts seemed intelligent but when I spoke I became frustrated.<br><br>
At first I went back to my friends house, still feeling extremely uncomfortable around everyone and wanted to change.<br><br>
I went to my house, COMPLETELY AVOIDED MY MOM. I knew I could not speak to her normally. I quickly smothered myself with blankets and felt safe. I demanded that my boyfriend hold me closely. I felt safe.<br><br>
He suggested we go out to eat, I hadn't eaten all day and the idea of pasta made me smile. More importantly, the idea of him taking me to eat pasta seemed overwhelmingly sweet. Although I was scared to leave my position. I went out to eat with him at Pat and Oscars at the mall. My visuals were intense.<br><br>
When I inhaled the lights became increasingly brighter. When I drank soda the lights got brighter. When I sighed or whined the lights became darker. We went home and my thoughts were running into an infinite trail.<br><br>
I tripped out on the fact that I felt so uncomfortable around my friends earlier that night. I felt so insecure and I could not explain. <br><br>
I later got into a seriously intense conversation about bad things that happened to me when I was younger. I felt insecure about the way I knew it affected me today. I was angry about how I could not get over it. I was angry because I grew up without a father. I was angry because my mom never made me feel safe. She took drugs and was angry all the time. The feelings overtook me. I cried intensely. My boyfriend held me, he told me I might need to talk to someone and fix things with my mom. I told him I wasn't comfortable with talking to anyone but him about it. He said he didn't know what to say to make me feel better.<br><br>
But during the conversation, the words came to him. My anger soon felt subsided. I felt so comfortable in knowing that he was willing to stay up late and talk to me about it all. He was giving me attention and love. I felt safe and had a euphoric feeling overcome me. I looked at him for a while as he started to fall asleep. I felt like crying. I told him I loved him. I smiled and felt euphoria.<br><br>
I looked at the posters in his room swirling and shifting for a while and slowly fell into a dreamy sleep.<!-- End Body -->
