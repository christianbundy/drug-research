I've used quite a bit of GHB, mostly when it was prescribed by my doctor and I got 250mg capsules from a mail-order pharmacy.  My father also used GHB for a while to help him go to sleep at night but stopped after he had an experience which he described as 'feeling like an illegal drug'.<br><br>
I had been trying out GHB, starting with 250mg the first night, and increasing it by 250mg each night until I reached 2.25 grams.  I noticed no perceptible changes in emotional experience, and gave up, thinking that it was not worthy of its street name of 'Liquid E'.  A few weeks later, I tried 3 grams.  Still nothing.  Then I put on some music, and noticed that it sounded significantly different.  So I put on some dance music, and particularly appreciated the bass drum beats.  I started focusing on how I felt and found that I felt quite 'opened up' emotionally.  Not like E, but closer than I expected.<br><br>
After I had found my dose, I wanted to try it at a rave.  I took 3 grams when I arrived.  As it came on, 15 minutes later, I could feel the bass beats quite strongly in his chest.  This went on intensely for about an hour, and then I took another 500mg.  This extended the peak some, but I described it as less intense than the peak.  When I got home, I slept about 5 hours and woke up completely refreshed, which I attributed to the GHB.  I said he hasn't found this (needing *less* sleep after staying up all night long) on any other substance right afterwards.<!-- End Body -->
