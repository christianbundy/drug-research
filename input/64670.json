 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSmoked 1 bowl full of material in a water pipe. About 5 hits total. Smoked only the flesh scraped from red skin.\r\nFelt effects almost immediately.  Very similar to marijuana.  At first more focused, but as I type this 30 minutes later I'm a little dizzier and losing ability to focus. \r\nSounds are enhanced.  Eyes are watering more than usual.  Getting a little jumpy.\r\nOverall, nice effect, seems to be a nice substitute for marijuana.  Will definitely try again, probably blending with marijuana next time.\n\n\n"
