First some background. I am a 32 year old male with a steady history of drug and alcohol use. Starting with Cannabis and Alcohol, then Cocaine, MDMA, Pain killers of all varieties, Amphetamines, Heroin, LSD, and Mushrooms.<br><br>
Now the mindset. I have abstained from alcohol and ALL drugs for four months prior to this experience, and also quit smoking two months prior. In the four months leading up this I began exercising six days a weeks and have gotten in really good shape physically, mentally and spiritually. I run four days a week, lift weights three days a week, and do Yoga and Meditate everyday.<br><br>
Let me also say that my favorite feeling from my drug history has been either on opiates or MDMA, and I enjoyed them both a little too much in the past. I try to stay clear of them now except for special occasions.<br><br>
Now onto the experience. I've done Kratom several times before, but this time was special, I fasted for 18 hours prior, my last meal was around 9PM the previous evening. The day of, I went for a 2 1/2 mile run followed by yoga and meditation. I thought around 3PM would be a good time to ingest the Kratom.<br><br>
3:15 ~ I weighed out 7 grams and emptied the powdered contents into my mouth chasing it with a tall glass of water. It tastes nasty, but I know the reward will be sweet.<br><br>
3:45 ~ I start to feel this intense warmth come over my entire body, it feels like a combination of my first MDMA high with a nice OxyContin like twist, along with the social aspect of Cocaine.<br><br>
4:15 ~ Still feeling incredible, strong desire to communicate with loved ones. Very empathetic.<br><br>
4:45 ~ Listening to music sounds like a really good idea right now. I put on a live Jerry Garcia Band disc from 77' and just lay on my bed really enjoying the moment.<br><br>
6:15 ~ Starting to feel back to normal, I still very happy though.<br><br>
Overall this experience was incredibly satisfying. What made it really magical was the fasting and the aerobic exercise, and the fact that this was the first time in four months I put anything psychoactive into my system.<!-- End Body -->
