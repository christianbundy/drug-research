I purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known<br>
nursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea <br>
methods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.<br>
Where codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little<br>
alternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't <br>
like wasting a useful substance... or puking, for that matter.<br><br>
At least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric<br>
fryer pot with enough water to 'float' the matter freely.<br>
Setting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed<br>
the mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.<br><br>
Next, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then<br>
poured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the<br>
water content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.<br>
I carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and <br>
left it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's<br>
consistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate<br>
amount of nicely dried 'tar' around the surface edges of the<br>
measuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in<br>
a cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to<br>
air-dry. <br><br>
A few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. <br>
I recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.<!-- End Body -->
