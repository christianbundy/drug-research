I am 21 years old and use several drugs enhancing my memory capabilities. I started with Piracetam about 2 years ago and use it till now with several breaks. My opinion about this drug is quite positive, but effects on my memory arent so considerable. <br><br>
My last course of Piracetam began about 1 month ago and continues till now. I began with starting dosage of 4,8 g for 5 days, then decreased it to 4,0 g and now use 2,8 g daily. Improvement is insignificant. I mentioned, that high dosages (even 6,0 g daily) do not create greater effect on me, comparing with normal recommended dosages (2,4-3,2 g daily). So I decided to continue therapy with these normal dosages. <br><br>
Several weeks ago I read about Hydergine and its synergistic effects with Piracetam. So I decided to try. Now I am using 4,5 mg daily for about 2 weeks and mentioned quite significant memory enhancing effect. Also, with these two drugs I use lecithin and choline in dosage of 4 g per day. <br><br>
One fact, which can mask the real effects of nootropics in my case history, is a depressant drug - Clonazepam. I am forced to use it, because I have vegetodystonia syndrome, which ceased only with Clonazepam (or Alprazolam). So I use 2,0 mg daily with no breaks for about 1 year. Very interesting, but I feel no side effects of Clonazepam (and any other BZD)- only several times it seemed to be effecting on me in its sedative or hypnotic properties. But anti-vegetodystonic effect of Clonazepam (or Alprazolam) is nearly 100%. All other BZDs I used (Diazepam, Medazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Oxazepam, Triazolam, Midazolam, Flunitrazepam, Lorazepam, Nitrazepam ) are helpless- quite a strange situation.<br><br>
Several words about getting Piracetam and Hydergine in my country. Piracetam is over-the-counter. Hydergine is a prescription drug, but it also used to treat vegetodystonia, so I can easily get it. My therapy with these drugs (Piracetam 2,8 g + Hydergine 4,5 mg) costs me about 0,5$ daily.<!-- End Body -->
