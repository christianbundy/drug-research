I'd been taking Lexapro (an SSRI) for just over seven months when I took mushrooms for the third time with two good friends of mine. The first two times that I took mushrooms, I had not been taking lexapro and although I was fairly depressed, I had amazing expierences, to the point that while I was hallucinating, I felt that my depression had been (at least temporarily) alleviated.<br><br>
However when I took mushrooms for the third time, while on lexapro, although my friends were having pretty intense expierences (although no visual hallucinations) I felt as though I had only taken 1/3 of the dose that I actually had. The only hallucinagenic effect that I expierneced other than a fairly intense 'buzz' was very mild spatial distortion, almost as though I had smoked a very large amount of hashish. Having orally ingested mushrooms twice before this expierence I'm fairly sure that the lexapro dulled the effect of the mushrooms heavily.<!-- End Body -->
