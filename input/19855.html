I work in as pet shop and I am a reptile/amphibian enthusiast<br>
a customer of ours (a wild, unkempt sloth of a man) asked to board a 'rare desert toad' and to 'keep it out of sight'. having known of the colorado river toad and seen it on websites, etc., I was excited.<br><br><br>
I waited until we closed, and went downstairs where the toad was kept. I never 'milked' one before so it took a while( and I imagined a lot of lost product) before I got up a good glob of venom.  It looked like a popped zit. I smeared it on to a metrocard(NYC) and put it aside to dry. Then I took a slim cigarette I hand rolled and rubbed the toads glands with it. I then let it sit for a bout 20 min, then lit it.<br><br>
I felt nothing, save anticipation.  I let the other clot of venom dry for 3 hours, then came back to my job with a dragon chaser I made (a bic pen, with a bowl of foil suspended from the bottom). I scraped the now flaky white stuff into the bowl, took a moment, and took my hit.<br><br>
I felt a warm wave starting in the nape of my neck. My ears got hot<br>
as my lungs were fitting to burst. I exhaled and got very dizzy. That passed and I was full-on. i could feel the effects still rising, and the hundred or so cages of breeding cockatiels whistling around my head looked like strange ugly aliens all moving and mercurial. One thing I always do to check how hard I am bugging is look at the palms of my hands, they looked clammy and blotchy.  My hands were getting bigger and smaller as I looked at them, and I felt the body rush akin to psilocybin.  I noticed I still had some crust in my chaser's bowl, so I folded the foil over and put it in my pocket. Every possible surface was moving.  I looked at the veneer on a cabinet door and the grain of the wood was moving along as if it were flotsam in strong current. I went outside take in some air, and the world was two colors. The sky was a greyish indigo, everything below it was dyed orange by streetlights.<br><br>
By now my trip was going down, so I walked home.  I saved the rest of my hit for whenever. I stil have it.  My only regret is that I was dead sober about 60 minutes after taking the hit. It was very intense, like the potent 'redcap' mushrooms that go around here. Very nice though. Hooray for amphibians!<!-- End Body -->
