My junior year of highschool I was unfortunate enough to injure myslef pretty seriously. After months of trying to convince my parents there there was a problem with my knee they finally sent me to a doctor. You can guess what he said. Over the next 2 years I underwent 3 surgeries to fix the problem. Each one of these surguries came with a minimum of 2 months of immobility, the longest was close to 6 months. Also, with each came an unlimited supply of percoset. And so began my long love affair with percoset. <br><br>
Before my first surgery I had never experimented with any painkillers of any sort. The first time I took 2 of them I was in so much pain I wanted to die, and felt like I was probably going to. After they kicked in about a half hour or so I was amazed at what was happening. I knew that my knee still hurt like a bitch but it just didn't matter to me anymore. It was like pain couldn't touch me anymore as long as I just didn't think about it. I layed on the couch watching tv, playing video games and taking my percoset when it started wearing off for countless days. After a while I lost all perception of time. I never knew what day of the week it was. All I knew for so long was the walls of my livingroom where I was living since my bedroom was on the second floor which would have made things too difficult and boring.<br><br>
After one perscription ran out and things looked good for my knee the doctors said I needed surgery again and I remember that that didn't bother me because it meant that I got more percoset. Of course at the time I was so addicted that I didn't see how wrong that was. I was willing to get hurt again just to get more of this drug. The same thing happened again. Almost like clockwork as soon as thing were looking up I needed surgery again. But once again, it didn't matter because I was getting more percoset. <br><br>
Finally after 2 years of an almost constant percoset binge the doctors said I was all better. My perscriptions ran out, my knee didn't hurt anymore but I still needed percoset. I started buying them off of people who could get them, spending half of a paycheck on percosets just so I wouldn't have to go without. But then I ran into a bump, I had to go to college. I knew that I wouldn't be able to handle a job and college at the same time (I'm not a bad student, I'm just not a great one). I ran out of percoset and money to buy it. <br><br>
Just like that I had to quit. I was in a terrible mood all the time, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't remember anything, I took lazy to an entirely new level. To this day I am a different person because of the extent I took the addiction to. I have trouble expressing myself verbally, I lose my train of thought in the middle of a thought. At this point you're probably thinking 'How long did this take to write?' your answer is probably too long. I have to say that the worst thing that has changed about me since this experience is that I cannot trust anyone. I have a constant paranoia that peoples intentions are not what they seem. I always feel that people say that they are my friends but really don't give a shit about me. Who knows, maybe I'm not paranoid, maybe they really don't give a shit. I'd like to think that that's not true. <br><br>
My final word to anyone who has actually cared enough to read this entire thing is: percoset is a great thing when you control it. For anyone how is into cars I'll put it this way, it's like a drift. It can go nice and smooth but it can also get out of control, at which point you either regain control or you crash and burn.<!-- End Body -->
