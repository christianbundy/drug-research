Background: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.<br><br>
Normally, I have a hard time getting to sleep. It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to get so sleep after going to bed, usually.<br><br>
In short, my 'sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.<br><br>
So, I decided to try some melatonin for a while to see if it will help me. I've been getting to bed around 5:00 AM for the last 3 nights (it was a weekend), and I have work tomorrow at 1:00 PM.<br><br>
These are my notes on 1-day-short-of two weeks of using 1mg melatonin sublingual tablets as a sleep aid.<br><br>
May 31 @ 2:50 AM<br>
1mg melatonin sublingual<br>

4mg melatonin sublingual<br>
I didn't get to sleep for at least 45 minutes.<br>
I slept 12 hours.<br>

June 9th @ 4:09 AM<br>
4mg melatonin sublingual<br>
I went to bed at 4:14 AM.<br>
I have to get up at 8:00 AM.<br>
I slept 4 hours and got up, a little bit (but not very) tired.<br><br>
June 10 @ 1:19 AM<br>
4mg melatonin sublingual (after not sleeping all day)<br>
I have to get up ~7:30 AM.<br>
I got ~5-6 hours of sleep.<br>
I was tired most of the day after waking up.<br><br>
June 11 @ 3:05 AM<br>
4mg melatonin sublingual<br>
June 11 @ 3:20 AM<br>
1mg melatonin sublingual<br>
I become tired @ 3:41 AM and go to bed. <br>
I obtained sleep @ 4: something AM.<br>
I got up @ 1:00 PM, but could have sleep for many hours more.<br>
I am very tired upon awaking. <br><br>
June 12 @ 5:52 AM<br>
2mg melatonin sublingual<br>
I'm tired anyway, but I'm taking two.<br>
Thank God I don't have work tomorrow.<br><br>
Basically, this stuff isn't helping, or I'm becoming too tolerant. It would be OK if I wasn't so tired in the mornings.<br>
I noticed no diffence in the frequency or vividness of my dreams when I was taking it from when I wasn't.<br><br>
Once this bottle runs out, I'm not buying another, but I'll use it untill it's all gone.<!-- End Body -->
