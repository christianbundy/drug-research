I recently (1/18/97) went to my first rave in Jacksonville, FL. When I first got there, I was kinda disappointed. There were a bunch of people standing around but only a few dancing. At about 2:30, a friend of a friend got me four tablets of X, called 'green turbo'. I handed one to my other 3 friends who were there with me, and we all<br>
took them at the same time. I had read extensively on the topic of Ecstasy and I had made the decision (responsibly) to try it out. I had been wanting to try it for quite some time, so I was ready for it to kick in. <br><br>
It hit me first. When I had my eyes open, I felt completely sober and coherent. But when I closed my eyes, it was the most unbelievable experience of my life. I didn't know everything could feel so good! After about an hour and fifteen minutes, it had gotten really strong. I was a little tipsy, but everything was controllable. If someone (like a cop or my mother) had come up to me to have a conversation, I could have kept complete control of myself. That was a big plus. I could close my eyes and feel the beat surging through my body. It was as if I was in touch with everything about myself and that was an exhilarating feeling, to say the least. I felt the fatigue in my legs and the dehydration beginning to start, but I could easily go and get water if I needed to. I could not believe how wonderful everything was. My friend had on a silver rayon shirt, and I couldn't stop touching her!<br><br>
The weird thing is, nothing about the whole night was sexual. It was all sensual. Everyone was so friendly and caring, it seemed as if I was home with the family. Backrubs abounded and so did the touching. People would walk by and just touch you... and it felt so good!<!-- End Body -->
