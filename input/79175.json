 "report": "<p>Interesting experience I had over a few days that may give people a better idea on whether or not they may receive a false-positive for opiates. The first two days I took a bottle of Robitussin Liquicaps (300mg) each day. Both of those days I took the DXM around 1PM and took a urine test around 4PM; both days I passed. On the third day I took (2) bottles of Liquicaps (600mg) around 1PM and when I got back to the facility they didn't test me that day. The following day I took no DXM and was tested around 5PM and came up positive for opiates. Some people may think it was just the fact that I took a higher dose that last day, but I'm not so sure about that. Seems to me that DXM built up in my system over time to create a false-positive.</p>"
