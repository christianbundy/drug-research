I started taking Melatonin four days ago along with a vitamin B complex in hopes of enhancing my dreams and maybe sleep a little better. I also take OTC Claratin and St. johns wort. I would take 1.5 m.g. of Melatonin and vitamin B at about 9:30 p.m. The first night I fell asleep fast and had some pretty intense dreams. The dreams I can remember were about work and were very vivid, but not worth explaining. <br><br>
That day my allergies were horrible and the Claratin I took had no effect at all, so I thought I had come down with a severe cold.That night I took the Melatonin and vitamin B along with some cold medicine. I did not sleep very well and was sneezing all night with a swollen throat.The next to days and nights were the same and I was taking lots of cold medicine to get through. This morning was the worst yet. My nose was runny and my throat and toungue were very swollen. <br><br>
I ended up going home after two hours and was thinking about going to the hospital because I was having much difficulty breathing. I found my girlfriends albutoral inhalor and took three puffs. After the swelling subsided I decided to look online for more information on the drugs I was taking. I found out that I am alergic to Melatonin and that I should not take Melatonin since I have seasonal allergies. <br><br>
The symptoms I experienced at first were much like that of a common cold with severe seasonal allergies and I had no idea Melatonin was the cause.<!-- End Body -->
