Hi, I'm writing about the most terrifying but also exhilarating psychedelic experience I've had so far. It happened at my friends university accommodation and taught me a lot. I guess I'll start with some background.<br><br>
I'm 19 and have been dabbling with narcotics for about a year and a half now, pretty much since I turned 18 although I've casually smoked weed since about 14. I've had experience in MDMA (extensively), a few MDxx's, various stimulants, 6-APB, 2C-B, 2C-E, aMT (also extensively), LSD, 4-HO-MET, Ketamine, Methoxetamine, DXM, a <strong>lot</strong> of N2O (fave!) and a few others I can't reel off the top of my head right now. I'd always had a very cavalier attitude to psychedelics, having pretty ridiculous binges, and the report I'm going to outline is one of these that took a rather interesting twist and somewhat changed my outlook the process of ingesting drugs.<br><br>
My friend, R, who is also a bit of a psychedelic veteran, had recently got hold of 250mg of 2C-B and some good hash, and I was to visit him to, surprise surprise, sniff some 2C-B and smoke some hash. I woke up that day and ate a moderate breakfast of 2 slices of toast and set off to his accommodation, arriving about midday. We got high and chilled out for a bit while we waited for some friends of ours to get out of their last lectures on the Friday because we planned on doing 2C-B with them also.<br><br>
Our friends, F and P, also experienced psychonauts, arrived about 8pm and everyone was in a good mood. Now, anyone that has sniffed any of the 2C series knows that it's not the nicest thing you can put your nose through. None of us had, but we were aware of their reputation. Still, having been told that 2C-B was a lot tripper when you sniffed it, we decided it'd be a good idea anyway, taking the inevitable, 'oh it can't be THAT bad!' stance. We racked out 4 lines of 15mg each and up the nose it went. Ouch. We then all had a 20 minute period of feeling very crappy indeed, but amidst a period of standing over a toilet wondering whether or not I was about to hurl up whatever was left of my toast, I realized I was tripping pretty hard. Wow! This stuff really is trippy when you sniff it! I was seeing lots of beautiful patterns, and vibrant colours - I wouldn't say stuff was shifting or breathing so much, but my field of vision was just one giant fractal. I remember seeing the Mandelbrot set (look this up on google images, it's really amazing) in great detail on R's kitchen floor. My body felt light and airy, and I generally felt happy and uplifted, both from the 2C-B directly and being made happy from the visuals I was experiencing.<br><br>
We all had a really good time after the come-up, smoking some joints and chatting a lot of bollocks. When we started to come down, R suggested that he and I put some more in a drink and top up, so in went 10mg to a glass of water each, and down the hatch it went. In a period of about 5 hours this happened four times - yes, four times. So now on a pretty heavy dose of 2CB, and seeing patterns as intense as the initial come-up, if not more, our other friends D and S arrived. D, who is always a man to have a cabinet full of drugs, had some 4-AcO-DMT. He and S sniffed a pretty fat line of this, around 30mg maybe. It was then that R popped the question, 'so what do you reckon would happen to us if we sniffed a line of that on 2C-B?'. D replied with a chuckle, 'I guess you're gonna tell me in a minute!' and racked us out some lines of about 20-25mg.<br><br>
This is where the real experience begins. 4-AcO-DMT really was a joy to snort, especially in comparison to the 2C-B - it went down smooth and the drip wasn't too unpleasant at all. Within 5 minutes everyone basically started saying how ridiculous their visuals were getting. And, to be fair, my visuals were getting utterly ridiculous. Everything was shifting and breathing and the combination of the 4-AcO with the 2C-B really did produce beautiful things. The patterns I was seeing before on the 2C-B were as vibrant as ever, but now they were moving and dancing around my vision and even more intricate than before. People's faces would just flat out change colour a few times a second. If I closed my eyes I would be lost in a giant kaleidoscope with every colour on the spectrum making an appearance then suddenly I'd be traveling down a mystical cavern of shifting colour and swirls. I opened my eyes to see the most incredible trails and then F putting on a jacket - and this is one of the coolest things I have ever seen. In the 3 seconds it took him to put on this jacket, he turned into a wizard, then superman, then an elf like creature, then a beautiful woman and then back to himself. All crystal clear and in 3 seconds. Amazing! Sound was completely altered as well. Lots of crazy echoes, which made music sound really beautiful. My thoughts were somehow still pretty clear which was great because it allowed me to appreciate the utter euphoria I was experiencing through all of my senses.<br><br>
This is when things go a bit pear shaped. We notice the sun will be rising soon, and decide it would be the best thing ever to go to a hill nearby and smoke a joint, watching the sun rise, tripping balls. Me and R set about rolling this joint, which would be a challenge what with the fact we were seeing the tobacco running around the table. I don't think I've ever been so excited as I was to see this sunrise. However, half way through the joint rolling process, I got an uncontrollable urge to yawn. I did so, and I felt an incredible shudder running up my neck as I did so - it felt really bizarre. I commented on this to R, and then started to yawn again. Now this is the maddest yawn I have ever experienced. It honestly felt like my whole body was being turned inside out. The last thing I remember is losing my balance as I completed this yawn.<br><br><div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">'It's never wise to casually eat more drugs when your body would probably be crying out for sleep, food, and water if you'd been sober at the time.'</div></div> I wake up on the floor in R's room. As I regained consciousness by vision was just a mess of patterns and colour. I was literally blind with hallucinations for about 5 seconds. I was also very confused. 'What the fuck just happened man?' R replied, 'Um, you just passed out, had a bit of a spasm, and now you're awake. Are you okay?'. I wasn't. I felt VERY sick and could feel myself going pale. 'No man, I feel like shit if I'm honest.' I crawled to the toilet and sat there a while, not being sick, but having an overwhelming urge to just shut my eyes and sleep. I thought this odd as I was under the influence of a lot of psychedelic drugs. My breathing was suddenly <strong>really</strong> laboured and slow. I was becoming more and more aware that I had no idea if the combination of drugs I was on was actually safe, or what had just happened to me. There was a tightness in my chest and it was getting increasingly hard to keep my eyes open. I decided to play it safe and call an ambulance due to having an overwhelming sensation that if I did fall asleep I'd never wake up. It was pretty scary - the only time I've ever been scared on any drug at all.<br><br>
They rocked up in minutes and I was promptly informed I'd had a seizure and that a period of tiredness/sleep after one was totally normal. I actually ended up feeling fine in a few hours and was discharged from the hospital pretty quick once they'd assessed that my vitals were all in check. It was a pretty surreal experience being driven to hospital and talking to a paramedic whilst tripping my nuts off. It was hard to take him seriously when being driven in his car was like being in a psychedelic spaceship and his face was shifting into some sort of venus fly trap.<br><br>
Upon returning to R's accommodation, to a very relieved R, we pondered why this had occurred. It soon was made apparent that I hadn't actually eaten anything substantial for almost 24 hours and was probably very dehydrated as well. The whole experience taught me to make sure I am well fed and watered before, and during, any experience with any drug. It's never wise to casually eat more drugs when your body would probably be crying out for sleep, food, and water if you'd been sober at the time. I survived though and have continued on my merry way, with a fairly consistent intake of psychedelics still. I just make sure my body is in a good state before I indulge :)<br><br>
So yeah, bear that in mind everyone! Peace<!-- End Body -->
