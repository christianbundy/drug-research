 "report": "<p>I would like to share some side effects from useing to much ecstasy. </p><p>I 1st tried e in england about 5 years ago. I had a very good time. After a few months in england I went to an asian country to teach english. I am still here. Over 2004 up to now I have been useing e. It started off as just doing it every now and then to every day. Some of my side effects I get are stressed out very easily and frustrated I never used to be like that. I have a very mild case of compulsive disorder. I seem to check my back pack on my way to work over and over and over again. I get panic attacks not all the time though. I get hot and sweat alot. </p><p>I have lost alot of weight from useing e. I used to be 100kg and now I am about 75kg. But I also do not want to put the weight back on. Although I abuse this drug I am afraid of life without it. I get dizzy spells (not all the time). Dry skin, find it hard to relax. I have had some really wicked headaches. </p><p>I am not crazy or anything I am a good person. I have a quarter in the morning and afternoon. And alot in the weekend. I have not cried for nearly 2 years. My moods are up and down but I am not a violent person. Just get moody. There are times when e has been very good when I have been in a very good mood and happy but thats very rear. I also think alot of speed is in them as I do like the rush. </p><p>I know I have a dependancy on e and I have to find a way of trying to give up.</p>"
