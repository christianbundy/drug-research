 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPain killers normally put me to sleep, or just give me a numb feeling that just bores me, but I found something different in Ultram.  After an hour of taking 3 ultram 50mg pills, I started to feel numb and groovy.  I listened to some good ol' Led Zeppelin, then I got off the bus and I was so happy, I wanted to talk to everyone. I loved everyone.  Music was great, hell, even school was great, this pain killer made me very euphoric.  \r\nIt gives me ungodly constipation.  I have never had trouble pissing before, but I had taken 3 one day, and 4 the next day, and 2 that afternoon, well I drank bout 3 cokes, and I needed to use the bathroom, Im sitting there waiting! About 30 seconds into it, I finally feel it coming out and it hurt, it burned, it was very unpleasant.  That night I went to bed, or tried to, and I felt pains in my stomach, those pains were from 11p.m-1:00a.m and I went frequently to the toilet with nothing happening, finally I had a small but significant crap. I still like to groove on them every now and then.\n\n\n"
