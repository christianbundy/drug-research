My friend and I decided to try some DPT together. We are completely at ease in each others company and wanted to celebrate her return from what had seemed like a long absence by exploring our souls once we had caught up on news! We were in my tranquil house, undisturbed, at dusk in the summertime. We lit a couple of oil lamps made from a nautilus shell and a giant conch. We hadnt eaten for several hours. We had shared a bottle of wine and a few cigarettes.<br><br>
My friend has never tried DPT before, Ive experimented with it orally  some time ago  but snorting it this time significantly intensified the effect (surprise!). We found that the experience utterly defeated our usual impulse to analyse our trips verbally/in writing afterwards. Instead, a record of our conversation at the time might convey something of the nature of the experience.<br><br>
About 10-15 mins after insufflation<br>
C  Im not sure what to make of it, are you? It feels very overwhelming.<br>
A  I feel as though Im rolling along on waves.<br>
C  Yes, thats a good description.<br><br>
A goes out into garden to pick flowers and returns with lavender, nigella and snapdragons.<br><br>
C  How on earth did you manage to coordinate that?!<br>
A  I dont find it hard to move. Im just adjusting to how this feels.<br>
C  I cant budge. Im not sure how Im finding this.<br>
A  No. It doesnt feel threatening in any way, though. Not edgy like 2CE.<br>
C  No, its very beautiful.<br><br>
Some conversation, which feels like an effort<br><br>
A  I dont particularly feel like talking, do you?<br>
C  No, not really.<br><br>
Silence<br><br>
C  Im not finding it very comfortable. Im not sure I like it  theres a kind of acidic edge to it. And its very acute.<br>
A  The taste of it in the back of the throat probably doesnt help!.<br>
C  No.<br><br>
C goes to be sick<br><br>
A  Are you OK?<br>
C  Yes, I just physically didnt feel too good. But Im OK. Its very powerful stuff. Very intense.<br>
A  Yes. Im still working out what kind of space were in. But everything is very altered. It has a sort of hushed quality to it, very still.<br>
C  Yes.<br><br>
[About 45 mins after insufflation]<br>
A  Strange. Im not being funny but I can feel my chakra points, can you? In my palms. The top of my head. And here, and here and here Its flowing in through my palms.<br>
C  Yes! Only its not just flowing in there, its the most enormous rush all the way through, upwards.<br><br><br>
C  Oh, thats the most beautiful thing I ever saw. I dont know how to describe it. <br>
A  Im not getting visuals at all. <br>
C  I cant believe what Ive been seeing.<br>
A  Ill try closing my eyes No, nothing. But I feel glowing. Like I am spread out into everything around me.<br>
C  Im sorry, Im not being much company. <br>
A  No, I feel the same way, lets not spoil this by trying to describe it. We can compare notes tomorrow.<br>
C  Yes. This is absolutely amazing.<br>
A  Isnt it.<br><br><br>
C  What do they call it, that church that uses this as their sacrament?<br>
A  The Temple of the True Inner Light.<br>
C  Yes. I cant wait to write about this. But I dont know what to say about it.<br>
A  There are no words for it, are there?<br>
C  No. Perhaps its best not to even try.<br><br><br>
A  I hope this really is the nature of things, do you?<br>
C  How could it not be?<br>
A  It seems that way, doesnt it.<br>
C  Yes. <br><br>
[A couple of hours later]<br>
C  Im coming down a bit now, are you? Do you want me to leave you to it for a while? I dont want to spoil it for you.<br>
A  No, Im happy to talk. But I still feel  weightless. I can feel my body, but its as though its without substance. Im dissolved into all the space around us. <br>
C  That was a very intense peak, for me, but it seems to be over now. Its gone like this [makes a series of jerky up-and-down gestures with hand].<br>
A  For me it has been constant and steady, and very calm. Im still there. I feel  like that flame [pointing at the oil lamp]. Like that, exactly.<br>
C  [Laughs] Say no more! Enjoy it!<br><br>
The intense period lasted perhaps a couple of hours, but the sense of tranquillity and joy permeated the entire evening. We mused a little later on the fact that although the set and setting undoubtedly helped to make this a beautiful experience, we could not imagine feeling substantially different even if we had taken the DPT in another kind of environment. We felt there was a very safe and reassuring feel to it. The only snag was the nose burn, and sniffing so much we sounded like a pair of cokeheads.<br><br>
For me, none of this was at all visual. When I went out into the garden, for example, to get the hang of the come-up, nothing looked different: it just felt very different. With closed eyes I saw nothing, either  I just felt completely transcendent, for want of a better word. C, on the other hand, was able to see herself at the base of an immense tree, and describes it as best she can like this:<br><br>
'The tree was massive, very like some of the ones I saw when I was in the Amazon, overwhelmingly huge and ancient. I was very aware of the texture and smell of its bark, almost as if I were tasting it. I was lying at the base in amongst all the stuff one finds on a jungle floor, soil, leaf litter, undergrowth, insects, staring up the length of the trunk which disappeared off into the distance. There was a blinding light at the top that came rushing down to meet me and as it did I felt like I was being propelled upwards towards it while the tree cradled me in its giant root system.'<br><br>
Reflecting on my own previous experiences with other people, and on the individual nature of our own responses to it this evening, we mused that it seems to give you what you most need. A very powerful substance that we look forward to exploring further.<!-- End Body -->
