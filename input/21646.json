 "report": "\n\n\n\nOne day after school I was bored and decided to try my dad's tobacco snuff. This was closer to chewing tobacco than powder, and it didn't look like I could inhale it so I just stuck it in my mouth like chewing tobacco. There was a numbing/burning sensation at first but then it lessened until it was almost gone. \r\nAbout five minutes later I got up to get something and I realized my legs felt funny, like relaxed with a slight loss of coordination. I also felt very slight light-headedness. I was totally calm, more than normal and especially compared to the nervousness I had felt a few minutes before at trying this stuff. No 'good' or happy feelings, just neutral. About ten minutes later I felt slightly nauseous until I spit the stuff out at the 15 minute mark. I lay down for a few minutes and for half an hour later there were lingering calming and appetite suppressing effects.\n\n\n"
