 "report": "<p>I have had a good result with Wellbutrin. I tried Lexapro, but that was making me unbelievably nauseated. Wellbutrin works for me, and helps me at work and with social life. It clearly stimulates me, and I can feel the effects in 1-3 days. I am very glad that I have discovered this medicine.</p><p>I have been taking it for 4 years now, but only when I need it which is every now and than about one in 2 months. It reliably clears any depressive symptoms, or more importantly, when I am low on energy, which is more common. I cannot take it for more than 3-4 days, or else I get insomnia from it, and this sometimes will be contraproductive as far as the next day is concerned.</p>"
