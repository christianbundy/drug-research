We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] </font><br><br>
My friend introduced me to getting high off computer duster.  He said that the chemical was harmless so I tried it on good faith.  I quite enjoyed the experience and every time we got together drinking we would cap the night with some hits.   The normal experience was just a head rush type feeling with pulsating sounds and darkened vision.  The good thing about it was it was a quick rush and didn't last too long.<br><br>
Today I was off work and bored so I bought a can to enjoy at home by myself.  Holy S**T.  I took a deep hit held it in, then let go.  The pulsating noises started.  I took another deep hit and started to drift away.  Suddenly my friend was there (not really) but I really thought that he was.  He said 'look how you feel now, imagine if you do another' so I did.<br><br>
Into another reality I went.  It was like a paranoid dream and my imaginary friend was really messing with me.  I came back to reality and was so facinated although a little horrified I felt that I must try it again.  Deja Vu, same exact dream took place.  I repeated this about four times trying to figure out what it all meant but as I would come to I would forget most of the event although it seemed to be the same.  I couldn't figure out how I could be so insane as to forget that I was just hallucinating again after each hit.   I really would think these things were happening in a matter of seconds.<br><br>
I called that same friend at work and we did a few together over the phone.  Nothing, just the head rush.  It seemed like only when there was nothing to concentrate on I would fade out.  But I figured hey why not try this with some porn.  Now there is about 1 hour of my life that I really don't remember.  I was so into it I don't think I would have stopped exept for the fact that I threw up on my living room floor.  The can was almost gone and I was pretty screwed up for several hours fading in and out of reality.  I became rather depressed and almost suicidal but after talking with some friends I seem to have snapped out of it now.<br><br>
I am just glad I waited to get home before I started.  I really think it should be avoided all together because anything that could do that to me so fast must be doing some damage.<!-- End Body -->
