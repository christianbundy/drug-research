 "report": "<p>\nQuite some time ago, soma compound (carisoprodol & aspirin) (or soma compound with codeine) was prescribed by my doctor to treat pain and muscle tension associated with TMJ. Shortly after taking meds, I noticed an increase in frequency of sex dreams. Great dreams! I have taken other muscle relaxers and pain medications since, but have never encountered the same experience. The dreams seemed to directly correlate with the soma. Eventually the dreams subsided after I discontinued use (about 1 year). After that, the dreams occurred with less frequency and intensity.</p>"
