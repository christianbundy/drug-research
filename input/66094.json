 "report": "<p>I tried taking ginko for about a week.. The bottle said to take like 2 pills twice a day... But every morning I took 1 pill with my prozac and vitamins.</p><p>The first few days I had headaches and would get the chills like I had a fever. Eventually that went away but every afternoon I would still feel tired and sick. The effects it made on my memory and concentration were amazing though! I was remembering things I didnt need to know without trying. I was also dreaming more vividly and would remember the dreams upon waking. Basically it supercharged my mind but made my body feel sick. I kept the bottle. I will take them before any important tests or when work is hectic. </p><p>Someone else made an experience about Ginko giving them a slight perceptual change, making them feel smaller. I experienced this too and mushrooms will heighten this effect.</p>"
