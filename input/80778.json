 "report": "<p>For certain people I believe that Provigil is or can be addictive.  Both physically and mentally.  I started in 2005 on around 200 mg for jet lag and I had to go to detox last year to get off of it.  The increase always happens.  When I take Provigil I do get a 'rush' similar to that of cocaine but much less instense.  In the past I stole a prescription to get more.  There are times in the past that when I just stopped using it.  I have cravings for about 3 days and I was very unmotivated for about the same.  This to me sounds like addiction and I think people should know that this is a possibility.</p>"
