 "report": "\n\n\n\nUnder the stunted oak I waited for her<br>the Green Lady<br>clothed in the black of the mystified, the lost,<br>but more truly, naked and unshriven, seeking a dying moment.<br>Under my tongue, the bitter mint<br>above my head, invisible leaves,<br>known only for the moonlight they intercept<br>below my back, the green grass that saw me through my youth.<br>She came to me in a spirograph body<br>wings twined with ivy in curliqued ringlets<br>her fingers the thorns of roses pointed with the blood of the unworthy<br>the edges of her smile reaching up to the stars, her teeth, barbed spikes<br>I had not expected fear, but terror came with her<br>and tho I sought a dying moment, she showed me a dying eternity<br>and tho I sought to bring wisdom into the real, she tore the real from me<br>and I was no more, and in unbeing, I lost my fear<br>She made me into a mist, expanding slowly until I was all<br>everywhere, blown by the wind of her breath<br>into eddies and whorls within myself<br>and it was I that her wings beat, to keep her aloft<br>She flew in me, acrobatically spinning and turning<br>casting off parts of myself in colors I have never seen<br>I flowed across her wings, she breathed me<br>and I flowed through her grasslike hair<br>Soon, oh, too soon,<br>boundries encircled me and I contracted, condensed<br>and rained myself on the stunted oak, and dripped from it in rivulets<br>and froze beneath it into this mortal body, clothed in black of the still<br>mystified, but no longer lost.<br>© 2001 Lizard\n\n\n"
