We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
Inhalents will kill pretty easily, here's my story, listen up. About six years back me and a friend of mine were hanging around, bored, and we'd heard about huffing freon from a friend. I decided to try it.  This stuff is incredibly addictive. I did it for about three days, about 30-40 times a day. The last time I huffed I nearly died.<br><br>
I was sitting there huffing, I'd get high, loose comprehension, wake up, and do it again, and so on. Well about 10 minutes into this I passed out but I was still conscious it was weird, I had suddenly was completely sober, and felt none of the effects of the freon. I wasn't in my body or anything, instead I was in this black void, it felt real far away. I dont know if it was an out of body experience or whatever but its nothing I'd ever been through or have since. <br><br>
Well anyway I'm in this place, feels lightyears away and stuff. I'm looking at these two massive chrome spheres and there passing this signal between each other. I could see the signal it was this type of thing<br>
0  ))))  0  <br>
The signal would travel to the opposite sphere then it would go back<br>
0   (((( 0<br>
I watched these things do this about three times, then something happened. The signal was interupted by something, it stopped, the spheres lost communication and glazed over with a grayish dead looking mist, they weren't shiny anymore. And I had this overwhelming conviction that somehow I had just really royally messed up on a universally massive scale, I knew I had just watched myself die. I dont know how I knew but it was the most powerful feeling of 'ohhhh god no!' I've ever felt. I was dead. <br><br>
The very instant this realization hit me, I mean 1 millisecond after I felt all of this, I was rushed back to my body and woke up to just another summer day in texas. Blue sky and everything.  Talk about a second chance on life. So anyway I guess that is what almost dying looks like, and to anyone looking to get a cool high by huffing anything, take it from me, it is not worth it. Its not worth it on a scale that is beyond comprehension. You cant even believe the unworthyness of it. I barely even can.  Hopefully some idiot teenager, like I was, will read this and think twice about huffing stuff.<!-- End Body -->
