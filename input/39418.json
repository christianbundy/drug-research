 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell where I should start. Im going to try to make this as easy to fallow as possible I hope I can actually do that because I can barley fallow it myself. I recall my friend David telling me about Angels Trumpet and how cool it was but I guess he left out all the bad shit he saw. I had come across the plant itself many times never knowing what it actually was. I had obtained a large quantity (about 90) Datura Stramonium seeds from a friend. I read a few hundred articles about it in various places on the internet. I read that datura contains both atropine and scopolamine that interface directly with the CNS (central nervous system) so I know this is going to be very hard to control and could have prolonging aftereffects. I came to the conclusion to do a small amount. <br>Now to the story, it was a Friday night I was bored nothing to do so I figure it was about time to take the seeds a bought nearly a month ago. I wanted to do it when I had a long period of time to recover. So I took a deep breath and poured 35 seeds into my mouth and chewed them for about 2 seconds and about gagged and quickly swallowed them and chased it with water. About 5 mins later I remember this should take about 30 min to 3 hrs to start so I start playing half life and at about the part when you start meeting marines is when I felt a little weird. <br>I take a look around and feel my legs getting a little numb so I figured I have to stand up for a bit well that didnt work I just fell over. I remember taking it and remember other people saying that they get all drunken feeling so I just disregarded it and got back on my computer. I feel a lot weirder now then I did on the floor, I dont know how long I was there but all I know is that Im in a different state of mind now. I look back at my monitor and I try to move the mouse and its gone. After a wile of trying to find it I give up and use my keyboard. All I wanted to do is play some music so after like 60 Ctrl-Alt-Dels I come to the conclusion its frozen so I restart. Nothing happened, I do it again and again and finally it starts (Im not sure if this was just the datura or my computer was fucking up). The computer started and I forgot my password and I am so mad, all I want to do is play some music. Then I punch the keyboard it works but my sink started to spray water all over the place. <br>Im a bit confused and I go to turn it off and as soon as I hit the tile it turns off. I do a little dance back and forth from the carpet to the tile turning the water on and off it was so funny. But then it doesnt stop the water is going every ware and I cant stop it. I try to turn it off my hitting my keyboard but nothing happens. I deicide its best to just leave before I drown. So I go to my room and shut the door. By this time my mouse is back and I put on Tools Ænima and go lay down because I really want to get off the carpet for some reason. I lay down and my pillow is getting me angry it keeps blocking the music so I get rid of it by putting it in my closet and go back to laying down trying to figure out what music is playing. <br>I get up to check the song on the play list but my mouse is gone again and I decide its Jasons fault. Well Jason is a friend that lives in Texas and I have to find him to get my mouse to come back so I ask my room mate for 16 dollars to fly to Texas, he told me that I wouldnt stop asking him for money even though explained a plane ticket to Texas would cost like 400 bucks, and I told him that I had a guy who stole a plane is waiting outside for me and hes a bum so all I need is 16 dollars and a pack of cigarettes and he will fly me to Texas. <br>Well I dont remember when or how I got back into my room but I did and I couldnt get out. My roommate probably locked me in. I look around and I have these crazy twisty posters I get at a gifts well I escape threw one of them and Im outside and I see the plane just about to take off. And I just sit down on a bench and a plane lands and there is Jason with my mouse in his hand and Im so happy. But when I go up to him he gets very mad at me because he had to pay the bum 16 dollars, and he smashes my mouse and kicks me in the knee and I fall down I look back up and Im in my room again, and at this point I am very scared because for a second everythings the same again and my arms are stuck inside my shirt  and I need to get them out to stop the walls from getting any closer and I rip threw my shirt and Im leaning on the wall trying to stop the wall from crushing me and everything in my room like a garbage compactor. <br>Well I wasnt strong enough and I was crushed. I appear in my old house in Tampa and my friend that died like 2 years ago is there and Im a ghost and we talk for a wile and he is real mad at me and said I killed him but I didnt and he casts me to hell. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS BAD.<br>Im in a room where the corners of the room are flashing bright red and every time they flash it hurts a lot. And I cover my eyes but nothing I can do stops the light I can see it in the same spot no mater what I do and my friends parents are there yelling at me an crying saying that I killed their son and hitting me with those glow wands from demolition man. <br>Then I look up and there gone but my friends there and he gives me a cigarette and I take it only to keep him happy with me and I light it up and it burns my lungs but I keep smoking it to keep him happy despite the terrible pain that comes with every drag. After about 60 or so cigarettes I tell him I dont want anymore and he kicks me and I fly back from my poster onto my bed and I look around everything is back and Im in my room and that scares the fuck out of me. So I get under my bed and try to go to hide by putting everything I can around the edges of my bed but everything is so incredibly heavy I can only lift small objects like cds and pens so I decide to hide in my closet. Well I get in there and my pillow is there and I dont want it to stop the sounds of someone coming in my room so I get rid of it by putting in my dresser but it wont stay closed and this makes me very pissed off so I kick the shit out of it but Im very weak and anything I do is in like slow motion and I cant seem to get is closed so I just wrap it in my blankets and throw it out of the window. <br>But I cant close the window. So I go back into my closet and I see like 80 copies of myself and its so crowded in there I cant breath and I pass out. And I keep hearing like a sweeping noise outside of the room Im in. Im in one of those portables they have in over crowded schools and I know whatever it is there going to get in somehow and get me so I try to hide but its just a room no ware to go. And I hear all these banging noises like its trying to break the door down and I get a desk and throw it at the wall and it breaks a hole in the wall and its very bright outside I get the courage to go outside and nothings there so I get my welding glasses out and put them on and I can see clearly now and there it is a big fucking tornado. I go back inside and it hits the building and kill everyone in the area and Im all alone bodies everywhere. Then I see my house Im like oh fuck my brother was home and I start to like rip the  debris apart and like Im fucking superman Im like throwing huge pieces of broken house with ease but the house was like made of puzzle pieces and I couldnt get them to stack up they kept falling over back onto the pile. I try for days but every thing I do causes more damage and the pieces keep getting smaller and smaller until its like a big multicolored pile of sand and its like the future and everything is more advanced and developed but this small section of land where my house of sand is and Im in a glass ball and there are like aliens looking at me threw the glass and shaking it around like a snow globe. And one of the alien kids turns it over and the house of sand falls on me and I suffocate.<br>I wake up to my roommate yelling at me. Asking me why am I in his closet and why did I throw his pillow out the window, I tried to tell him that it was going to stop the sound but he cant understand. So he explains to me that I must be high and he thinks Im on acid, I tell him acid is not good for him and that he should try something that I have. And I handed him an empty bottle labeled datura, and it all hits me it was all just a VERY BAD trip. So I call my parents and there a little confused why I asked if they were ok. So I hang up and go take a shower trying to get back to normal. It took about 6 to 8 weeks until I could actually see strait and sleep regularly and not expect to be killed at any moment.\n\n\n"
