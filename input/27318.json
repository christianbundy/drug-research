 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nDose: 2 g sinicuichi steeped twice as a tea + 2 g smoked.<br>First, I smoke 1 g in a water pipe.<br>Each puff elicits a kind of 'head rush'.<br>Feel an immediate euphoria and relaxation, <br>like a mild opium dose, without the endorphin hit.<br>As I smoke, sounds seem to reverberate, but no visuals.<br>Then I down the the tea. The taste isn't bad--surely delicious compared to Calea Zacatechichi. :-)<br>I smoke another 1 g.<br>About ten minutes after smoking, the tea kicks in. I listen to Pat Metheny's 'As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls'. Music is a joy to listen to. Must say Sinicuichi is perfect with music. (Is this the 'auditory hallucinogen' part?) I slouch back in the armchair, feeling slightly sedated and quite euphoric. After about two hours, effects wear off. I go to bed and have a very sound sleep.<br>Next morning, I feel rested and at ease. No hangover,  but some minor muscle aches all day.<br>Sinicuichi's certainly one of the most 'recreational'  entheogens I've tried. This stuff's actually fun and physically soothing. However, a weekend would be a better time to have it--the bodily discomfort's mild, but distracting. (In contrast, mushrooms and Salvia are psychically demanding, and Calea is physically tiring due to sleep often being interrupted by dreams.)\n\n\n"
