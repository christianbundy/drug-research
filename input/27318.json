 "report": "<p>Dose: 2 g sinicuichi steeped twice as a tea + 2 g smoked.</p><p>First, I smoke 1 g in a water pipe.</p><p>Each puff elicits a kind of 'head rush'.</p><p>Feel an immediate euphoria and relaxation, </p><p>like a mild opium dose, without the endorphin hit.</p><p>As I smoke, sounds seem to reverberate, but no visuals.</p><p>Then I down the the tea. The taste isn't bad--surely delicious compared to Calea Zacatechichi. :-)</p><p>I smoke another 1 g.</p><p>About ten minutes after smoking, the tea kicks in. I listen to Pat Metheny's 'As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls'. Music is a joy to listen to. Must say Sinicuichi is perfect with music. (Is this the 'auditory hallucinogen' part?) I slouch back in the armchair, feeling slightly sedated and quite euphoric. After about two hours, effects wear off. I go to bed and have a very sound sleep.</p><p>Next morning, I feel rested and at ease. No hangover,  but some minor muscle aches all day.</p><p>Sinicuichi's certainly one of the most 'recreational'  entheogens I've tried. This stuff's actually fun and physically soothing. However, a weekend would be a better time to have it--the bodily discomfort's mild, but distracting. (In contrast, mushrooms and Salvia are psychically demanding, and Calea is physically tiring due to sleep often being interrupted by dreams.)</p>"
