 "report": "\n\n\n\nA couple days ago I obtained a few madagascar perywinkle leaves from a local nursery and decided to try making a small quid out of the stuff. I took 1/2 of a leaf and rolled it up with a few herbs and stuck it in my cheek after taking some anti-histamines (in-case it didn't do anything). After about forty five minutes I started feeling really floaty and happy and started experiencing some visual disturbances (brighter colors and distorted perspective). After about an hour of this I started coming down (although the euphoria stayed). When I was practically at baseline (except for the euphoria, which felt kind of like 'nothing could get me down) I started experiencing stomach cramps and had to go use the bathroom really badly, but this was ok because I was the happiest person on the planet. \r\nThis was three days ago and I still feel really happy and relaxed, my typing skills seem to have significantly increased as well, I will definitely do this again.\r\nAll in all very possitive.\n\n\n"
