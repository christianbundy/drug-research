The first time I smoked I was 15. A few months before, my boyfriend, who we'll call W, left his half empty pack of ciggarettes at my house cuz he said he didn't want them. I hid them so my parents wouldn't find them and just forgot about them.<br><br>
One day I was really pissed off and depressed. I was tired of popping the usual pills and wanted to try something different. No one was home and I remembered I had those ciggs. I went oustide, sat under my tree in my reclining lawn chair or whatever the hell u call it, and lit up. I took a few little puffs to try and get used to the smoke. Then I inhaled really big. Stupid...I started coughing and thought I was going to choke to death. But I did it a few more times and got used to it. Immendiately I started feeling lightheaded and dizzy. I stopped right there and put it out. My parents would be home any minute and I didn't want to be messed up in front of them. I got up but fell right back down into my chair. Eventually I was able to stand and tried walking. I stumbled and couldn't walk straight, like I was drunk. After many tries I finally got inside and went to bed. I had the worst nightmares I could imagine.<br><br>
A few days later my boyfriend was over and I wanted to smoke again and finish at least one whole cigg, just to see what it was like. W asked if I was sure because he knew I never really smoked before I said yes and so we both lit one up. I was sitting on my window sill, which is pretty high up and he was standing beside me on the floor. After about halfway through it I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded again..I told W to hold on to me because I had a feeling I was going to fall forward out of my window onto the ground. I barely finished the cigg and fell backwards into his arms and we both fell onto the floor. I felt really really hot and started sweating. I also had some nausea but it went away quicky. I tried to stand up but I couldn't. <br><br>
W picked me up and put me on my bed. I looked up at the ceiling and it was spinning. It was makin my head hurt so I shut my eyes. Then W said I was shaking,he sounded alarmed. I opened my eyes and looked at my arms. They were really shaking. I was like that for about 20 minutes, but I was still a little shaky and unstable for about another 30 minutes. W was a freaking out a little sayin he shouldn't have let me smoked. After he left I went to bed and again had nightmares.<br><br>
I have no clue why all that happened. I had never heard of anyone doing that. Maybe its because I'm small for my age. I'm 15, 4'11 and 80 pounds. I have been around 2nd hand smoke most of my life. To this day when I smoke I still get those symptoms and nightmares, just not as intense. I don't know if thats normal or what, no one I know that smokes ever had that.<!-- End Body -->
