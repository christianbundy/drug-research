 "report": "<p>On the night of this experience I ate some dark chocolate prior to dinner.  Because I am still not sleepy at 10pm, I decided to take 0.5 mg of Melatonin to help me fall asleep.  I think around 30 minutes I suddenly felt very fuzzy, and fell asleep soon after that.</p><p>I woke up around 3AM in the morning, and detected some unusual sensations immediately.  I felt very relaxed, and comfortable.  I could feel warm waves of gentle euphoria wash over me.  I was cuddly as well, wanting to hug someone close to me.  All this time I was sporting a semi-hard erection, but desire for sex was not very strong, just a desire for</p><p>a good hug.</p><p>These strong feelings subsided by around 5AM.  I woke up a bit later than usual because of this episode, but was not too groggy.  Needless to say, the whole experience was pleasant.</p>"
