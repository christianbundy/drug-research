I am bipolar, and my psychiatrist decided to put me on geodon, 100mg.  So I get home and take it.  About an hour later I felt extremely agitated and I could not stop moving.  I tried to take a warm bath to calm down, sat in it for about 5 minutes and then I had a strong urge to leave.  I would start smoking a cigarette, take a hit or two then put it out, and 10 minutes later I would do this again.  I also repeated trying to calm down in the bath, only to have to leave it after a few minutes.  So I decided to go to bed, which was difficult but eventually worked.<br><br>
The next afternoon, I took all of my medication as I usually do and went to work.  This turned out to be a mistake as, like the day before, the symptoms returned only this time about 100 times more intense and I had an overwhelming sense of doom.  So I talked to my boss and managed to get a ride down to the emergency room.<br><br>
After waiting for what seemed like an eternity I finally saw the doctor.  He recognized it immediately as akathisia and prescribed benadryl to be applied through an IV.  I was nervous with this because I experimented when I was younger with this stuff and it was never a good experience, and even low dosages of benadryl make me uncomfortable, but at this point I was willing to try anything.<br><br>
So after another eternity, the nurse finally comes in and gives it to me and BAM, it went away instantly.  The relief was so great that it was almost orgasmic.<br><br>
So now I am still on the geodon, but I take a 25mg benadryl everyday with no return of the akathisia.<!-- End Body -->
