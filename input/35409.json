 "report": "<p>I am a 19-year-old male student, experienced with alcohol, weed, ecstasy, DXM, but was yet to tinker with any members of the opiate family before this venture. My friend told me how easy (and cheap) it was to get hold of codeine so I researched it on the internet for a couple of hours and decided to give it a crack that night as I had nothing to do.</p><p></p><p>In Australia we are very spoiled with codeine compared with what I read it's like in America and many other parts of the world. I went down the local shops and bought, for $8 OTC, a box of Nurofen plus, which has 24 tablets containing 200 mg of Ibuprofen and 12.8 mg of codeine phosphate. I was told by a friend, and later confirmed with research on my favourite drug forum, that the codeine can be taken directly from these particular pills without needing to do the CWE. This sounds like bullshit I know, but I promise you it is not. For whatever reason, probably problems with combining the two drugs, the ibuprofen is on one side of the pill and the codeine on the other. You can take a sharp knife and using it along the LENGTH of the pill on the flat edge, you can split the pill into its two halves, i.e. a top view of the knife along pill would look like this:</p><p>\n</p><p> (------)</p><p>\n</p><p>One half has an 'N + ' pressed into it (the codeine-containing half) and the other is blank. If done properly you can clearly see they are two they are separate halves.</p><p>\n</p><p>I planned to take the pills after work that night (I worked 7 pm - 11 pm) so I cut 14 pills into halves before I left to save me rooting around later. Work was particularly tiring as I had had little sleep the previous night, so by the time I got home I was pretty buggered. I swallowed the pill halves in two separate mouthfuls, punctuated by swigs of soft drink at 11.20 pm (T + 0). I hadn't eaten since before work so the stomach was empty. Due to me fucking up the splitting of a few of the pills and getting slim N + sides I reckon it would have averaged out to about 11 full halves, i.e. 140 mg of codeine. I kicked back in front of the TV and waited for the onset of effects.</p><p>\n</p><p>(T + 0.5 hrs) I had been feeling a little strange for the last five or ten minutes - like something was different but I couldn't really put my finger on it, but had written it off as placebo. When I got up to grab a drink though and walked across the room though, I was noticeably lightheaded and my balance was maybe a little off. I decided that I would go lay in bed with the lights dimmed real low and listen to some music, as I thought this would help enhance the 'trip'.</p><p>\n</p><p>The music (Shpongle) was noticeably better, though not that much so, like it would be with some herbal assistance. I noticed after a short while that my face was quite flushed - like that hot kind of feeling. This was familiar as I tend to get this with most drugs, with DXM it was very pronounced. The effects were nice, but not very strong at all - about on par with a couple of cones (bowls). I experienced no euphoria or sense of contentment and was only as relaxed as I would expect to be while chilling out in bed listening to tunes. Also my body does not feel any heavier than usual when I try to move as some people reported.</p><p>\n</p><p>(T + 1.25) I wanted more of a ride than this so I get five more pills out, bust them in half, again I lose a bit due to shitty splitting - I estimate only about four full halves were obtained (52 mg). I chucked them down and for good measure I have a little cone. I emphasise 'little', as I once got impatient on my first DXM trip (550 mg) and had a cone to kick things inholy shit did that work a little better than expected! Anyway I head back to bed and lay down again. Shortly after, about ten minutes or so, I felt the first wave of euphoria roll over me and I grin a big goofy grin in anticipation. Disappointingly though, after two more similar waves in the next five minutes it never really eventuated.</p><p>\n</p><p>(T + 1.5) It gets a little hazy around here as I started to have what I think of as codeine dreams. It was quite weird, I'd be laying there and just kind of drift off into these dreams. In the same way that you never notice the point where you pass from wakefulness to sleep, I similarly never noticed the transition to the dreams. They were just like dreams you have when you are asleep, except I'd just kind of snap out of them and be awake again - like a daydream x 100. They were not very lucid at all - I would not really know I was dreaming until after I had 'woken up', although in one I was in a video game I had been playing earlier in the day and I knew I was in the midst of a codeine dream. I think with some experience, lucidity could be obtained. This continued till about (T + 2.5) when I assume I went into a dream and never came out, as I woke up the next morning with the music still going. I turned it off and went back to sleep till after 2 pm, about 12 hours sleep (not hugely unusual for me on the weekend) but I could easily have kept sleeping. That day I was a bit tired but nothing drastic and work was fine that night.</p><p>\n</p><p>Overall I was a bit disappointed as I had been hoping for the euphoria and contentment that many people report. Maybe I'm just hard to please :) or maybe I have a tolerance to opiates, I am reasonably tolerant to most drugswho knows. It is also worth noting that I didn't experience any nausea whatsoever, but perhaps a slight itch. I will try this again at 180 mg, taken all at once. I'll let you know how it goes. Peace.</p>\n"
