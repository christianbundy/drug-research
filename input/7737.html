After a six year hiatus from entheogens I had the opportunity to try some mushrooms.  A few weeks prior I was able to obtain some Banisteriopsis caapi (Harmine/Harmaline) in tablet form from an online distributor.  Since it had been six years and I had no idea how potent the shrooms were, I started by eating the smallest shroom in the bag.  Although it was less than 1g, the experience was deep and insightful, lasting about 4 hours.  From my previous shroom experiences I now knew these shrooms were very potent.<br><br>
After a few days I took the 2 x 250mg tabs of Banisteriopsis caapi by itself to familiarize myself with its effects - it was very pleasant and deeply relaxing with a mild nausea and vertigo.<br><br>
So a few days later I took 500mg of Banisteriopsis caapi and about 2 grams of shrooms.  Within 20 minutes I began to feel both deeply relaxed and at peace while my mind began a deep journey within.  After a timeless period, I awoke to my external surrounding realizing that this entire time I had been sitting in my chair at the computer.  I was deeply entwined with internal experience that I had lost touch with external reality completely. It was then that I slowly made my way to my bed to lie down and get under the covers.<br><br>
This combination is definitely not recreational and should be done in a safe and controlled setting, preferably with low light and a comfortable place to lie down.  The Banisteriopsis caapi puts me in such a deep state of relaxation - almost anesthetic - that an externalized trip would have had to been forced.  This combination really took me inside like I had never been before.  After years of reading about the Ayahuasca voyages, this is exactly what I had achieved with this combination.  The harmline's provide a deeply calming effect that allowed me to accept all the visions, especially the disturbing ones to be experienced with love and acceptance.  I felt as if my soul was being healed from the inside out.<br><br>
At times this 'healing' was very painful, harrowing and humbling.  But the really nice part is there seemed to be several breaks - I would go through a wrenching cleanse of a particular ego fixation, followed by a calm period of peaceful integration and back in again for more.  At one point I felt the pain and suffering of all of mother earth, and I wept for her, the pain we have caused her.  I felt that I was not only healing myself but my relationship to the planet, and deep felt symbiotic gratitude from Gaia for my reconciliation.<br><br>
Despite the depth of this experience I was most surprised at its short duration and quick recovery.  I dosed at 11:00am and was back at baseline by 3:30 fully refreshed.  I went out and grabbed a late lunch and felt a renewed sense of self and my relationship to everything.<br><br>
For me this was a great combination!  One I plan on experimenting with more.<br><br>
