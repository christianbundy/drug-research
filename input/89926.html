Subject 158lb male<br><br>
Ingested ~220mg MDAI concurrently with 5mg Ritalin.<br><br>
MDAI is dark brown &amp; plastic tasting. Smells very much like plastic/rubber when dissolved in water.<br><br>
Substance taken in water 2 hours after a full meal.<br><br>
('m1' is methylone)<br><br>
Alert within 20 mins. Feeling better but can't put my finger on why exactly. Nothing seems to have changed except my mood in a subtle but significant way. This quickly escalated into a very serene/calm feeling not unlike after an m1 peak. Things became quiet and lights looked more vibrant. Did not check if pupils were dilated or to what extent.<br><br>
At 40 mins I feel FANFUCKINTASTIC. I can't explain why. Drug feels very very clean. Feels very much like when SSRIs kick in. Rolled a small amount of weed with tobacco. Feels and tastes great but one part of me is wondering why I'm harming myself with tobacco. Its appeal is not as apparent as when sober or on stimulants. The nicotine rush is also not as pleasant, making me a bit uneasy but I can't explain why exactly. It could be due to the fact that I've been chewing nicotine gum all day.<br><br>
Took it while tired and still no energy present, actually with some somnolence developing when the MDAI kicked in. Feeling content doing work, dancing or just sitting around. Drug would be enhanced if taken upon waking up or after a nap.<br><br>
Constant farting, burping, yawning. No stomach discomfort or headaches whatsoever. No appetite suppression. Friend who ingested same amount had the same symptoms. Also felt very chilly/cold but cannot tell whether this is the MDAI. M1 does this to me as does weed/jwh.<br><br>
After about 90 minutes noticed I became very engrossed in what I was doing and found myself being very detail oriented. Classic ritalin effects there.<br><br>
Tobacco and JWH (73 and 18) feel great but leave me feeling stoned. Couch locked, especially the nicotine rush.<br><br>
Very chatty and upbeat. Music and touch are enhanced but there is slight music-ADD. Constantly changing the song. Time seemed to go by quicker than usual as well.<br><br>
As far as sex, I'm not sure I can keep it up in this state of mind? I can definitely get it up, but I may get distracted and see it shrivel up or get softer. I feel like I wouldn't be able to cum easily (much like methylone does on its own or SSRIs on their own. Could of been the ritalin/m1 here but considering that MDAI effects serotonin it plays a role here too.) Wish we had girls or any other friends over.. but not for anything intimate. Just a strong desire to connect with people, especially those who are hurt or seem discomforted or bothered by something. Classic m1.. attempt to invite a dozen girls/guys ALL result in no replies with 'who the fuck texts/calls at 5 AM?!' replies the day after heh.<br><br>
At the 2-3 hour mark snorted 50mg methylone. Within 20 mins I'm clenching and have dry mouth. Mood and energy are rising significantly. At the 4 hour mark I'm afraid of the m1 crash which doesn't come (though I'm not very susceptible to it at that dose.)<br><br>
Snorted 75mg methylone again at the 5-6 hour mark with another increase in mood and confidence but short term memory is impaired slightly, but likely due to the weed and ritalin. Friend did a line and I followed suit. I had no strong desire to dose anything but also no regret or concern with dosing either.<br><br>
Went out for a walk. Chilly but very pleasant and serene. No visuals but colors are vibrant, things are shiny, and the world looks like I'm on 1.5g of mushrooms (the vibrant colors were apparent before the m1 was insufflated however.) Does the world always look like this?<br><br>
Effects lasted about 6 hours with no major comedown. Just a stronger desire to lay down/sleep but I can't stress how 'clean' the high felt. If you've taken Celexa or Zoloft for 3-4 months it's very similar to when you wake up one day, take your med and suddenly realize that you just feel great. The yawning, somnolence, very significant mood lift and anxiolysis are quite similar to my experience with SSRIs. I can't emphasize the similarity enough. I also can't emphasize how 'clean' the drug feels. There are people that feel like this everyday? No anxiety? Seriously? Not fair.<br><br>
Instantly fell in love with this drug at the 1hr mark. I'm sensitive to serotonin-releasing agents or reuptake inhibitors and this made me feel whole, healthy, clean, happy, too happy, too normal and feeling as though this is the only drug I need. I felt that way with m1 but this is different.I felt sober, as if I've been taking a drug called anxiety my entire life, fantastic. <br><br>
I like the fact that MDAI does not interfere with sleep and has no speediness to it. I can see why combining this with m1 or adderall or ritalin would feel like rolling. It does. At higher doses or m1/ritalin I can see myself rolling face but will keep away due to the (probably negligible) neurotoxicity.<br><br>
Confidence and mood are through the roof. Diuretic effects present since the m1 was ingested. m1 definitely causes this but at this point I don't know if it's the m1 or MDAI making me want to pee. The urge happens suddenly and without warning, with no trouble using the bathroom. No trouble doing much of anything.<br><br>
Next day: Feeling just as good as the day before but with somnolence and yawning throughout the day. No crash whatsoever, no harsh comedown, non-neurotoxic. This drug should be legal and would make an excellent replacement for alcohol. The mood lift I get from being tipsy minus every negative thing alcohol does along with +empathy and a strong anxiolytic effect.<br><br>
When it was kicking in, I had the idea that MDAI should be prescribed for the first 3 weeks with SSRI therapy, until the SSRI kicks in and begins to overshadow (and block) the MDAI.<br><br>
This and m1 (either alone or both together) are probably the best tools for enhancing social interaction and overcoming social anxiety. Glad the high doesn't wear off as quickly as m1 on its own.<br><br>
Going to order 500g. They banned JWH today.. stock up on MDAI and M1 while you can folks.<br><br>
I can't see how people can hate this substance. It's definitely something I'd want to keep in my drug arsenal. The drug is recreational but more therapeutic and situational than m1/mdma. Situational meaning it has a lot of uses (i.e., job interview, social gathering, dating, PUA, and in any situation I'd want to diminish anxiety) Drug would probably be great for thrill sports and passive activities like fishing.<br><br>
Purity? As far as I know, there's no such thing as white or gold MDAI. Those with bad reports about the drug who are ingesting something with no taste and without the dark coca-powder brown color may not be ingesting MDAI at all. I trust my vendor from all my prior experience with him.<!-- End Body -->
