The other night I decided to try blue lotus after searching through reports about that at many other things. Blue lotus stood out because it was described to me as having pot-like or opiate-like effects but more mild. What I had ordered was dried blue lotus, which looked like mostly the petals and the leaves from the plant. So I loaded a bowl with some pot on the bottom and the blue lotus on the top.<br><br>
I did get opiate like effects which I believe were from the blue lotus because the smoke didnt smell anything like pot (I only took 2 hits to sortof try it out). The taste reminded me a little of herbal cigarettes. Every thing was fine until about 30 minutes after my first hit when I got a strange hot flash though my friend I was with said I didn't look flush. After that subsided after about 5 minutes my legs were jittery but not much else.<br><br>
It's possible there was an interaction between the blue lotus and my anti depressants (I currently take prozac) because I haven't read any reports about blue lotus with negative side effects.<!-- End Body -->
