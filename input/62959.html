During my sophomore year of college was when I really became a heroin addict.  At first I started out snorting lines and eventually I went to shooting up.  Well, I did this for a while and being in college I eventually decided that it was in my best interest to stop my addiction.  I did the whole dope-sick, craving, shaking, puking thing... it wasn't fun.. AT ALL.<br><br>
Fast forward to my junior year.  I was walking downtown one day and unfortunately enough, the safe-needle clinic was right across from where I get my birth control pills.  Well, I ran into a guy who used to run with a few junkies I knew and (once a junkie, always a junkie) I asked him where I could score a few good bags.  He walked with me down the street and I picked up a couple of bags of pure, brown heroin.  I had some syringes left from when I used to shoot, so just feeling bored I went back to my dorm room to have some long lost fun.<br><br>
I did the usual.  Took an alcohol pad out, wiped off the syringe and the vein on my left arm.  Opened the bag and tapped about 3/4 of the bag of heroin into my little metal cup.  I used to do a lot, so I thought I was being safe with only 3/4 of a bag.  I squeezed a bit of water into the cup and mashed it up with the end of the syringe.  I dropped my little cotton into the solution and watched with anticipation as it puffed up with the heroin mixture.  I slipped the tip of my syringe into the cotton and pulled the brown, sweet concoction into my syringe.  I pulled my elastic around my left arm, feeling for that vein that would soon be the recipient of my forbidden love that I had long ago professed never to do again.  I slid the needle into my vein, pulled back to get the blood in there to know that I had registered.  And then... pushed.<br><br>
All of a sudden I knew I had done too much.  OH SHIT!!! I said.  And then...<br><br>
I woke up on the floor.  I couldn't breathe and my pants were wet.  I had pissed myself.  The reason I couldn't breathe was the blood in my nose and throat, presumable from falling out of my chair and onto the wooden floor when the heroin knocked me out.<br><br>
I knew I had ODed and I crawled into bed crying because I knew that I couldn't call anyone without getting into trouble.  I was high too, so I didn't even want to get out of bed but the whole time I thought I was going to die.  My heart was beating slow and while I knew that eventually, it was going to be ok, it was then that I knew that I actually did have to stop and if I ever did heroin again I needed to be more careful.<!-- End Body -->
