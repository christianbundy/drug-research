 "report": "<p>Let me explain myself. A close friend of mine used to sell me his Ritalin and Adderall pills for recreational use. Whenever he used to give them to me he'd give me another pill that he said would take away the speedy feeling and make me tired. I asked him what it was and he said it was called Melatonin. Personally, I had sleeping problems. I went to and bought a bottle of them for roughly five dollars, I can't remember.</p><p>Anyway, I started taking them every few nights, and then every night weening myself onto them to help my sleep patterns. They helped my sleep patterns dramatically, although there were some strange side effects.</p><p>Firstly, say one night I accidenally woke up at 4am (with Melatonin in my system) and I had to use the bathroom. For the next several nights I'd keep waking up at the exact same time and would have to use the bathroom. When Melatonin sees a pattern in my sleep, it grabs hold of it and doesn't let go.</p><p>Secondly, the most noticeable change, is the dreams. Wow, dreams have never been so amazing. I noticed that after a few times of taking Melatonin that I'd have these strange and intense dreams, and then wake up in the morning and remember every single detail from them. I could just take out a pen and paper and literally write down the entire dream.</p>"
