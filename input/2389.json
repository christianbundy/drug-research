 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, nobody has tried this yet, so...<br>8:50PM<br>------<br>        I weigh out 6mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, chop it up into fine powder, and<br>divide it into two lines of approximately 3mg each. I divide each of these<br>in 2 again.<br>8:53PM<br>------<br>        1.5mg up one nostril, 1.5 up the other! The smell/taste is similar<br>to DPT - or any other tryptamine for that matter. I'm glad that 5-MeO-DIPT<br>has a very low dosage range... it would not be pleasant to insufflate<br>large quantities of this. I have an immediate sense that 'something' is<br>coming, but the effects are not instantaneous.<br>8:58PM<br>------<br>        Yuck! The drip from this stuff tastes very bad, and also is giving<br>a very uncomfortable burning sensation in the back of my throat. Neither<br>saline nasal spray nor drinking seems to help. I guess I just need to wait<br>it out.<br>9:05PM<br>------<br>        I am beginning to feel a tryptamine lift, and the bitter burning<br>taste in my throat is subsiding.<br>9:20PM<br>------<br>        The taste in my throat has cleared up, and I'm definately feeling<br>the effects now. At this point, its still fairly mild, and feels like what<br>I would expect from the same ammount done orally. I wonder if it will<br>build any more, or if I should do some more? I decide its best to wait<br>another 10 minutes or so, just in case.<br>9:30PM<br>------<br>        I'm feeling a rather good effect. I seem to have reached a plateau<br>now. It feels slightly stronger than this dose would orally - but not by<br>much. I feel warm, trippy, and happy. I have very mild visual enhancement<br>(bright colors etc), like I would expect from a low oral dose of<br>5-MeO-DIPT. The time it took from insufflation to peak effect was roughly<br>25-30 minutes. I think a little more will do nicely. 2 lines of 1.5mg each<br>are still on the plate, I think one of them is in order - if not both...<br>9:40PM<br>------<br>        I insufflate one of the 1.5mg lines.<br>9:50PM<br>------<br>        Fuck it. Up with the other 1.5mg!<br>10:02PM<br>-------<br>        This route seems to be about co-effective with oral. Same dosage<br>range (though maybe insufflated is SLIGHTLY more efficient). Similar<br>subjective effects, although this seems a little more energetic, and it<br>hit alot faster. The neck tension and jaw clench seems a little less<br>prominent. There is no trace of stomach discomfort. This is a very clean<br>experience compared to my oral experiments with 5-MeO-DIPT. This is an<br>exceedingly comfortable place. This feels like wrapping up in a warm fuzzy<br>blanket in front of a fire on a winter night.<br>10:32PM<br>-------<br>        Ahhh... very nice. The last few lines are fully kicked in. I am at<br>a very solid +2. Warmth, a nice tryptamine body high, a relaxed and mellow<br>mindset. Some mild visual enhancements and perhaps even hits of OEVs<br>scurrying past the corners of my eyes. I feel like going to lay down and<br>relax and think for a while.<br>11:00PM<br>-------<br>        Wow. Laying on my couch and listening to my fan was amazing. A<br>timeless sense of relaxation and bliss. Thinking contentedly about life.<br>Everything is good. I feel very introspective, in a warm fuzzy way. Again,<br>the sensation is similar to the coming down phase of a very good LSD trip.<br>I do feel that I am lower down now than I was a half hour ago, however. A<br>few quick tokes of cannabis, then off to lay down for a few more minutes.<br>11:11PM<br>-------<br>        I'm unable to return to that warm, floaty place. I seem to be<br>coming down a good deal now. I am still quite high but the mental effects<br>are now taking a back seat to the purely physical sensation of<br>tryptamineness. The bright colors are still very prominent. But the peak<br>effects are beginning to subside. I feel I've still got a long glide down.<br>11:50PM<br>-------<br>        I'm a little lower than I was. Its very hard to judge how far you<br>have come with this substance. Its very difficult to tell if I'm feeling<br>less effect than a half hour ago, or to tell what effects have dissipated.<br>But I know that I am alot further towards baseline than I was a half hour<br>ago, nevertheless. I did notice a sort of laxative effect just now - an<br>increase in peristalsis, rather. Perhaps the stomach effects of oral doses<br>are not just because of chemical irritation of the stomach or intestine,<br>but also due to some sort of neurological process? Perhaps it is<br>interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain stem. Its a non-issue<br>though. There was no discomfort whatsoever. This was a far cleaner<br>experience than oral... except for the bad tasting drip. I think I will be<br>using this route more than the oral route, despite my usual aversion to<br>snorting things. Its just a cleaner trip this way.<br>12:30AM<br>-------<br>        I'm pretty far down now. Could probably sleep without too much<br>effort now. This experiment exceeded my expectations quite a bit.\n\n\n"
