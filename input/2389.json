 "report": "<p>\nWell, nobody has tried this yet, so...</p><p>8:50PM</p><p>------</p><p>        I weigh out 6mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, chop it up into fine powder, and</p><p>divide it into two lines of approximately 3mg each. I divide each of these</p><p>in 2 again.</p><p>8:53PM</p><p>------</p><p>        1.5mg up one nostril, 1.5 up the other! The smell/taste is similar</p><p>to DPT - or any other tryptamine for that matter. I'm glad that 5-MeO-DIPT</p><p>has a very low dosage range... it would not be pleasant to insufflate</p><p>large quantities of this. I have an immediate sense that 'something' is</p><p>coming, but the effects are not instantaneous.</p><p>8:58PM</p><p>------</p><p>        Yuck! The drip from this stuff tastes very bad, and also is giving</p><p>a very uncomfortable burning sensation in the back of my throat. Neither</p><p>saline nasal spray nor drinking seems to help. I guess I just need to wait</p><p>it out.</p><p>9:05PM</p><p>------</p><p>        I am beginning to feel a tryptamine lift, and the bitter burning</p><p>taste in my throat is subsiding.</p><p>9:20PM</p><p>------</p><p>        The taste in my throat has cleared up, and I'm definately feeling</p><p>the effects now. At this point, its still fairly mild, and feels like what</p><p>I would expect from the same ammount done orally. I wonder if it will</p><p>build any more, or if I should do some more? I decide its best to wait</p><p>another 10 minutes or so, just in case.</p><p>9:30PM</p><p>------</p><p>        I'm feeling a rather good effect. I seem to have reached a plateau</p><p>now. It feels slightly stronger than this dose would orally - but not by</p><p>much. I feel warm, trippy, and happy. I have very mild visual enhancement</p><p>(bright colors etc), like I would expect from a low oral dose of</p><p>5-MeO-DIPT. The time it took from insufflation to peak effect was roughly</p><p>25-30 minutes. I think a little more will do nicely. 2 lines of 1.5mg each</p><p>are still on the plate, I think one of them is in order - if not both...</p><p>9:40PM</p><p>------</p><p>        I insufflate one of the 1.5mg lines.</p><p>9:50PM</p><p>------</p><p>        Fuck it. Up with the other 1.5mg!</p><p>10:02PM</p><p>-------</p><p>        This route seems to be about co-effective with oral. Same dosage</p><p>range (though maybe insufflated is SLIGHTLY more efficient). Similar</p><p>subjective effects, although this seems a little more energetic, and it</p><p>hit alot faster. The neck tension and jaw clench seems a little less</p><p>prominent. There is no trace of stomach discomfort. This is a very clean</p><p>experience compared to my oral experiments with 5-MeO-DIPT. This is an</p><p>exceedingly comfortable place. This feels like wrapping up in a warm fuzzy</p><p>blanket in front of a fire on a winter night.</p><p>10:32PM</p><p>-------</p><p>        Ahhh... very nice. The last few lines are fully kicked in. I am at</p><p>a very solid +2. Warmth, a nice tryptamine body high, a relaxed and mellow</p><p>mindset. Some mild visual enhancements and perhaps even hits of OEVs</p><p>scurrying past the corners of my eyes. I feel like going to lay down and</p><p>relax and think for a while.</p><p>11:00PM</p><p>-------</p><p>        Wow. Laying on my couch and listening to my fan was amazing. A</p><p>timeless sense of relaxation and bliss. Thinking contentedly about life.</p><p>Everything is good. I feel very introspective, in a warm fuzzy way. Again,</p><p>the sensation is similar to the coming down phase of a very good LSD trip.</p><p>I do feel that I am lower down now than I was a half hour ago, however. A</p><p>few quick tokes of cannabis, then off to lay down for a few more minutes.</p><p>11:11PM</p><p>-------</p><p>        I'm unable to return to that warm, floaty place. I seem to be</p><p>coming down a good deal now. I am still quite high but the mental effects</p><p>are now taking a back seat to the purely physical sensation of</p><p>tryptamineness. The bright colors are still very prominent. But the peak</p><p>effects are beginning to subside. I feel I've still got a long glide down.</p><p>11:50PM</p><p>-------</p><p>        I'm a little lower than I was. Its very hard to judge how far you</p><p>have come with this substance. Its very difficult to tell if I'm feeling</p><p>less effect than a half hour ago, or to tell what effects have dissipated.</p><p>But I know that I am alot further towards baseline than I was a half hour</p><p>ago, nevertheless. I did notice a sort of laxative effect just now - an</p><p>increase in peristalsis, rather. Perhaps the stomach effects of oral doses</p><p>are not just because of chemical irritation of the stomach or intestine,</p><p>but also due to some sort of neurological process? Perhaps it is</p><p>interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain stem. Its a non-issue</p><p>though. There was no discomfort whatsoever. This was a far cleaner</p><p>experience than oral... except for the bad tasting drip. I think I will be</p><p>using this route more than the oral route, despite my usual aversion to</p><p>snorting things. Its just a cleaner trip this way.</p><p>12:30AM</p><p>-------</p><p>        I'm pretty far down now. Could probably sleep without too much</p><p>effort now. This experiment exceeded my expectations quite a bit.</p>"
