This was my first experience with either voacagna or salvia. I received the seeds quite by accident; they were included with my salvia 5x order. Or perhaps, it wasn't an accident at all! :)<br><br>
I'm 52 years old, have tripped a number of times over the years, previous experience with peyote, psylocybin, LSD, ex, ritalin, dextromethorphan, cannabis, and a few others. This was by far the strongest psychedelic experience I've ever had. I will be careful recommending this to anyone as it seems to have the potential to really unhinge some critical psychology.<br><br>
The voacagna seeds are neat! I like the effect they have a lot, smooth, mellow, a nice stimulated visual accuity, a bit like very mild mescaline. I just chewed them up, held the pulp in my mouth and swallowed them after a a few minutes. Like chewing on little bits of wood. It took a while, maybe a half hour to start feeling the effects of the seeds. I purposely held off on smoking any cannabis, to get a better sense of what the voacagna would do. I had researched the available literature, so had a sense of what to expect, pharmacology, and possible side effects.<br><br>
After a few hours I decided to try the salvia. I put a little tiny budlet of pot in the bong-bowl first to keep the salvia powder from falling through too soon. I'd read that the boiling point for Salvorin A was over 400F so I held the flame close and hit the bong hard. It has a smallish bowl, so there wasn't a lot of stuff in it. I thought it tasted nice, a little like some fresh opium I had made last spring, though more woody. Not having a clue what to expect, I waited for a little tingle or something to signal the onset of whatever was going to happen.<br><br>
It was like a switch turned on. It happened so fast, it was disorienting. I was quite suddenly aware that the carpet had become much more 3-D and that the pattern was flowing like lava. The colors became exaggerated versions of their true selves. I quickly realized the chemicals were having a hey-day with my senses and just relaxed and watched and felt in total amazement. I have a lot of visually interesting stuff around; lighting, art, furniture. And all of it was alive and moving. All this accompanied by a buzzing/tingling sensation in my face and hands.<br><br>
Visually, it was very mescaline-like, insanely exaggerated colors, especially reds, greens, and yellows, though these were not at all the only ones. Emotionally, I felt very odd, almost a sort of ancient feeling, as visually 'primal' as the scene was, so were my emotions, it seemed. I have never felt that way before, yet somehow, it felt familiar. I wasn't afraid at all. It was incredible. I started laughing and going 'Oh my God, this stuff is legal?!?!' <br><br>
I couldn't walk or didn't think I should, so I crawled across my bed to get a look out the window. It was at this point that I started to come down and reality re-gelled. All in all, about 5 minutes had passed. I was still laughing with incredulity at the absurd effects I'd just experienced.<br><br>
About an hour later, I tried it again. Same basic routine. Same nearly instant effect only this time, the room and everything in it turned into what I can only describe as billions of 'Chicklets'. Little shiney flat bead-like molecules of vision, all moving and all brightly colored. It's like whatever allows me to experience gradients in color and other sensations, goes wacky and everything becomes posterized. Even tactile sensations become posterized which is a very odd sensation indeed! But it's 3-D (and maybe even 4-D, time became really odd), so it's like Legos rather than flat pixels. It felt like I was being gently hit in the face with millions of 'beans' and I could hear them all rattling softly as they did. It felt like molecular wind. I think maybe I must process sensation at successively finer levels of detail. I am typically only aware of the finest levels (they are my normal level of resoultion). But salvia feels like it steps me down into a lower level of abstraction that has much less detail, both visually and tactilly, and maybe even emotionally.<br><br>
I also felt like I was tipping over to my right side, sort of twisting around. I had to hold on to my chair as I felt like I would fall out of it. Again, after five minutes or so, it was basically over.<br><br>
I felt exhausted and took a little nap. Woke up hungry for something salty (did this stuff tip my ionic balance? Can sure imagine it might after so much intensity!). No lasting effects or lethargy. Maybe a little spent-feeling. I was able to sleep well all night.<br><br>
I will not be doing salvia again. It was amazing, it was exhilarating even, but it was just too intense to do more than a couple times. I'll save this level of amazement for the next cycle in my existance! The voacagna seeds are swell, and I will certainly be using them again.<!-- End Body -->
