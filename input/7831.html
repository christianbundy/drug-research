After skimming through the erowid site for a good hour I came upon the experiences people had from smoking mushrooms.  The only time I had smoked mushrooms was when I was younger, at my friends house.  I didn't know what the effects were because i had already taken four or five grams of stropharia cubensis oraly earlier so it was hard to differentiate between the effects of the two methods. <br><br>
This made me curious as to if there were actually psychadelic effects from smoking mushrooms.  When I was done reading the entries I decided to break out my bag of mushrooms I had picked a few days earlier while camping in the interior of British Columbia.  I broke up a dried cap into my pipe and smoked it, still inhaling after the cherry was out to ensure I was getting everything including the spores.  I didn't expect much because of the small dosage but I soon realized that smoking mushrooms does in fact, have effects.  Not strong enough to be classified as tripping, but after about 5 minutes I was feeling a disorienting body stone.  <br><br>
It didn't last long but was entertaining acheiving this different high.  Much like stepping onto land after being on a boat for the past six months.<!-- End Body -->
