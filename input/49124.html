One day, after school, a friend of mine offered to give me some Betel Nut.  I'm from an island wherein chewing betel nut is a daily occurrence, and I was wondering why it was so popular, so I figured I'd try it.  <br><br>
He prepared the nut by cracking it open, scooping out the red mush that was inside it, adding lime and tobacco to it, and then wrapping it in a peppery leaf.<br><br>
I chewed it.  Within 10 minutes, my head felt incredibly light.  I got up, and walked around feeling like I was very, very light.  I spit the nut out soon after I began feeling these effects.  What followed, then, was an intense feeling of vertigo.  I got very hot and began to sweat.  I lay down on a bench in an effort to suppress an urge to vomit.  I lay down for about half an hour, feeling very ill. Then, I got up to walk home, and immediately puked up lunch.  <br>
I took a nap afterwards, and felt fine.  The taste of the leaf stayed with me for a couple of days, sometimes resulting in a fresh wave of nausea.<br><br>
A few friends of mine have had similar, nauseating first time experiences.<!-- End Body -->
