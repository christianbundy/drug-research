Set/Setting: After work, tired and needing a psychic lift, somewhat wary following the Ethylone (E1) experience one week ago, writing work to be done, drizzly Melbourne winter rain outside, partner home as is the cat, decidedly non-psychedelic the both of them, tomorrow is a low stress work day, so indulgence for the sake of scientific curiosity, of course, is in order. <br><br>
Plus, cluster headache shadow  tis the season, so anything to stave off the forthcoming attacks of pain, the Beast, which is much like a jagged serrated spike of searing metal-bone pushed back and forth through the left eye, through the hypothalamus to the back of the head, while being repeatedly broken in the process. Broken bones are nothing in comparison, pain-wise, Ive had a few. Those with clusters will know what I am on about. <br><br>
T+0:00 150mg Butylone (B1) taken on an empty stomach, 10 hours following the standard low-key nootropic regimen of piracetam, ginseng, caffeine, l-phenylalanine. <br><br>
T+0:20 First alerts. Thankfully, no cathinone flavoured burps. A quick walk to the video store, smile on my chops, random interaction is easy, Dune for the comedown. <br><br>
T+0:45 This material feels lighter on the body than E1 and the empathogenic component is certainly present. Warmth beginning to radiate from the heart chakra, spreading smoothly to envelop the whole body. Made a rasta salad  a 50/50 mix of local indoor sat/indi and outdoor indi/sat, a tad bit of ultralight tobacco thrown in for good measure, sampled same to good effect.<br>
Music  put on some new Toi Doi and was violently shocked into an immediate shift to Sounds from the Ground  Terra Firma, not too fast, not too slow, just about right. Much less cardiovascular push than E1 at same dose. Some jaw twitching  not clenching. No anxiety, coordination seems untouched if not slightly improved, and spirits lifted to an appropriate level for a workday. <br><br>
T+1:20 As this seems to be the peak and Im not quite there, 42mg B1 and 26mg Methylone (M1) is swallowed in a gelcap. No desire to drink the delicious Grolsch chilling in the fridge, but herbal tea, hot, red, sour, sweetened with honey, is delightful. <br><br>
Unlike E1, there was no MDA cloak. There is some hullabaloo about the definition of the stoning effect attributed to MDA and MBDB and in my case, certainly to E1. This feeling to me is akin to laying on my back and having an invisible futon drop on me, like a reverse faceplant. The futons center of gravity is on the chest, it tentacles to the upper back and shoulders, with a hooplike extension around the head. This is accompanied by a desire to just lay there, drugged, heavy, no volition to effect will to power, which last for some time, if not through the whole experience. <br><br>
Happily, none of this is found with B1, plenty of motivation and easy energy to channel into productive task completion. <br><br>
T+2:00 Music  Squarepusher, Ultravisitor. The open, euphoric state is maintained, but now there is more peripheral effects, heart rate 120BPM; seems normal if not slightly decreased. Some increase in body temp, this after some strenuous, albeit brief physical activity  a 20 minute deep tissue massage for the Soulmate. <br><br>
No desire to eat, more B1 is wanted now, but I am well aware of the tail end stimulant effects of the methcathinones and decide to ignore the compulsion. <br><br>
T+3:00 Some insignificant loss of associative memory noted the peak, but since Im talking bollocks with the Soulmate, it is unnoticed. Content to lay there and be moved by Shpongle  Nothing Lasts But Nothing Is Lost. No more need be said about optimisation of the audio immersion environment as it has been achieved. <br><br>
Music is enhanced to the same extent, if not more than by M1. With the eyes closed, there are gently pulsating fields, tapestries of softly shifting coral colour (for those that SCUBA), although these are not laden with meaning and only vaguely symbolic. As such, they are dismissed quick-smart for open eyed enjoyment, writing this report seemed proper for awhile as the partner is too tired for any soulsearching. <br><br>
T+4:45 the Soulmate is asleep, Matt Coldrick and Matt Hillier  Elemental Journey is softly on the audio. This seems to be the perfect time to replenish on a certain neurotransmitter known as DMT. <br><br>
Several grains of the orange gooey sacrament are loaded on top of a rasta salad cone, inhaled, held, let out, breath deep, lie down flat on back as to better attune. 30 seconds later, the visuals descend. With this Australian acacia extract, even at the sub-breakthrough ~15mg dose, there is a distinct natural and organic vibe to the CEVs, greenish-brownish golden fields of trees in a subtropical rainforest surround, breathing gently. <br><br>
There is no threat but a pressure on the top of my skull, the astral body feels the pull and wants to take off, B1 holds the ego in place, I focus the body on breathing and the mind on passing through the forest, which is at this point an impenetrable curtain, but the leaves contain intricate, living informational structures in constant interaction, visible as a multicoloured strand that appears to be incredibly information-dense and permeating virtually everything. Not DNA, something denser, tighter, superstring? All visual phenomena perfectly synaesthetic with the selected music, the Coldrick and Hillier a first listen and a very pleasant surprise. <br><br>
T+5:00 I am back as the visuals fade in a somewhat teasing manner, the shakiness of the B1 is gone, anxiolytic DMT does it every time. Now Grolsch is hitting the spot, tried watching Dune, realised it will be too protracted. Some more cones to take the edge off the still present stimulation, a bit of the internet. <br><br>
T+6:00 1mg alprazolam taken since its a workday and quality sleep is a must. There will be no cluster headache tonight, sleep hoped for T+7:00. <br><br>
Summary: Butylone was a worthwhile excursion on the version, and compared with Methylone and Ethylone, the clear winner for me, with its short duration, strong empathogenic properties, mind opening qualities, pleasurable somatic sensations, little cognitive distortion, and minimal side effects. The Butylone hangover was reminiscent of Methylone / Ethylone, some serotonin / chi depletion felt day after, less day after that.<br><br>
Butylone is indeed quite an improvement over MBDB. As opposed to Ethylone, which is a step down from MDEA. Who would have figured? Parts ain't parts. Of course, YMMV.<!-- End Body -->
