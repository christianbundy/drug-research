 "report": "<p>Bud dried past its prime is a fact of life for a lot of people.  Buds that break up into dust are undesirable to me, therefore I have adopted the following procedure:</p><p>Somewhere in the 3-18 hour period prior to smoking extremly dry cannibus, I wrap each .5g or so in a single leaf and let it sit for 90-180 minutes.  Then, depending on the consistany of the bud after this, I either remove the leaf entirely, or leave it in the bottom of the bag until it's smoked.  The result is mj that shreds much better for any means of smoking.  If fresh marijuana leaves are not available, the same effect can be achieved with lettuce, but this destroys whatever aroma the pot may have and makes it smell unpleasant and taste extremely bland.  Other herbal plants can be substituted to various taste (and effect).</p>"
