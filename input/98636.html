Sorry for my bad english. Hope you'll get my meanings tho!<br><br>
At that time I didn't use anything else than cannabis, tho I started to experience different drugs, like MDMA, LSD, amphethamine etc.. Now I've tried soo many different drugs and appreciate them more, after this one intense experience! :D<br><br>
So, one of my bf's friends came to us and told that he had something strong and <br>
good blotters, and because I tried LSD the first time just a week before this and I liked it, we decided to try this one too. First, he said that it was LSD what has a mescaline on it, and I was really excited. I took a half of the blotter, so did everyone else too. <br><br>
After an half hour, because I didn't feel the effects and now I don't remember how <br>
did it even taste, we decided to take another half and placed it under our tongue.<br><br>
THEN he said, that it takes more time than usually to feel the effects, and some of<br>
people called it 'bromo-dragonfly'. So I did my research at the internet, and noticed that it wasn't mescaline, it wasn't even LSD. I got a bit scared, but at the same time more excited. I remember one thing he said before the trip: 'don't fall asleep, it's the most important'.<br><br>
After like 3 hours, we all started to feel the effects. I don't remember maybe correctly because the whole trip were so strong and intense, but I do remember that I was laying on the bed, while others watching a movie. I tried to open my eyes, but it seemed so hard to keep them open so I had the most coolest closed-eye-visuals. Sounds of the movie came to my trip and at the same time my friends kept pushing me to keep my eyes open and not to fall asleep. I remember that my bf was really scared for me, and I remember when I said something like 'I don't care if I die, I feel so good. So let me keep my eyes closed'. They didn't let me. <br><br>
Time passes by, and after maybe +5 hours I started to come back from the rush, I was able to keep my eyes open again. But I kept 'falling' in the closed-eye-visuals over and over again, while my bf panicing about me and how I'm doing. Now I'm grateful that they kept talking to me and keeping me awake. <br><br>
I don't really remember even 1/3 of the trip, it lasted like 72 hours. There were good things, and actually just 2 bad things;<br><br>
1. 2'nd day, one of our friends came from the bar to say hello to us. I was in my bed, just watching, while others talking. Suddenly, I had this weird thought, 'I'm going crazy, all these people are crazy, soon they'll kill me!!!!'. It lasted 5sec, then I got back and relaxed.<br><br>
2. 3'rd day, it was morning, everyone else was asleep, me still awake and trying to sleep. I was so close to fall asleep, but then I heard a BIG snap in my head, and got scared for my brains! I got up, and noticed that I'm 100% sober, the trip were over. I got to the bathroom ( it was hard to even walk on the whole trip, so this was like 2'nd time in the bathroom for 3 days), looked myself on the mirror, and notices that my right pupil was reaaally big and left one normal. Or maybe I was still tripping and thought so... <br>
So I went to the kitchen to take a glass of water, and when I turned to the window, I saw snow everywhere, but it was all red and shiny. I got near the window and sat there like 20minutes tho I believed I was in there for 2 minutes.. <br><br>
Then I realized that I'm still tripping badly and I need to get to the bed before my legs starts to feel too heavy to move again.<br><br>
I don't really remember that much of the trip, but it was reaaally good, without the guys with me in there, it would have been on a really bad trip, but they were all so kind and I felt the love and thoughts between us just by looking in someone's eyes, I had the most coolest trip ever, and still thinking that way.. Even tho I'll never try BDFL again. I could just imagine how that ends to a bad trip, and 'cause it lasts 3 days ( or those blotters do), it's not a toy to play with, and could be hard to get back to the right road again.<br><br>
AND I don't know what would have happen, if they wouldn't keep me awake while the biggest rush were on. In one time, I remember that every closed-eye-visuals got away, and it placed with darkness, and nothing. Then someone slapped me and I got back. I don't know if I was near to passing out or not, but I felt like I was. <br><br>
Yup, be careful what you take, and how much.<!-- End Body -->
