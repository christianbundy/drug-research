I've taken a whole lot of drugs, the only ones that would pertain to this trip report would be 6-APB, stims like methylphenidate and adderal, cocaine and dozens of $5 street ecstasy pills ranging from good to real shitty. I've had my share of 'rolls', just never had real MDMA. <br><br>
I ordered a gram and a half of 4-MEC for $15. I knew it wasn't going to be the best 'alternative to ecstasy' but I really wanted drugs and I was broke as shit so I settled for some 4 methylethcathinone. I read up on it for a few days, heard good shit and bad shit. Mostly bad but I figured as long as it was more than just a stimulant (having additional 'ecstasy qualities) then I would probably enjoy it. I understood that it felt like somewhere in between MDMA and cocaine and had a pretty short duration. It was supposed to burn a lot upon insufflation (which sucks because it's such a convenient ROA)...and that's about all I knew about it.<br><br>
Picked it up from my local UPS store (which BTW is what I always do when ordering anything suspicious online, never have things sent directly to my house), took it home and opened it almost immediately. It was ever so slightly off white crystally in appearance. Shards were like sea salt but more rectangular rather than square. Pretty easy to crush up with a credit card. <br><br>
T+0:00 I measured out ~50mg and snorted it up my left nostril. Pretty bad burn but nothing I hadn't felt before. I felt effects withing 10 minutes, slight mood lift and I could tell my consciousness was slightly different in general. Not enough.<br><br>
T+45:00 Snorted 100mg up left nostril. 5 seconds pass and and incredible burning pain goes all through my nose and the left side of my brain. I later realized the pain was so bad because the left nostril is the one I use to snort most all my drugs since it's usually more clear than the right one. After 10-15 minutes the high was very nice, I had decided I liked this drug. definitely stimulating but not overpowering to the point where it feels like I'm on just a straight upper. No, there are definite 'ecstasy' like qualities about it. In fact if it lasted longer I would definitely buy a bunch and sell it on the street, but the duration is a real turn off and no one would come back to buy more. Lol, can't sell it as coke + because it burns so fucking bad. ANYWAY I came down within an hour and decided I needed a bottle of wine.<br><br>
T+90:00 I made a 50mg capsule and ate it, went across the street to BevMo (lol yeah across the street), got wine, went home and took a shower.<br><br>
T+2hours Totally come down, waiting for capsule to kick in, I plug ~50mg up my butt. I wash my hands and make a BOMB ass sandwich. Just as I'm finishing up the sammy I feel it start to kick in, however I can tell it's a weak dose and I'm not sure why.<br><br>
T+3hours Still feeling the dose, the oral+anal combo definitely lasts longer. This is where my right nostril cleared up and I decided to give that side a go. Sniffed ~100mg, burned a lot but only in my nose and throat, not through my brain :).<br><br>
After this I lost track. Over the next 5 hours I probably did 5-6 lines of ~100mg all through the right nostril.. trip info doesn't really matter because the info I previously gave is sufficient. I was also drinking wine during this time so I kinda lost track of shit.<br><br>
My take on this drug is...Yes I do like it, but is it worth the nose burn? Maybe. I am glad I bought it and tried it, I just probably wont buy it again. I'll try to describe the high as best I can with other details and shit...Euphoric, stimulating, however doesn't last nearly long enough. Very slight visual changes. Typical body sensations: Hot then cold etc. Moderate tactile/sensual enhancements. Jaw clenching. <br><br>
Did not suppress my appetite, I was hungry at the beginning of the experiment and still wanted to eat after two doses. Little to no hangover after one day of getting high. Overall it's a cool high, fun drug except for the duration and nose burning. <br><br>
I have low inhibitions about re-dosing and am usually likely to just keep redosing for the whole night. I knew what I was getting into before I took the drug and I kinda didn't care, I just needed something other than weed and alcohol. 4-MEC does not compare to 6-APB. The latter is better in every way imaginable except for the price. Hope this helps anyone considering trying this one!<!-- End Body -->
