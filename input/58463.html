After mixing 3g into a drink, I quickly drank the bitter solution.  I would give the taste of phenibut as a comparison to very salty citric acid.  So, add lots of sweetener to your drink.  I found that saccharin was a good match.  I began to notice effects about an hour later.  I felt a feeling of stimulation first (increased heart rate).  This was followed by a feeling of extreme relaxation.  A few people I was taking this with experienced a slight headache in the form of pressure in the sinus cavities (the difference is that I HAVE been taking GABA as a supplement the past week, this may have affect my experience).   <br><br>
I soon began to feel as if I were drunk.  The only difference was the ability to comprehend things.  I did not feel a loss of cognition.  After another hour, I decided to rail a small line.  WARNING THIS BURNS LIKE HELL.  I felt more intoxicated, but I do not recommend this.  After  another hour, I felt very very intoxicated.  This feeling increased until about 3 hours where it leveled off.  I was highly off base of sobriety by now and I would say my cognitive skills had decreased.  Because of this, I decided to eat 1g more of powder.  It tasted very badly, but more easily ingested than the drink mixture as I could chase it and dissipate the taste readily.<br><br>
I decided to rail another small line as well as ingest another gram of the stuff.  However, by now this dosage did nothing to my peak intoxication.  In fact I would strongly recommend not to increase the dosage after initial dosing due to the long half-life and nature of the substance.  <br><br>
Throughout the night I felt very intoxicated and even began to develop a slurred speech.  Upon recieving a ride home, I promptly went to bed.  I was typing this report on my computer when I passed out completely and awoke about 5 hours later, much like blacking out on alcohol.  I then went back to sleep and awoke 8 hours later still feeling slightly intoxicated.  I do remember have a deep sleep with very vivid dreams.  <br><br>
I still feel intoxicated way past waking up, and in conclusion believe I ingested way too much phenibut.  Please use caution with this substance and do not exceed 3g on your first use.  Believe me, this is enough.<br><br>
I'm rather excited about this substance as an anxiety reducer and an occasional recreational drug.<!-- End Body -->
