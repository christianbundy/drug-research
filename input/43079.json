 "report": "<p>First, I consumed the Rue. This was absolutely gross. I wasn't prepared for this level of nastiness. But I managed to get it down in 10 minutes. I waited about 20 minutes until I felt slightly euphoric. There was extremely minor hallucinations at this point that involved slight tracers and color change. I then consumed the Mimosa. You can mix this solution with a fruit juice if you want, but it really doesn't taste that bad. After 15 minutes, I began to feel nauseatic symptoms. I started noticing a mental and bodily change around 5 - 10 minutes later. Objects began to appear differently and I heard a low frequency buzz that sounded like it was coming somewhere from outside. 15 minutes later the nausea kicked in more and I went to the bathroom to purge. This was a deep boweled vomit unlike a normal puking session. After I was done vomiting, the DMT kicked in majorly. I stumbled back into the living room and sat down on the couch. I had trouble focusing on objects so I closed my eyes. I had many CEV's that involved lots of color and dimensional shifting. When I opened my eyes the visual hallucinations kicked in. When I moved my eyes back and forth, all the objects in the room had extreme distortion and color change. </p><p>For the next hour I switched between closing my eyes and keeping them open. I had a jumbled experience of past memories, philosophical thought, inventive ideas, anxiety, euphoria, and body and mind separation. I also experienced minor synesthesia involving hearing colors and seeing sounds. All of the sudden I noticed a nausea come over me again. I stood up to go to the bathroom. I had real trouble walking due to the extreme hallucinations. Every time I moved, objects severely distorted and bent. Every thing seemed to have a radiant aura that expanded and closed with great speed. I had a lot of trouble judging distance and size. When I got to the bathroom, I noticed the nausea wasn't in my stomach but in my bowels. I sat down on the toilet and unleashed the fury of a lifetime. I didn't think that I had this much liquid in me. I sat there for 15 minutes until I was completely empty. Afterward, the effects began to slowly taper off. I laid down on my bed and closed my eyes. A very pleasant feeling came over me as I laid there. I guess I must have fallen asleep around 30 minutes later. The next day I woke up feeling thirsty and lazy.     </p><p>All in all, it was a very good experience besides the nausea. It lasted for around 2 - 2.5 hours. The next time I will try to make the Rue in a different fashion that doesn't taste so gross. I think it's acidic and bitter flavor was what caused most of the nausea.</p><p>----------------</p><p>Supplies:</p><p>10 - 15 grams of Mimosa Hostilis</p><p>1.5 - 2 tablespoons of Syrian Rue</p><p>1 liter of water (preferably filtered, but tap is ok)</p><p>150 ml. of lemon or lime juice</p><p>2 lemons or limes</p><p>measuring cup</p><p>medium sized bowl</p><p>2 drinking cups</p><p>coffee filters (1-3)</p><p>coffee bean grinder (optional)</p><p>spaghetti strainer</p><p>2 medium sauce pans</p><p>jar with closable lid (big enough to hold 0.5 liters)</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>1. First, the Mimosa Hostilis is pulled apart by hand into small 0.5 - 1 inch long pieces about half the width of a penny.</p><p>2. Then, 150 ml. of lemon juice, 350 ml. of water, and the Mimosa is added to the jar with closable lid. Shake a few times every hour.</p><p>3. The solution is set to sit for 3 - 4 hours.</p><p>4. Then, 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of Syrian Rue is powdered (either in a coffee grinder or by hand).</p><p>5. The Rue is placed in a medium sauce pan with 250 ml. of water and the juice from either a lemon or a lime.</p><p>6. The mixture is set on high heat until it starts boiling. Then let it boil for 5 minutes. Stir the mixture while it is on the stove to make sure it doesn't burn.</p><p>7. Then, filter out the boiling solution through a coffee filter into a drinking cup and throw away the Rue sludge. Let the liquid cool off for a few minutes and then place it in the freezer to cool down more. (If you have trouble filtering it through the coffee filter, place a filter into a coffee maker and pour the rue  into it. Then pour the liquid from the coffee pot into the drinking glass. This seems to work better.)</p><p>8. Next, take the Mimosa solution (should be rather purplish) and place it in the other medium sauce pan and set the heat to high until it starts boiling. Boil this mixture for 5 - 7 minutes and make sure to stir it so it doesn't burn.</p><p>9. Filter out the boiling solution through the spaghetti strainer into the medium sized bowl.</p><p>10. Take the bark and put it back into the sauce pan and add 400 ml. of water and the juice from either a lemon or lime. Throw in a few small chunks from the lemon or lime. Set this solution to high heat and wait for it to boil. Let it boil for 5 - 7 minutes and make sure to stir so it doesn't burn.</p><p>11. Filter out the boiling solution into the bowl with the other Mimosa solution and toss away the bark.</p><p>12. Place the combined Mimosa solutions back into the sauce pan and set heat to high. Try to boil this solution down to a smaller amount. I let it boil for 30 - 45 minutes. </p><p>13. After it is boiled down, pour it into a drinking cup and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Then place it in the freezer to cool down more.</p><p>14. Take the Rue juice and the Mimosa juice out from the freezer and prepare to drink.</p><p>This whole process of preparing took me only about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Make sure that you haven't eaten in at least 5 - 6 hours and that no medication has been taken in at least 24 hours to be on the safe side.</p>"
