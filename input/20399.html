I chewed betel nut many times when I was in Papua New Guinea on a research project.  Everybody (including kids of 3) chews it there in the areas that it grows naturally.  It has a kind of sour/bitter taste that I liked a lot.  I usually just chewed it green, but a few times I chewed it with lime and daka, or betel pepper.  A couple times stand out in my memory.  Once I asked for a really strong betel nut and the local buai (betel) fiend gave me one.  I chewed it up with a bunch of lime and daka.  It totally made my head spin and it was a lot like the first time you smoke a cigar and forget that you're not supposed to inhale.  I sweated a lot and I was kind of zoning out.  Somebody asked if I was OK and I said 'Oh, mi spak nau' (Tok Pisin for 'I'm buzzing')  Everybody laughed.  <br><br>
Most times when I chewed it with lime though I just got animated and chatty (not my usually speed, I'm normally a fairly quiet guy), sweated a lot, and generally felt up, like I'd just had a good strong unfiltered cigarette or cup of coffee.  Overall I really enjoyed it.  I think it's great stuff as long as you don't go nuts with it.  <br><br>
There were people with black teeth in PNG from chewing it constantly, and one guy I knew was clearly addicted.  I wish I could find some in the states.  It would be great every now and again.  Also, I would love to see people's reaction when I spit a big stream of orange red betel juice!<!-- End Body -->
