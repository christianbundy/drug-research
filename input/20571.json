 "report": "<p>Woke up at 2pm.</p><p>3pm: Ate 2 ham and turkey sandwiches for lunch.</p><p>(With 4 of my friends)</p><p>9pm: We took Foxy pill, along with 2 tabs of PepmoBismal.</p><p>smoker/ foxy Female: 120-lbs</p><p>only foxy Female: 135-lbs</p><p>only foxy Female: 100-lbs</p><p>smoker/ foxy Male: 165-lbs</p><p>9:45pm: Setting: Room with candles. 2 big beds on the floor and a kitty cat chilling with us.</p><p>Played some Tool on the stereo. We three smoked 5 bowls of regs. only foxy female 100-lbs started tripping, pretty much overwhelmed.</p><p>I felt nothing.</p><p>10pm: Completely stoned and zoned out. </p><p>Starting to feel jittery and very happy. Not with energy, just in my mood. Everyone (but *only foxy female 100-lbs) is feeling pretty good right now.</p><p>Switched music to trance and turned it up. Killed the candles and turned on the blacklight with glow in the dark paint on ceiling.</p><p>11pm: I feel like I weigh 5 times more than I do. Im laying sunken on my bed, like a big blob. My body feels excellent. Pretty numb and twitchy. My jaw feels really tired.</p><p>Visually blurred out, glowing green paint on ceiling is moving. Visuals of rich texture and bright glow to certain things in the room. </p><p>*Being high as the 5-MeO-DiPT worked into my system was great because it creped up on me nicely while I was stoned.</p><p>12am: The foxy is flowing like waves off and on. Everyone is still planted into the bed. Some small talk every once in a while, mostly people checking up each other. Giggles all over the room spreading from one person to another like dropping dominos. </p><p>The trance was very soothing and rideable as we flowed through our frozen dreams. </p><p>Closed eye visuals were incredible. Kaleidoscope of craziness, mostly unimaginable or indescribable.</p><p>only foxy female 100-lbs is feeling good now.</p><p>Stomach discomfort is beginning to be noticeable.</p><p>4am: Coming down nicely. Only a little bit agitated and with some stomach growling.</p><p>5am: Finally my mind has stopped spinning and thinking. Sleep.</p><p>My overall experience was wonderful. As a psychedelic experience and mind journey I would say I didnt travel that far. The up and down of foxy and the lack of focus, made my thoughts start to develop but never finish. Mentally I ended right were I started. Now I just feel fresh and motivated. During the night I pretty much indulged in my body more than my mind. Focusing on relaxing and feeling things.</p>"
