 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWoke up at 2pm.<br>3pm: Ate 2 ham and turkey sandwiches for lunch.<br>(With 4 of my friends)<br>9pm: We took Foxy pill, along with 2 tabs of PepmoBismal.<br>smoker/ foxy Female: 120-lbs<br>only foxy Female: 135-lbs<br>only foxy Female: 100-lbs<br>smoker/ foxy Male: 165-lbs<br>9:45pm: Setting: Room with candles. 2 big beds on the floor and a kitty cat chilling with us.<br>Played some Tool on the stereo. We three smoked 5 bowls of regs. only foxy female 100-lbs started tripping, pretty much overwhelmed.<br>I felt nothing.<br>10pm: Completely stoned and zoned out. <br>Starting to feel jittery and very happy. Not with energy, just in my mood. Everyone (but *only foxy female 100-lbs) is feeling pretty good right now.<br>Switched music to trance and turned it up. Killed the candles and turned on the blacklight with glow in the dark paint on ceiling.<br>11pm: I feel like I weigh 5 times more than I do. Im laying sunken on my bed, like a big blob. My body feels excellent. Pretty numb and twitchy. My jaw feels really tired.<br>Visually blurred out, glowing green paint on ceiling is moving. Visuals of rich texture and bright glow to certain things in the room. <br>*Being high as the 5-MeO-DiPT worked into my system was great because it creped up on me nicely while I was stoned.<br>12am: The foxy is flowing like waves off and on. Everyone is still planted into the bed. Some small talk every once in a while, mostly people checking up each other. Giggles all over the room spreading from one person to another like dropping dominos. <br>The trance was very soothing and rideable as we flowed through our frozen dreams. <br>Closed eye visuals were incredible. Kaleidoscope of craziness, mostly unimaginable or indescribable.<br>only foxy female 100-lbs is feeling good now.<br>Stomach discomfort is beginning to be noticeable.<br>4am: Coming down nicely. Only a little bit agitated and with some stomach growling.<br>5am: Finally my mind has stopped spinning and thinking. Sleep.<br>My overall experience was wonderful. As a psychedelic experience and mind journey I would say I didnt travel that far. The up and down of foxy and the lack of focus, made my thoughts start to develop but never finish. Mentally I ended right were I started. Now I just feel fresh and motivated. During the night I pretty much indulged in my body more than my mind. Focusing on relaxing and feeling things.\n\n\n"
