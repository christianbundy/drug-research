 "report": "<p>I started chewing little finger-fulls of kava throughout an hours time. I chewed each dose until the bark was flavorless. My arms began to feel a little itchy soon after taking the first few doses but it was a bearable agitation. I felt calm no more than 30 minutes after the first dose.</p><p>Right now, two hours later, I'm feeling very calm, relaxed, warm and a little heavy-headed almost as if I were drunk but my mind is clear. I also noticed a few visual distortions, almost like my brain is a little too quick for my eyes and ears or vice versa, kind of like how you are when I'm drunk. My stomach is a little off but I'm not nauseous. I'll see how my sleep goes. So far this is much more pleasant than alcohol, which usually make me sick and makes me urinate a lot LOL.</p>"
