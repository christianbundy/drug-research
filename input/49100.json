 "report": "<p>Prepared some Damiana tea with some Orange Pekoe to mask the taste, was a good tasting brew.. mild after but overall a pleasant experience, I feel something light, almost light-headed.. more stimulated yet pleasantly relaxed.Change in body temperature also seems to be present, and it's not just from the warm tea, much more pronounced.</p><p>I've tried smoking this stuff, which is also pleasant but didn't feel much. </p><p>Tea is how I'll be preparing this henceforth and forever (maybe).</p>"
