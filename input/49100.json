 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPrepared some Damiana tea with some Orange Pekoe to mask the taste, was a good tasting brew.. mild after but overall a pleasant experience, I feel something light, almost light-headed.. more stimulated yet pleasantly relaxed.Change in body temperature also seems to be present, and it's not just from the warm tea, much more pronounced.<br>I've tried smoking this stuff, which is also pleasant but didn't feel much. <br>Tea is how I'll be preparing this henceforth and forever (maybe).\n\n\n"
