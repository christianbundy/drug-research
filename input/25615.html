Ingested orally 17.5 milligrams in capsule... the night before I had done quite a bit of codeine but that was probably a very small part of the problem... as it was about a day later that I tripped and was feeling completely normal up until the ingestion of the AMT... no other drugs were consumed at the time. <br><br>
The trip was as described by most except the peak for me was a close to death experience. My body lost feeling as if the blood wasnt reaching most parts of it, even my face. I commenced to have heavy relentless panic attacks as well as the feeling of physically being extremely close to death. I told my friends to call an ambulance around 5 hours after oral ingestion. It was an extremely small quantity so it may have been an alergic reaction but my body barely survived. <br><br>
I was plugged into an IV and recieved 4 full plastic bags of nutrients into the bloodstream as well as several calming shots and I was plugged into oxygen. I survived but beware. I reacted extremely bad to a low dose of smoked DMT as well so it may be a problem with tryptamine. I felt extremely poisoned and a complete drainage of my seratonin resulting in panic and near physical death. if anyone knows anything about this kind of ridiculously extreme reaction to such a low dosage please report it as well so I can figure out the causes. 3 other friends with me ingested the same dosage and tripped hard but never reached my reaction level. The dosage may have been under-estimated but I am pretty sure it was not more than 20 mg.<!-- End Body -->
