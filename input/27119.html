I am a very experienced user of ecstasy, cocaine and amphetamines. I was heavily in to the rave scene throughout the 90's, but now rarely indulge in clubbing or drugs of any kind much anymore - I am in no way against there use and still look back at my time as a clubber with great affection.<br><br>
One of the main reasons my 10 year passion for clubbing came to an abrupt end was the emergence of the ketamine user at clubbing events. I found that the use of this drug by people attending raves and clubs so severely detracted from the vibe that I found going to clubbing events far from unifying, but more like a trip to hell with incredably dirty zombies staring at me and my friends and generally seeming completely psycotic.<br><br>
I find that ketamine in the clubbing environment does (certainly for those people on e produce an extremely unfriendly and almost evil vibe at clubbing events. Every single experienced e user I have ever known agrees with my sentiments.<!-- End Body -->
