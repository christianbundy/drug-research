14 mg. Iprocin<br><br>
A cloudy Sunday at home.  I cleaned my house and had nothing more to do on this day.  I thought it would be a good time to satisfy a curiosity I had for some timewhat are smaller dosages of Iprocin like?  After doing a little prayer ritual with some incense, I took a capsule with fourteen milligrams of the slightly off-white powder in it.  I had little food in my stomach, just a banana, which I had eaten a few hours earlier.<br><br>
Within just fifteen minutes of swallowing the capsule, I felt a powerful alert.  Not stimulation, but I could tell something was working its way through my central nervous system.  Within another five minutes, the effects grew incredibly strong and unmistakable.  Almost a full plus-three.  I had taken this compound previously at twenty milligrams, and even above, and this seemed in a way almost as powerful.  I know I weighed the dosage correctly, I guess it was just my time for a powerful trip.<br><br>
At just around forty minutes in, it could not get any deeper.  I felt robbed of myself.  It seemed as though all voluntary actions were beyond my ability to perform.  Trying to make some kool-aid was nearly impossible.  Figuring out what CD to listen to was a struggle.  I had lost control of my self.  There was a lot of visual activity for the dose I took, and both the visuals and mental effects reminded me strongly of LSD.  Most reports in TIHKAL volunteered the absence of visuals.  Not for me!<br><br>
At the one-hour point, the body was very uncomfortable.  I needed to void at both ends, and did so.  Thankfully I was able to take care of each duty one-at-a-time, so there was no mess to clean up.  If I had made a mess, I would have had to leave it for later.  All ability to do things such as clean up vomit was beyond me at this point.  This trip was definitely kicking my ass, both mentally and physically.<br><br>
After emptying my digestive system, I took a hot bath that helped to relax me and it made me feel refreshed.  I felt cleansed.  I found all this odd, as my previous experiments with higher dosages left me with no body problems and a very happy time (mentally.)  I decided it was not the compound, but it was me.  I do not treat my body with the respect it deserves these days.  Too much smoking and too many opiates.  I was paying the price.<br><br>
While in the bathtub, I began to think deeply about my life.  I was shown where I was at, and what I still needed to work on.  All of this was shown to me in thankfully a most gentle fashion.  I was allowed to see my mistakes without having to feel bad about them and without having to dwell on the negativity of it all.  These insights all acted as a reminder of what I still needed to do to get to the places in life I want to be.<br><br>
Around the two-hour point, when I got out of the bathtub, I was definitely on my way down.  Id say I was at a gentle plus-two.  Unlike my previous exposures, it seemed as though this compound was acting more like it was described in TIHKAL... short, fast, and damn intense.  Higher dosages seem to both prolong the experience, and delay the onset of the peak-effects.  In a way, those twenty-milligram trips seemed gentler than this fourteen milligram experience.<br><br>
Three hours, and I was largely out.  Some lingering visuals remained but mentally I was back to my old self.  I made a nice cup of tea, and drank it outdoors as I enjoyed a cigarette.  It felt like the calm after the storm.  I just sat amazed at the power of this compound.  I wondered what would have happened if I had taken a higher dose!  I am glad I didnt.  By four hours, I was down enough to where I felt safe to drive, and I went over to a friends house.  I spent the rest of the evening there.  We smoked some nice pot, and I told my story of the day.  I had no difficulty getting to sleep that night.<br><br>
Conclusion:<br><br>
I know this was a short report, but I found it important to illustrate how sometimes the dose you take of a drug has little effect on the actual outcome of the trip.  I am not sure why I was hit so hard, but I was.  It was just my time.  I was very satisfied with the level I reached, and was thankful I did not take a milligram more.  While the experience was not exactly pleasant, it was very instructive.  The dose I took did exactly what I needed it to do.  I ended up being hit harder than any previous Iprocin experience.<br><br>
This trip further supports my feelings that Iprocin is a damn good psychedelic.  I find it much more useful and rich than any other synthetic tryptamine I have sampled and look forward to many further experiments.<!-- End Body -->
