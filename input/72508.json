 "report": "<p>I purchased 114 grams of sinicuichi from an online vendor. So once I received the package I immediately powdered it all & made very concentrated resin balls, around 45 in all. Once ready I swallowed all with water in around 15 minutes. There were no effects until a couple of hours later, at first I felt very tired and sluggish. So much so that I couldn't bare being around others in my condition. Then came the muscle pain. My joints were killing me. While walking home I realized everything sounded VERY deep including my own voice. Once home I laid down for a while and watched TV, listening to the strange sounds I never hear while watching my usual shows. I puked 3 times and had what I can only describe as Paralysis. I couldn't move an inch without feeling immense pain and impending doom. I would not suggest anyone ever using this plant unless having a chemistry set to isolate the good from the bad.</p>"
