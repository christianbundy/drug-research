Heard on the news about the two lads dying from Mephadrone use, instead of putting me off it gets my intrested, and I look on the websites about its uses and how to get some, got some Mephadrone from the internet a couple of days later, but I also received .5gram of Methylone as it was going cheap.<br><br>
Worried about taking the Mephadrone so I opted for its softer alternative instead <br><br>
It was a Saturday afternoon and my son was out playing with his friend, Wife was out shopping with my elder daughter, so I thought I would give it a go, I had read reports that it would calm me down and so what better time to do this than a Saturday afternoon, as watching football always gets me agitated.<br><br>
5.25pm .25Gram taken orally with some 100ml of water. tastes like bitter asprin but not undrinkable,<br><br>
6.15pm Doctor Who has just started and I have an overwhelming feeling to go out and find my son in case he misses it.<br><br>
6.20pm feeling very mellow, but in control, unlike Alcohol or Cannabis, find Son and tell him he is missing his favourite program. Feeling a lot of Love for my Son, so I give him a big Hug.<br><br>
6.40pm The New Doctor Who is a lot better than I expected, But cant make out if its because I am feeling a lot of Empathy for his first Time being Doctor Who and feel sorry for him, or is this due to the Methylone and really he is a load of Pants, Jury still out on that one.<br><br>
6.50pm Wife and Daughter back home, feeling very concerned and needing to show them some Love 
<br>
7.30pm Feeling great, very calm, not agitated, as I often get on a Saturday, I think this is because it is my day off and I never seem to get any peace, so I start to resent the people who dont give me any peace, which is usually the kids, and in the end, I finish of the evening by getting in a mood and shouting at everybody.<br><br>
8.pm, High has worn off now, but still feeling very relaxed and at one with things, realise what an absolute Arsehole of a Father I have been recently, determined to mend my ways and think more about my Wifes feelings and the children a lot more and be a good dad like the one I wanted when I was a Child.<br><br>
11pm Made Love to the wife, but with a lot more consideration and less rush than Normal, God this Methylone is great and now the Government is going to Ban it, not Voting for them this Year, interfering Arseholes<!-- End Body -->
