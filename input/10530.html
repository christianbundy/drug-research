In my curious quest for trying things new, I ventured into a local petshop and bought a 1 Oz loose of catnip.<br><br>
This all emptied in a pan with 1 pt water and brought to boil for 5 mins and then steep high temp for a further 15 mins, then drained and the water was mixed with sugar and peppermint tea bag to drown out the foulest tasting stuff since (Strong)magic mushroom tea.3/4 of the yuck was drunk. This has more than likely put me off taking it again. Too much :)<br><br>
My state of mind before taking catnip tea was stoned on hash to a fiar level, which is the norm for me.<br><br>
After about 15-20 mins I started feeling the effects of the tea, quite relaxed definately noticable and enhanced feeling of almost wanting to burst into a mild trip, this never happened , but I did think quite stragely, made me think of things I havnt thought of before, some memories of tripping which I never remembered, this was quite nice. I went to bed and had no problems sleeping, I never really do.<br><br>
The next day at work i felt vagely trippy all day, but nothing unpleasent, rather pleasent really. About 6 at night after being it for a couple of hour from work, I had a few pipes of hash, I started feeling quite wierd and trippy, this passed soon but was slightly unnearving (felt like it could be a bad sign,i knew it wasnt, therefore I guessed that i was a little bit jittery from the catnip, and to just get over it), but odd. The next day i still felt the effects but were very sutble.the day after I was normal.<!-- End Body -->
