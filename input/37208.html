I've been taking paxil for about 2 years now for anxiety disorders (panic attacks &amp; OCD).  I noticed a lot of submissions in the paxil experience vault here &amp; thought I'd offer up my own experiences of paxil, well, fucking with me, as a little warning to anyone taking it either medicinally or recreationally.<br><br>
My worst paxil experience occurred a little over a year ago, when I had just upped my dose from 12.5mg to 25mg (per day).  I had been drinking all night with my friends, as much as I normally would, &amp; late into the evening I sparked up a bowl of mj, which I also often do.  We smoked a bowl between the three of us that were there at the time, &amp; I was feeling good &amp; high-drunk for maybe a half hour after smoking.  At the time I was also continuing to drink beer.  But then I started feeling not-so-well.  I tried to tough it out, but eventually decided I needed to lie down for a while.  One of my friends, whose apartment we were in, asked if I was going to be sick &amp; I said I was fine, fully believing it.  So I lay down on the couch &amp; closed my eyes &amp; sort of continued to participate in conversation, but I started to experience the closest thing I'd ever had to a trip at this point in my life.<br><br>
Eyes closed, I saw my body outlined in stars against the sky, sort of like a sparkly chalk outline.  It made me really happy &amp; I think I was telling my friends about it.  Then I felt like I was in an attic - I knew where I *actually* was at the time, but in my mind I could see me &amp; my friends in an attic &amp; it fit for some reason.  I remembered one of my friends but forgot who the other girl was, &amp; I was racking my brain trying to remember who she was - both her name &amp; her appearance.  Then I started feeling nauseous &amp; said I thought I was going to puke soon, but before anyone could do anything about it, I barfed.  All over myself &amp; the couch I was on.  It was embarrassing &amp; gross.<br><br>
My (wonderful!!) friend washed my shirt for me &amp; got me a trash can, &amp; I continued to barf into that &amp; then spent the rest of the night clutching it &amp; feeling crappy until I passed out.  I don't know for sure, but I attribute this to the paxil, since I have never been that helplessly sick from just alcohol &amp; weed.  The 'trip' was also something that had never happened to me.  I should note also that I do take ritalin as well (40mg these days) &amp; have done so for 13 years, so that's in the mix too, but I have found that it doesn't interact badly with weed or booze, as far as I can tell.  I never had another incident like this.<br><br>
My other notable paxil problem occurred a couple months ago.  Like I said, I've been taking meds for most of my life, &amp; I don't know if I've ever screwed it up - except for this time of course.  I was at work &amp; it was time for the afternoon ritalin; I was also on antibiotics then &amp; it was time for that pill too.  I took two pills, &amp; only after the fact did I realize I'd taken a paxil instead of a ritalin.  And of course I'd already taken my paxil that morning.  So I took the ritalin &amp; hoped nothing bad would happen.  I noticed a couple hours later that I was more talkative than normal, hyper almost, &amp; I talk a lot normally so I might have been annoying.  I felt kind of bouncy &amp; 'up'.  It wasn't unpleasant really, but not particularly pleasant either.<br><br>
I went over to my friend's after work &amp; smoked a couple bowls, but avoided alcohol of any kind due to aforementioned puking incident.  The high didn't feel very different, &amp; it chilled out my hyperness a little.  Later I went home, smoked another bowl &amp; watched some TV as I fell asleep.  At this point my jaw started feeling weird &amp; I was clenching it a LOT.  I had to concentrate REALLY hard on not biting down &amp; even then I eventually gave up on it.  My mouth would just not be like it normally is at resting state.  It was bizarre, but gone in the morning.<br><br>
So in conclusion, kids, respect the paxil &amp; be careful with it.  Do as I say &amp; not as I do, &amp; try not to mix it with alcohol.  My doc told me that paxil &amp; alcohol are metabolized by the same liver enzyme, so if you're liver's dealing with the paxil &amp; then you throw a bunch of alcohol in it, things can get messy &amp; even dangerous.  I've cut down on my liquor intake since finding that out, &amp; I should probably cut down even more.  Haven't noticed any other problematic drug interactions with it, but as I am with the ritalin, I assume it makes my tolerance lower for certain things. (I don't know if this is actually true but it sounds good, no?)  <br><br>
If you're taking it recreationally... personally I don't quite get how paxil would be fun, but who am I to judge, so be careful &amp; again, WATCH THE ALCOHOL!!  Also avoid MAOI's if you're going to be on paxil because MAOIs don't mix well with most Rx drugs.  I started smoking passionflower a while ago &amp; it made me feel slightly weird, &amp; then I found out it was an MAOI so no more of that.<!-- End Body -->
