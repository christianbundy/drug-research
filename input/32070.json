 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nManaged to get some IAP. Setting was pretty good - went out to party with some friends. Had some internal issues to work out.<br>t.0:00 - Took 35mg in a gelcap, carefully weighed out.<br>t.0:15 - First alerts -- I was on an empty stomach.<br>t.1:00 - Slight euphoric rush. Sort of like a small % of an mdma rush.<br>t.1:30 - Dosage bumped by 10mg.<br>t.2:00 - First get a chance to catagorize my mindset. _really_ awake! Head feels light. This is nice. Sort of like mdma without the rolling empathy vibes.<br>t.4:00 - Dosage bumped by 10mg.<br>t.5:00 - Plenty of energy for dancing -- but I don't have to. Not an uncomfortable energy. Feels like it's impossible to be bored. I test this by staring at the wall for a few minutes. I'm not bored! Not sure where my head is -- it's like my capacity to be bored has been turned off.<br>t.8:00 - Finally coming down slightly but I had a few hours left in me. Decide to take a sleeping pill to allow sleep.<br>Notes: This lasts a long time. Be prepared. It's also no substitute for mdma -- but might be a great tool for writing, etc, anything that required some intense concentration. This is not a plain old amphetamine. There is some great introspective healing inside of it -- but that's harder to capture in a trip report.\n\n\n"
