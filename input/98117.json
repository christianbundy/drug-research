 "report": "<p>Chemical: 4-Fluoroamphetamine</p><p>Dose: Approximately 140 mg to 170 mg (powder/crystals)</p><p>Body: 70 kg or 155 lb</p><p>Age at time of experience: 19</p><p>Experience date: October 30, 2012</p><p>Duration of the effects: 8 hours</p><p>PROLOGUE: I am a 19 year old student. I have experience with Marijuana, Salvia, MDMA, Cocaine and Alcohol. Today I am writing about a designer drug 4-Fluoroamphetamine or 4-FA for short. A week before taking the drug my friend and I were discussing MDMA effects and how to obtain it. He suggested I looked up 4-FA, not seeing any harm I decided to. Online it states that it is a designer drug with similar effects to MDMA. I decided to try it out and 1 week later it comes in the mail.</p><p>SETTING: The halls and classrooms of a university.</p><p>EXPERIENCE: </p><p>+0:00 - 1:00 pm  90 milligrams, oral, I did not have any capsules so I decided to just take it plain on the tongue. I measured out 10 approximate portions of the 1 gram that I had and took one down the hatchet. It does not taste good; I immediately had to chase it with orange juice. </p><p>+0:20 - 1:20 pm  60 milligrams to 80 milligrams, oral, did not feel anything and thought that I may have taken too little so I ingested some more. I decided to listen to some music since I know its going to be great.</p><p>+0:30 - 1:30 pm  I started feeling a bit more happy and joyful but not to the extent of being surprised by the fact. I took a bus to my school with a big smile on my face. On the bus I felt like my head was clear and my eyesight improved, as if I were more focused on what was going on around me.</p><p>+1:00 - 2:00 pm  Class 1 started and I felt very good, serotonin must have been released at this moment. At other times I am a bit more reserved during class 1 but not this time. I was answering questions, leading a discussion and socializing very easily. This is one of the first effects 4-FA had on me, extroversion and socialness. I am typically an introvert (likes to relax alone) and dont have too many friends but that day I was talking to everyone with excitement in my voice. The class had about 50 people in it and the experience was similar to a presentation.</p><p>+2:00 - 3:00 pm  This is the start of the peak of the trip. I felt my heart beating fast (100 bps) while I was taking notes. I felt like the teacher was taking too long to explain the lecture therefore I decided to pull out notes from class 3 and started learning 2 subjects at once, still being involved in the previous discussion. At the peak it felt like a mix of MDMA and Cocaine, I felt like I could do anything, like I was superman, very euphoric. I was also very impressed with myself for taking on so many tasks and actually completing them. </p><p>+2:30 - 3:30 pm  Class 1 ended and whilst walking down the hall I noticed one of my acquaintances had a booth set up and was presenting his point of view. While socializing I gave him advice on how to improve said booth in order to attract more people, I felt very confident in my suggestion.  I left with another acquaintance with whom I do not normally speak, this time I was carrying on a full out conversation with someone I had not spoken to in a year and did not enjoy being in his company.</p><p>+3:00 - 4:00 pm  Class 2 starts, it is my least favorite class and I usually slack off in it. Today I took major notes, listened and understood the concepts clearly. This is about the time I noticed my jitters. I had to tap my pen on my desk or move my hands in order to relieve the energy flowing through me. At this moment I also realized the dryness of my mouth. This is not a concern, just a mild annoyance and it can be cured with a stick on gum which I thankfully had. </p><p>+4:00 - 5:00 pm  Class 2 ended and I was on my way home. When I got home I felt extremely bored. Since I only had 30 minutes of free time I had to use them effectively, before leaving for school again. I started working out with interval training. I did not get tired at all, sweaty, but not tired. While at home I noticed that my appetite was suppressed, even if I did want to eat I would not have been able to so I went back to school.</p><p>+5:00 - 6:00 pm  At this moment while studying for class 3s upcoming quiz I started coming down. I was a bit scared, I knew that 4-FA made me a better learner, but I wanted the effects to last through the quiz in order for me to receive a good grade. At this moment I thought of having more. Unfortunately the rest was at home which was a 15 minute bus ride away was and if I had gone I would have surely missed the quiz. The dose would also give me another 8 hours of energy which I did not need so I left the hopes of having more and went to class 3.</p><p>+6:00 - 7:00 pm  I was on my 4th piece of gum in 3 hours, now this may not seem so strange to some but gum usually lasts longer. My fears of the drugs effects fading away, faded away (see what I did there) when I received my quiz. I remembered almost everything that I had learned in the previous hour and felt very confident with my answers. During the class I took notes very quick like which meant that the drug was still in my body even after 6 hours. It did not worry me since some MDMA trips lasted up to 10 hours.</p><p>+8:30 - 9:30 pm  When the class was over I felt off my buzz, I have returned to Earth and was a regular human again. This was not a cause for concern because I had a great day, I did not yearn for more which is good, that meant 4-FA is not addictive, or at least not to the point of Gollum (my precious!). On the way back home with 3 of my friends on the bus I did not feel the constant need for social interaction. I stayed quiet for most of the ride, sometimes answered their questions or threw in my 2 cents. The weather was about 11 degrees Celsius or 52 degrees Fahrenheit. I noticed that I am not as cold as I thought I would be. On MDMA sometimes hypothermia sets in (in my case every time I did it) and the weather usually felt colder than it was. I was mildly surprised that I was not shaking or trying to warm up. </p><p>+9:00 - 10:00 pm  At home, good atmosphere, warm rooms and plenty of comfort. I felt the effects wore off but a nice afterglow still lingered. It made me awake, not Coked up but as if I drank an espresso. I started playing some music again and just listened to the vibes, relaxing. </p><p>+10:00 - 11:00 pm  Hey! I know, Im going to write an experience report since they have helped me so much with stories and information. Still very awake I started writing.</p><p>+12:30 - 1:30 am  Finished the report, posted it and went to sleep. No sleep problems, fell asleep normally (in 7 minutes) and no hangover the next day.</p><p>PROS: The good effects of 4-FA include mood elevation, increased energy, euphoria, increased focus and mental functions, it becomes very easy to socialize and my confidence gets a boost, no hangover the next day, if used for work I would get a lot done. </p><p>NEUTRALS: The effects that accompanied the trip but dont make any significant changes in the trip. Increased heart rate, dry mouth and suppressed appetite.</p><p>CONS: Increased heart rate and suppressed appetite, now these are both neutral and cons because they could carry long-term effects, can last a long time if not prepared for it, feeling tired after the trip.</p><p>OVERALL: I really liked this drug, I was looking for an MDMA experience and I got it. Definitely will do it again, maybe in two weeks.  I would not recommend any intake other than oral since it burns like the deepest fires of hell if you snort it and it does not work as well if smoked, I dont know anything about injecting it. </p><p>COMPARISON WITH MDMA:</p><p>As I mentioned before I was looking for an MDMA experience and found that this comes very close to the perfect duplicate, but how close?</p><p>4-FA</p><p> Effects included euphoria similar to MDMA, increased energy, mood elevation, extroversion and socialness, bruxism, and suppressed appetite. After the drug had run its course there was barely any hangover or a recovery period.</p><p> Less popular and unknown.</p><p> 4-FA produced less hyperthermia than MDMA.</p><p> Effects began within an hour after ingestion and typically lasted anywhere between 4-10 hours. Common dose range was 80-150 mg, usually taken orally.</p><p> Unscheduled.</p><p> Little to no pupil dilation.</p><p>MDMA</p><p> MDMA induced a strong sense of inner peace and self-acceptance, diminished fear, anxiety, extreme mood lift with accompanying euphoria, feelings of intimacy and even love. After the drug had run its course, I feel fatigue; diminished mental capacity, and impaired cognitive ability.</p><p> Very popular in rave scenes, much more known than 4-FA.</p><p> MDMA produced more hypothermia than 4-FA.</p><p> Took effect within 45 minutes to an hour of consumption, hitting a peak at 2.5 to 3 hours, and lasted 3-4 hours.</p><p> Common dose range was 80 - 150 mg.</p><p> MDMA is criminalized in most countries.</p><p>In my opinion 4-FA is a cheaper version of MDMA that is unscheduled or not controlled in many countries with a longer trip without a big hangover or a recovery period. I think that MDMAs effects are more superior to those of 4-FA. Overall 4-FA is an adolescent compared to the adult Ecstasy.</p><p>Sorry for writing so much and thank you if you read all of it, hope it helped.</p><p>Resources used:</p><p>http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_basics.shtml</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Fluoroamphetamine</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_MDMA_on_the_human_body</p><p>I know Wikipedia might not be a reliable source school wise but it is a winner in my book.</p>"
