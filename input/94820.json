 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I parachuted an unknown amount of 4-FA once, then again an hour later. I take a stimulant and an SSRI every day so I was interested how the added stimulant (4-FA) would affect me.<br>About a half hour after the first parachute I started to feel my heart racing. I felt on-edge and anxious as well as slightly nauseous. My boyfriend reported at that time that he felt like he was rolling.<br>A few hours later we were both feeling quite nauseous and continued to feel uneasy for the next few hours. I noticed at times that my boyfriend would complain about the temperature and break out into intense sweat while I felt the room temperature was normal.<br>Another few hours later we both still felt nauseous and he ended up puking and then feeling mildly better. Neither of us ate or felt like eating the whole time.\n\n\n"
