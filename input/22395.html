Setting: a late monday night in my dorm at my college<br><br>
I take about 150mg and wait 2 hours and still feel nothing I have tripped on AMT twice beforee this and I loved it. So after waiting two hours I take some more totaling 450mg. And in about an hour my life is about to take a drastic turn of the worst.<br><br>
After all 450mg kicked in I was trippin balls everything was moving and I was so happy and swaeting bullets but overall I felt ok. I ran around the halls in my dorms room looking for a party and some weed. But I was so fucked up I was scareming at the top of lungs and security came. I started cursing everyone and telling them that were all going to die tonight and just sscaring the hell out of people. I was breaking fire alarms I was out of control. <br><br>
Eventually security got me back to my room and tried to calm me down that is I lite a Cigg in my room and security took it from me and I punched the guy in the face for taking my Cigg. Next thing the police get there and they are restraing me and holding me down. ..... I must have passed out for a good hour and I woke up in the hopsital I freaked out I was starpped down to a bed and had and IV in me and there were treatng me of a LSD overdoes when I had taken AMT which no one had ever herd of.<br><br>
Well after I got out the hospital I was kicked out of college and my parents kicked me out and now I sleep where ever I can.<br><br>
AMT takes a long time to kick in. I should have waited at least 3 hours before taking anymore. Blacking out and waking up in a hospital is no fun.<br><br>
This is about a week after and I have noticied no real bad effects from my overdose really strabge I thought I would be fucked up for life after taking a research chemical Stay safe and keep trippin :)<!-- End Body -->
