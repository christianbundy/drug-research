 "report": "<p>These are my only slightly edited notes taken while on 4-HO-DiPT.</p><p>11:28 am</p><p>I had a sample of 4-HO-DiPT of known identity and purity. Butter-white fine crystals, 8.5 mg hydrochloride. I dissolved these in a small glass of Diet Coke and drank the mix down in one gulp. The beverage did a good job of moderating the somewhat nasty flavor of the drug. Im kinda scared - I Did It Now. Id had two previous brushes with this drug - the first time at perhaps 4.5 mg was awful - five hours of formless terror while my body felt All Wrong. The second time (10 mg) I had a cold, so perhaps the difficult nature of that experience had an excuse. This was try 3 at a dose chosen to push me past the unresolved terror state but still be manageable. In theory anyway. The striking feature of the 10mg event was its duration - in at 6pm one evening, and still quite intoxicated at 1am that morning, when a stout dose of alprazolam was used to get some rest. The day after that I was still off baseline for most of the morning!</p><p>I cleared my mind and asked whatever God was inclined to oblige to see to my safety. Okeydoke, here goes.</p><p>11:40 am </p><p>Poss first alert? The feeling in my lower gut along with barely perceptible pink&green in a white surface.</p><p>11:52</p><p>Mild somatic wave - definite alert. Doing chores. Still not +1. </p><p>12:20pm</p><p>Persistent Feeling in my lower gut. Pleasant. Hand on a cushion breathes a little. Smiling a lot. So far, so good! +1</p><p>1:16</p><p>Lying in bed. Still going in! Strong waves of ideation - somewhat disorienting. The feeling of having entered the Place frivolously, uninvited, cant be shaken. You really didnt want to be here. But youre here now for sure.</p><p>Visual is near-normal - mild breathing of edges, maybe a bit of blue&gold in surfaces. Im not completely coordinated.</p><p>1:25</p><p>Even at this modest level, the experience is flatly indescribable to those who dont know psychedelics. Hypnagogy is an inadequate surface metaphor. When I move about, the body sensation can be quite pleasant. At other times, it flirts with an alarming poisoned! quality.</p><p>1:50</p><p>Still very much in a dual state, but maximum reached and repair under way? Very ambivalent. Would like to try this one deeper, but not alone. </p><p>I dont acess anything animistic (the tree outside is and remains just a tree) or mystical/cosmic, and I have an inkling that the price of enduring the necessary dose would be quite high. Even now Im yawning and shivering moderately. </p><p>2:35 </p><p>It was a false repair. Still definitely +2. Waves of sensation/ideation - Im riveted still in my bed, realizing that communicating the most basic blocks (cognitive glyphs) of the experience eludes. ... Its like a panic anxiety that has been transfigured, rendered OK, into a feeling that alternates between disconcerting and occasionally beautiful - the barest hints of inner light unfolding Out.  ... And the remarkable thing is that the Observer is intact to write this down in mundane language.</p><p>2:40 </p><p>Went into a near panic when I Couldnt Find the Toilet Paper. Reasoning ability is getting hit: spent some time staring at a box trying to decipher the writing into (slowly breathing) words, then spent some more time realizing that the words made a message that didnt match the contents of the box. I can still pull it together, but its a real effort. No sign of effects subsiding.</p><p>2:47</p><p>I found the toilet paper - behind the (temporarily displaced!) toddler bed. Felt more profound relief than I really ought to have. I solemnly carried six rolls (two stacks of three) to their berth in the bathroom cabinet. </p><p>Checked Shulgins Plus Scale - this is still a +2, even though at times the rational mind/Observer is overwhelmed. My ego is just barely intact and continuous.</p><p>2:54 </p><p>So far Ive managed to decline a Valium. My mind understands that the anxiety (if it is even that!) is chemical and thus transitory, inconsequential. Bbbbut Im still far off baseline. I am well and truly Dipped. </p><p>3:25</p><p>Ive had a shower (washed the fight-or-flight funk from my armpits) and did some dishes. I am gently but unyieldingly pressured to realize that tryptamines arent for me. The Other is a damned good host - considering I barged in uninvited. But I must acknowledge that, having come to them so late in life, I have been guilty of romanticizing the psychedelics. They are not toys. They are not pleasure rides nor well-suited as discretionary intoxicants. I hope I have the courage and emotional memory-integrity to not come back without an invite or other extenuation.</p><p>I will trust myself to sweep up out front now. Im starting to get hungry.</p><p>3:40</p><p>Internal dialog. Sensation of wisdom/great sadness. So this is what it means to grow up. Hope I can remember. Perhaps that is the internal tragedy of this whole class of compounds. A sense that knowledge is dispensed only for that interval when it cannot be used, i.e. denied when Im sober again. I cannot remember the Basic Truth of this state when not in this state. And I am powerfully advised not to visit casually.</p><p>And yet there is tremendous peace in knowing that the underlying fabric of the cosmos abides, whether I Know or not, despite history and tyrannies and angry priests and entire generations sleepwalking. Even they fit with their own beauty into the whole. Gardan borders still breathing a little.</p><p>3:47</p><p>A migraine keeps nagging at my right temporal area. Drug body load seems diminished. Rational Observer seems better.</p><p>4:20</p><p>I walked to McDs. My Observer took a big pie in the face when confronted with the reality of talking to a stranger. I used all my internal resurces keeping it together and maintaining an inconspicuous energy signature. I got through about half the meal at a table before packing up and going home seemed like a Really Good Idea. I ran into (neighbor) on the way back and really worked at normal conversation. Im repairing, but with remarkable leisure. I wonder if duration and level of involvement isnt more typical of the normative 4-HO-DMT experience. This is no miniature of psilocin, not in me anyway!</p><p>4:25</p><p>The process of receiving a sensory stimulus - checking the internal catalog - deciding its not a problem - relaxing - starting the startle-chech-relax cycle over abd over again is very tiring. Whats it been - five hours paying full fare?</p><p>5:20</p><p>Killed some time surfing the web. Still solidly +1. Body load (a pushing feeling in boweld and backs of thighs) is frankly annoying. The pleasure/learning part of this is over and Im just paying the bills now. I still wouldnt be comfy answering the phone.</p><p>5:45</p><p>Small residues of objects breathing, apparent 10 minutes ago, are now gone. Repair under way at last. </p><p>5:50</p><p>Or not? I set up the stereo, but I cant seem to properly listen to the music. Still +1. Extraneous sounds are still not getting automatically processed and dismissed.</p><p>6:07 </p><p>A wave of physical pleasure-feeling. So its not ALL bad. But my overall conclusion is becoming: On balance this is a difficult, demanding experience.</p><p>6:45</p><p>Consistently near but not at baseline now. Im somewhat euphoric; I got through unharmed and with a story. Now to just try to remember that even this gentlest by reputation of the serious psychedelics. Is. Not. A. Toy.  Youve been advised.</p><p>8:00</p><p>Still not out of it. Waves of dislocation disabuse me from saying its over. I want baseline back.  Im very selective what Im watching on TV. I have no tolerance for harsh vibes. Watching spiders mate was horrifying. </p><p>9:20</p><p>Very chilled - put a jacket on. Calling all clear; nearly ten hours. Short-acting, yuh right.  DOB would probably kill me outright. </p><p>11:30</p><p>Twelve-hour mark.  Still tailing. Trying to sleep is difficult, even after 30 mg temazepam. Am taking 5 mg Valium to simply disengage.</p>"
