I had to take elavil for about a year due to headaches from TMJ. I found it to be a nasty devil drug. The effects begin right away but also ramp up as you take it. When I stopped taking it it takes a while to go away (days-weeks) too. <br><br>
The side effects are, dizziness on standing up, blurred vision, difficuly concentrating, and for me being very short tempered and nasty. The main effect is a grogginess very like taking antihistamines. I find it to be a wide awake fuzziness, feels like one of those days where you slept too much or something and you feel like you never wake up. <br><br>
The thing is, this is always. I had a headache 24-7 when I stared taking it and after about a year I hated it SO much that I went off and started doing everything I possibly could to avoid headaches without it. I did exercises prescribed to me 1-1/2 hours a day to avoid the headaches without the elavil. I still have headaches often, although not constant ones, and put a lot of time into exercises, physical therapy, etc.. I just hope I never have to touch that crap again.<br><br>
Also, to all the people taking for a buzz. If I am not mistaken it is pretty dangerous in combination with things. Not 'good' potentiation like alchohol and downers, but more like MAO inhibitors in mixture.<!-- End Body -->
