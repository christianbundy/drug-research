Well I am unable to partake of most drugs, as I am drug tested frequently. My wife and I recently heard that you could smoke catnip. So we read up on it a bit, and then i bought a small bag from the store. It was the organically grown type.<br><br>
We have a small plastic bong with a glass bowl, and between the two of us, we smoked 4 bowls. The herb was very pleasant to smoke, and smelled incredibly like marijuana. As soon as my wife exhaled the first hit, I laughed, amused at how close the smell was. The feeling was instant, and very subtle. It was a slight head buzz, simliar to marijuana but no where near as strong. If you smoke marijuan frequently, you may not even notice the effects. But if you're like us, and can't do so, this is good alternative.<br><br>
By the time we finished the 4 bowls, we felt pretty much the same: relaxed. My vision somehow seemed 'sharper', and the colors in the room seemed a little brighter, and my wife agreed with me.<br><br>
We watched a movie, and by the half way point (45 minutes or so), I didn't feel much other than relaxed. But this could be due to the fact that I had been lying down for that whole time.<br><br>
In summary, if I can't partake of marijuana, smoking catnip as a substitute is pretty good. The smoke is smooth (through a bong at least), it smells remarkably like marijuana, and i would even say it tastes similar in a way.<!-- End Body -->
