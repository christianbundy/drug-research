What I am about to tell you is the most accurate description I can give of a night in December 2000. Most of the information is taken from a paper I prepared 2 days after the experience. I think about this experience every day, and it's been almost 3 months.<br><br>
I went over to my friends house. He was having a party with about 60 people. We were smoking a lot of weed. Then someone brought acid over. I am an experienced user with acid, and it wasn't too big of a deal that I decided to take six, although the most I had ever had was five, which was a bad experience due to being on a camping trip. But I was with my friends, and there was always weed if I started to get tense. But what I've learned from this experience and many others, is that weed intensifies the trip significantly.<br><br>
First, everything started to get louder about 20 minutes after I had taken them. I was experiencing a mild tripping feeling, with slight visuals and feelings of the adrenaline flowing. We started smoking out of a gasmask. I had a lot, like about 10 bowls. I was in my friend's bedroom, where there were only about 5 people. I started to quickly loose reality 1 hour after I had taken them. That's when things got crazy. All in a sudden, SMASH! I fell through the bed I was laying on, fell through the floor, and down to the next level in the apartment, in which the room looked exactly the same. (I only imagined this had happened). I was laying there, my friends still there. I looked at my chest. Guts were hanging out. I could feel severe pain. I didn't say a word. Things are slightly foggy from there, but I do remember knowing I was dead. I was thinking, what did I do to deserve to die? I couldn't move. People who I knew from school who were not at the party were looking at me, knowing I was dead, and saying things like, he was a weirdo, I never did like him, he deserved it. I was in total terror. So this is what death is like. <br><br>
The ambulance and police came (in my head). I saw the flashers. The cops came in and looked at my dead body. 'Yep thats what acid will do to you' they said smiling. I didn't understand why the music was still playing. I never looked at the imaginary cops directly. My friends were talking about me, about old times. They seemed unusually happy that I was dead. This thought angered me. I kept thinking, what's my coworker, my mom and everyone else going to think when they find out I died when I was tripping. I was wondering when I was going to be dead completely, like going black or going to heaven, hell, or wherever. I was seeing myself almost in the third person, in a pile of blood. I finally got the strength to get up. I thought everyone would be suprised that I was there. My friend was like, 'Are you ok?' I said what the fuck is going on!!!? He calmly said, 'It's a party dude'.  I repeatedly asked him what happened. He said I was just laying there that whole half hour I was on his bed. I looked at where I was lying. There was no blood. I was now experiencing the equivalent to a basic 3 hit trip. I got reality back sooner that I thought I would. The next day, no one will ever know how happy I was to be alive. To this day I am so thankful to be alive, even though I consider my life shitty. I wonder if some parts of the trip were due to Paxil, which I have been taking for months. The times I've tripped while taking Paxil seem to be more intense for a lesser period of time. My point of this story besides sharing my extremely odd and scary experience is, you can be with your best friends and still have a bad trip.<!-- End Body -->
