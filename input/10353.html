I started taking 2 tablets (300mg. each) of Olmifon (adrafinil) each morning.  I did this for 7 days or so before I noticed any effect whatsoever.<br><br>
The effect, at first, was merely a strange alteration in the overall energy levels in my body.  I no longer became exhausted and sleepy in the afternoon or early evening.  But, I could also go to sleep easier than usual!<br><br>
That fugue many people (not only college students) get, the brain just falls into an empty loop -- a brain fart -- is rarely present now.  Whether or not I'm paying attention, I am always thinking, but it isn't any sort of manic of compulsive thought drive.<br><br>
I have only been taking Olmifon for 2-3 weeks, so I cannot comment on any effects past this time, but I have not noticed any side-effects.  [Early worries of the 'inner tension' listed as a possible side-effect have been removed as the pain I felt initially was due, it now seems, to taking 10mg. of Deprenyl in one day, along with 600mg. of Olmifon.]<br><br>
It does not resemble amphetamines in any way at all, which I've found odd since it does awaken the mind so. OTHER:<br><br>
A potent oral opium extract at night had a sedating effect that lasted through to the morning and seemed to conquer any cognitive enhancement of Olmifon.  This day my brain was able to slip into the fugue mentioned above.<br><br>
However, alcohol (only tested with beer) at night does not seem to weaken Olmifon for the following day, like the oral opium did.<br><br>
Do not know if Cannabis knocks down Olmifon, I would image so.<br><br>
It seems that Olmifon is a mild attention-cognition tweaker that can easily be crushed with the typical assortment of stupifying drugs. [Syntopressin does bring back cognitive awareness in the midst of intense Cannabis intoxication.  Sadly, Sandoz has stopped production and the few remaining Syntopressin manufacturers have created a monopoly costly for the smart drug enthusiast.]<br><br>
Other than not being able to push past opiate intoxication, Olmifon seems to be a perfect addition to the medicine cabinet of college students and those needing a brain to function constantly throughout the day.<br><br>
Cost varies; Europeans should expect to pay less than 10 Euros for a box of 40 tablets, while Americans end up spending $20-$40 for the same box. Taking 2 tablets per day at this cost could get very expensive.  Besides, the literature warns against taking Olmifon for more than 5 months solid, without having liver enzymes checked.<!-- End Body -->
