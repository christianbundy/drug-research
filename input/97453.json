 "report": "<p>A friend of mine had been wanting me to go to this secret camping spot with him for years and we finally planned it out and went over a weekend. The spot was beautiful in a lightly wooded pine forest next to an inlet which is very close to the ocean. On the water you could see all the lights of the city and also ferries slowly trolling across the water all night. We drove for about an hour and a half to get to the camp site and ate a couple weed brownies once we were close to our destination. When we finally got to the parking area we each took one blotter that contained 1.5 mg of DOI and began hiking through the forest trails in search of a good secluded spot. We found the perfect spot, maybe 15 feet back into the woods with a clear view of the ocean and the moon, huge and bright, positioned directly in front of my hammock.  </p><p>The first thing we did after setting up our hammocks and mosquito nets was locate some beach wood and dry leaves to start a fire.  After about an hour of collecting wood and setting up the fire we got a good burn going and decided it was time to eat our doses of 4-AcO-DMT, which were 25 mg each. There were a lot of sand shrimp jumping around almost like they were dancing right near the fire. I saw a huge moth fly directly into the fire right in from of me, almost instantly its wings burnt up like paper and it died. It was very symbolic. I remember thinking, I'm next, and laughing out load trying to mask some anxiety of what was going to happen to my mind.</p><p>By this point, it was maybe one or two hours after taking the DOI and we were both starting to feel it, so subtle and visually pleasing, we both really enjoyed it. Very soon after I noticed the DOI, the 4-AcO starting getting very strong. I could tell the difference easily. The 4-AcO is very deep mentally and a lot like mushrooms, very spiritual. When I would close my eyes I would see people or strange robots like simpler transformers but very colorful, just walking around and I would see faces of people I have never met before. There was continuous swirling colorful patterns, a sea of neon candy cane spinning in my mind. It was very similar to DMT but coming in waves and much gentler.  </p><p>At this point maybe 3 hours in everything felt as if it was peaking and I was very disoriented. All I could do was lay on the sand in front of the fire and stare out at the water and witness an indescribable play of light on the water by the boats and lights at the opposite coast line.  As my friend and I lay on the sand next to the fire, I was flowing in and out of closed eye scenes of indescribable strangeness, we barely ever uttered a word to each other. This is probably the least I have talked in my whole life haha. After a couple more hours of rolling around on the ground and moaning in spiritual ecstasy we simultaneously decided to climb into our hammocks. </p><p>With the aid of my head lamp I stumbled aimlessly through the woods almost blinded by the busyness of my morphing vision, but I managed to find my hammock, climb in and zip up the bug net. I had just bought a new net for my hammock and was broke because of it, but it was very worth it; it worked perfectly and was hung up a few feet above my hammock. Inside, with the net all zipped up, I felt like I was in a cocoon. I could see the many bugs and flying things all around me but was warm under a blanket and in the safety of my cocoon. </p><p>Neither of us really slept all night, maybe in short increments of a few minutes during the morning hours. We spent the night writhing and moaning, seeing and feeling the presence of what can only be described as aliens or gods or spirits. I was engulfed by the brightness and size of the moon, this being the weekend after the super moon it was still quite impressive and shining bright through the trees. Later my friend and I discovered we both experienced the same effect when looking at the moon, it seemed as if the light was bending around the trees behind some and morphing in totally unnatural ways. For me this became quite unsettling at one point.  </p><p>After staring at the moon for several minutes it started to become very distorted and take on a serpent like form and slowly wiggled closer and closer to me. At one point, when it looked like it was about to emerge from the tree line right in front of my hammock, I called out to my friend to make sure this wasn't real. I almost never do this, I trip a lot, but the setting along with the synergy from the DOI, probably compounded by the several weed brownies we consumed, sent me into a full blown Shulgin ++++ experience. I laid there looking at this snake of light not being able to remember what it even was, that it was actually the moon. And I was in actual fear of possibly being abducted by some sort of alien life form. Slowly I figured out it was the moon and I was just experiencing strong visual distortions and separation from my normal thought but that took several minutes to realize.</p><p>After figuring out that the aliens or beings surrounding my friend and I weren't intending on abducting us and figuring out the huge UFO slowly moving towards me was the moon, I realized I had forgotten much more than just how the moon works. I spent several minutes trying to remember my name and why I was here, and eventually remembered. After remembering who I was, I remembered I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me, and an awesome dog that is my best friend too. I felt immense love knowing these two beings cared for me so much, I was so happy. After losing total contact with myself remembering my love here in real life after being totally consumed by psychedelia is like drinking a liter of water after running ten miles. I felt so happy and refreshed, I felt totally at peace with everything in that moment.</p><p>I couldn't shake the feeling that I was part of everything, God was us and we were it, I come to this realization almost every time I mix tryptamines (e.g. mushrooms, DMT, 4-AcO-DMT) with  phen's (Mescaline, DOx, 2C-x). I recommend everyone seeking a strong spiritual experience try at least a low dose mix of two, it is very rewarding. After several hours I think I may have fallen asleep but I am not sure, I may have been drifting in and out of sleep all night. But in the morning we got up both feeling very refreshed and energetic, and as happy as could be. Partly from the trip last night, but also partly from the amphetamine effects of the DOI still going strong, and for the next few hours as well. We decided to pack up after a small snack and head towards the ocean in the car.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] </p><p>I met up with a friend on the beach near the pier and got half a gram of some dank weed and we drank some 24 oz beers on the beach, hopped in the car and smoked a joint on the way to a more secluded beach spot. We wandered the dunes drinking the rest of our six pack and then walked down to the water and swam around for a while and cooled off. After leaving the beach we decided to drive home, feeling exhausted as fuck. After I finally got home that night, I called my weed man and got some bud to roll a blunt. I still had a relaxation shot I had brought camping in case I needed help sleeping. It was composed of melatonin, valerian root and rose hips and it worked wonderfully. I quickly slipped off to sleep and woke up ten hours later feeling better than ever, reset and refreshed.  </p><p>Ḱ∀ℛℭЇℵØḠИℐÖṲ</p>"
