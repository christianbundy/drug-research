 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPrep.: \r\nThe seeds are baked by placing a seed on top of a lit light bulb seems to work for me better than in a stove or any other. Seeds are crushed in a mortar and pestle to a very fine powder. Then seeds are mixed with baking soda and a bit of water. After placing the brown sludge over a lightbulb set in a lamp I waited. After the mix is completely dried I crush it again in the mortar and pestle. It is ready.\r\nSetting and Mind Set:\r\nSitting in my room very anxious. This would be my second yopo attempt first attempt was ill prepared and gave me all the bads without the goods. I sat there with well prepared powder in a medium sized line breathed in and out and dove in. One nostril, Two nostrils. Oh god it burns. I run into the bathroom and calm myself down. \r\nExperience: \r\nT=+0:30\r\nIn the bathroom staring at myself in the mirror. My Shower is on to calm me. The pain is intense but not anything i can't handle. My face is burning and drool is coming out of my mouth. I know that soon I will be vomiting. Correct, I am currently vomiting but the effects are starting to kick in so I really don't care my vomit actually looks neat in yopo vision and I'm staring at it.\r\nT=+5:00\r\nThe effects are now full blown there are many colors and if I close my eyes I can see a spirograph spinning out of control. I decide to take a shower just to experiment it is very relaxing and to my surprise i notice all feelings have become simply feelings. It was like if I feel pain and I tell myself that it is all in my mind. All feelings did not feel good or bad they were just feelings. Moving around is also very easy.\r\nT=+15:00 \r\nI'm done with my shower and lay down in my bed I feel very good and all effects are still the same. I turn on my Zen CD for some peace. \r\nT=+30:00 \r\nThe effects start to change. Now there are transparent planes All over my room. It looks like there are windows all over my room. Also my room is green. \r\nT=+35:00\r\nMy ceiling is moving and there are transparent tentacles coming out of my ceiling light. There are also geometric patterns all over the ceiling they look very fancy.\r\nT=+45:00 \r\nI look up at three dots on the ceiling and realize that this must be how people made up star constellations. These three dots make up a horses face but look nothing like a horse without the yopo. \r\nT=+65:00 \r\nThe effects are gone and I feel great I turn on family guy and have some good laughs.\r\nAll in all this was a great experience and I can't wait to try again with lime in the mix. A word of advice is when this stuff is in your nose don't breath in through your nose and blow the stuff out when it starts to take effect.\n\n\n"
