I am fortunate enough to live in a place where Salvia is unregulated and so I bought some from a store just to give it a try.  My first experience of it included several smoked bowls (bong) taken in short hits.  I felt a mildly stoned and dismissed Salvia as just a crappy cannabis knockoff.  A legal high for straight shooters.  Subsequently I put it aside and forgot about it for a week or two.<br><br>
The setting:  Alone in a darkened room lit with candles, mellow music, and insense.<br><br>
It was later when I was preparing to smoke some pot that I remembered that I had it.  I decided that I might as well use it up, so I decided to mix it in with the pot.  However for whatever reason I decided to make the first bowl just pure Salvia.  As the smoke is somewhat milder than pot, I packed it big and took in all down in one long slow hit.  I tapped out the bowl and was about to pack it full of pot when I felt the full effect of the Salvia creep up all over.<br><br>
I could feel myself being pulled back from the real world into a state of delerium.  I was totally unprepared for the experience and I found myself saying 'Oh, fuck!  What have I done!'  I stepped into a puddle and found myself falling down the rabbit hole. Soon enough I found that I was about as far down as I was going to go,I relaxed a little bit and enjoyed the situation.  It is fortunate that I have had experiences with LSD and mushrooms before so I was prepared to handle the Salvia trip, no matter which way it decided to go.<br><br>
Everything in my vision seemed to blur and what I experienced wasn't the walls melting reality morphing hallucinations of acid.  The best I can describe it is as a waking dream stretched over the framework of the visual world.  I saw hands and arms bordering my vision and the sensations of thousands of fingers touching my body.  It felt like I was being carried overhead by and army of people 1 inch tall.  It could of been unpleasent but I find that these things are usually just best if you roll with it and enjoy the ride.<br><br>
I 'woke' from my daze and sat up in total amazment, it was just as intense as acid (if not more) and was only about 15-25 minutes in duration.  I paked another bowl and went down again.  This time I was staring at the glowing ember at the end of a stick of insense.  I could feel myself being pulled back away from 'reality' again with this glowing ember marking the center of my vision.  The darkened room behind sort of blended itself into a chaotic field with no horizon.<br><br>
It felt like being on the inside of a globe filled with choas; like the stain on the wall after God has exploded.  There was no reference to distance because the only point of reference was this glowing ember, which had ceased to be insense and was now just a ball of light.  I could see a bluish sort of umbilical cord connecting me to this ball of light and I knew without looking around that there were others connected to it too although I did not see them.  At this point a voice started speaking almost tauntingly.<br><br>
'Who do you want to be?', it asked.  'You know you can be anybody you choose to be.'<br><br>
I sort of did an indexed search of all the various aspects of my psyche and realised that this voice was right.  I could focus on anyone of these and literally change who I am.  Unfortunatly this is a double edged sword because as good as I can become is also as bad as I can become.  A saint or a serial killer.  They are both in me, as they are both in everyone at some level.  This distressed me a little bit to say the least, but it is something that I have probably already known.  Needless to say I didn't make any decisions and am currently still who I was beforehand, however a little older and a little wiser.<br><br>
So in retrospect I can say that Salvia comes to those who wait, and that expectations can kill it.  Also it is definitly not a kicking back after work, mellow out in the basement kind of high.<!-- End Body -->
