 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first started taking phentermine, it gave me a real buzz. I would bound through each day with plenty of energy and moments of euphoria. It made me happy and very talkative. It's not as full on as taking speed though. The downside is that I would find it difficult to get to sleep. I just never felt tired. It suppressed my appetite and I did lose a little bit of weight, which is the reason I was prescribed phentermine in the first place.\r\nNow, after 3 months of daily use, I don't get the original euphoric feeling. It still makes me alert, but my appetite is creeping back.   I now take xanax nightly to help me sleep. \r\nAm I addicted to phentermine? It's possible. I don't use phentermine on the weekend and don't feel any withdrawls. If I were to go without it for a longer period I don't think I'd cope very well. I will have to stop taking it soon, as I feel it is supposed to only be used as a temporary aid to weight loss. I will miss my daily pick me up.\n\n\n"
