I had read everything that I could find about 5-MEO-DiPT, which unfortunately wasn't much. However, all sources generally agreed that it was a mild trip with some visual distortions and strong aphrodisiac properties. I found the trip to be substantially, but not entirely, different.<br><br>
My friend and I dissolved 250 mg 5-MEO-DiPT in 250 ml filtered water. Then, we each measured out 12 mg and drank it. It tasted vile! My friend was on Paxil, as she has a prescription for it, and had eaten recently. I hadn't eaten for a few hours, and we had both been smoking pot all day. I had also taken aleve and advil earlier that day.<br><br>
As soon as I felt onset, I experienced a throbbing headache and painful nausea. I curled up on a couch as I felt a little floaty and saw mild visual distortions. I took two tylenols for the headache, and then went outside to smoke some pot, in hopes of making the nausea subside.<br><br>
The pot caused the trip to soar to the peak. My friend and I took a short walk over to a bench that lies under a tree near her house. I layed down and experienced some of the most intense visuals I've ever seen. It looked like I was in a painting; everything was abstract, yet we both agreed that everything was symmetrical. The places where light shone through the leaves of the trees started swirling around in a spiral. In fact, everything was swirling. I also experienced a constant rush that I can only liken to being on coke. However, I was totally clear-headed, and the only mindfuck I experienced was from the marijuana. This was interesting, but unenlightening. I wondered why everyone describes the drug as a potent aphrodisiac, because sex would have been an impossibility.<br><br>
We walked back to my friend's house to lay on her couches. The fluffiness felt really nice. After about an hour or two since I first peaked, the effects started to wear off. The intense hallucinations became distortions, and my back started to hurt, the way that LSD makes it. I felt incredibly horny and wanted to go home and masturbate, so I called a cab (no WAY was I driving!)<br><br>
We smoked some pot in her driveway as we waited for the cab to come. This kicked the trip up considerably and I started hallucinating again. <br><br>
By the time I got home, I was exhausted, but I experienced too much insomnia to sleep. Masturbation was fun, especially orgasm. After many hours, I finally fell asleep.<br><br>
The next day, I felt groggy, not radiant afterglow-y like after an LSD trip.<br><br>
It was an interesting and fun drug that I plan on doing again. However, LSD still reigns as my drug of choice.<!-- End Body -->
