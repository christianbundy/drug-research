 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI previously had used DXM and Effexor (venlafaxine) together without incident, so I assumed that taking DXM and Wellbutrin (buproprion) together would go much the same.  In my particular case, the positive aspects of the DXM experience itself were diminished completely, and I felt very unenergetic.  In fact, I continued to feel fatigued for several days after ingesting DXM.  For almost an entire week, I wanted to do nothing but rest in bed, getting up only to eat or use the restroom.  <br>Thankfully, I was in between school semesters when this happened, and I work only when school is in session.  There would have been no way I could have functioned either at work or at school.  I fully recovered after about a week, but I'm lucky that in my ignorance I did not end up seriously hurt or dead.  I once again was taught that I never can be too informed about any of the drugs I choose to take, especially regarding drug interactions.\n\n\n"
