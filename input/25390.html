Being interested in shamanic ways, I was of course intrigued by the most commonly used Amazonian psychedelic, Ayahuasca.  Wanting to understand the subtleties the ingredients had to offer, I decided to try them out individually, and combine them when satisfied.<br><br>
NOTE:  I seem to have an EXTREME tolerance to psychedelics.  I have taken 1 hit of acid, ingested 900 morning glory seeds at once, smoked several grams of dried Salvia Divinorum out of bong, on several occasions.  Then I wanted to try an extract, smoked 1 gram of Salvia 5x by myself (used bong).   Ingested 14 g of Mimosa Hostilis extract. ALL to NO effect other then a sense of nausea or minor personality changes, nothing magical.  Most of these states I have been able to successfully induce via meditation. <br><br>
Preparation:  Grind 14g of seeds, eat them, chase with water.  Also have not eaten in 12 hours.<br><br>
These are the recorded events in the order which experienced.  <br><br>
1:18 Syrian rue taken 14 g<br><br>
1:51 Light mellow high, barley noticeable nausea<br><br>
2:22-2:40 I had to hurry to the bathroom, (diarrhea), also where I threw up 3x, then to the kitchen trying to get some water because I choked on my own vomit, throw up some more, about 8x, water is 10 feet away but cant move.<br><br>
2:44 Lot of zoning out<br><br>
2:45 Ego seems dissolved<br><br>
3:00-5:30 Laid on bed, had to get up and throw up 2x, tried to smoke weed, couldnt threw up again.  Back to bed, fell into dreams almost at will, no CEV, or any type of visuals for that matter. Slept<br><br>
6:05 pretty much down<br><br>
3:09 Peaceful <br><br>
Conclusion:  This is not psychedelic!!   Then again NOTHING has worked for me except high doses of cannabis.  Combos have yet to be tried but most certainly will soon.  I didnt have but a joint with me, if I did it most certainly would have been a less painful experience, so I would have some cannabis handy.<!-- End Body -->
