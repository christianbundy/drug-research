I have only had one experience with datura, and though i have considered taking datura again, i am not sure i ever would.  I remember my friend Sean was reading Lycaeum articles and experiences about datura and he was looking for someone to join him in doing it.  At the time, I was willing to try any drug without reading or researching about it at all.  My logic was that I would be able to sense the equilibrium that my body could survive and since my mind is not real, i don't have to worry about the survival of it.<br><br>
Anyway, my friend Sean found some datura growing behind a small garbage dump near where he used to go school.  Sean and I ground up some datura and made tea out of it in Sean's tea strainer shaped like a little house.  As usual Sean chickened out and I became his more than willing guinea pig.  After about ten minutes out from drinking the vile potion, my mouth became extremely dry and my body was incredibly weak.  I could not drink enough water.  I did not even consider the fact that I may have poisoned myself.  I kept flashing to a world where i was part of what seemed to be a slave train.  Me and my fellow slaves were racked (as in wooden racks holding our hands next to our heads) and chained together and being forced to march.  One of the times when I flashed back to the 'real' world, I looked down at my hand to see that it was charred and oozing puss.  The flashes continued until i very easily (and perhaps stupidly) went to sleep.<br><br>
The notable thing about this seemingly mundane trip was the reality of the flashes that I was experiencing.  All of the other experiences that I have had (with the exception of DXM) have been surreal or unreal whereas the vision of marching into oblivion for reasons that my altered self could not call up was so unbelievably vivid and detailed that it has forced me to question whether a place like that truly exists.  I could feel the pain and desperation both physical and mental that someone in that situation must feel.  It was beyond anything I had ever experienced.  It was what I would call hell.  Definitely not for the squeamish.  I know that there are those who hear something like that and think 'Wow!  Cool!  I can't wait until my seeds arrive!'  and that's a good way to end up in a stretcher or better yet a coffin (or urn, etc depending on your will).  I am no chemist, but I have been told that datura contains neurotoxin and having experienced it's effects first hand (no pun intended) I would not suggest its use unless one is looking for a serious and sobering awakening.<br><br>
Datura is definitely NOT a recreational drug.<!-- End Body -->
