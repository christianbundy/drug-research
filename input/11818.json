 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had read about kava kava smoked by some people so I decided to do some first hand investigating.<br>I went to an herb store in my city and bought about 2 ounces of fresh Kava Kava (none of the emptying the pills, drinking tea shit) for 6 bucks.  Pretty cheap! <br>T+ 00:00<br>I packed the first bowl and smoked it in a few minutes, it burns almost as good as tobacco.<br>T+ 00:05<br>Mild effects, but not much.  Packed the second bowl and smoked it.<br>T+ 00:09<br>Effects settling in very nicely.  It's surprisingly stronger than I expected from the reports, but nice.<br>T+ 00:15<br>I've reached full effects, it's similar to being stoned, but relatively aware.  Everything is moving a little bit slower, and I'm really, really relaxed.  Definately something to use after a hard day.<br>It's T+ 00:35 now and I still feel all the effects, I now love Kava Kava.  And the best part is... it's LEGAL.  Don't listen to thoughs who say there is no effects. <br>It is an awesome, tranquil euphoria.  If you go in to it expecting very little, you will come out with an awesome experience.\n\n\n"
