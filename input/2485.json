 "report": "</p>\nA 17-year-old girl from Oslo died late Sunday night after taking a toxic ecstasy tablet one week earlier. It's suspected that the 'Mitsubishi' pill she had taken may have contained a cheap but deadly amphetamine substitute, PMA. </p><p>The teenager went into a coma last Sunday and was taken to Buskerud central hospital. She never regained consciousness. </p><p>Light-brown tablets were discovered in her jacket pocket with a Mitsubishi car logo on one side and a cross on the other. </p><p>White tablets with the same markings have claimed the lives of two men in Denmark this summer. Theses pills contained the amphetamine substitute known as PMA, or 4 methoxy metamphetamine. </p><p>The tablets found on the girl have not yet been analysed.</p>"
