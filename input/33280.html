-Setting-&gt;: In between a rock and a large pine tree, in my woods<br><br>
-time-&gt;: around 5pm<br><br>
-mood of day--&gt;: Gray sky, warm<br><br>
-mood of myself--&gt;: I was in a good state of mind, and well-being<br><br>
To start off my story I would just like to say how one needs to build a respect for plants and how they can take you to places you've never been before.<br><br>
This was my 1st trip of any kind. My friends R. and RR. my brother A. were all there to watch me smoke some. R and RR bought it and got it in the mall the other night, and they both tryed it. R. said that he was a 'farmer' and how he 'lost his body and was another being'. Hearing this not only did I get anxious to try it, I was thinking if I would lose my state of mind and become something else. RR. then told me how he was a 'peice of a train' and when he was 'broken off' he was lost and had no idea what he was, or where he was.<br><br>
So after talking about their experience the other night, I sat in between a rock and a huge beautiful pine tree that has been very special to me since I can remember. R. packed and told me just to hit it like as if it was weed and just try to hold it in a little longer, if I could. I took a large hit for my standards and held it in for about 40 seconds. After I exhaled I felt very light headed and noticed how I liked the taste. Everything became much more elaborate, and I felt like I was going fast so I took another hit. This time, I could only hold it in for about.. 10 seconds because I was gone. <br><br>
Everything was very elaborate and I could see figours and lines out of almost everything, as if it enhansed my vison and my 'skill' to see patterns out of everything. After this everything became very bright and my head jerked to the right (not to the left) I looked up and saw the tree that I was sitting under, and it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I then closed my eyes to see the beauty in my head, wanting to be in this state for the rest of internity. The second I closed my eyes, I saw this thing, the most beautiful thing I could ever see in my whole life, it was grayish chrome, and was bubbled almost and was a shape that can't be explained, but only remembered. Thats when I lost my body, and became one with the tree I was sitting under. It was as if this 'aura' took me and put me into the tree. I was maybe 500 feet up in the tree (although its not that tall, but it's tall). I was in a different state of mind, and one that is like at the state of nirvana. This lasted what seemed forever, and I to this day only wish it was. <br><br>
I slowly came back to my body, and was once again myself. <br><br>
this being a very good trip, I love Salvia and I respect this plant, and now have a better understanding of earth, and myself. Salvia enlightened me. Now every time I smoke Salvia I always see the same figour in my head. Me and my friend H. think its my Aura, which gives us a whole new out look on life.<!-- End Body -->
