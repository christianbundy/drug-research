The combination that I tried on this day was a poor choice, but not for reasons you may think. The problem was that I had difficulty telling which effects were coming from which drug. <br><br>
T-0: My friends and I each take two hits of high quality, 90microgram LSD hits.<br><br>
T-10m: We smoke several bowls of marijuana to pass the time until come-up.<br><br>
T-2h: At last, the acid has kicked in. This is the smallest dose of LSD Ive ever taken, so there are no hallucinations to speak of.<br><br>
T-3h: I decide to go to rugby practice, knowing that because Im not tripping too hard, there will likely be no issues. Right as I get to the pitch, mild hallucinations begin, mainly due to cloud formations.<br><br>
T-3.5h: This LSD, incidentally, is quite potent. Ive begun to grow very confused, but not to an uncomfortable degree.<br><br>
T-5h: Knowing that there is a huge party tonight, my trip mates and I take 20mg of amphetamine salts each.<br><br>
T-7.5h: In the past hour, my friends and I have begun to drink a very large amount of alcohol. LSD has always kept me from getting truly drunk, and I take advantage of this by drinking ~15 shots of tequila and ~5 beers. (Note: I DO NOT RECOMMEND drinking this much EVER, as it can have serious consequences.)<br><br>
T-8h: Not outwardly drunk, my friends and I each take three large shots of Absinthe. After this point, I have a very detailed account of the evening, mostly because of the amphetamine salts but possibly also due to the Absinthe. I have no hallucinations whatsoever, but feel very good and free. Although it seems preposterous, from this point on is the LEAST weird Ive felt all day.<br><br>
T-8h  T-14h: This period of time went on like a typical party. Plenty of drinking and merrymaking, but very little psychedelic activity. Im not sure what caused this to happen, but it most certainly did. Thanks to the large quantity of alcohol, Im able to fall asleep right away, something I usually cant do on LSD.<br><br>
Epilogue: I felt incredible the next day, with no hangover but an appreciation for enjoyment. Although I wont do this combination ever again due to its non-psychoactive nature, I enjoyed it as a 'hard head' for a more infantile, basic high.<!-- End Body -->
