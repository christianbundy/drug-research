 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n2C-E\r\nDosage: 5.2mg\r\nSet: Stable and relaxed.\r\nSetting: Sunday in the house with wife and 2 house cats.\r\nThis was my first experience with 2CE.  I couldnt find a report of a single dose this low for 2CE.  I am a firm believer in getting familiar with the shallow end before entering the deep end with any substance.  And of course sharing these experiences is equally important.  So here it is.\r\n12pm  Took a crumb from the bag of 2CE to make sure there werent any lab mix-ups.\r\n2pm  Still at baseline so I take 5.2mg.\r\n3:30pm-8:30pm  This is the duration for what was a very light peak.  \r\nThe overall effects at this dose for me were: \r\n- Surfaces have a soft glow.\r\n- There were light waving hallucinations are only noticed when I stare at the floor for longer than 20 seconds.\r\n- My energy was increased and transformed into a giddy, nervous tone that was fully manageable.\r\n- My thoughts are a bit jumbled but I was still able to take business calls as well as talk to my mother on the phone.\r\nConclusion: Although not a dose I would repeat again, it worked as a friendly introduction to what I expect to be a challenging ally.  It was a light enough effect that I would consider doubling the dose for the next trail.\n\n\n"
