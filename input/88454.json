 "report": "<p>2C-E</p><p>Dosage: 5.2mg</p><p>Set: Stable and relaxed.</p><p>Setting: Sunday in the house with wife and 2 house cats.</p><p>This was my first experience with 2CE.  I couldnt find a report of a single dose this low for 2CE.  I am a firm believer in getting familiar with the shallow end before entering the deep end with any substance.  And of course sharing these experiences is equally important.  So here it is.</p><p>12pm  Took a crumb from the bag of 2CE to make sure there werent any lab mix-ups.</p><p>2pm  Still at baseline so I take 5.2mg.</p><p>3:30pm-8:30pm  This is the duration for what was a very light peak.  </p><p>The overall effects at this dose for me were: </p><p>- Surfaces have a soft glow.</p><p>- There were light waving hallucinations are only noticed when I stare at the floor for longer than 20 seconds.</p><p>- My energy was increased and transformed into a giddy, nervous tone that was fully manageable.</p><p>- My thoughts are a bit jumbled but I was still able to take business calls as well as talk to my mother on the phone.</p><p>Conclusion: Although not a dose I would repeat again, it worked as a friendly introduction to what I expect to be a challenging ally.  It was a light enough effect that I would consider doubling the dose for the next trail.</p>"
