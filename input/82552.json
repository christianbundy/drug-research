 "report": "<p>This was several years ago, but I thought I'd post my experiences up as a warning to others.</p><p>I got some Halcyon in Mexico, as the pharmacist told me it was just like Valium, only better.  Being young and dumb, I took him at his word and did not do any research on them before ingesting.  When I got home, I took a few (I can't recall the exact dosage), along with some methamphetamines (another consequence of being young and dumb).  It seemed to be just like another benzo, and I went to bed as usual.  </p><p>The next morning, however, my girlfriend informed me that I'd attacked her and tried to strangle her, while speaking in tounges.  Even years later, I do not have even fragmentary images of the incident, but judging by her bruises her account of what happened was correct.</p><p>All in all, I'd never go anywhere near this stuff again, and it's not worth the risk.  Stay away!</p>"
