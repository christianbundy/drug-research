On a windy Thursday morning I ingested 230mg of methylone from a reputable supplier.  It had only been in my possession for a week.<br><br>
I've plenty of experience with psychedelic drugs, both the usuals and the RC's.  Lately I've been on vacation from drugs, pursuing sober life, trying to manifest the changes I've seen I need to make to be proud of myself.  I meditate and do yoga, and I am very sensitive to changes in my psyche.  15mg of caffeine is too much for me.<br><br>
My state of mind going into the experience was not exactly positive.  Life is tough and I'm having trouble transitioning from passive to active life.  Wednesday was my 21st birthday, which I spent alone.  Basically I was too depressed to want to talk to anyone.<br><br>
So this morning I got up, did my beach yoga with the rising sun, wrapped the pungent chemical in some paper and ate it.  I was already feeling better than the night before.<br><br>
10:47 +230mg methylone<br><br>
In ten minutes I took a shower and did some dishes.  Then I packed my backpack with some music, a sketchbook, and some sweet Faber-Castell markers.<br><br>
I sat on the beach and tried to meditate as the chemical set in.  I burped a couple times and tasted the chemical.  <br><br>
11:30<br><br>
Possible first alert.<br><br>
12:00<br><br>
I try laying down in the sunshine and listening to some music.  It was really very nice, but not any nicer than usual<br><br>
12:20<br><br>
I wonder if the chemical is going to kick in.  I wrapped it in a receipt, and I wonder if receipt paper is harder for the stomach to digest than tissue or toilet paper.  It seems unlikely.  <br><br>
I move to a bench and start to draw the sun shining through clouds.  A priest professor from the university comes over and lights up a cig.  I make some conversation, hoping that this chemical shines with social interaction.  We have an interesting talk about literature, but nothing unusual.<br><br>
I finish up my picture and its pretty sweet.<br><br>
2:00<br><br>
I go to eat in the cafeteria alone, and sit down next to some random chick.  I usually try and do this kind of thing, and we usually talk.  I get her number, nothing too unusual.<br><br>
So I never really ended up feeling anything.  My heart rate didn't increase that much, although I was a tiny bit sweatier than usual.  I tried to do some yoga towards the end of the experience and it wasnt any different than usual.  I would describe the experience as similar to eating blotter before it has been saturated with a drug, or like being around drunk people.  I ended up in a good-ish mood, but I wasn't smiling or anything.  Also, all my normal social anxiety was fully present when talking to the chick.<br><br>
I don't really have any way to explain my reaction.  I don't have any special allergies or anything, and it was my first time with an 'entactogen'.  For all the psychedelics I've tried, I have avoided MDMA.  I wonder if it has to do with the extent to which I used to trip - other experience reports talk about life-critiquing experiences which made them want to change bad habits or something, whereas that is all I think about, ever.  I'll definitely try it again, as I have a couple grams of the stuff left over and it would be a bad idea to try and share it without having experienced it myself first.<!-- End Body -->
