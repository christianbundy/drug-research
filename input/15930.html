I myself have been recreationally using the drug for about 3 to 4 years now, off and on.  I think that it is a great drug, whose good effects are outweighed by its bad.  I have experimented with other painkillers such as percocet/percodan, darvocet, hydrocodone, and codeine, I find Ultram to be the best by far, for the simple fact that it lasts the longest.  <br><br>
I enjoy going to bed on it and getting the impression that the Ultram itself is waking me up intermittently to remind me of its presence, I wake up oftentimes at 5:00 a.m. in a euphoric state for no apparent reason.  Also, it makes mundane activities (such as going to work) very enjoyable.  it also has the somewhat bizarre effect of making me want to do my schoolwork.  I also of course love it in social situations.  <br><br>
The downsides to this drug are that it is addicting.  Also, when I take it I can get easily irritated on high doses (6-8 pills).  another thing is that after a few days of continuous use I will get a splitting headache, and all of my joints and muscles will ache, I have spent many a morning lying in bed thinking confusedly 'how can something that is supposed to cure pain cause so much pain?!'  But everything has its ups and downs and I find this to be the perfect drug.<!-- End Body -->
