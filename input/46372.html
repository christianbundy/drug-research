I remember before I moved away last summer there was talk of a plant called Datura. People were saying I could trip on it, so me already having done shrooms and acid thought ok lets give it a try. Datura is a plant that grew in my neighborhood with trumpet shaped flowers on it, but before these trumpet shaped flowers grow there are seed pods. Big round spikey pods, extended from vines in front of an old ladies house. <br><br>
My friend brian and I were total stoners looking to get fucked up, But we had no idea what we were in for. Word on the streets was that if I broke open these pods and consumed the seeds I would hallucinate.<br><br>
So we being the stupid stoners we are ate one full pod sat for about 15 minutes and were not feeling anything. After consuming about 350 of these seeds we thought we were superman niether of us tripping yet.<br><br>
We made our way to the park and I stated to feel strange I had the worst cotton mouth it felt like I smoked a pound of weed. Then I looked down at my legs as I trotted down the path way to the park, they looked and felt as if they were pendulums swinging back an forth. I finally got to the park and my friend steve was there he had some weed and I tried to smoke but couldnt it tasted vile and disgusting. My face began to feel as if it was melting of my skull. and I started to trip... bad<br><br>
As I lay in dismay my friends asked me if I was alright I replied saying I dont know tell that man with the sword to stay away. I thought I was in the revolutionary war in a trench. All of my friends were dressed in full combat gear. decided to go home because this shit was starting to freak me out so as I started to walk home my legs felt like they weighed a 1000 pounds and soon enough my arms felt this way also I realized I was fucked up and would probably die if I didnt get to a hospital. So I continued to try and walk home until I finally go there my parents werent home(thank god) so I went right to bed and fell asleep for about 4-5 hours<br><br>
When I awoke I walked down the stairs and fell right off the stair case, then I went to the bathroom I tried to piss but couldnt. Then I felt something wet in my pants and thought it was just water but I had pissed my self in reality. After I pissed my pants I heard my parent pull up and the entire bathroom went white I couldnt see a thing I was banging around so much, after my parents opened the door they found me on the floor passed out. complete red as my father described red as a lobster, <br><br>
When I awoke I was in a state of delirium, I didnt even recognize my own parents I kept asking who are you to my mother and calling my father a fat fuck, then they tried to ask me what I was on I tried to lie and say I was just smoking weed. They knew for goddamn sure I wasnt high on weed.<br><br>
I dont remember anything after that but my dad told me what I did he was hesitant at first because it had scared the living shit out of him he had never seen anything like this in his life, he told me that when I got to the hospital I tried to bite the doctors and beat them up. It required 4 doctors to strap me down, still my skin was a very red tone and when I was strapped down I tied so hard to get out my neck muscles bulged at least 4 inches from my body and then I passed out.<br><br>
I awoke the next morning to recognizing people again at close range my vision was so blurry I couldnt even read.<br><br>
Datura is the worst drug in the world.<!-- End Body -->
