 "report": "<p>In 2002 I posted a HPPD report describing my unusual experience with this disorder.  I thought I'd share whats happened to me since with regard to this condition, which is basically not a lot.  Since I last posted, I would estimate I have done ecstasy around 50 times, speed 100-200 times and ice about 50 times in addition to lesser amounts of acid, k, nitrous, amyl, salvia, heroin  (once) and too much dope and booze to count.  I barely notice the symptoms at all; I tripped for a week over new year with no after effects whatsoever!  Symptoms still appear sometimes if I smoke heavily (or eat cookies) and they can still sometimes suprise me with their vividness, but 95% of the time I forget that I've got this disorder.  So there is hope, and I would guess a large part of it takes the form of good quality meth!</p>"
