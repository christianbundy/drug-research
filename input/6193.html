It can be extremely dangerous to choose ones dose on the basis of the amount taken by someone else.  Overdoses of opiates can be fatal.] </font><br><br>
I have yet to read a report about OxyContin on this page, so I decided to write one of my experiences.  I use the drug recreationally.  Usually once every weekend or two.  This particular experience is when I did 120 mg.<br><br>
8:00 P.M. - Did first 40 mg pill.  Felt the warm, euphoric rush that generally comes with OC.  I felt really relaxed, but not really wild yet.  Along with the relaxation, I was somewhat energetic/talkative at the same time.  Nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>
9:00 P.M. - Did the second 40 mg pill.  This made the euphoria more intense.  I became more relaxed, and perfectly content to just sit and enjoy the buzz.<br><br>
11:00 P.M. - Did last 40 mg.  After this I was really wild.  I went to a friend's house to play pool.  My body was so relaxed I could only stand for about 5 minutes and then I would have to sit down.  I would nod in and out of consciousness.  I felt as good as I've ever felt in my life.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
The feeling I get from OxyContin is total euphoria.  It relaxes my body, my mind and makes me feel like everything is perfect.  There is no better or more comfortable place to be than where I am at.  This is similar to what I have read about heroin (although I have never tried it).  I have tried morphine however and I felt it slightly more strong in my body, but not nearly as much in my head.  If I were to compare the two I would have to say Oxy is much better.<!-- End Body -->
