I was hanging out with friends after a satisfying dinner which had included a beer and a couple of glasses of wine, fairly standard for myself and others. I had been given a bunch of dried damiana recently and decided it would be nice to smoke some, as it had a very pleasant aroma in the bag. <br><br>
I rolled up two cigs of the stuff and 4-5 of us shared both of them. we were all sitting and having a very interesting conversation, I remarked to my friend ' do you feel any different?' because I had noticed a very slight shift in my experience of things. She said she also had noticed some thing but couldn't really say what. we agreed it was somewhat marijuana like in effect but very weak and subtle, which was nice. Sometimes smoking weed can just knock me right out and is a bit much, the weed is getting really strong these days. And this damiana stuff was a relaxing departure from getting too stoned too fast.<!-- End Body -->
