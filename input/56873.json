 "report": "<p>I was put on lexapro over a year ago after I had a nervous breakdown followed by severe depression during recovery of an eating disorder.  I was crying like everyday and wanted to die, and after I started the lexapro, which actually should be dubbed the pussy of antidepressants, there wasn't really a day where I was like 'I feel better today.'  I cried maybe a little less often but still did not experience any actual joy in my daily routine.</p><p>The one thing I did notice during my four month tenure with lexapro is that it greatly diminished my social anxiety.  I am deathly afraid of public speaking and have come close to having a panic attack when forced to speak in front of people, but during my time on lexapro I actually tried out for a play.</p><p>Maybe it would have helped if the dose were a little higher, but it was not so I started doubling up on them and taking vicodin to feel better and after I was caught I was taken off the lexapro abruptly.  I did have a few months where I took a downturn, but after that my body started to do for itself what an antidepressant is supposed to accomplish anyways.</p>"
