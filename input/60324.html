Last night was my second time trying Salvia Divinorum and I was not trying to get as high as my first time trying it, but was trying it out for medicinal use since I have had a cold lately, so I loaded up a small bowl into my 14 inch bong and cleared the bowl in 1 hit, held the hit approximately 15 seconds then coughed it out since its harder for me to hold it in while sick, this produced a ringing noise in my ears and tingling sensation in my back, after about 3 minutes I loaded another (larger) bowl into the bong and cleared it in 1 hit as well, this time I was able to count to 30 and exhale, upon exhaling the typical trip started to set in, and I had mild visuals and the gravitational effects.<br><br>
After about 5 minutes these subsided and I just had a euphoric feeling and realized that my nose was no longer clogged, I no longer had a headache and I did not feel like I had a fever, I actually felt quite well, better than I usually do on normal days. After about 35-40 minutes the cold symptoms gradually came back however so this does not seem like a practical remedy for symptoms unless you take it just before bed so that you can fall asleep in peace. I am contemplating mixing Salvia Divinorum with tobacco and rolling it in a cigarette for possible symptom relief without hallucinogenic results when I am at work.<!-- End Body -->
