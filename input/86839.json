 "report": "<p>I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a year ago and since I was put on these medications my life has gone downhill.  A once outgoing person I became secluded and unwilling to meet other people.  Since then my anxiety has increased and have become a loner.  This all changed when I saw a different psychiatrist who said I have pain related depression (not sure what the actual diagnoses is).</p><p>Since I have been put on this medication I have been much more outgoing and my anxiety is waning.  I have been on suboxone for over three months now and I feel much better.  Although now I am trying to get off Seroquel for a while and it does drain me suboxone has taken away most of the side effects relating to Seroquel.  Before I was on Suboxone I could not study and my grades took a tumultuous dive along with my social skills.  Now that I have been put on this medication I have kept a steady 3.5 rather than the 2.0 I had at my old university.  Everyday tasks have become easier to do and I am able to do much more now that I am on this medication. Without this drug I do not know where I would be right now but I am glad I have it.</p>"
