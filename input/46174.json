Put it on my toungue,  got the whole dose at once. Got an Extremely nice high. Body...mindeverything.  <br>I get to my house... then the next thing I know paramedics are all around me and my dad is shaking me. Apparently I stopped breathing and was almost dead the EMT said.  Other people had experiences like this one also so I have read.   People   please be carefull  doses of Fentanyl are VERY strong when you put the patch in your mouth. fuckin A\n\n\n"
