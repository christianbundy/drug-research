   I inhaled. <br>
              I exhaled. <br><br>
A few seconds later, I was overwhelmed by the drug. The feeling was of urgent distress. I felt stuck, both physically and mentally. I could hardly move, but I crawled towards the balcony to look outside. I looked over at the building across from the one I was in. The wall was bending and swirling. I kept getting higher and higher.<br><br>
                Rocket <br>
                      brain.<br><br>
Regret set in, I wished the feeling would go away. As soon as I made the wish I realized it would not come true. I was on a drug, it was taking effect, and I had to bear that effect until it expired. I wanted to make the feeling go away. Throwing up and banging my head against the walls crossed my mind. I didnt do any of these things, I just kept sitting in front of the balcony door, watching the wall swirl and twirl.<br><br>
                Say goodbye <br>
                           to what you <br>
                                       'know'.<br><br>
Eventually I stopped getting higher, at which point I gave in to it. I accepted the feeling as part of me for the rest of the trip, and thoroughly enjoyed the comedown.<br><br>
The secret... let it flow through. I was trying to figure out the feeling... I was trying to gain control over it. Once I realized I had no control... once I gave up and let it push my mind around, I saw some incredible things.<br><br>
                    THE DOOR <br>
                          IS <br>
                            OPEN NOW.<br><br>
Everything around was alive, breathing, vibrating, communicating, with me. I was at a friends house, and his mother has a thing for frogs. There was a stuffed toy frog between me and the balcony door. I looked down at it and it told me a lot about what life at that particular apartment is like. It didnt open its mouth and speak, no. Just by looking at that frog I got a feel of the permanent mood of the apartment, and the people in it. <br><br>
                    Life...<br>
                            is enigma.<br><br>
That night I learned quite a few important lessons. In this life, the only thing you actually control is your own reactions to what is happening. Everything else is beyond your control. If you look carefully, a tiny rock on the side of the road could teach you a lot about the journey you are on. Nothing is insignificant.  <br><br>
Open your eyes, open your mind. Look around, at the big big wide picture. At our world, in which everything is the way it is. Why are YOU HERE? <br><br>
                     HAVE FUN<br>
                              trying  <br>
                                    to solve it!<!-- End Body -->
