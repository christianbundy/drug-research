Well, where to start..<br><br>
I remember thinking to  myself this isnt going to work, taking a big hit, then being surprised at how instantly the effects began.<br><br>
All of a sudden my whole vision turned into thousands of fractals, and my consciousness was fired through the fractals, arriving at what seemed to be a giant, fluorescent, rotating lattice. I seemed to float there a few seconds, before I was catapulted through the lattice, to a place of amazing colours and shapes. The dimensions of this place I found myself were confusing, jutting out in strange and alien angles. <br><br>
In the top right hand corner of my perception seemed to be some sort of multi armed pulsating being. It felt as if it was communicating something to me,  but all I could thinks about was whether I would ever come back or not.<br><br>
This perception lasted for about 10 mins, until I quite quickly slipped back to base level, feeling brighter (not an unpleasant hangover).<br><br>
This was my first experience with DMT, and have since become a seasoned traveller into that alien dimension.<br><br>
I have found that the more experiences I have had, the deeper into that realm I have travelled, resulting in what I felt was a total immersion trip. As soon as I smoked the bowl, I instantly found myself in a very physical place. No fractals, no rolling/floating experience. I found myself in a room as real as the one I sit in now, with a window overlooking a strange landscape, and in the centre of the room, what seemed to be a ball of crackling blue energy. <br><br>
It is worth saying that before I experienced DMT, I was a staunch realist, not remotely spiritual or metaphysical in any way, but DMT very quickly changed that.<br>
This trip was profoundly real, more so than any hallucinogenic experience I have ever had, and fully convinced me of the multitude of alternative dimensions there must be..we are just on a layer in the onion my friends!!!!!<br><br>
This is a truly remarkable substance, and a truly alien experience, that should defiantly be treated with the up most respect.<!-- End Body -->
