 "report": "<p>I am a 42 year- old woman, a perfectly healthy physician, who has been going through an atypical depression (hypersomnia,...). </p><p>I have been recieving, thanks to my psychiatrist, Paxil (paroxetine) 40 mg /day and Modiodal (modafinil) 200 mg/day. Since I started Modafinil my life has been very different: I have a lot more energy, I sleep much less during the day, and I can do almost a normal life (except from driving). </p><p>I have been really satisfied with that drug, but a month ago, although I have been a perfectly healthy woman (except for my depression), I have been experiencing high blood pressure, tachicardia and most of all, arrythmias, and also angor pectoris (angina). I suspended Modiodal 5 days ago, and I still have arrythmias and angor. I would like to know if these symptoms are reversible. Now I feel deperessed again, but also feeling those cardiac effects, which are worse that the depression alone, or the non-depression and cardiac symptoms.</p>"
