 "report": "<p>Weeks of procrastination and poor time management.</p><p>23:30, I decide to do some physics. I take 200mg of Modafinil and 10mg Ritalin. </p><p>00:30 Noticed a slight tingle in my lips 10 minutes ago and decided that the recent auditory change warranted a report. I just noticed a sort of pressure change in my ears.</p><p>I was very focused in on my work, much more than with Modafinil or Ritalin alone. I don't even want to write this report, I want to go back to my work. But since I plan on staying up all day on both substances, I'd figure posterity would want something from it.</p><p>My eyes are a bit light sensitive, they've been open all day so I'm guessing just tired. I've dimmed the lights in my room to just a desk lamp pointed away from me into a closet. </p><p>My heart rate is about 90bpm. Ive also taken 2x220mg Naproxen sodium, 800mg Ibuprofen. (bad back)</p><p>01:00 heart rate is about 98bpm. Im able to focus deeply on.</p><p>01:13 (Crap I just realized I was distracted by my internet mid sentence.) I took another 10mg Ritalin, chewed it up. Back to work.</p><p>01:19 2x81mg Aspirin</p><p>02:00 Focused as all hell. Equally as sore from sitting.</p><p>03:00 I feel pretty good, aside from my pain. Im awake. Focusing is good, Im thinking clearly and am able to multitask yet accomplish. Heart rate 100bpm.</p><p>04:42 Slowing down, heart at 84bpm. Drive to read is gone, I feel like just sitting and breathing slowly, perhaps laying down. </p><p>04:57 I ate PB&J sandwich, 2x10mg Ritalin, 1x200mg Modafinil.</p><p>06:00 100bpm. Back to work.</p><p>06:51 some chest pain, heart burn maybe, right side of chest. A fullness to my head like an almost drunken warmth. Ill bet my blood pressure is really high right now. Taking 1x81mg aspirin</p><p>I continued to take the Modafinil about every 4-5 hours, and the Ritalin every 3-4. I noticed that when I was losing the effects of the Ritalin I was zoning out and becoming sadder. When the Modafinil was wearing off, but the Ritalin wasnt, I was awake but feeling sleep deprived, my vision was taxed and I would start to mildly hallucinate with an unpleasant headache feeling. Very jittery and stimulated feeling. When both of them were working I felt awake and good, slightly euphoric, but less euphoria each time I redosed. Focused, and the jitters went away. The Modafinil seemed to keep my mind awake, and the Ritalin my body. I took 5 Modafinil throughout the day, and about twice that many Ritalin. </p><p>21:30 Going to bed now with a bit of a headache.</p>"
