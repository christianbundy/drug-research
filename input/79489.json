 "report": "<p>aprox 23.45  - 1 small key 15-20mg</p><p>23.53 Feel very happy good to talk to people over the phone, would be worried about being in public due to gurning as normal for me with stimulants and serotonin antagonists.</p><p>12.16 Had another 15-25mg key going for cigarette enjoying feeling deep breathing and the feeling of 'coming up' again. Product very morish even though I know I have important things to do tomorrow also had 1/3 litre of vodka done with 2 drinks vodka and orange 50/50</p><p>Went for cigarette, still a bit gurney but feeling good, nice an replacing with a rush running in the back ground similar to mdma. Nice to have a cigarette v relaxing. Bit of dry mouth so advised to drink water.</p><p>Being in a suitable place is recommedended due to physical effects i.e. jaw.</p><p>Good fun all round and more reliable than illegal substances. But my experience with chemicals in this category is that if taken in moderation than the negatives are similar to drinking.</p><p>Bigben60 - taken most drugs besides crack and heroin</p>"
