I got two flowers and boiled them in about 750ml water for 20 minutes. After the tea was done it was a slightly bright green. I squeezed the remaining water out of the flowers and put the tea in a jug in the freezer to cool down. 20 minutes later the tea had cooled down to about luke-warm temperature, so I measured out 390ml and added ice cubes. I drank this over about  10 minutes while I was on the phone. It tastes better after adding the ice cubes. It kinda tastes like the water after boiling vegetables in it. Not too bad, but there's definitely better tastes. This was at 8:15 PM<br><br>
I then went and did stuff on the computer for 15 minutes, and I noticed the edges of my eyes had started to blur just a little bit, but I could still read. I stood up to go to the toilet but I couldnt make it, my legs were bendy springs. I managed to stumble to the toilet, and look at the mirror. It was just me, not magic talking person, but I looked at my pupils and they covered almost 3/4 of the colored part of my eye. Over the next half hour nothing excited happening while I was watching tv, so I went to bed (took a few tries with my bendy legs). I watched tv for a few hours (until about 11 PM). I dozed off a little and woke up a while later to find my girlfriend sitting on the end of my bed. I reached out to touch her here and she disappeared. 'Weird' i thought to myself. I looked at the tv and something crap was on so I changed the channel. <br><br>
After that I kept falling asleep (or maybe I just thought i did), and everytime I was asleep I would see someone different in  my room and I would talk to them, but I had to whisper because if i talked out loud my voice would wake me up (if i was actually asleep). After 'waking' I could see the person for a few more seconds, then they would disappear and I would see they were actually things from my room. My girfriend's mom was actually a chair with clothes on it, and one of my friends was a pile of blanket.<br><br>
In between seeing people I would 'wake up' doing strange things. Because my bed is against the wall I would wake up facing the wall. One time I was eating cheese pizza, and I swear I could taste it, then it would slide down the gap between my bed and the wall and be gone forever. I thought o well, and went back to sleep. Another time I woke up doing crosswords in the newspaper and then the newspaper slid down the gap, and I tried to get it out with the pen, and lost the pen as well.<br><br>
Again I woke up facing the tv and smoking. I put the smoke under the blanket and then realised what a stupid idea it was, so I pulled my hand out as quick as I could and dropped my smoke. I jumped up before it could burn my leg and looked for it, but it wasn't there. I never had a smoke. I had finished my pack earlier that day. This happened again about 2 hours later. I seemed to be 'waking up' every 10 to 20 minutes. I still didnt know if i was actually sleeping or not. During this time I never actually realised I was tripping. I only realise that now.<br><br>
The second last and most weirdest thing was I woke up at 4 in the morning and there was a preacher woman on tv. I swear she was talking to ME. I sat there and listened to her for an hour, because I thought she could see me and was talking to ME and if I went to sleep she would send me to hell. Then she said 'come here, lets go to the prayer chair' so I got up and walked to the TV but she never gave me a chair. After about 5 minutes I sat back down on the bed. Her eyes seemed to follow me, increasing the feeling that she was talking to ME. I had to try really hard to convince her I wasnt into praying and then her show ended. I changed the channel and went back to sleep. Twice during all my other experiences I woke up thinking I was at my girlfriends house and I wondered why it looked so different and I'd call out for her and realise where I was. I stopped waking up after 6. <br><br>
Mum woke me up at 7 in the morning to get ready for school. I got my clothes and went to the shower. I wondered how come my girlfriend didnt walk to the shower with me. I went back to my room and couldnt see her, so I thought she mustve gone to the shower when I came back to look for her. I walked back to the shower, and she wasnt there. It was then that I realised that she didnt stay over the night before. Luckily I hadnt said anything stupid to my mum. My pupils had mostly gone back to normal. I actually felt quite refreshed that day, and didnt see any after effects till about midday. I was writing something and suddenly a star appeared at the end of my pen. It whirled around in front of my face and then shot out the window. It was really bright. Nothing else happened until I went to bed. I turned the light off and the star shot out of my stereo display and it went wherever I wasnt looking. I could not look straight at it because it would move. I knew I was seeing things so I put my head under the blanket and went to sleep.<br><br>
Now today nothing weird has happened yet.<!-- End Body -->
