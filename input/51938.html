I work in a pharmacy and have been taking small amounts of pills for experimenting for some time now. I noticed one day a number of large bottles on the top shelf in the back counter area of the pharmacy. A bottle of Chloroform caught my eye. I remember in movies how the characters use chloroform to render their targets or victims unconscious. I have always wanted to try an anesthetic on myself and this was my opportunity. I decided to take a negligible amount from the bottle, since it was barley ever used.<br><br>
Later that night, some friends came over to my place. We snorted some Vicodin sat back and relaxed. I feel I may have built up a tolerance to the drug, but I still felt sedated and content. My friends left an hour later and I was alone. I researched Chloroform a bit little before trying it. I have no prior experience of huffing any kind of ether, paint thinner, etc. So I was in the dark on how to administer the drug to myself. I decided that the best way would be to soak a small rag in the chloroform and place the rag into a paper bag. At 12:10 am, I took my first deep breath from the bag. The chloroform had a surprisingly sweet taste. The taste eventually turned into a rubber cement odor/taste after the second inhalation. I did three consecutive breaths from the bag and sat back.<br><br>
My mind suddenly became cloudy. I looked around and chuckled a few times. I felt light as a feather but then I couldn't move. I needed to take more I thought. After two more large breaths I sat back again. This time My vision began to change from a bright white to a dark black. I took two more breaths. I cannot recall my actions after that. My brother told me that he saw me dancing around for a minute or two then pass out. I felt like I slept the whole night. After I came to, it was only 12: 22am. <br><br>
I woke up clearheaded and refreshed. A common side effect of chloroform in severe or mild headaches but the Tylenol in the Vicodin probably helped me in avoiding one. I would recommend chloroform and will use it again. My advice is to use it in a safe and comfortable environment. I ran around, passed out, and felt great for twelve minutes. Maybe I should try a larger amount with just a rag? I assume only a high dose of chloroform will cause unconsciousness but I am not willing to accept the risk of full anesthesia.<!-- End Body -->
