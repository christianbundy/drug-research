 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell to start off Im an addict an any addict who is not in denial will be able to tell you that once an addict always addict. That doesnt mean I am still using just means I have no self control. My drug of choice was Meth, Terrible drug, sucks you in and by the time you realize and the drug goes all loco on you its to late. <br>I quit with such ease it was rather mind blowing to some, but what they didnt realize is I had researched all the withdrawal symptoms and then what Meds would cancel out each. I then went to a Psychiatrist and played all the plays I had to get what I needed. Long story short, this is what I am now taking daily, No abuse, only as prescribed: 600mg Seroquel, 150mg Venlor, 100mg Zoloft, 90mg Concentra<br>50mg Seroquel Morning and Lunch<br>150mg Venlor Morning<br>100mg Zoloft Morning<br>90mg Concentra Morning<br>500mg Seroquel Before Bed<br>This combination allowed me to have zero Meth withdrawal. Its the ultimate combo for getting clean, I went from smoking 2 Grams of meth daily to zero the next day. I'm living proof That there is a legal combo out there.\n\n\n"
