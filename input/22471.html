Mindset - Good mood, relaxed, relatively happy<br>
Preparations - None<br><br>
Prelude:  Prior to this night, I had tried LSA once before.  I had eaten 6.5 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds about 4 months before, and felt nothing other than a slight buzz and minor CEVs.  On this night, my friends J and M and I were in the mood to 'trip', and we decided to try a larger dose of Morning Glory seeds.  At ACE hardware, we acquired 4 5 gram packs of seeds each, giving us each a dose of 20 grams.  When we arrived back at M's, we discovered that he had 6 2 gram packs of seeds left over from our previous purchase.  Dividing these evenly between us, we each had a dose of 24 grams.<br><br>
T+0:  We began eating the seeds straight out of the pack.  The package claimed that the seeds had not been sprayed/treated with chemicals in any way.  This grew to be a daunting task, due to the hardness and horrible taste of the seeds.<br><br>
T+30 min.: After half an hour of hardcore crunching and gagging, I had successfully ingested my seeds.  M had given up after eating about 15 grams, but J had also finished all of his packs.  I will now report what I wrote/had M write for me in a notebook during the experience.<br><br>
T+1 hr.:  Slight giddy and cold feeling felt.  Also seeing visual disturbances, such as 'breathing' surfaces and light tie-dye colored patterns over my visual field.<br><br>
T+2 hr.:  Effects have GREATLY intensified.  I now realize that I have taken far too large of a dose.  My vision is completely obscured by the colorful patterns and objects that are constantly present.  I am also having extreme stomach pains and feel like I have poisoned myself.  I do not want to vomit, since I want to experience a strong trip on psychedelics.<br><br>
T+4 hr.:  Effects are even stronger.  The nausea and stomach pain have been reduced, due to ingestion of 1 small hit of marijuana.  I am now unable to comprehend reality.  The trip is extremely pleasurable at this time, and I am enjoying it, despite the strength.<br><br>
At T+5 hr.:  We decided to attempt to go to sleep.  This is when the trip took a turn for the worst and is 'When I Went Insane'.  I will now resume commentary on major events I remember.<br><br>
T+5 hr. 30 min.:  While attempting to go to sleep, I noticed that the colors and visual patterns would NOT go away.  If I closed my eyes, they simply grew more intense and brighter.  My mind was racing, thinking thousand of conflicting thoughts every second.  I began to become afraid that I had permanently 'fried my brain', and would never return to normal.  I looked over at J, and exclaimed 'I NEED TO FIND REALITY!!  WHERE IS REALITY?'  He responded 'Same!'  It appeared that he was in the same situation as I.<br><br>
T+7 hr.:  After living in my insane state for 2 hours, I began to adjust.  The trip was plateau-ing at this time, and was still going strong.  Since it was 3 A.M. and dark out, I didn't know that it was raining.  I began to hear a noise.  In my inebriated/altered state, it sounded like M was masturbating.  I didn't want to look over at M to verify this, since I still felt somewhat nauseous and it would have caused me to vomit.  <br><br>
I yelled out 'M, you fucking sick bastard.  What the hell do you think you are doing.  Here I am, fucking delusional and I'm dying and you are masturbating.  FUCK YOU! STOP MASTURBATING!'  He replied 'I'm not masturbating dude, it's raining.'  I thought he was trying to trick me, so this comment just further angered me and aggravated my already shaken mindstate.  I continued repeating 'Fuck you, M.  You sick fuck.' every few minutes for the next 2 hours, since I kept hearing the supposed 'masturbation sound' in my state, I completely forgot that no one could possibly masturbate for that long of a time.<br><br>
I finally fell asleep about 3 hours after this event occured.  When I woke up at T+13, I was still tripping HARD.  I had to go home, but didn't want to endanger myself and others by driving in that state.  I called my mom, and rambled off some shit like 'Hi mom I'm insane so I need a ride home.  I think I'm dead.  Is this the afterlife?' and such things.  After dropping off J at his house, mom asked me what I had done.  At this time I had managed to hide my marijuana/hallucinogen use from her for 4 years.  I told her that I had smoked too much weed and would be fine in a few hours.  <br><br>
As soon as I arrived at my house, I went to bed.  I slept for 12 hours and woke up at 1 A.M.  When I woke up, I had pretty much returned to baseline.  However, I still had minor open eye visual patterns for 2 weeks after the ingestion, and, to this day, about a year and a half after ingestion, I can stll see faint visual disturbances if I stare at an object.  These disturbances consist of seeing the 'breathing surfaces' phenomenon and seeing slight color patterns on the object.<br><br>
Moral of the story - I am not trying to convince anyone to not take LSA or other hallucinogens.  If you decide to try Morning Glory seeds, please have the common sense to take a moderate dose and not vastly overdo it like I did.  Completely losing your mind for a day is NOT fun.<!-- End Body -->
