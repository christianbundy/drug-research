 "report": "<p>I dose about 5 mg a half hour before I have sex. I have had some rather intense episodes prior to figuring out a standard dose. One can become rather cranked up on too much. </p><p>I am 49 yrs old and can achieve a very hard and super sensitive erection using the above. Aditionally, I have had up to four huge ejaculating orgasms in 1/2 hour (at my age!) without losing the erection. This is no BS. </p><p>This substance also works for females. My wife has reported way more intense orgasms. I notice much more moisture and tightness (due to swollen erectile tissue). Her clitoris can become twice the usual. Women should start with only 2mg.</p><p>This is the only substance that I have found to really come close to a true aphrodesiac.</p>"
