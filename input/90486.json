 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nCompounds I take daily:<br>Piracetam - 1200 mg <br>Phenibut - 750 mg<br>Vinpocetine - 10 mg<br>Noopept(another racetam) - 15 mg<br>Time from the last recreational substance usage: 1 day, it was 20 mg of 4-AcO-DMT - I didn't like it, but it is the whole different story.<br>5-methoxy-tryptamines I've tried(and loved): 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-DALT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MET. <br>Initial setting: my room. <br>Initial set: everything is alright, I am in a positive mood, had enough sleep today. I have no motivation for work or study, and I am bored a bit, so I decide to enhance my evening with some (hopefully) mild MeO experience.<br>T-0:15 I weight out 30 mg, but unsure if I dare to take whole dose.<br>T+0:00 I consume ~23 mg of 4-MeO-MiPT dissolved in ~100 ml of water. As for the most compounds, taste is chemically bitter, but quite tolerable. My stomach is empty, but I had light meal 90 minutes ago. <br>T+0:02 I eat some chocolate syrup to mask the taste, and and then put on headphones.<br>T+0:05 Some visual activity is noticed, very similar to 5-methoxy-tryptamines: darkening colors, increase of static, thick gray lines - this is what I call 5-MeO fingerprint. When I take psychedelics, I usually can feel something in my system within few minutes, but this is quite fast even for me. <br>T+0:09 Visuals are quite mild, but I think that they are distinct from placebo or my usual HPPD-like state.<br>T+0:16 Colors become even more darker, and typing posts on bluelight becomes more difficult - I am a bit altered, +1.5 maybe. Body feels nice, but it is not body high. I can easily blur my vision, which is another sign of alteration.<br>T+0:24-T+0:30 I have a telephone conversation with my girlfriend. No problems with putting thoughts into words, mood is lifted up. She's in another city, she's alright, and we exchange some funny nonsense, as we love to do. Actually, I love to tell nonsense more than she, but this doesn't really matter to this trip-report .<br>T+0:32 I am at +1.5 only, and no negative side effects are felt, so I decide that it is safe to take additional 7 mg dose, so my total dose becomes 30 mg.<br>T+1:05 Taking shower was really pleasant. Doing everything is niiiiiiiiiice. I am at +2.5, but no visuals. This seem strange, but I had a hypothesis. I put on headphones again and listen to Godhead for a while. I put off headphones. I put on them again. Aha! It is synaesthesia, and it is clearly distinct from my sober synaesthesia. Listeting to music, I notice all initial visuals + waving, blurring and very, very occasional patterns. And none of these visuals when music is turned off. <br>T+1:50 Eh, last 40 minutes were really boring. I felt nice, everything is enhanced, like someone casted a spell '+2 to liking everything, +3 to enjoying everything'. <br>T+2:10 The peak effects are gone, but I can clearly feel the compound in my system. I am wondering what to do and I go to the room of my friends. <br>T+2:15-T+3:50 These is amazing 85 minutes. I am in my friends room, and unlike with other psychedelics, my thoughts are well-connected, I am quite talkative, and feel emphathy. The effects of compound are back but not to the original extent. We talk about various stuff, watch a lot of funny youtube videos. Absolute niceness.<br>T+4:10 I had a phone call, which made me anxious. Argh! I try to calm down, but I need anxyolitic.<br>T+4:40 I am approaching baseline, but still feeling 4-MeO-MiPT. I take my usual 3 mg of Melatonin and unusual 1 mg of Phenazepam before going to bed. <br>T+5:15 Can't sleep. I am calm, and not anxious anymore, and sleepy. I just can't. 4-MeO-MiPT, Phenazepam and Melatonin create unique effect, and I have strange urge to write something artistic. I rarely do this, but now this strange desire takes over me.<br>T+6:00 I typed 5k characters, and my inspiration is gone. Finally I can asleep.<br>T+6:10 I think, it is the point where experience actually ends, I am sleeping.<br>I slept 10 hours, and woke up refreshed, feeling both 4-MeO-MiPT afterglow and benzo dumbness. <br>Overall, The compound heavily reminds me of 5-MeO-DALT, there are some differences, but I am not sure if I am able blindly distinguish these two. 4-MeO-MiPT has less side-effects, less bodyload, less GI discomfort and even less psychedelic effects. But 4-MeO-MiPT is more pleasant.<br>I liked it more than 5-MeO-DALT, and I am going to experiment with this compound in the future.\n\n\n"
