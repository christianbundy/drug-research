After reading Otts and Aardvarks assertion that mimosa hostilis is psychoactive without MAOI, I performed the cold water extraction exactly as Aardvark describes it in the article, even noting the same eerie, magic potion effect of the root bark dust floating out of my herb grinder. I soaked the material in sterile water for an hour, filtered and repeated with new water and combined the results into a beautifully wine-colored brew. <br><br>
It was more bitter than I had expected, but not really nauseating, maybe like drinking Turkish coffee without any sweetener. Nonetheless it took me about 15 minutes to get the stuff down, chased with a bit of water.<br><br>
Maybe I drank it too slowly, because my results differed greatly from Ott and Aardvark. After sitting with the brew in my stomach for 30 minutes with no event I decided to smoke a small amount of marijuana  two puffs of good stuff. It set something off, and in a minute I was expelling the bitter fluid off the back porch.<br>
Afterwards I felt fine, but a bit drained. <br><br>
I was hungry; I hadnt eaten all day and Id been up for several hours. I had a small meal, then had a few beers with my friends and smoked a bit more pot. There was a moment there where I felt a little different, but under the circumstances I would blame the beer-pot-nearly empty stomach, although it did seem like there was something else there. But<br><br>
While I was sitting with the brew in my stomach, before I threw it up, I felt a bit stimulated, but once again this may have been my excitement as much as any effects of the drug. All in all I would say that no effects worth mentioning were experienced that I couldnt explain through more mundane means. <br><br>
After my experience I read Dale Pendells chapter on mimosa in Pharmako/Gnosis, and saw that he had had similarly disappointing experiences with mimosa without MAOI. It makes me wonder why Ott and Aarvark were so lucky  maybe some metabolic fluke? I dont think theyre lying, and I dont wish to imply that either party is full of shit, but obviously the matter is more complicated than they indicate in their writing. <br><br>
I agree with Dale Pendells assertion that, were mimosa reliably effective without MAOI the web would be flooded by reports of its use this way. The silence is indeed deafening. But perhaps a few lucky folks out there have the right metabolism for itI myself, for instance, am very sensitive to psilocybin mushrooms, whereas my friend isnt; I can enjoy, and learn from 1 gram of psilocybe cubensis. He needs 3.5 grams for threshold effect. You tell me.<br><br>
My advice  use your mimosa in ayahuasca, dont waste it this way. (Disclaimer) That is, of course, unless you live in the United States; I would never endorse the use of any illegal drug within the boundaries thereof.<!-- End Body -->
