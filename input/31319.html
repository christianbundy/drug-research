My friends sit around me at my new apartment and my girlfriend is across from me in the smoking circle. I took one last hit of the marijuana. I had agreed to go first. Though I don't know why. I sat on the floor and I packed the bowl with salvia. Everyone was looking at me. I put the bong to my mouth. I pull and hear it bubble. This weird feeling sweeps over the right side of my body as I exhale. I pull again and the bowl was still burning. Another lungful. I hand the bong to my friend. <br><br>
I was lying on the floor, reality was closing around me. I start to sit up a familiar pain, the one that had knocked me to the floor like a boot to the head, it knocks me down again. The pain spreads through me as reality splinters inside my body. I feel bee stings thousand millions over every inch of my body. I tell my friends that it hurts. I ask them why, but two are already tripping and lost to the world. Reality bends. Now nothing exists outside a foot wide vertical space to either side of me. The pain distracts me from my thoughts and numbs me to reality. Down, I must go down I feel it pulling me down is where the pain will stop down is where Ill be safe. The floor wasnt low enough, it wouldnt work.<br><br>
I can think but not well. In this moment of clarity I walk to the bathroom. I was told I screamed 'Make it stop as I was walking. I walk to the shower. I strip not bothering to close the door. I see my girlfriend shes helping me dry off I yell at her not to touch me, anything that touches me makes the pain worse. I realize the shower hadn't worked. I didn't distract the nerves with soothing water or even make the pain worse. My hair was wet but I couldn't feel the water.<br><br>
I jumped up and down and screamed. I had to make the pain stop I wanted to die. I wanted someone to knock me unconscious or shoot me up with tranquilizers so that I would sleep through the rest of the trip. I ask the friend of mine I bought the hit from how long it would last. He said about 15 minutes. Had it not already been a year at least? I looked at the door. I lived in the upstairs apartment. Stairs, stairs that go down, down will make the pain stop. I run to the door but someone pushes me down. I lie with my back on the floor. Reality returns but the pain doesnt subside. I ask everyone if there is anything I can do to get rid of the trip. There isnt.<br><br>
I guzzle down water. I dont remember why Am I thirsty? Im starting to disappear Im dieing and hell is calling for me. Should I trip out? Would it be more fun in the end? Is that why I have the pain? Im fighting. The trip will it not hurt me if I follow and let it guide me. The room begins to disappear, reality vibrates around me. The pain gets worse the farther I slip from reality. NO! NO! I wont trip out. It will make things worse. I fight to gain control of my mind. The demon relents. It wont drag me into the depths. My mind clears, reality returns to normal again, but still the pain is there. I turn on the TV to distract myself, but the pain is stronger than my concentration. There is nothing I can do. I lie in the floor and wait. I wait for the pain to stop though I know deep down that it never will. But if I wait patiently death will save me as he does all living things. Then the pain will have no hold over me. Though I dont know exact times I know my trip from the beginning to when the pain stopped was only 20 or so minutes.  This was the longest twenty minutes of my life.<!-- End Body -->
