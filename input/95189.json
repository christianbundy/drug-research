 "report": "<p>It was New Years Eve, and I had no plans or preparation for the night. I went over to my friend's house and he mentioned that he had a baggie of shrooms. It wasn't a fair trade, but since I had never taken mushrooms before he agreed to exchange my bag of weed with his 3.5 grams. I ate it with peanut butter and it was dry and crunchy. Within minutes I felt so nauseous I tried to induce vomit in the bathroom. I couldn't do it so I gave up and went for a car ride with my friend. 45 minutes had passed as we began down the road, my tripping really started. The tree's were coming at me so fast, I felt compelled to greet every one of them. He put on loud gabber music and I danced and saw closed eye visuals of patterns and dragons.</p><p>We picked up our friend from a meeting and I felt too uncomfortable to enter the building in my state. He ran out to us and I noticed the ground was covered in fungus looking red dots. Back at his place, he turned on a strobe light and played metal through some sub woofers. I figured I would have fun and move to the music, but it made me disoriented. I tried to keep my mood lifted, but things became so cartoon-ish and distorted, I felt like I didn't know where to put my focus. My thoughts began racing and the paranoia elevated. I went to get a drink of water and it was suggested that we go to yet another friend's house. </p><p>I figured we were just stopping by, but he told us to come inside as it would take a while. And I enter this sketchy, freezing cold crack house. The place is trashed and it is filled with addicts. I tried to find solitude and some peace in the bedroom but on this poor excuse of a mattress all I can see when I close my eyes is moving patterns like a built in kaleidoscope.</p><p>I watched some people play guitar hero but at that point I begged to be driven home by my friend. We finally left and I have a video of myself in the car of us stopped to let a train go by with me yelling for him to stop the car or we will hit the train (we're at a complete stand still). Sifting through my iPod was useless as it was covered in red and green neon dots, obscuring the titles. My friend turned into a demonic shadow, but soon I was dropped off at my house around 3:30 a.m.</p><p>I entered the house and joined my sister on the couch. I attempted to sit there like I wasn't on the verge of a panic attack and watched her and her boyfriend laugh at South Park, which was featuring Satan figure skating and burning things. I couldn't believe how awful the world we live in today is and couldn't endure the trip any longer. My sister and her boyfriend retired to bed, and it was when I was alone in my room did things become horrifying. I recall the feeling of being completely alone. I looked at my computer and saw the words on my friend's away messages, stating 'Happy New Year' as the words melted down the screen.</p><p>My computer desktop had a picture of me and my friend lying on the ground. We looked like corpses and I couldn't bear to look at it. I went to find my cell phone for someone to talk to, but the moment I picked it up I didn't know how to use it or who to call. I forgot what I was doing, all I could do was look at the clock in pain at how slow it would take for one minute to pass. My mind took over and I began to believe that time was stopping. The room around me became dark and overwhelmingly evil. Everywhere I looked there was nothing to turn to for comfort and it seemed as if all of my possessions were turning on me and reminding me of how bad of a person I am. I was still a teenager during this and I called for my mother half heartedly, not knowing if she would  be there or if she could hear me. She entered the room looking like a monster. It was at that point I was convinced the world had ended. She asked me what was wrong with me and I told her I was in Hell. She called my sister into the room when I curled up and began crying hysterically on the ground. My sister came in not understanding and my mother explained that I was having a bad trip. She knelt beside me and in her most comforting voice, tried to explain to me that it was only a drug and I was perfectly fine.</p><p>Her face was twisting in front of me and her pupils became slitted. They both looked so disgusting to me, they could not be my real family members. I believed she was a demon, mocking me of my drug use from my past life. I then lost all control. I stood up and went to the mirror, screaming at my own distorted reflection. I cleared everything off the dresser and the shelves. I pushed the computer onto the ground and threw my furniture. I never, ever have lashed out like this. I remember bits and pieces of it, but according to my family it was the worst psychotic fit they had ever witnessed. I ripped down my dress, yelling that I looked like a whore. I saw a police officer walk almost robotically up my stairs. I felt that he too was a monster sent to torment me. I knew him from somewhere, but I couldn't place where (he turned out to fill in for the officer at my high school from time to time) and I was forcibly handcuffed on the ground. I remember the pain I felt of being overpowered and man handled by these 'monsters' and believing it could only worsen.</p><p>The police carried my writhing body down the stairs and out of the house, onto the street and into an ambulance. They put me on a stretcher and I was terrified and out of touch with reality, they might have given me a sedative I don't recall. All I could do was take in my surroundings and feel anguish. I have no idea why I thought all of these awful things, but in my head I believed them. I entered the hospital where within moments I saw a nurse. I looked right at her and said something so horrible I regret it to this day. I figured she was there to torment me for the mistakes I made in life. Once in the hospital bed, I have vague memories of them attempting to use medical equipment on me and I flipped out. The nurses left the room save for one. She tried to put heart monitor patches on my body but I slapped her in the face. I saw a cop watching me from outside in the hall and made crude gestures at him, I couldn't think rationally. He walked away ashamed for me. My mother came in several minutes later after they sedated me and hit me again after I was babbling about something. I just recall her telling me the world did not end. The trip was beginning to lessen and the sedatives calmed me down. When I realized what I had just done, it was hard to balance the relief that came with me being alive, but also having to live with myself after what I had done. It was a silent car ride home. </p><p>I had to come to terms with the fact that I am not mentally able to cope with prolonged tripping, as interesting as I find it. With lower dosages, friends and a familiar setting, this all could have been avoided. However in my mindset, morality and rationality are seemingly thrown out the window with my skewed perception.</p>"
