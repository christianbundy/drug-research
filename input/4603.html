Well I started off the day with a pretty positive mindset. I had taken Adderall orally before and this time decided to snort it. (rationale is that I find snorting produces a greater peak and more pronounced effect for any drug). I had injested 9 10mg tablets in one 3hr block of time a couple months ago, but I was on a bunch of other drugs that night as well, so I didn't have a distinct feel for A+ as other pharms (mm....ritalin).<br><br>
So anyway, me and my friend R. went out and got some of the 20mg tablets. I crushed up 2 for myself and 1 1/2 for R. The time was around 6:30 pm. The fine powder didn't burn, but it had a trickle that was almost like a nasty sweet taste. A strong increasing head/body buzz started at the 10min mark.<br><br>
The effects still were going strong hours later when we found ourselves just walking around the mall. On the car ride to and from the mall we had a good conversation about why drugs should be legal, and how we should feel this way all the time. I think R. was having more fun than me though. I prefer the feeling of snoggin' 50mg of ritalin a little better. I had R. drive me home at around 7:30 and I was still fucked up. When I got home I snogged about 1/2 of a tablet. I read the first 200 pages of Dune in a 2 1/2 hour period, watched tv, read another 75 pages (!) and then tried to go to sleep at 2am. <br><br>
NO LUCK. I didn't sleep AT ALL. I took a shower at around 5:00am and snorted about 2 more adderalls before I had to be in class at 7:45am. I was really buzzed in class, but we didn't do anything that I needed to concentrate on so I just enjoyed the feeling. Around noon I started on another 3 tablets (I snorted one every hour or so) and ended at 3:30pm.  Writing this all down now.. I finished that Dune book (530 pages total) and on page 60 of the sequel and now its 6:30, wonder if ill sleep tonight... I think ritalin is more comparable to coke than adderall. A lot of energy, body / head buzz, alertness, and coming down no appetite (haven't eaten much past 2 days) and a definite effect still preventing sleep for many hours after the last dose.<!-- End Body -->
