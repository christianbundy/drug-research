 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAround two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the 'green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc... I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a 'thujone' high.<br>(first time) <br>I did the 'thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.<br>- didn't really feel anything.<br>(second time)<br>I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.<br>- no effect whatsoever<br>(third time)<br>This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.<br>I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.<br>T+0:00<br>I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable<br>T+0:05<br>stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.<br>T+0:07<br>I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.<br>T+0:15<br>I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.<br>T+0:25<br>I feel normal again.<br>My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled.\n\n\n"
