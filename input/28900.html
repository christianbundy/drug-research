I once bought 14 HBW's from a shop in Manchester, UK. They were black &amp; cost me £20 for the lot. The guy in the shop had never done them before &amp; didn't really have any idea what they could do to a person.<br><br>
I took them home &amp; checked the internet whereby 5 was supposed to be the standard. In preparation, I scraped the black from the seeds using a pen knife &amp; placed them whole in a cup of boiling water(1/4 full). Left them there for 3 hours then took them out of the water, crushed them up, put them into a small bottle with the water they had been resting in &amp; added a little more water.<br><br>
I shook them up vigorously then left them for another hour. At 8:00pm that evening I sipped down the murky water that had become, shaking it again beforehand. I sipped it slowly for 20mins.<br><br>
About an hour later I was beginning to feel a little funny, my feet felt extraordinarily light whilst walking from room to room &amp; my eyes were kind of pulsating. I thought this was due to me watching the telly at first but when I turned the telly off, the pulsating was still occurring.<br><br>
About half an hour after this I was finding things to be quite amusing. The fact that nothing was really amusing kind of made it even more amusing!! However, I was feeling a little ill by this time so I had a spliff to chill out the nausea.<br><br>
Come 10:00pm, I began to watch 'The Office' on telly which made me laugh quite often &amp; I felt quite comfortable watching it, although still feeling nauseated. By 10:20pm I was beginning to worry. My main worry was: What am I going to do after The Office finishes? I realised I had the first series on DVD so at 10:30pm I went upstairs to watch it.<br><br>
By 10:45 I was board of watching The Office &amp; wanted to do something else. Tried playing Solitaire but the cards seemed to be jumping around a bit &amp; it was making me feel sicker than I already felt. I was feeling rushes &amp; seeing minor visuals. I thought I was definitely up by this point &amp; at a peak.<br><br>
11:00 - Still didn't know what to do with myself. The wallpaper in the spare room was looking quite interesting &amp; a lego man image on a skateboard seemed to be moving his hand up &amp; down but then stopped when I looked directly at it. I could feel that I had progressed even further since I last thought I had peaked.<br><br>
11:15 - Put some music on, Dreamfish. WOW!!! By now, things were really hotting up. I put my head back &amp; just lost myself in the music. It was like as if the music new exactly what I wanted to hear. I Began to imagine that there were numerous other people in the room with me. It wasn't as if I could see them, but I could feel there presence. I had many deep conversations with them. Strange considering they weren't even there but I managed to find out so much about myself during this experience. I should have written it all down but I don't think I would have been capable. I even had a debate with somebody(nobody!) about who was rolling the next spliff. I ended up rolling it in the end because the person who wasnt there kindly reminded me that, well, they werent there!! Still felt sick by the way, with no signs of the sickness diminishing.<br><br>
11:45 - The third track on my Dreamfish CD came on &amp; I couldn't make out whether I liked it or not. It seemed to make me feel even more nauseous than before. I was twitching around, trying to find something to do again but everything I thought I wanted to do just seemed to become boring within seconds &amp; then Id want to do something else.<br><br>
11:55 - Wanted to go to bed, although I think this was just another false idea. Went to my bedroom &amp; got into bed. Didn't bother getting undressed. Turned the light off &amp; closed my eyes. Sleep had no chance!! Every time I closed my eyes, all I could see were 10 kaleidoscopes all rotating at the same time. Don't be fooled, this felt really horrible. I felt as though I wanted to go to sleep but the HBW wasn't letting me. This became an instant worry for no apparent reason. I opened my eyes &amp; turned on the light. Put the telly on &amp; tried to watch something. It was useless, I ended up just channel hopping because I couldnt concentrate on anything for long enough. This also became an instant worry bearing in mind that I still felt ill at this point.<br><br>
12:10 - Burning up! Opened a window, still feeling hectic, sorry, FRANTIC!! Began to march around the house rubbing my head thinking I was going to die &amp; become one of those 'silly boy' drug death statistics on TV. I remember thinking how perfect it would be if I did die - almost textbook. I also began to pretend that I was showing somebody around my house as though I was selling it or something (ie: heres the kitchen, needs a bit of work blah blah blah). Walking did help, though, mildly.<br><br>
12:20 - Went into the bathroom, all walls were breathing. The tile effect on the walls was sickening &amp; seemed to stretch on for miles &amp; miles. Ran out of the bathroom whispering 'I don't like that room'. Went back into the bedroom, sat on the bed. Considered phoning a friend, considered going for a walk. Decided not to go for a walk as reality had been removed, therefore, I probably would have been knocked over or something.<br><br>
12:30 - Still sat on my bed thinking - this is it, I can't go on through the rest of the night like this. I honestly felt suicidal because I felt so uncomfortable with myself &amp; the way I was feeling. I noticed that pain didn't really have any affect on me as I tried biting my fingers hard but couldn't really feel it.<br><br>
12:35 - Still felt sick &amp; thought maybe if I could be sick then the horrible feeling would go away. I went into the bathroom &amp; knelt in front of the toilet, still thinking I was going to die. I looked up at the ceiling, it seemed to be so far away. Walls still breathing, couldnt physically be sick so decided to get a beer to see if it would relax me a little.<br><br>
12:40 - Got a beer from the kitchen. The kitchen was dark with some dirty dishes knocking about. It seemed as though they were watching me &amp; I became a little paranoid but just laughed it off. Walking out of the kitchen there was a lamp next to the door. Whilst walking past it I nearly jumped out of my skin. I thought there was somebody stood there!!! Even when I departed up the stairs it still looked as though somebody was stood there!! Sat back on my bed with my mind still racing. By this point I actually wanted to die just to stop myself from feeling the way I was feeling. It wasn't the nausea but what was going on in my brain. I just felt uncomfortable in my body &amp; didn't want to be inside my own body anymore. Also felt like bashing my head against a brick wall.<br><br>
12:50 - Remembered how much of a good feeling it was listening to Dreamfish in the spare room until that nasty track came on that made me feel sick. I went into the spare room, sat down &amp; began to play the CD from the beginning again.<br><br>
MUCH BETTER!!!! The music took me again &amp; began to calm me down.<br><br>
01:00 - Began to talk to people who weren't there again but felt good, loved up, happy, deep, less nauseated but most of all, chilled. The sensation I was getting at this point can only best be described metaphorically as taking my head off my shoulders &amp; putting it on a roller coaster whilst my body stayed on the ground.<br><br>
The roller coaster went down low until the affect of the HBW was at a minimum. Then, it would climb high &amp; fast until the affect of the HBW was at a maximum &amp; then rush straight back down. Like a kind of build up before a climax. I remember wanting to feel like this forever.<br><br>
01:10  Feeling extremely chilled, no sickness whatsoever. Head rolling back, eyes closed on many occasions. Decided to take a lie down whilst listening to the music. Opened the sofa bed, got under a quilt &amp; turned the lamp off but left my globe on.<br><br>
This was a brilliant idea!! I just lay there staring up at a patch of light reflecting off my stippled ceiling. The light was moving in all kinds of directions &amp; seemed to fill up with what looked like fizzy water. This made me laugh out loud. I looked around the room and everything seemed really noticeable, as if I could just sit &amp; analyse everything. I looked at a tiny picture on my wall of a holiday resort. I felt as though I could leave my body &amp; enter into the picture. I stopped this from happening but if I hadnt, I may have had an astral projection at that point. I lay down &amp; enjoyed this feeling for sometime, the light on the ceiling was most interesting!!<br><br>
02:00  Began to feel the affects slowly wearing away, now. Still felt happy but a little disappointed that I was beginning to come back to reality. Tried to close my eyes to go to sleep but was not able to.<br><br>
03:00  Still high but on the way down. Arms &amp; hands felt very weak at this point. I propped my forearms up on my elbows but didnt make any attempt to hold my hands up. They just flopped down whilst I swung them around a little. This felt very weird but particularly uncomfortable.<br><br>
03:30  Wanted to go to sleep by now. Whole body felt weak &amp; quite achy, too. Found it difficult to close my eyes &amp; getting a little agitated. I tossed &amp; turned for a bit &amp; think I managed to sleep for about 15  20 minutes.<br><br>
04:30  Got up &amp; went to my bed. Went to sleep with no bother.<br><br>
Woke up the following day feeling a little groggy &amp; nervy but not too bad.<br><br>
Now, you have just read what happened to me after taking 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. The following weekend I took another 3 with a friend who also took 3. The effects were OK but really I just felt very stoned more than anything. My friend, who had never done them before, said that he had some visuals &amp; that he thought the seeds were quite nice &amp; mellow.<br><br>
I think its really amazing how just an extra 2 of these things can make a person really lose it like I did &amp; also give off the fantastic visuals I experienced. Maybe it was because I was on my own. I have to admit, doing these things with a friend was much better. That way I always knew that I had somebody there who was real, who I could talk to just to bring myself back down to earth when I needed it.<br><br>
Anyway, the real point of this story is not just to describe the effects of HBW but something else. The seeds themselves. When all my seeds had gone I decided to buy some more. I looked on the internet for the cheapest price &amp; managed to get hold of 70 for $12 shipped from the US to the UK. These seeds were fresh &amp; DID NOT come with nauseating black crap on the outsides of them.<br><br>
What happened? I hear you askNOTHING!!! The following evening I tried 5. This time I chewed them for 20 minutes &amp; then swallowed them. Still, not even a twinge. A couple of nights later I prepared 10 seeds in the same way I had prepared my original, mind blowing 5 seeds. Still nothing. The night after that I chewed 15 seeds but there was no effect. I dont understand what has gone on here. The seeds look exactly the same, minus the black crap, they taste exactly the same but do not hold any effect whatsoever.  I guess some seeds work and others don't.  I am waiting on an order from another company.<br><br>
Imagine what 30 effective HBW seeds would do to you if it only took 5 to make me feel as though I wanted to die. Bearing in mind that I have taken Ecstasy, speed &amp; mushrooms many, many times, therefore, I do have a little experience with drug taking.<br><br>
5x HBW was like nothing else I had ever taken before. To sum it up, it was like taking Ecstasy, speed &amp; mushrooms all at the same time. The ecstasy came with the luvvy feeling, the speed with the not knowing what to do next feeling &amp; the shrooms for the trippy feeling.<!-- End Body -->
