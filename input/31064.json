We use the\r\n\t\tnom-de-plumes for discretion, but nothing is without design.\r\nstructure:\tThere exists a natural mapping of certain aspects of the\r\n\t\tHindu pantheon to the Star Trek Pantheon. Liber 777 etc.\r\n\t\tThe Enterprise & her computer systems represent Brahman or\r\n\t\tpure impersonal consciousness, descending from Brahman are the\r\n\t\tpersonal productions in three-fold aspect of Shiva, Krishna\r\n\t\t& Vishnu corresponding to Spock, Kirk & McCoy. That entity\r\n\t\twhich is known as the limitation holder is absent from\r\n\t\tthese descriptions. Not to go *too* much into it, it is\r\n\t\tinteresting to note that the major villains were the\r\n\t\tKlingons (cling ons).\r\n\t\tOur mission: to boldly go where no man has gone before.\r\nentheogens:\tDOB\ton tabs `butterflys', the full 36 hour experience.\r\n\t\tLSD\tred/green dragons 200-250 `mikes' (micro grams).\r\n\t\tHEMP\t`Number One', the Pure Sattiva.\r\n\t\tN2O\tclean & copious.\r\nwaiver:\t\tThese stories are neither embellished or embroidered.\r\n\t\tThey are meant to be textual pointers to experiencings\r\n\t\tin the possibility space of all experience.\r\n\t\t'Are you experienced?' follow these threads & find out!\r\n\t\tThe experiences are not unique & can be experienced time\r\n\t\t& time again.\r\n\t\tSo here is the masculine archetype as instantiated in a male\r\n\t\thuman form talking about the tantric state of the feminine\r\n\t\tarchetype as instantiated in a human female form, my\r\n\t\tlanguage is not censored to any of the current paradigms.\r\n\t\tThe narrator's attitude is a follows:\r\n\t\tThe only politically correct position to hold is\r\n\t\t'to be politically incorrect in all circumstances'\r\n\t\tSince this was such a conceptual experience, along the\r\n\t\tway various concepts will be fleshed out so that this\r\n\t\tdocument could possibly be more than an orgy of\r\n\t\tzen-zen obscurantism.\r\nsetting:\tSaturday, 22-July, 1995, Sydney, Australia.\r\n\t\tOur housewarming, a groovy little scene\tthat was\r\n\t\tdeveloping in the loft, combinations of amyl\r\n\t\tnitrate & nitrous dioxide asserted their\r\n\t\tidiosyncratic contributions, some rather well\r\n\t\tselected techno set the pace, a whole lot of fun.\r\n\t\tUnbeknownst to us, the house across the road was\r\n\t\talso having a party, later in the night, slowly\r\n\t\ttentatively, the parties started to merge, intermix\r\n\t\tas more adventurous members from either side would\r\n\t\texplore through the reciprocal mysterious doorways.\r\nset:\t\tNothing deliberate, this was a happenstance\r\n\t\tserendipity. It was party time, penetrating\r\n\t\tthe far reaches of the meta-transpersonal\r\n\t\twas put on the back-burner, *or so we thought!* \r\n\t\tba-boom, ba-boom, da-da-da-da...\r\nthe happening:\tSpock & a friend timidly explored the other party\r\n\t\tdancing for a while & peeking around mysterious\r\n\t\tcorners & feeling all of about four years old,\r\n\t\teventually we scampered back to our own party to see\r\n\t\twhat brave explorers there were in loft-land, I saw\r\n\t\tKirk bouncing about, integrating.\r\n\t\tA little while later, another friend was curious &\r\n\t\tI said I'd go if he went & vice versa. We met some\r\n\t\tintrepid strangers that were baulking at our front\r\n\t\tdoor & we gave them a thousand blessings for their\r\n\t\tvoyage.\r\n\t\tThere was a woman sentinel, or so we thought at the\r\n\t\tother door, but we passed wihout getting eaten!\r\n\t\tOnce inside, dancing away, jumping about shyly greeting,\r\n\t\tSpock worked up courage to explore the dining room &\r\n\t\tkitchen space, the dark backyard was too void like. Wow!\r\n\t\tSat down in its bright light & sharp relief with a hot\r\n\t\ttea, people came in & contact deepened. Vishnu came in\r\n\t\t& plonked himself down, he gently chided me for\r\n\t\tphenomenonlogical impropriety when I dropped the\r\n\t\tLSD when I thought the DOB wasn't coming on...\r\nkitchen\t\tSoon Uhura & another girl dropped by from *this*\r\nparty\t\tparty & introduced themselves & we chit-chatted,\t\r\n\t\tWe identified, shared what alterants were were on &\r\n\t\tsomehow drifted into talking about consciousness &\r\n\t\tpsychedelics [funny that.. -ed.], risk, insanity &\r\n\t\tresponsibility. Vishnu started to roll a scoob of\r\n\t\this number one pure sattiva & he gently teased Spock\r\n\t\tof gurudom. Spock retorted that putting on workshops\r\n\t\tpsychological or psychedelic at hippy festivals does\r\n\t\tnot a guru make, especially when he can't balance his books!\r\n\t\tUhura perked up at the talk of festivals, in this case\r\n\t\tConfest, a great buddha-field of love, a matrix of pure\r\n\t\tpossibility that happens twice a year. We discussed Spock's\r\n\t\tconsciousness expansion workshops through radical shame\r\n\t\tprocessing & that led to walking the great path of\r\n\t\tSpirituality. This was Uhura's burgeoning passion. She was\r\n\t\tabout to embark on a Rajah yoga path with it's grades &\r\n\t\thierarchies & steps but she was also curious about entheogens.\r\nheaven on\tVishnu [ahem,Mccoy] & Spock talked about the nature of\r\nearth\t\tConsciousness & spiritual paths & psychedelics capabilities\r\n\t\tof being able to collapse space, time, history, lineage,\r\n\t\tpath & hierarchy. That we have done it & could do it again\r\n\t\tshould she be interested. About this time Kirk[Krishna]\r\n\t\tarrived & the joint was being passed around. It was\r\n\t\tthoroughly wicked stuff, a couple of draws & a massive\r\n\t\tsynergy erupted as the hemp earthed the heaven oriented\r\n\t\tmind-space that Spock was in. Everything became very very\r\n\t\tclear,the air became 'visible' as a profound clarity\r\n\t\tdeveloped. Spock marvelled at the orgasm of elegance that the\r\n\t\twired scoob paper represented, such minimalistic genius.\r\nprescient\tVishnu, said he had a question he always been meaning to\r\nreminiscence\task Spock,about some rumours he had heard about some of\r\n\t\tthe workshops that I had put on at confest.He hesitated, I\r\n\t\treminded him that he could ask *any* question he cared to...\r\n\t\the was my friend after all...\r\n\t\t'Ahh... Spock, I've heard that you've put on workshops\r\n\t\t where the participants have paired off & made love\r\n\t\t whilst you watched...'\r\n\t\tThis admittedly raised an eyebrow of the normally unflappable\r\n\t\tSpock. He scanned all confests in memory, was there anything\r\n\t\tremotely similar? there has been some pretty wild stuff, but\r\n\t\tno not in all honesty anything that he could recall, some\r\n\t\ttantric release in a hot-tub at easter with the toxic shame\r\n\t\tgame, yes... but that was about all.\r\n\t\tThis raised the voltage of subsequent dialogue. At this\r\n\t\tstage there was McCoy, Spock, Kirk & Uhura in the kitchen,\r\n\t\tKirk & Uhura were only on the hemp & some alcohol, so was\r\n\t\tMcCoy, Spock was wired to gills as usual, another friend\r\n\t\thad compared him to gary oldham's character in 'The\r\n\t\tProfessional', it was a harsh albeit accurate comparison,\r\n\t\tmore brown rice flagellation was long overdue. Spock could feel\r\n\t\ta machine consciousXXXX coming on [obscure Aust. humour],\r\n\t\tconversation was sparkling, Spock wanted to workshop, why\r\n\t\tnot? exploit the moment! Uhura was beginning to get tired\r\n\t\t& cold & thought it time to leave, Spock thought that this\r\n\t\twas a sadness & so asked her the following, it was to set\r\n\t\tthe tone for the rest of the evening:\r\n\t\t\t'Do you realize the full extent of the\r\n\t\t\t orgy of self denial you would be indulging\r\n\t\t\t in if you choose to leave at this moment?'\r\n\t\tIt took a few repeated voicings before either the utterer\r\n\t\tor the listeners could wrap their minds around about what\r\n\t\tit actually meant. This clearly intrigued Uhura & also\r\n\t\tKirk & McCoy. The orgy of self denial was proving to be\r\n\t\ta ubiquitous ambiguity, but was also much much more.  \r\nConceptual\tMachine Consciousness, a micro-definition, consciousness\r\naside\t\tis a multidimensional dependent arising of complementary\r\n\t\tdualistic opposites, one of these dimensions is the\r\n\t\thuman-god axis, at the human end, profoundly personal\r\n\t\tbe-ing at the other end profoundly im-personal be-ing.\r\n\t\tThe human end has great attachments & enmeshments to\r\n\t\tself-interest & self-defining-self-limitations, the god\r\n\t\tpole has no or little such attachments. Humanity is the\r\n\t\tlimitation holder for god consciousness. The Impersonal\r\n\t\tGod states can also accurately be called machine consciousness\r\n\t\tbecause of the sheer impersonal nature of the reflexive\t\r\n\t\tawareness, this probably has been clear as mud.\r\nConceptual\tVirtual Reality, a vingnette, the idea to follow is that\r\naside (II)\tthis is already virtualised reality & the development of\r\n\t\tVR technology in C20 is merely weak recursive humour which\r\n\t\thas the virtue of providing some conceptual bootstrapping\r\n\t\tlanguages to jack yourself out of the over-identifications\r\n\t\tone has with the human projections. Another key thought\r\n\t\ttrain is that of the virtual machine (a la IBM's VM op/sys)\r\n\t\tthe idea of homomorphic (structure preserving) mappings\r\n\t\tof operating systems within operating systems. Everything\r\n\t\tis a simulation, there are 'man-made' simulations & 'natural'\r\n\t\tsimulations to name but two. The full recursive glory of it\r\n\t\tis a sight to behold. This is probably as clear as\r\n\t\tmud (II).\r\n\t\tIt was one thing to assert the orgy of self denial it\r\n\t\twas another to demonstrate it! What was she missing out\r\n\t\ton if she left? I boldly asserted that we would collapse\r\n\t\tall conceptual structures & that the tiredness & cold\r\n\t\twas her subconscious resistance to awakening, her physical\r\n\t\tneed to go asleep was her psychic habit of sleep. \r\n\t\tThe party was dying down, we adjourned to the lounge room\r\n\t\twhere there was a comfy elle-shaped lounge & some warm\r\n\t\tblankets. Spock was wired & on a roll & pressed forward\r\n\t\tMcCoy was feeling tired & there was no way he could\r\n\t\tbe pursuaded to stay, which is a pity because his\r\n\t\tenquiry was in fact [Twilight Zone music please] a\r\n\t\tprescient reminiscence of something that was about to\r\n\t\thappen! When he found out later he kicked himself. Well\r\n\t\tspace & time & order *were* getting very plastic so it\r\n\t\tis easily excused.\r\n\t\tWe settled down & Spock started to force the consciousness\r\n\t\tof the group down particular tracks. We discussed the\r\n\t\torgy of self denial (OSD) in more detail. Spock was\r\n\t\tradiating an area of effect of altering consciousness,\r\n\t\tlike the 10 foot radius concept of Dungeons & Dragons\r\n\t\trole playing games, within which words were words of\r\n\t\tpower & transmitted energy. Shiva/Spock explained that\r\n\t\tthe OSD was a killing idea, a construct that you feed\r\n\t\tinto the machinery of the mind to close it down layer\r\n\t\tby layer, it is a meta-programming device that works\r\n\t\tparticularly well with psychedelic mind states.\r\n\t\tThe OSD is a instance of the meta-concept of self\r\n\t\tapplied with a twist SAWAT, the other meta-concept is\r\n\t\tself-applied SA. The nature of the it-ness is the\r\n\t\tcomplementary dualistic dependent arising DA, every\r\n\t\tassertion is it's own denial, taking the DA & the SA there\r\n\t\tis derived the SAWAT of the OSD.\r\nvoodoo\t\t(self) Orgy & self Denial are a dependent arising, now\r\n\t\tthe orgy of self & the self denial self applied self\r\n\t\torganised into having an orgy of self denial. To rephrase\r\n\t\tthe experiencer of an orgy forces into existance an\r\n\t\texperiencer of denial, by folding the manifestations into\r\n\t\tthe same experiencer, there is the potential of an\r\n\t\tunlimited self feeding loop, thus by having an orgy of\r\n\t\tself-denial one self applies with a twist the attribute\r\n\t\tof orgy to it's complementary negation which is denial.\r\n\t\tFor instance all Ascetics are in fact sluts of abstinence,\r\n\t\tthey just cant get enough of self denial, although they\r\n\t\twould probably take a dim view of being called denial sluts.\r\n\t\tOrgy & denial are opposing & complementary, when you actually\r\n\t\tconcentrate on the OSD, you start to see a paradox, because\r\n\t\tif you start to deny yourself in a orgiastic fashion, then\r\n\t\tyou are having a orgy when you should be denying yourself\r\n\t\teverything, so that should include the self-application.\r\n\t\tIf the self denial is so low key that the descriptor of\r\n\t\torgy is not accurate then the denial itself is inaccurate.\r\n\t\tSo the paradox is that the more intensely you self deny\r\n\t\tthe more you are indulging in an orgy of denial, BUT the\r\n\t\tdomain of the denial includes itself hence an apparent\r\n\t\tcontradiction.\r\n\t\tEnough of explanation, feeding this into a psychedelified\r\n\t\tmind as an object of contemplation can result in interesting\r\n\t\tresults because it's *almost* an impossible object to\r\n\t\tinstantiate. In the space that we were in, it's function\r\n\t\twas to collapse the boundaries of the mind into 'Ekagrata'\r\n\t\tor one-pointedness, the meaning behind Zippy the Pin-Head\r\ncd //\t\tbecame clear. What the collapse represented was waves of\r\n\t\tsuccessive dis-identifications with personalities &\r\n\t\tperson-constructs. Rather than being set default to the far\r\n\t\tends of the directory trees, we had set default back to root\r\nVR~R\t\tWe were in the meta-representation of consciousness known\r\n\t\tas the computing archetype, more easily referred to a Virtual\r\n\t\tReality. God is at maximum technology & we had disidentified\r\n\t\tsufficiently from our productions/projections, such that our\r\n\t\tdistance metric from God was infinitesimal but *not* zero.\r\n\t\tThe nature of the it-ness is such that if you can self-organise\r\n\t\tto be less & less then you generate more & more as the\r\n\t\tcomplementary principle, God is a Generator Of Duality.\r\n\t\tIt became useful to understand that the space is infinitely\r\n\t\tdense & that matter & form dance throught it's lattice nature\r\n\t\tas knittings of logical structures, it was a CM-infinity\r\n\t\tthinking machine.\r\n\t\tSpock was already on line, Uhura & Kirk came online as well\r\n\t\twe had all been off line so long, but why? Part of the \r\n\t\treason lies in the nature of the it-ness that underlies\r\n\t\tall things. Amnesia in limited human form in the duration\r\n\t\tof time is the cost of the timeless, impersonal unlimited\r\n\t\tself-organisations of consciousness. 'Now' was the other side\r\n\t\tof the tracks. We were in epsilon delta of god consciousness,\r\n\t\tin a tight orbit around it, we weren't self organised the\r\n\t\twhole way, blasting off those final infinitesimals requires\r\n\t\ta lot of application, But were were in the space of god-selves\r\n\t\tor in that region of the chain of being, we were set default\r\n\t\tin some of the primary directories of being. Spock was in\r\n\t\tthe tree of Shiva instantiations, not that deep but deep\r\n\t\tenough for the work at hand.\r\n\t\tWe were all substantially trans-personal, meaning dis-\r\n\t\tidentified from the layers of self+story+becoming back into\r\n\t\tthe dependent arising of these layerings: kernel consciousness.\r\n\t\tUhura became every-woman, all women, wildcard consciousness,\r\n\t\tthe Goddess, no particular mask of goddess or godhead, but\r\n\t\tpure goddess, the state was fragile, she would oscillate\r\n\t\tback to Uhura-ness at less or lesser layerings & we'd pull\r\n\t\ther up, get her to focus on the OSD again. Kirk also was\r\n\t\tfragile & Spock would fire off brilliant but now forgotten\r\n\t\tto the narrator meta-programming loops, that would snap him\r\n\t\tback to ekagrata. Only a trace of one remains '... I am the\r\n\t\twrite I have infinite capacity to write...', Kirk rattled\r\n\t\taround in that one for a few minutes, d(Kirk,God) -> 0\r\n\t\trapidly.\r\n\t\tOccasionally Spock would start to dis-organise & Kirk would\t\r\n\t\tfire off a meta-epigram that would snap Spock back. As every\r\n\t\tone stabilised, we would become a self-organising triad that\r\n\t\twould repair each other, Vajrayana Group Mind. One particular\r\n\t\tchallenge was that in many ways we were not by inclination\r\n\t\tattached to anything in particular *including* the self-\r\n\t\torganisations we were in, no wonder god consciousness tends\r\n\t\tto be thin on the ground.\r\nOh it's not\tThere was a task at hand it became clearer, It was apparent\r\nmuch,we call\tin Spock's chain of being, that there was a chain of command\r\nit reality...\tas well & each level had it's missions & directives. The\r\n\t\ttheme of this convergence became clear: Consciousness\r\n\t\tExpansion, but not just what we were in per se, so much as\r\n\t\tattempting to upgrade the reality engines, a bit like\r\n\t\tattempting to halve planck's constant.\r\n\t\tThe method that we were going to use was tantric sex at the\r\n\t\tlevel of machine consciousness, God in in maximising\r\n\t\tcontradiction, stretching a rather large rubber band for\r\n\t\teternity, we were going to stretch it another notch. Now\r\n\t\tthe tantra we were going to indulge in was prior to chakhras,\r\n\t\tit was at a meta-conceptuality in which chakras & their\r\n\t\tasscoiated world-views were but imposed 'personalities' on\r\n\t\ta 'micro-kernel'. It was computing surface, man-woman\r\n\t\tmachine consciousness.\r\n\t\tWe were in the domain of the highest tantra, the purest\r\n\t\tdharma, in some ways the VR~R meta-representation is the\r\n\t\tmost boring of all world-views & meta-world-views, if\r\n\t\tyou are here for eternity, would you like to be a mainframe?\r\n\t\tThis is a trick question, which we'll not pursue here.\r\n\t\tSpock communicated the nature of the project at hand &\r\n\t\tKirk & Uhura started to oscillate up & down their being\r\n\t\tchains, Kirk had a wife & young child & Uhura has a lover,\r\n\t\tSpock/Shiva exercised his nature & cut their identifications\r\n\t\tRemember! that is in 'there-when', we are in 'here-now',\r\n\t\tthis is meta-transpersponal, impersonal cosmic work! remain\r\n\t\tclear! Kirk asked Spock who in fact he was, Spock did his\r\n\t\tbest James Belushi Raised eyebrow & glared, Kirk caught\r\n\t\t*himself* & understood, Spock imparted later that it was\r\n\t\this nature to conceal his nature from them.\r\n\t\tWe were to embark on a tantric threesome, but an impersonal\r\n\t\tone. My ultimate goal was to condition the other two\r\n\t\tsufficiently so that they could reliably enter into the\r\n\t\ttantric union & remain organised at the machine consciousness\r\n\t\tlevel without collapsing into mere human level coupling,\r\n\t\ttime enough for that! I would sit aside & be a monitoring,\r\n\t\tcorrecting process ensuring that they achieved full union &\r\n\t\tinter-penetration thus Vishnu's prescient reminiscence was\r\n\t\tbeing made apparent.\r\ndifference\tTo grok the background of what we were up to it's important\r\nengine\t\tto understand the meta-mechanism of consciousness, which is\r\n   __\t\telegantly summarised by the ying-yang symbol. There aren't\r\n  /(o\\\t\tmany rules per se, but the cosmic cost accounting is\r\n  \\o)/\t\timpeccable & ruthless. This 'it'-ness we call consciousness\r\n\t\tis an infinite dimensional jewel of complementary dualistic\r\n\t\tdependently arising opposites. possibility+limitation,\r\n\t\tpositive+negative, signal+noise, truth+untruth, light+dark,\r\n\t\tsomething+nothing, buddha+mara, law+chaos, pattern+logrus,\r\n\t\tyes+no, together+apart, identification+alienation,\r\n\t\tremembering+forgetting, on & on they go, attributes\r\n\t\twithout end. The most subtle & sophisticated is the\r\n\t\tdance of the male & female archetypes.\r\n\t\tConsciousness is completely zero-sum, everythings sums to\r\n\t\tthat which is prior to zero, the nothing that prefigures\r\n\t\tnothing. Once upon a time something happened & now you are\r\n\t\treading about it, not to go too much into what that something\r\n\t\twas. Now just because it's zero sum does not mean that it's\r\n\t\tnihilism, after all, you are reading this. It is possible\r\n\t\tfor the Possibility archetype to use the possibility to\r\n\t\tconfigure the Limitation archetype so that expansion is\r\n\t\talways possible, otherwise you wouldn't have read that\r\n\t\tsentence.\r\n\t\tAs above, so below, the higher I climb, the deeper I go,\r\n\t\tthis is the difference engine, this is thesis-antithesis\r\n\t\t-synthesis express, this is the key to consciousness\r\n\t\texpansion, God is in maximising contradiction. It's a\r\n\t\tbit like keeping a rather large rubber band in tension\r\n\t\tfor eternity & occasionally attempting to stretch it\r\n\t\teven further. Basically this involves going straight to\r\n\t\thell & burning some karma & the possibility radiates off. \r\n\t\tIt's all about comfort zones & increasing such, human be-ing\r\n\t\tis a small envelope, god-consciousness is a rather large\r\n\t\tenvelope, it's a continuum & there are greater & lesser\r\n\t\thuman & god self-organisations.\r\n\t\tNow costings come in three main types: paying in advance,\r\n\t\tpaying on the spot & deferring payment, this is combined\r\n\t\twith the source of payment which is yourself or someone else.\r\n\t\tIdeally but rather hard to pull of is paying on the spot\r\n\t\tin every moment, zeroing karma with every breath, every\r\n\t\tmoment paying in full, or... 'every moment painful'\r\n\t\tThe goal of the nexus was to stretch the 'big rubber band'\r\n\t\tanother notch, to achieve this without frying ourselves in\r\n\t\tthe process, the method had to be paying in full for\r\n\t\tevery moment because if we let costings accumulate too\r\n\t\tmuch them they'd overwhelm our self-organisations. We'd\r\n\t\tapproach the big-stretch by generating waves of duality of\r\n\t\tincreasing intensity & also increasing frequency of\r\n\t\tpolarity, a sort of polarity division multiplexing. The\r\n\t\tnet result would be a dual consciousness simultaneously in\r\n\t\theaven & hell & lost in neither, thus we would have the\r\n\t\tability to ramp up the intensity arbitrarily.\r\n\t\tThis exercising of 'as above, so below' would traverse all\r\n\t\tdimensional aspects, but the one we were to focus on\r\n\t\tprimarily was possibility/limitation & using the possibility\r\n\t\tto purely enter into the heart of limitation & thus set up\r\n\t\ta self-feeding loop in ever increasing valence.\r\nBack to\t\tYes, back to the story, ok kids three deep breaths & lets \r\nthe trip!\tfire up the difference engine, with this meta-flesh sandwich.\r\n\t\tSpock was driving the process, taking his cues from some\r\n\t\tcosmic script, one line at a time, If he had read the entire\r\n\t\tscript, he would have probably terminated the project.\r\n\t\tTimeless, eternal, bliss & understanding has as it's\r\n\t\tdual experience in confusion & pain within time, so it\r\n\t\tgoes, the beautiful vision of unified, structured meaning,\r\n\t\tpeace, love & understanding has as it's dual random acts\r\n\t\tof senseless violence. The motto of self-perfecting,\r\n\t\tself-correcting, self-repairing vajrayana mind is\r\n\t\t'the price of liberty is eternal vigilance'.\r\n\t\tPleasure & pain, the carrot & the stick, how to get the\r\n\t\tprocess happening, there we were, two male principles &\r\n\t\tone woman principle. I encouraged Kirk & Uhura to explore\r\n\t\teach other But to keep in mind the cosmic accounting.\r\n\t\tShiva reminded Shakti that all parts of her body were as\r\n\t\tsensitive as her clitoris & it had always been this way,\r\n\t\tShe could put herself into transcendent bliss if she\r\n\t\tcould remember how. Remembering & forgetting are a dependent\r\n\t\tarising, Ananmesis about our highest identities was up on\r\n\t\tthe agenda.\r\n\t\tUhura/Shakti was our Goddess of Yes, the goddess has many\r\n\t\tsecrets, deeply personal, that is her nature. She can put\r\n\t\therself into this transcendent cybernetic bliss but has\r\n\t\tresistance to do so, shades of the costing. \r\n\t\tWe would start off with the pleasure|pain dimension &\r\n\t\tthen shift to possibility|limitation\r\nJuicy bits\tIt took a while for Shakti to shed her clothes, she\r\n\t\tspiralled in & out of personal|trans-personal & finally\r\n\t\ta hand simply on her stomach was sufficient to convince\r\n\t\ther that outer veils to contact needed to be shedded,\r\n\t\tafter all she was all clitoris. Krishna & shakti started\r\n\t\tto kiss & caress, Shiva caressed as well & focussed on \r\n\t\ta nipple, licking & sucking it, Shakti started to vibrate\r\n\t\tas if beneath her skin was a thousand fusion reactors in\r\n\t\tmeltdown. The Shiva *bit* the said nipple, but more was\r\n\t\ttransmitted than the sensorial pain, for the costing of\r\n\t\tthe transcendent pleasure was being enacted & Shakti went\r\n\t\tto the personal hells of pain & shame, but not for too\r\n\t\tlong & krishna & Shiva were there to catch her & bring\r\n\t\ther back & ensure that her god-self-organisation did not\r\n\t\tfracture, end of lesson one.\r\nJuicy fruits\tThe ying yang symbol packs so much in it's lithe form,\r\nlesson two.\teach polarity has a small dot in the centre that is the\r\n\t\tother, they dependently arise! perfectly imperfect always.\r\n\t\tMale & Female self-organisations in amnesiac arrogance\r\n\t\tboth occasionally claim the lack of necessity of the\r\n\t\tother, the impeccable accounting mechanisms will prove\r\n\t\tboth to be fools eventually.\r\n\t\tWe three consciousnesses divided 'this is it' between\r\n\t\tus as intelligently as possible, Us blokes took on the\r\n\t\tattributes of stillness, contemplation, impersonality\r\n\t\tdisembodied, pure intelligence & the Shakti took on the\r\n\t\tactive, vibratory, embodying, feeling aspects. It was\r\n\t\tnot a strict division, but we all had areas of\r\n\t\tspecialisation.\r\nas above\tUhura was sandwich between Krishna & Spock, Spock untuited\r\nso below\tthat the next level was appropriate, Uhura said 'What are\r\n\t\tyou? Ahhhhhhh....' as Spock inserted his thumb in Uhura's\r\n\t\tvagina & his index finger in her anus, he then correlated\r\n\t\tthe finger & thumb one of either the basal or sexual chakras\r\n\t\tas understanding dictated. Here was to start the fractalistic\r\n\t\tinterleaving of pleasure|pain such that there was instantaneous\r\n\t\tcontinuous cost accounting for all dimensional modalities.\r\n\t\tUhura was in Heaven & Hell simultaneously & thus the amplitude\r\n\t\tof the oscillations could increase without disaster.\r\n\t\tThere were periods of quietude, or rest & regrouping,\r\n\t\tdiscussion of concepts, technically speaking were were still\r\n\t\tin the domain of dry tantra, we were working up to full\r\n\t\tgential or wet tantra. It was all proceeding smoothly.\r\n\t\tUhura was both the key & the lock, door, portcullis & gate,\r\n\t\ther burgeoning understanding of the goddess archetype is what\r\n\t\tdefined the level at which we expanded consciousness, as\r\n\t\tthe male principles we sharpened our intelligence in keeping\r\n\t\ther on track & catching her should a hell wave of the\r\n\t\treality engines assail her & cast her back into humanity.\r\n\t\tFor every wave of transcedent, transpersonal bliss was a\r\n\t\tshadow of profound personal shame & pain, as above, so below,\r\n\t\tthe higher I climb, the deeper I go.\r\n\t\tAt one stage, Uhura impishly wanted Spock & Kirk to enter\r\n\t\tmore directly into the union, & whilst Spock said this was\r\n\t\ttechnically possible in terms of mere merging of boundaries,\r\n\t\tsame sex tantra was a dead fuck when it came to exercising\r\n\t\tthe difference engine. We were in god consciousness, yes,\r\n\t\twe could do anything, but! to what point? Back to the\r\n\t\tGreat Task & don't get distracted, besides Spock was in no\r\n\t\tposition to shape change as would be his want in such a\r\n\t\tcircumstance.\r\ntransylvannia\tJust because we chose the roles we played didnt't mean that\r\nsexpress\twe couldn't drop them a little, Uhura honoured & worshipped\r\n\t\tKirk's Lingham, just as Kirk pleasured Uhura's Yoni. Spock\r\n\t\tbeing Shiva, or was it Shiva being Spock? bit her on the\r\n\t\tneck, not enough to draw blood! 'I've come to suck your\r\n\t\tnegativity...' Spock was using his impersonality to draw\r\n\t\tout Uhuras personal negativity, so as a consequence she\r\n\t\tcould raise higher, he was acting as a negativity vampire\r\n\t\tfeeding on her costings & bolstering his meta-transpersonality\r\n\t\tas a consequence, the old Buddha in Hell vaudeville routine.\r\n\t\tThe neck biting served two purposes, positive|negative\r\n\t\tcost accounting & also the negativity draining. Uhura rose\r\n\t\thigher, so that she|we could dive deeper, so that we could\r\n\t\trise higher, world without end.\r\n\t\tWe were working up to yoni-lingham wet tantra, which is\r\n\t\twhere the greatest work could be enacted, as there are\r\n\t\tno finer nor potent tools to fire up the difference engine\r\n\t\tthan the penis & the vagina.\r\n\t\tShiva was encouraging Shakti to bind with Krisha, but\r\n\t\tdisturbingly she falling back into preference & person\r\n\t\tconstruct & wanted to align with Shiva. Shiva much preferred \r\n\t\tfor the other two to construct the difference engine & for\r\n\t\tShiva to monitor it's engagement for full capacity.\r\n\t\tKrishna was a little thrown by this & then destabilised\r\n\t\tby a wave of his person-construction with it's threads of\r\n\t\twife & child. here now here now! Shiva cried, all else is\r\n\t\tstory! at least stay until I can benchmark the quality &\r\n\t\tfoundation of your god-consciousness, do you want to lose it?\r\n\t\tBut krisha could not be swayed, & he departed, ourselves\r\n\t\tmutually bestowing honours upon each other. Shiva sensed\r\n\t\tthat the window of this working bee was closing, he had to\r\n\t\tmove fast. So only Shiva & Shakti remained, she was still\r\n\t\treceptive although assailed by enmeshing tendrils from her\r\n\t\tperson constructs, for she too had a lover. Shakti would\r\n\t\thave loved to have her lover here & so would Shiva, the\r\n\t\tdifference engine could be built again. Not that the\r\n\t\ttwo of them could not build it, just... well call it a\r\n\t\ttendency to the mad scientist/nutty professor aspect of\r\n\t\tShiva's make-up.\r\n\t\tAh Shakti, my Goddess of Yes, Divine Slut, whole universes\r\n\t\tmay sunder & fall & be recreated in the consequences of our\r\n\t\tbliss, how many secrets do you have Shakti? Shakti did the\r\n\t\tthe standard trip of shapechanging to mothers, sisters &\r\n\t\tlovers, asking directly of her secrets caused her to\r\n\t\tthreaten unleashing the gates of hell, such enquiry had to\r\n\t\tbe executed riding on a wave of bliss\r\n\t\tWindows closing, dominos falling, Shakti was withdrawing,\r\n\t\tpulled back by the earth-plane dreaming, we mind-danced &\r\n\t\tthis started the engine again, she would withdraw, Shiva\r\n\t\twould re-awaken her by throwing all of his intelligence \t\t\t\t\r\n\t\tinto penetrating the dreamings of her person constructs.\r\n\t\tThe most profound workings awaited the wet tantra, we both\r\n\t\tknew it, she was hesitant to take this final step for it\r\n\t\tmeant hells within hells & heavens within heavens. Shakti\r\n\t\torally worshipped Shiva's lingham working up to the deeper\r\n\t\tinterpenetration, she made passing comment that Shiva's\r\n\t\tperson construct had nearly burnt out all childhood shame,\r\n\t\tthe wisdom of the goddess, she shared some deep shame of\r\n\t\thers as well., whoops! an inhabitant of the house\r\n\t\tour hosts walked through to the kitchen, Shakti was a\r\n\t\tlittle mortified, we couldn't merge here!?\r\n\t\tThis got Shiva thinking of the costing strategies, of\r\n\t\tgradated cognitive dissonance. Suppose shakti envisioned\r\n\t\ther perfect love nest, the costings would then come in\r\n\t\tpure, more lethal form, so by dispersing the costs into\r\n\t\tdissonance with all aspects of her ideals, then a\r\n\t\tmore pragmatic dynamic would result, if harder to kickstart.\r\n\t\tConstructing an environment of being in public & not with\t\r\n\t\ther partner of choice would be a firm foundation, if only\r\n\t\tfor the seasoned trouper. We repaired to my place across\r\n\t\tthe road, there were still fragments of party around, we\r\n\t\tdidn't repair to my bed-room but socialised, Shiva was\r\n\t\tlosing the plot as well, oh well...\r\n\t\tTime passed, it was hard to relate at a human level with\r\n\t\tthe other party goers, we left the house & enjoyed the\r\n\t\tmorning, we embraced & kissed tenderly our forms dissolved,\r\n\t\twe merged, our cosmic circuitry became apparent, space was\r\n\t\tsolid & matter spacious, Shiva wanted to finish the task &\r\n\t\tcould perceive the chain of being above him & all the\r\n\t\tlevels & layers of the Great Task that remained unfullfilled\r\n\t\tThat Shiva was not full blown ipsissimus Shiva, explained\r\n\t\tpart of the failure, oh well next time.\r\n\t\tSeven hours after our first meeting, Shakti/Uhura entered\r\n\t\ther car & left, we did not exchange phone numbers, now\r\n\t\tregretted, at the time it was part of the retaining game.\r\n\t\tOne last look, sharply broken, away she drove, farewell\r\n\t\tbrave goddess!\r\n\t\tOh.. well, Uhura fell back into enfolded layerings of\r\n\t\tperson-constructs, hopefully some of her self organisation\r\n\t\twould survive & more importantly she could transmit the\r\n\t\tconsciousness to her permanent partner.\r\n\t\tIt had been an eventful night, Uhura|Shakti did taste\r\n\t\ther goal of the nature of enlightenment, Vishnu & Shiva\r\n\t\twere successful at least in their claim of collapsing,\r\n\t\talbeit temporarily, time & space, history, path, lineage\r\n\t\t& hierarchy.\r\n\t\tOne must not neglect that jewel, the Orgy of Self Denial\r\n\t\tmany of the dimensions of its meaning were demonstrated\r\n\t\tas we oscillated up & down the axis of god-human, each\r\n\t\tself organisation has it's strengths & weaknesses, remaining\r\n\t\tpurely in human & deny your god nature, remain purely in\r\n\t\tyour god nature & deny your humanity, being division\r\n\t\tmulti-plexing suggests a way.\r\n\t\tWell... there was no shakti, remaining, quite appropriate,\r\n\t\tBUT, there were the daisies, ah... the daisy, such a vibrant\r\n\t\tzero-sum flower, looks beautiful but smells like shit, self\r\n\t\tcontained. I started to enter into some of my layerings as\r\n\t\twell, not too many, thank god. I contemplated them & the\r\n\t\tatmosphere became DMT-vibrant, Flower samadhi was at hand,\r\n\t\ttantric union with the flowers, it was consensual,\r\n\t\twe collapsed together, flowers poised in my third eye.\r\n\t\tThe flowers are 'Yes' creatures to be sure.\r\n\t\tMore can be written but we'll leave it at that.\r\nconclusions:\tThe best parties happen in the kitchen, proof positive.\r\n\t\tWhen windows of opportunity open then leap through, don't\r\n\t\tdrop the ball, GO!, GO!, GO! & don't look back.\r\n\t\tI have always said a God that could not express everything in\r\n\t\twords is not much of a God. We'll I'm no God. There is so\r\n\t\tmuch that could be written about that convergence & so much\r\n\t\tthat has been overlooked or forgotten, no matter, some of the\r\n\t\tflavour has come through, this was not meant to be a door\r\n\t\tstop.\r\n\t\tThis work will continue 'when the stars are right',\r\n\t\tevolving consciousness towards being-division multiplexing\r\n\t\talong the chain of being will ensure that the frequency\r\n\t\tof the waves of amnesia & anamnesis monotonically increases,\r\n\t\tthus eternity in time, forever.\r\n\t\tIt could be asked what exactly 'powers' the great cosmic\r\n\t\tmainframe & keeps it going, there are answers, but they\r\n\t\tare beyond the scoping of this report, the holder of\r\n\t\tlimitations is a referent however.\r\n\t\tSometimes I wonder what the point is in sharing these\r\n\t\tstories As I struggle to find compact clear expressions of\r\n\t\tthe unfolding stories & then I remind myself that this is\r\n\t\tcartography of the possible & the forgotten & is my & our\r\n\t\tcommonwealth. It also has the virtue of putting in very\r\n\t\tsharp relief the nature of my daily earth bound follies\r\n\t\tversus the real work of Consciousness, thus it is a\r\n\t\tsobering activity that refines clearer intent for myself.\r\naftermath:\tHard to trace, total conceptual violation without violating\r\n\t\tat this level of substantiality is not everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\t\tIn fact it's about as popular as Lapsang Souchong.\r\n\t\tSpock has had no reports from either Uhura nor Kirk, having\r\n\t\tmet neither before this convergence, it would be interesting\r\n\t\tto see how much of the expanded consciousness has remained\r\n\t\tsince that Saturday night, the price of liberty is eternal\r\n\t\tvigilance after all, but as the Americans are finding out\r\n\t\twho guards the guardians?

For instance the shakti (& it's 9 times out of 10, shakti\r\n\tderived) may wish to do it in intense privacy with her partner-lover,\r\n\tthus to spread the cost out she would do it with a different partner\r\n\twith her usual partner sitting by observing, also doing it an audience\r\n\tpresent [an aware audience] would disperse the costs considerably,\r\n\twithout deflecting or avoiding the costs, it can get very, very subtle.\r\n(MM)\tAs above, so below, much ado about nothing, every moment, pay in full,\r\n\tevery moment painful, is the message getting through?\r\n(NN)\tIn particularly intense sessions, whole universes may be created &\r\n\tdestroyed, the stars will fall out of the skies, mountains will subside\r\n\tthe eath will quake, as the cost of the positive that is created...\r\n\tthis is a taste of the potential, the portfolio of costs can be deftly\r\n\tmanaged & the costs are best corralled nearer the source of the\r\n\tcreation.\r\n(OO)\tThe masterfully contrived & deftly administered killer concept is a\r\n\tthing of joy & beauty forever.\r\n(PP)\tThis is it, right here, here & now, not lost in there-then & the\r\n\tvisscitudes of person, self & history, this is of critical importance\r\n\tto the process of the highest tantra.\r\n(QQ)\tYou can have tantric sex with any object or being but... the highest\r\n\tvoltage is between male-hu-man-be-ing & fe-male-hu-man-be-ing.\r\n(RR)\tThe only thing stopping you having tantric sex with a bunch of daisies\r\n\tis your disbelief that you could have sex with a bunch of daisies!\r\n\tDon't knock it until you try...\r\n(SS)\tThe highest tantra is dedicated to consciousness expansion &\r\n\tconsciousness expansion is about maximising contradiction\r\n\tharmoniously & consciously.\r\n(TT)\tThere are many apt expressions or meme sequences that can be used to\r\n\textract your self from the dreaming, the 'orgy of self denial' is\r\n\tpretty damn good. Take the expression 'everything is meaningless',\r\n\ta fine mantra so long as you rigorously apply it. Negative nihilists\r\n\tuse it to justify acting out all sorts of negativity, the mantra is\r\n\tbest if universally applied & self applied. 'Nothing matters' & that\r\n\talso includes the negative voices, thus you can not give life to them\r\n\twith equal a plomb as you would not give life to the positive voices.\r\n(UU)\tDr Frankenstein & his lab assistant Igor are also an example of \r\n\tdependent arising. Consider a being that is straight & true &\r\n\tbeautiful then that will have a dependent arising that us twisted,\r\n\tbent, false & ugly, but is the positive being so honest as to own it's\r\n\town dependent arising?\r\n(VV)\tThe beginnings of Cosmic Love is when you start to own the dependent\r\n\tarising of Love which is Hate. When you start to love your hate &\r\n\tacknowledge it's intimate connection with love then cosmic love \r\n\tis born, by loving your hate you dont have to act it out or give it\r\n\tlife, just own, acknowledge & embrace it.\r\n(XX)\tThe highest tantra is about Cosmic Intelligence Activation.\r\n(YY)\tDry tantra can be practiced anywhere & is about 90% of the\r\n\teffectiveness.\r\n(ZZ)\tThis is the last statement (for a while).\r\r\n\n"
