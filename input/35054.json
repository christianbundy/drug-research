 "report": "<p>Smoked 3 rolled cigarettes of catnip over an hour or so. Felt a rush of calm/chill after two or three drags.  Wandered around on a golf course in the rain for awhile smoking the other 2 cigs.  Whole trip was similiar to a mild pot buzz, without the apathy (which is a bonus for me.  The buzz wears off soon after you finish smoking, and leaves you content and drowsy (hyper-chill as I call it).  All in all, not something for the gutterrat drug fiend who constantly strives to trip balls, but a good way to chill for those who are bored/disillusioned with getting stupid on pot.</p>"
