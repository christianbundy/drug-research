I obtained a 100mg baggie of 2c-d from a online vendor literally a week before the huge RC bust happened. I did not have a milligram scale but I wanted to try a RC just because I am up for trying pretty much anything once. Previous experience w/ pyscadelics include good expereince with shrooms and salvia and a little experience with dxm, dramamine, and baby woodrose seeds (lsa). Of all of the different RC's I chose 2c-d because I do not have access to a milligram scale. Because the doses of 2c-d are substancially higher than other RC's, I thought that it would be a ok idea to eye out the dosage. How wrong I was. <br><br>
I have no idea how much mg of powder was in the baggie to begin with. I tried to weigh it out on a scale that was accurate to 1.00 g however the scale wouldnt even pick it up. I am guessing that the dosage that I eyed out was much more than the intended dosage (50mg) which means that the baggie had more than 100mg in it to begin with. <br><br>
So my friend and I split a bag of what we thought was 100mg of 2c-d. we made 2 equal sized lines of the powder and then proceeded to put these lines into two different cups of water. we each drank a cup. it tasted awful... like chemical backwash. Our plan was to watch a movie and see where our minds took us. We pop in the DVD and begin watching it. The 2c-d was ingested on a empty stomach. 20 minutes later we both began to feel a weird type of nausea and knew we were coming up. However, unlike with other substances, there was no euphoria at all. the nausea would not go away.<br><br>
Throught the whole trip the same chemical backwash taste was in my mouth. I could TELL that I was on a chemical drug. Unlike MDMA, another chemical drug, while rolling I do not get the slightest feeling that I am fucekd up on chemicals, it actually feels somewhat natural. While I was on 2c-d I felt like my whole body was being processed by a chemical waste company.<br><br>
After I came up, I looked at my skin and like on many other psycadelics, I was getting patterns and shapes forming on it. My friend and I got bored of my house, still with an intense amount of nausea we decided to drive to a baseball field that is a few blocks away. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> Unlike on other psycadelics, I felt like I had total control of everything I did. Pretty much I was sober but I was seeing shit. We got to the field and sat down on some bleachers. We looked at the ground and both commented on how the ground was 'cratering' before us... or turning into little craters. It was from here that stuff went for a awful turn for the worse...<br><br>
that nausea that I was talking about never went away the whole trip. It stayed there and just intensified as I began to trip harder. However, the visuals went away. It was purly a mind trip. We were both tweaking out really bad. Nothing could cheer us up, we drove around and listened to music but that just made shit worse. We even went to the fucking mall. I had no clue what was going on. The chemical was playing serious tricks with my brain. I was hearing things that werent there, thought everyone was looking at me, thought people were calling my name, and thought that everyone was out to kill me. <br><br>
We left the mall 10 mins after we got in and just sat in the car and talked. We could only think of the worst. We were talking to each other about different good friends who we both shared and about how we hated them so much. The drug made us only think about the bad in everyone in the world. <br><br>
Now came the weirdest part. My friend began to punch himself. He realized that he could punch himself as hard as he wanted and not feel a single thing. I then tried it myself. I punched myself in the upper leg. I relized I felt nothing at all. I then began absolutely whaling my chest and my legs. Not feeling a single thing. My friend began punching himself in the face repeatedly until I convinced him to stop. This was at the peak of our 2c-d experience.<br><br>
It seemed to just get worse and worse and we both tried to fight it. We were trying to act sober but we both knew that the 2c-d was really fucking up our perspective on everything. We needed to do something, anything, to escape this trip. We thus decided to smoke weed.<br><br>
My friend and I at the time (and currently still are but not to the same degree) huge potheads. At the time of our 2c-d trip we had smoked every day for atleast 3 or 4 weeks probably more. We both loved weed and everything about it. Weed could not fail on us now. It had to make things better. My friend was not tweaking out as much as I was at this time so he only took 3-5 hits. I on the other hand smoked probably .7g to my head trying desperately to kill the confusion of 2c-d and 'get back to normal' which was high on weed for us.<br><br>
And... it made stuff better. Weed had once again done me good. I have always relied on weed to get me out of sketchy drug situations. If I was having a bad shroom trip or was tweaking out on lord knows what (or even if I was pissed sober), I would just smoke myself retarded and all my problems just vanish. While smoking a good deal of pot to my head in a short amount of time did not totally dissipate the effects of 2c-d, it made shit a ton better. <br><br>
Just like on shrooms, smoking pot on 2c-d made the visuals come back again... not as intense as in the beginning of the trip but they were definetly noticable again. However, I was still thinking about the bad parts of everyone... even myself. We were just aimlessly driving around and we pulled into a supermarket parking lot because I had to go to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and all I can think about was how much of a druggie I had become and how I was absolutey destroying myself (even though the only drug I was doing in the past few months was pot and occasionally shrooms)... the mirror began transforming a little and changing shapes and I just merely sighed and went back into the car.... this was approximatly 4 hours after the 2c-d was initially injested.<br><br>
After I left the supermarket, we both finally felt ourselves returning to normal. The peak of the drug was over. We drove around listening to music for the next hour, not really saying anything to one another. We finally got back to my house around 6 hours after we left... finally sober. My head ached and I was incredibly mellow and very pissed off about what just happened to me. Later that night I went to a party and got shitfaced just so I could forget about the events earlier in the day.<br><br>
So whats the moral of this story? ALWAYS use a milligram scale when using RC's... Regardless of the RC. I thought that I would be fine eyeing out 2c-d because of the high dosage of it. I was very very wrong...<!-- End Body -->
