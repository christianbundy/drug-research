I had just gotten out of school for the holiday. I was asked to go to a party that night by my boy h2k earlier in the day. there was only to be a few people there so I said alright.  We had scored a fat sack of shrooms the day before (about 4 grams) and we were going to trip at the party. It was all good.<br><br>
So we get to the party at about 7:30  My friend had bought everyone alcohol for the night, but me and h2k werent drinking. When we got there h2k busts out with a cigarette pack filled with joints.  He lit one up and we started smoking.  We smoke the kind goodness for a while and the we went back inside. Remembering that we had shrooms we decided to take them. It was 8:30. I washed the shrooms down with some Smirnoff ice (since thats all there was to drink) <br><br>
Ok now Im being dead serious now. By 8:45 I was tripping my fucking balls off. I had tripped before and it has never hit me so fast and so sudden before. so me and h2k (who was also tripping at this time) decided to go for a drive. That was a mistake.  We got about two blocks away from the party and he had to stop the car to let somebody else drive. it was funny as hell.  We cruised for a while smoked a joint and went back to the party.<br><br>
As soon as we got back it started getting crazy. The floor was moving and it felt like I was sinking into the floor.  At about 9:30 me and h2k went outside to blaze a fatty. As soon as that was done I lit a cigarette took two drags and I heard '5-0, 5-0' <br>
I didnt think it was happenening. I then saw a cop walking through the trees. Again it seemed unreal until he came and said something to me. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was just standing there.  He was cool and when he went upstairs I followed. it was mayhem upstairs. I watched my friend get arrested for contributing to the alcoholism of minors. Then the cops called our parents. I wasnt even at the peak of my trip yet and I was going to have to go home.  oh well<br><br>
H2k left and the cops called my mom. When my mom got to the house the cops called me into the kitchen. I put my hand on the counter and it sunk in like it was a liquid.  When I pulled my hand out the coutertop seemed to come with it. It was definitely bugged out.<br><br>
Anyway the cops said I wasnt being charged with anything because I wasnt drinking.  little did they know we had eaten shrooms and there was a pack of joints in the yard.I was relieved that nothing really happened to me and h2k.<br><br>
So I got home at about 10:15 took a shower and stared in the mirror for what seemed like an eternity.  It was so mesmerizing.<br><br>
That was pretty much the end of the night for me.<br><br>
In closing I would like to say that magic mushrooms make the world so much better to me.  Tripping on shrooms has made me see everything for what it really is.<!-- End Body -->
