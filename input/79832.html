The problem with this drug is that its high is surpassed only by its speed of tolerance.  <br><br>
I started by snorting one pill 10mgs (only after a three year daily oxy habit), it was an incredible rush of warmth and euphoric security unprecedented by my past opiate/opioid use such as handfuls (rather nosefuls) of oxycodone, hydrocodone, and as much Fentanyl as I could beg, borrow, or steal.  The rush seemed to start in my brainstem and very quickly cover my head including the tongue and then my entire body inside and out.<br><br>
It took only three days to work up a tolerance of thirty mgs just to get the most minimal high- very little rush.  After only two weeks, I was trying to jam 8 of these pink bitches up my nose, to no avail. <br><br>
So I have been IVing for the past two months; I started with half a pill 5mg and now I have to put 4 full pills 40mgs in a 3cc rig to get that rush but ooh that fucking rush! The nod is not much to speak of; basically I am puncturing my veins multiple times a day in anticipation of a two or three minute rush.  When IVed the rush is more of a warm, beautiful specter overpowering me from behind and before the needle is empty she has wrapped me in love, peace, and, happiness, but by the time I catch my breath (literally) she is gone to leave me wanting Bitch. <br><br>
The only grace I have if at all, is that I always run out before my new script so I suffer, terribly suffer, for a week or two until I can hit the Doc.  I stay the withdrawals by taking suboxone (wearing a fresh 100mcg Fent patch wont even help). I gave half a pill 5mg to a low tolerant friend and he was sick for three hours puking, lethargic, wishing he was dead.<br><br>
As for my drug experience; over the past 18 years, I have used almost every substance reported to get you high (even banana peels), I have been to raves and Dead shows alike, as a connoisseur of not only drugs but the various cultures.  Over the past year I have been prescribed Opana 10mg 4xday and 100mcg Fentanyl every 72hrs (usually bump it to 200 or 300) also I did a couple of ounces of cocaine (several thousand dollars), and some pot (when free), and a few doses of morning glory seeds (nice) and once mescaline (what can I say) and DXM (use only when needed) and lots of alcohol.<!-- End Body -->
