 "report": "<p>\nI got 25 HBWR seeds, I then used a pair of pliers to crush the seeds.  I did not remove anything from the outside of the seeds, they were used as is.  I then put the crushed seeds in a jar with about 2 cups of water.  I let the mixture sit for 36 hours, shaking occaisonally.  The water turned a nasty brownish color, but didn't smell of much.</p><p>At about 1:30 pm, 'B' and I drank an equal part of the liquid and ate the remains of the seeds (leaving about a 3rd of the seed mush).  This was done on an empty stomach.  It was very mild tasting, somewhat like an oatmeal taste or something.  We then sat back smoked a joint or two and waited.  </p><p>+2 hours- we both noticed slight sensation...somewhat lazy, groggy....nothing very strong.</p><p>+3 hours- noticable feeling of happiness, silly grin on face.  'trippy' sensation...tightness of jaw, jittery stomach.  Very similiar to the feeling I get on LSD.  Although no visuals whatsoever.  </p><p>+5 hours- giddy, giggly and feeling different.  Nothing strong at all, but a noticable effect.  Could have been active during the experience, but was quite happy to be chilling at home listening to music and hanging out.</p><p>No nasuea or pain...some gas, burping.  </p><p>Overall, we both agreed that it was quite pleasant, felt like half of a hit of a drug somewhere between LSD and MDMA...I wonder what 20 seeds would feel like?  Anyway, I was skeptical about these things, but I am a convert now, and will look into other natural legal drugs of this type...look in other vaults in the future, to see how I like em.</p><p>Overall grade, C+ (would have been higher but my expectations were too high)</p>"
