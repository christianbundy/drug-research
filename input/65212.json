 "report": "<p>My experience with Modafinil was an interesting one to say the least. I was at a friend's house and interested in acquiring some speed. He told me he had some great speed that wouldn't be detectable on drug tests. Needless to say, I was interested. So I bought from him two Modafinil pills for $5. I took one and shared one with a friend.</p><p>The first hour or so, I noticed really no effect from the drug. I felt the same as always. </p><p>8:00 PM The drug effect starts to kick in. I feel boosted awake. I feel much more alert, similar to the feeling of a few caffeine pills, but without any of the stimulant effects. No speedy feeling, no elevated heart rate...nothing. Just very awake.</p><p>10:30 PM I had taken the Modafinil right before attending a concert. At this point, the concert was over and the Modafinil was just starting to really kick in. I felt more and more awake by the minute.</p><p>3:00 AM I've spend almost the entire night chatting with my friend who take Modafinil on the internet. Neither of us are at all tired at this point. We just continue chatting.</p><p>7:00 AM At this point, I feel the Modafinil starting to wear off. My energy and alertness boost goes away and I'm really feeling a crash coming on.</p><p>8:00 AM I crash and fall asleep. I sleep for maybe 2 or 3 hours and then am awakened because I have go to a class. When I wake up, I can definitely tell I've crashed. I feel insanely tired.</p><p>Overall, it was a good experience, but not something that really had much of a drug experience. Modafinil was unlike any stimulant I have ever tried. There were genuinely no real stimulant effects, just an amazing feeling of being completely void of any feeling of tiredness for a solid 12 hours. I can see how this could be a great drug to boost alertness for work or school. I'd definitely consider taking it again, but not for recreation. It should in no way be considered speed.</p>"
