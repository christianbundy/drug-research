 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFew days ago after around a month or so of using Subutex, I heard that there was some pretty good acid going around, I had not had a trip in years and thought this would be a good idea, I asked a few friends if they fancied a trip, but none of them were up for it, so I was gonna go it alone. \r\nAround tea time I got a few dvd's and some music out in preperation of the trip, I swallowed my trip, an elephant, and stuck some hawkwind on the sterio, I relaxed on my sofa and let the music take me away, the next thing the album ended and I was still ... Normal, nothing was happening, my perception was quite unchanged, this was an hour after taking the trip, I thought I may need to bring it on and put some trippy comedy on the t.v., nothing at all. I stayed up for a couple of hours, still nothing. I retired to my bed very dissapointed.\n\n\n"
