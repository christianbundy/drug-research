My little brother introduced me to DXM a couple of years ago, I did not know that such a trip was even possible.  This drug has advanced me spiritually and mentally beyond what I even imagined possible.  The most recent trip that I have had was the most amazing yet.  Throughout the years that I have tripped, each experience was like the most vivid near death experience possible, the sensation of being beyond life and back to the most familiar state that I can only compare to what might have been felt before I was born being very intense.<br><br>
I took 480 MG of Triaminic Thinstrips, waiting nearly an hour or so before I felt anything out of the ordinary.  A wave of nausea washed over me and I threw up several times before that familiar wave of comfort finally settled over me.  When the drug was in full peak I was watching with my little brother several TV shows showing some of the more extreme police shows.  The sense of familiarity and being in a dream was VERY strong, most of the experience being most like a trip back to that time that I can most compare to the time I can imagine before I was born.  There is the most peculiar and strong feeling of deja vu and stong visual hallucinations of a place before memory.  The experiences and memories that I have taken from each trip have made me more and more convinced of a previous life beyond just a past life, a super-conscious state where I feel like a bud or droplett from a larger place.  <br><br>
Everything feels like part of a dream and the natural result of every decision I have made in my life up to this point.  If I am in a dark place I can close my eyes and hallucinate in pixels.  I have seen past lives and from the TV shows that I have watched a greater sense of purpose or closeness to that beginning.  This drug is nothing like I can compare to, it is the best comparison to a spiritual near death experience.  I love it, it makes me feel like I am back to the source of life, like I am dead and alive at the same time.  Coming down from the trip is a slow and spiritual release from a higher state, if I happen to share the experience with any friends I will hopefully be born as a soul brother/sister to that person.<!-- End Body -->
