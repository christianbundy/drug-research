A crude extraction of Anadenanthera Colubrina Var. Cebil obtained from Argentina was made.<br><br>
Three gram of Anadenanthera Colubrina Var. Cebil where ground finely in a coffee bean grinder. One hundred ml of H2O was acidified to pH 2 using citric acid. 200ml of the acidic solution was added to the plant material. This was heated, shaken often and allowed to sit for two days. Next, naptha was added to help remove the unwanted fats and oils. This was shaken and allowed to macerate for 24 hours. The naptha layer was removed and discarded. This was repeated one more time. 50ml Vodka was added to the remaining solution. The entire sum of liquid was evaporated on a pyrex dish. The result was a black, tar-like, gummy substance. This was smoked using a regular lighter in a small pipe. A small amount of smoke was inhaled before the melted tar covered the orifice of the pipe. This clogged up the hole and disallowed more smoke to be inhaled. The smoke was held in for 30 seconds then released slowly. A heavy somatic feeling occured for 5 minutes. No alteration of consciousness or thought process. This was very noticable and was not very likely to be placebo. I imagine that if one obtained a freebasing pipe and a butane lighter, a larger amount of smoke could be inhaled and a stronger effect would be felt.<!-- End Body -->
