 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have done only a few other drugs and this is probably not in top 3 for me...I've done hydrocodone a pill I haven't heard of anywhere but here called L's xanax klonopin and marijuana several times, but this is worth trying.<br>12:00 pm<br>Took 4 50mg pills ate a pb&j and watched Fox News nothing yet.<br>12:30<br>Started feeling really light...Starting to feel pretty good. Mellow and just peaceful.<br>1:15<br>Starting to feel very relaxed, I'm starting to feel a nice body high just...great.<br>1:30<br>I think I might be at the plateau I just feel really...peaceful and lazy and mellowed out.<br>2:00<br>Very euphoric and cant help from smiling. I feel great. Just...ahh =]<br>2:48<br>I think Im coming down. Not bad at all overall the whole thing is feeling like a hydrocodone trip without getting the nods. I love it.<br>3:30<br>Welp its kinda wearing off. Still feel great. Body high is still there. Just feel peaceful.<br>4:10<br>Welp back to normal. Still feeling great. just a little nauseated. But it was pretty good. =]\n\n\n"
