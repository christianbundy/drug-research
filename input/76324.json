 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have done only a few other drugs and this is probably not in top 3 for me...I've done hydrocodone a pill I haven't heard of anywhere but here called L's xanax klonopin and marijuana several times, but this is worth trying.\r\n12:00 pm\r\nTook 4 50mg pills ate a pb&j and watched Fox News nothing yet.\r\n12:30\r\nStarted feeling really light...Starting to feel pretty good. Mellow and just peaceful.\r\n1:15\r\nStarting to feel very relaxed, I'm starting to feel a nice body high just...great.\r\n1:30\r\nI think I might be at the plateau I just feel really...peaceful and lazy and mellowed out.\r\n2:00\r\nVery euphoric and cant help from smiling. I feel great. Just...ahh =]\r\n2:48\r\nI think Im coming down. Not bad at all overall the whole thing is feeling like a hydrocodone trip without getting the nods. I love it.\r\n3:30\r\nWelp its kinda wearing off. Still feel great. Body high is still there. Just feel peaceful.\r\n4:10\r\nWelp back to normal. Still feeling great. just a little nauseated. But it was pretty good. =]\n\n\n"
