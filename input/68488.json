 "report": "<p>Being prescribed Lyrica 100mg. Being in the mood to try for some euphoria, I upped my dose one Saturday afternoon to 500mg.</p><p>It took about 45min to start to feel the effects. What I felt wasn't exactly euphoria as one experiences from Opiate pain meds etc, but rather a feeling of energy, and I did a few chores around the house I had been putting off. As I reached the 2hr mark I sat down and relaxed in front of the tube. It was then when I started to see flashes and streams of blue and red colors off and on. I knew I was high in a way but not stoned in a way where one loses coordination etc. </p><p>Just a pleasant experience that lasted several hours. The overall energy though lasted about 8hrs. But the good news is I actually start to feel drowsy where I can sleep ok.</p>"
