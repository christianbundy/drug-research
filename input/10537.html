I was most fascinated when I discovered growing in my brother's garden the plant know as 'Angel's Trumpet'.  I knew it was that from which Datura is extracted but was too afraid to try it having heard so many bad reports of people's near death experiences.<br><br>
However through a network of people I know on the web I was finally let into a little known secret and that is that the actual petals and leaves of the plant are indeed quite toxic. The actual part of the plant needed is only the stamen, that is the thin white stalk inside the flower, and this is best picked when the flower is nearly dead and all that remains is the bright yellow banana shaped part.<br><br>
I tried rolling this thin sliver in a cigarette and smoking it and after about 20 minutes or so I began to notice a euphoric feeling and then I noticed that if looked into a light in a darkened room that the light came towards me and danced before my eyes.<br><br>
The light and I spoke together for some time.  All over it was a very mystical experience and I am looking forward to seeing the plant flower again.<!-- End Body -->
