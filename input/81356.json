 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nA 200mg dose of Modafinil produces the following effects in me:<br>- A non-euphoric rush of mental energy that lasts 20-30 minutes<br>- Muscular tension: jaw clenching, tightening of the chest<br>- Mental silence<br>- Anxiety (Im an anxious person by nature)<br>- Mild anhedonia that lasts up to a day <br>Modafinil begins to kick-in within 30 minutes and peaks at 80 minutes. <br>The effects are like Adderall, except without the euphoria. <br>Im  a 21 year old male, 150 pounds, have a full tolerance to amphetamines, and am generally hypersensitive to psychoactives.\n\n\n"
