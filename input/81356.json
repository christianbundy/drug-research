 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nA 200mg dose of Modafinil produces the following effects in me:\r\n- A non-euphoric rush of mental energy that lasts 20-30 minutes\r\n- Muscular tension: jaw clenching, tightening of the chest\r\n- Mental silence\r\n- Anxiety (Im an anxious person by nature)\r\n- Mild anhedonia that lasts up to a day \r\nModafinil begins to kick-in within 30 minutes and peaks at 80 minutes. \r\nThe effects are like Adderall, except without the euphoria. \r\nIm  a 21 year old male, 150 pounds, have a full tolerance to amphetamines, and am generally hypersensitive to psychoactives.\n\n\n"
