 "report": "<p>\n11/9 10:10pm</p><p>Fuck it. I want to be out. I took the pill with no remorse and with no regret.</p><p>Ive heard a few stories about this drug. It works like an opiate, but doesnt bind to receptor sites as opiates do. Seems interesting enough for me to consider.</p><p>:20min A general feeling of slowness sets in.</p><p>:40min My body is becoming heavier, more difficult to control as time progresses; however, I dont seem to be sensing (picking up on) anything else due to the fact that Im watching the new Marilyn Manson DVD Guns, God and Government World Tour.</p><p>Although, Im able to pick out what is going on in my head. The effects are mild and similar to those of Vicodin.</p><p>:50min The key thing to note here is that this is a low dose for me. I decided to go with a 50mg dose because Ive read about how higher doses the first time cause vomiting.</p><p>1:10 Im beginning to think that a way of making this better is to smoke weed. (I wont take another pill. Im saving the 3 I have left for a 150mg dose later.)</p><p>1:20 The head effects have blended into my normal feeling. Meaning? I became tired and exhausted, instead of high, which leads me to believe that tramadol is a really weak drug.</p><p>1:40 I will say that tramadol is better than hydrocodone, so far.</p><p>1:45 Final thoughts: weak. The nicotine in cigarettes has stronger effects than this.</p><p>2:00 Time to blaze some trees.</p><p>2:20 More electrical. My teeth are numb. Im able to write fairly well, unaffectedly so. Unfortunately, my vision is in horrible disrepair. My nose got cold, and that also reminded me of a time I took hydrocodone pills in the past.</p><p>Im also severely retarded. My head is numb. I think the tramadol has taken a seriously stronger effect. Its great though. Im completely out of it.</p><p>2:25 My fingers are numb, and I cant feel most of my body. My back is numb... it was interesting to crack my back, because I couldnt feel anything. The crack itself produced from the twist felt amazing.</p><p>Im kind of afraid of dying at this point. Im having too much fun since Im so fucking gone.</p><p>2:50 For me, the trees made the trip. The cannabis chemicals cremated my core.</p><p>3:10 This drug has made me relaxed and very calm. Im also under the effects of a speedy-type euphoria.</p><p>3:30 The attention-grabbing thing about this drug combo is that I got to the point at which I cant feel certain body parts, yet there are no tranquilizing effects present. I can get up and walk around just fine, but Im gone inside my head as well.</p><p>Ill mention this one more time... this combo is highly euphoric. (Ive smoked this weed before, and its euphoric by itself to begin with.)</p><p>3:45 Id say this drug has potential for high abuse rates. Its too good to be non-addictive, and its too body numbing to be resisted. The blast of euphoria itself makes it hard for me to say that Ill never do this drug again.</p><p>Id take tramadol over hydrocodone any day. Hydrocodone cant separate my mind from my body after smoking weed as well as tramadol can.</p><p>3:50 The good thing about tramadol is that it also lasts for a longer period of time than other painkillers.</p><p>Although, the green has saved me from being dead to the world, as painkillers normally make me.</p><p>3:40am I cant tell time anymore (I don't know how many hours it has been since the time I took the pill), but Ill smoke again (before I go to sleep).</p><p>:20min Mentally, I feel like Im on shrooms. Its a powerful hold over mental functions, and its a trippy way of thinking...</p><p>:40min Now Im starting to go numb. I cant really feel my fingers or legs. Everything seems to be moving with ease though.</p><p>Peace out/</p><p>The following day I spent like a zombie. Imagine not getting a full nights sleep and wishing you could stay in bed. (The sheets are very pleasurable to lie in.) The entire day feels like that.</p><p>One more important thing that needs to be considered is that in the following days Ive become more willing to look and say crazy things since this experience. Im the kind of person that can sense the slightest change in behavior, and Ive noticed that Ive tended to be more obnoxious.</p><p>Could this possibly be as a result of my mind not being able to release itself?</p>"
