  I ordered some powdered fly agaric mushrooms from a reliable company a few weeks ago. I decided to take about one and a half tablespoons in a cup of tea. I drank it down and experienced sweating about two hours later, not too bad. I figured that I needed to take more, since I didn't have any other effects.<br><br>
  So last night around 10:00, I took 3 heaping tablespoons in a cup of tea. I drank it down, the same as before. Within an hour and a half, I started sweating. I didn't get any other effects, except for being a bit restless.<br><br>
  I decided to go to sleep around 12:00. I couldn't really sleep. I continued to sweat buckets. Around 1:30 I finally fell somewhat asleep. My wife woke me up around 2:30 telling me that I was all wet. I was. The bed was soaked, and I was FREEZING and shivering.<br><br>
  So I decided to take a hot bath. I took one in very hot water, and felt a million times better, my skin returned to a normal temperature, and I slept very well, even though I had to sleep on the floor (my bed was soaked).  I woke up feeling great.<br><br>
  I still have more of the powdered mushrooms, but I don't think I will be taking it. I didn't get any mind altering effects from a dose that made me really uncomfortable, and I don't want to see how much I'd have to sweat to hallucinate.<!-- End Body -->
