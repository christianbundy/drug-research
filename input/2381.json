 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\n12:50AM\r\n-------\r\n        OK, so its actually the 18th now. So what. I haven't gone to sleep\r\nyet, so its the 17th as far as I'm concerned. Anyway...\r\n        I have 2.5 tablets of Propacet, each containing 50mg of \r\ndextropropoxyphene. They're the last of a batch of 8 of them that I was\r\ngiven. I ingest all of them. I had smoked a little cannabis earlier, still\r\nfeel a lingering effect, but am close to baseline.\r\n1:09AM\r\n------\r\n        I begin to feel a hint of opiate feel kicking in. I also seem to\r\nbe feeling random itches all over my body, but they are easy to ignore.\r\nThis is a typical opiate alert for me. I feel slightly warm, a little\r\n'floaty,' and real calm. Not much else yet. Narcotics seem to take a long\r\ntime to take effect orally.\r\n1:21AM\r\n------\r\n        The itching passed several minutes ago. But other than that, there\r\nhas been no change. I almost even feel closer to baseline than at my last\r\ncheck-in. I'm yawning a little now though.\r\n1:45AM\r\n------\r\n        Well, I definitely feel 'something' - basically the same as I have\r\nbeen feeling, but its moved up a level of intensity. Its tempting at this\r\npoint to smoke some cannabis to bring on the effects. I'm holding off\r\nthough, so I can get a good description of an unclouded dextropropoxyphene\r\nexperience. But damn... this slow come on time is a negative in my\r\nopinion. I would hate to have to wait this long if I were using it for\r\npain relief!\r\n2:10AM\r\n------\r\n        T+1:20 and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. This is taking an\r\nunusually long time. I haven't eatin in 11 hours or so, so my stomach\r\nwasn't full. I feel slightly more than I did at last check-in. Same\r\neffects again, just a little stronger. A kind of warm tingly sensation\r\ndiffused throughout my upper body and somewhat in my legs. A feeling of\r\ncalmness. Somewhat quieted thought processes. But I'm not yet feeling the\r\neuphoria or the 'buzz' yet.\r\n2:15AM\r\n------\r\n        As I typed that last paragraph, things did jump up a level. The\r\nbody tingles increased alot, and spread all over my body. There is some\r\ntinnitus in my ears now. Every now and then I get random itches, which has\r\nbeen going on since I felt the first hint of effects. I'm developing a\r\ndecent 'buzz' and some euphoric sensations now as well. \r\n2:30AM\r\n------\r\n        Things still seem to be building, but I'm at a pretty decent level\r\nnow. I feel typical opiate effects, though sort of mild. As I said,\r\nnarcotics are very different from other CNS depressants. Its hard to\r\ncompare this high to something like GHB or alcohol.\r\n        I feel a little warm, its a pleasant warmth. My body feels a sort\r\nof tingly, floaty sensation. I feel much lighter than usual. I don't feel\r\nlike moving around at all. I tried to lay down, though, and that wasn't\r\nnoticably more comfortable than sitting in my computer chair or standing.\r\nIt doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in, I'm equally comfortable.\r\nIts a comfortableness that seems to come primarily from not caring about\r\nthings that might normally make me uncomfortable. My thought processes are\r\nslow... I'm a verbal thinker, and the voice in my mind is much quieter\r\nthan normal. Its not that thought is impaired, I *can* think if I want\r\nto... it just seems nicer to not think though. Opiates are a very\r\ndetatched high. You just want to float around feeling calm, not doing or\r\nthinking. Its not that you feel unusually happy - you just feel mentally\r\nrelaxed and physically good. Personally I find it sort of boring, but I\r\ncan see how this state would appeal to alot of people, especially those\r\nwith escapist tendencies. Music is slightly enhanced. Orbital's 'Halcyon\r\nOn & On' sounds prettier than usual, and goes well with the floaty\r\nsensations. Other minor effects... I have dry mouth, but its different\r\nthan cannabis 'cottonmouth.' I was pretty hungry before I took the pills.\r\nThe hunger vanished within a half hour or 45 minutes or so and hasn't\r\nreturned. The itching is still somewhat there, but its so easy to ignore\r\nas to be a non-issue. Its concentrated on my scalp, face and arms now,\r\nthough, whereas earlier it was all over. My juice tastes bland.\r\n2:50AM\r\n------\r\n        Its been 2 hours... peak plasma concentrations of\r\ndextropropoxyphene are supposedly reached at 2-2.5 hours, and I do feel as\r\nthough I've gotten as far as I'm going to. There doesn't seem to be\r\nanymore sensation of increase in the effects. I'm kind of bored of the\r\nhigh already. Narcotics just don't do all that much for me on their own.\r\nI've been wanting to smoke some cannabis, but haven't yet because I wanted\r\nto write an accurate report of an unclouded narcotic high. I think I've\r\naccomplished that.\r\n3:00AM\r\n------\r\n        I smoke some cannabis. One hit from my glass pipe and I'm already\r\nfeeling much nicer. Yes, I think this is what was needed.\r\n3:15AM\r\n------\r\n        The cannabis made a huge difference. I can feel the effects of\r\nboth blended into a fuller high than the dextropropoxyphene alone. The\r\ncannabis also made me think more vocally again, and the combination makes\r\nmellow music AMAZING! It is making me a little sleepy though. Neither drug\r\nseems to dominate the high, its an even synergy, at least at these\r\ndosages.\r\n3:45AM\r\n------\r\n        I feel much the same as before, but the narcotic aspect of the\r\nhigh is starting to taper off ever so slightly. I'm pretty tired and plan\r\nto go to bed soon. This was interesting to actually document a narcotic\r\nexperience, but I've never really been a big fan of this class of drug.\r\nI'd definitely do it again if I was given some more, although I'd combine\r\nit right off with cannabis. Ah well...\n\n\n"
