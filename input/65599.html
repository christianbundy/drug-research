So me and my cousin were going to take a trip up to my cabin for a couple of days for my family's 4th of July celebration that we have every year. It just so happened that my parents weren't going to be able to go up this year so my cousin, my brother and I hitched a ride up with my grandparents. Now we usually bring up enough weed to last us the couple days which we had more than enough of, but me and my cousin wanted to try something new this time. So the day before we took off we decided to both get an eighth of mushrooms. A couple of my friends bought them too and I was with them when they took them and everyone had a good time, so I wasnt worried about anything bad happening. <br><br>
So we finally took off on about a seven hour car ride into Wisconsin. Our original plan was to eat them the day of the party and watch the firework show, but as you can imagine after being cooped up in my grandpas car for seven hours we were a little antsy by the time we got there. Ive got a very big family and this is the one time where I get to see most of them at one time, some of them I hadnt seen in years. So we finally get there and we decided to eat them right away, that was mistake number one. After we eat them my cousin, my bro, and me all decided to walk around in the woods for a while and smoke some weed until they took effect. The come up was great we were both having a great time you know laughing at pointless shit amazed at everything around us. Then thats when things took a turn for the worst. There was a very sudden change in the weather it was sunny all day and it suddenly started raining hard for about five minutes and then just stopped, now this kind of threw me off a bit and I got really confused. Then thats when I started to feel sick and knew it was going to turn out bad. <br><br>
All the sudden I stopped and started getting these crazy burps coming from deep inside my stomach, I puked up this really weird looking substance that was all green and brown and when I saw it on the ground it looked like it was bubbling, basically it was a big clump of mushroom mixed with who knows what. That really freaked me out and the whole time after that I was kind of uncomfortable, a little panicky, and extremely confused. Then my brother left me and my cousin alone, thats mistake number two, the plan was that he was gonna go back to the cabin, hop on a boat and pick us up on the other side of the lake. Me and my cousin were just waiting for him to get back and it took him forever, we were just sitting on the beach and my cousin was still having a good time but I wasnt feeling too good. So finally my brother shows up on not a boat but a jet ski, mistake number three. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> Thats when I decided that I needed to get back to the cabin to take a nap. So we all hopped on the jet ski and took off, but that didnt work too well with three heavy kids, the thing immediately tipped over and here I am fully clothed, soaking wet, and trippin balls. So we just walked back to the cabin and I went upstairs and laid face down in the bed. My bro and cousin were up there with me. <br><br>
Thats when I lost it, to my knowledge I fell asleep in that bed, so what happened after that I thought was all a bad dream. My brother left the room so it was just me and my cousin. I fell off of my bed and was sitting on the floor when I got really mad and busted out of the door of my bedroom, mistake number four. I went downstairs in front of my whole family and thats when they figured out something was terribly wrong with me. I went outside and saw all of them and they noticed I was freaking out so my grandpa came over to me and asked me what was wrong. I didnt say anything and started to walk away from him. Everybody got really concerned, my grandpa started yelling what did you take, what did you take? I stupidly replied Ya know, and continued to walk away. I went back right after that, went on the porch pissed my pants and sat there laughing about it. Then I ran inside and laid face down on the carpet. From the beginning I was constantly spitting everywhere. <br><br>
Thats when my family decided to bring me to the hospital because they thought something was seriously wrong. My grandpa drove me in my uncles rental car because he didnt want me pissing and spitting all over the back seat of his Mercedes. I sat in the back seat with another one of my cousins who was a doctor. I was totally out of it the whole ride there but it was very calm car ride and I would look over at my cousin and he would say something to me and his face moved in slow motion and his words would all slur together. We finally got to the hospital and they put me on a stretcher and brought me into the ER. When I finally awoke from what I thought was a dream they were pulling me out of a cat scan. They then inflated my bladder and put in a catheter because I couldnt control my urine. I think the gave me some kind of valium because my come down was very sudden. They still didnt know what was wrong at that point so they airlifted me to a bigger hospital in Minnesota. When we got there I confessed that I had taken mushrooms and everyone cooled down after that. I had to spend the night in the hospital all alone. After all that I got a helicopter ride, a flight for life t-shirt, a stuffed animal moose and a very awkward weekend when I got back to my cabin the next morning. <br><br>
If I learned one thing in this whole ordeal it would be dont trip for your first time in front of all your relatives, because now my whole family probably thinks Im some kind of junkie.<!-- End Body -->
