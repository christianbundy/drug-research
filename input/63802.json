 "report": "<p>I thought I'de mention this recipe for a good nights rest.</p><p>1. Iake a fair amount of deap heat / tiger balm or the like. Rub it on a section of your body just large enough to cover 1 large leave. do this in another spot, you may even need more leaves pending where you place yours. I put 1 large folded leave across my forehead temple to temple, 1 over my heart and usually one on my calf muscle inside my leg where its really warm. </p><p>2. Place the leave on the ointment and tape to prevent falling off.</p><p>3. Leave on until desired afect is obtained, remove and sleep.</p><p>I've had extreme vertigo from this so it's well advized to keep ample liquid for the night, in case of the need for a drink. I get very sedated but without the intense hallucinations.</p><p>In cetain moments the inner depths are sub-consciosly aware of other sub-conscios activity, extra sensory collaboration... somehow, sometimes we can dream together.</p>"
