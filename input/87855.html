My quest for an MDMA like substance has led me to some truly horrible experiences, this is one of them. One day they will legalise it and Ill not have to put my stomach in danger with a lot of unknowns.<br><br>
I took 200mg of MDAI and an hour after experiencing minimal effects took another 200mg. I had heard its slow to come up and it is.<br><br>
About two hours into my trip I have slight feelings of euphoria but nothing ground breaking.<br><br>
Three hours in and Im feeling dizzy, space out and tripping like mad. Some of it is enjoyable, some not. Its a bit too much so I drink some orange juice and have a cold shower.<br><br>
Four hours in and Im feeling incredible sick, I try to vomit but cant. I drink loads of water.<br><br>
Five hours in and I wonder if Ive done any permanent damage to my stomach, still trying to vomit but only bile comes up. I also have mega cramps in my feet. It also goes through my mind that this stuff could be lethal at high doses.<br><br>
Twelve hours in and Ive been up all night trying to vomit, regretting taking such a high dose and generally feeling like Ive screwed my stomach up. I go to work with difficulty.<br><br>
Im shivering all day at work. I try and go for walks. I try and force some food down me. I feel like Ive got unbelievable heartburn.<br><br>
Two full days after taking MDAI I feel back to normal except for the feeling of a scarred stomach and constant heartburn.<br><br>
Three weeks later and my stomach is back to normal.<!-- End Body -->
