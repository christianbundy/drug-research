 "report": "<p>Waking up at 12 noon, and consuming one spaghetti and meatball lunch around then - I decided to make it a day of opiates. The sun was shining through the tall redwoods and a cool breeze danced through the air. Having purchased pure codeine phosphate from an international pharmacy in 30 mg tablets, I decided to crush three pills and wash 'em down with some apple juice at around 1:50 pm. Following is a log of my experience:</p><p>\nT + 0 minutes:  Dose 90 mg pure codeine phosphate, crushed and washed down with apple juice.</p><p>T + 25 minutes: Effects begin to become apparent, with relaxation setting in.</p><p>T + 40 minutes: Effects increasing, very relaxed. Movement sloppy/uncoordinated.</p><p>T + 50 minutes: Somewhat of a body high, very euphoric feeling, contemplating a smoke.</p><p>T + 70 minutes: Feel nice, relaxed, no adverse side effectswill proceed with smoking.</p><p>T + 85 minutes: A very high high. euphoria persisting, and very relaxed. Things seem extraordinarily comical.</p><p>T + 100 minutes: Smoked a bit more (cumulative: no more than 0.2 g of high grade herbs). A bit slower, still feeling good. pupils are small, but not pinpoint. Clarity of thought is somewhat diminished, but public interaction would still be quite possible. Mild hunger setting in.</p><p>T + 120 minutes: Intense hunger, likely as a result of the marijuana smoke. Euphoria has dropped significantly, but I'm still enjoying myself.</p><p>T + 250 minutes: No noticeable effects persisting, somewhat drowsy.</p><p>\nThat was my experience. As you can see, I experienced no bad effects, aside from the temporary hunger (which was quickly resolved). There is no mindfuck involved with codeine IMHO, although it will slow you down a bit. It was nice to just lay down and listen to mellow music such as the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, or the like. The peak effects persisted for a good hour and fifteen minutes, making for a very worthwhile experience. Really wanted to do it again today, but I gotta be careful with those opiates - so I'm going to wait another week or three to experiment with a higher dose. ;)</p>"
