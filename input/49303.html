Saturday, 8:00PM<br><br>
T+00:00 80mg of BK-MDEA (ethylone) down the hatch, gel cap, light meal two hours before.  only water since.<br>
T+00:08 get the methylone belch, similar taste<br>
T+00:27 the belch again, first alert, feeling 'light'<br>
T+00:38 rushing, antsy, walk from room to room. stare into the mirror, put on some tunes<br>
T+01:00 yawning, light headed, more yawning and a sense of neck tension<br>
T+01:15 very mild, methylone-ish, but less stimulating and less euphoria<br>
T+01:25 ho hum, its not getting much better, if anything slight waves coming over me, but this is a tease<br><br>
T+01:35 parachute 100mg more in a rolling paper<br>
T+01:40 wow, a 180mg dose, I quickly decide that no matter what the outcome I've had enough for a first trial<br>
T+01:43 hmm, did I really need that booster? is that first hit just now fully coming on?<br>
T+02:10 wow, ok, hello bk-mdea  wow wow woo<br>
T+02:15 chatting on irc, what a blast, but I wander around outside quite a bit<br>
T+02:50 fairly high, very similar to MDMA but much less stimulating, not as euphoric as methylone, but fun. must go walk around outside.  music is great!  physical sensations are enhanced.<br>
T+03:00 I'm guesstimating that a 200mg dose would be more then enough for me!<br>
T+03:08 pretty sure I'm feeling full effects, very nice, empathy, minimal stimulation per say, neack and head muscle tension however<br><br>
T+03:13 desire some cannabis, so I go smoke<br>
T+03:18 ok, I could see dancing on this stuff, I've got happy feet, but I feel clumsy<br>
T+03:24 I'm pretty high, very ecstasy like<br>
I go roam around a little, watch the night sky, try to count bats (we have these cool mexican freetail bat population that migrates through here this time of year..), carpe nichtem, etc.<br>
T+04:25 been on irc and chat quite a bit night, pretty fun.  it slowly ramped up to a level of intoxication similar to the same amount of methylone, but not nearly as emotionally healing as methylone or as stimulating as MDMA.  fun nonetheless. <br><br>
T+05:00 spend an hour or two in conversation with the wife, but didnt try sex. :(<br><br>
Approx 6 or 7 hours have passed; I have a few beers to sleep.<br><br>
Similar to methylone, but less euphoria, similar to MDMA in musical and tactile enhancement, but dancing felt awkward. 'Stoning' but not quite as lethargy inducing as MBDB.  <br><br>
Unlike the way methylone opens a person up in a very theraputic way, bk-mdea  ramps up slower and delivers an enhanced and chatty mood lift,  not as forced and unaturally lovey as MDMA and lasts last at least 6 hours. There was musical, tactile and emotional segment to this experience which was nice, but it scattered my thoughts...making a true level of healing introspection very difficult.  This is not really a good party drug, but might have more value then most. <br><br>
Next day: hangover, similar to MDMA.<!-- End Body -->
