I was able to get ahold of some 5-MeO-DPT (note that it NOT DiPT) at a smartshop in Japan, in a 30mg liquid vial.  My friend works at the shop so I dosed 10mg and waited for it to kick in.<br><br>
Around 30 minutes later, I noticed it taking effect when it was difficult to concentrate on discussion. I kept getting frequently lost amidst the dialogue, and having to ask my friend to repeat his sentences.<br><br>
One factor that was affecting my inability to pay attention was how my once-relaxed muscles developed into these uncomfortably tense sets of meat. My flesh became unbearably cramped, and I often had to switch from standing to sitting positions to prevent any pain. I stretched my limbs out to relieve some strain, but I dont think even reclining in a bed would have alleviated the muscle aches. Additionally, I noticed a weak nausea, but it was gentle and passed fairly quickly.<br><br>
It is a shame that such a body load accompanied the 5-MeO-DPT, because this was the only let-down I was disappointed by. As far as sensation went, it was everything I was seeking. VeryVERYrelaxing, with a bit of dissociation thrown in the mix. Dreamy visuals soothed my mind, giving off the perception that I was examining Tokyo through a snow-globe. The easy visuals included changes in patterning, quite reminiscent to DXM and ketamine. Time also seemed to go as slowly as it does on a good robotrip; I glanced at my watch believing it was almost morning, only to discover it was still midnight.<br><br>
I was in awe at how brilliantly the city illuminations were glistening around me. It appears that on 5-MeO-DPT, I appreciate imagery from a reflection such as a mirror or glass surface, rather than staring at the actual image itself. <br><br>
Unlike other dissociatives however, I felt myself become strangely aroused simply standing there at the smartshop. I could practically feel the blood pulsating through myself, and couldnt help but consider trying 5-MeO-DPT as a love drug. I was a little surprised at how mild effects were, since the trip reports I read suggested that anything above 10mg would be a toxic dose. I felt I could go a little higher, but decided against it, knowing I had a busy week ahead of me, and I wouldnt be able to stand upright anymore if it increased my muscle cramping. I described my reactions to my friend at the shop, and he seemed interested. Apparently people are generally more energetic on the influence of this, but it seemed to have a sedating effect on me.<br><br>
Fuck the muscle cramps and body load.  If it weren't for that I'd definitely try it again...<!-- End Body -->
