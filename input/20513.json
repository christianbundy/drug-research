 "report": "<p>I took 5 tramadol (250mg) at once every day for about 3-4 weeks.  It felt great.  Opiate-like sense of well-being but a little speedy too.  I was very productive during this period - got a lot of work done.  I was just happy to be doing whatever I was doing even if it was a task that would normally seem tedious or boring.  No problem urinating as some have reported.  The fun stopped when I ran out of pills.  </p><p>About 24-36 hours after my last dose, I started to feel fatigued.  Between 36 and 48 hours, insomnia and severe anxiety (I'm talking panic attack stuff) set in.  The anxiety and fatigue lasted for about 3 or 4 days.  The insomnia lingered longer gradually dissipated over a 2-3 week period.  I'm fine now.  It would probably have helped if I had tapered off the drug - but, like I said, I ran out (and it's a prescription drug where I live).</p>"
