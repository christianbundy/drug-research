 "report": "\n\n\n\nThis really works! first off you need a source for bulk poppyseeds such as a winco food mart. once youve found that its cheap and easy. for one serving you need about 400 grams of seed and three or four lemons. pour your seeds into a pyrex baking dish and squeeze your lemons onto the seeds. next you must heat about 25 ounces of water to a boil and pour this onto the seeds and let it cool.  <br>Once your solution has cooled you must strain it through a cloth or (preferably) one of those french coffee presses. pour this mixture into your favorite drinking glass and drink it slowly. you may not need to drink it all and it tastes like crap (unless you like lemons). it might make you a little weezy in the stomach but if you're familiar with opium tea then you know the feeling. bulk poppy seeds usually cost about 10 cents per ounce.  thats it. be safe.\n\n\n"
