 "report": "<p>It was an ordinary day, a Wednesday, nothin special. I walked through the front doors of school and walked over to one of my circles of friends. My friend gave me 3 200 mg pills of topamax. Apparently that fucks you up. I walked to 1st period, sat down, stared at the pills. I gave one away to one of my friends to get lunch money and then took the two left.</p><p>The day passes, nothing happens. 4th period comes around my tounge starts buzzing, and I'm sorta confused. Dissapointed thinking that was the high I went to eat lunch, my depth perception is out of wack. I start seeing things smaller and other things bigger. My chickenburger was bigger than normal, and I wasn't complaining. Rest of lunch went normal then I went upstairs to 5th.</p><p>WOOO the hallway looks like 5 feet wide, what the fuck is going on? I get in the classroom and sit down, stand up, and then sit down agian. A smile slaps across my face, and I just wanna start laughing. Damn I need to write some essay! I get paper and a pencil and then I can't do this. I enjoy feeling in this unporportional world.</p><p>Bell rings, I turn in my 3 sentence essay (supposed to be 30 sentences) then walk down the main stairs. I walked in the middle because the stairwell seemed so small. Went to my locker, forgot the combination, then went to class. Some giant test provided by the state, I sleep it out. 7th was a blur then I went home.</p><p>Now the effects leaving me I get home and eat food for what seemed like forever. My friends come over, we leave to go to the park. I got the bowl, they got the bud, I take 2 hits. We're just chillin for a bit, then we walk. I get so fucking happy right after we start walkin. I felt at peace with myself and everything around me. I felt like a was walking in rhythm with the birds and the trees. Hell yeh, everything was goin good. We kept walkin and I can remember everyone sayin my name, and 'Dude, he's trippin balls!!' I didn't care though I just kept walkin.</p><p>Then it hit me again. I thought I was on fire or sumthing. No wait, I was in another demension, that's right. I lost my mind for what seemed like the longest time. I blacked out. I was slapping my friends around and hitting them for no reason. I broke some of their ciggerettes, and then just took off running. I was full on sprinting when I came to a complete stop by leveling a mailbox. I got up, did some crazy stuff, and was talking complete nonsense apparently. I kneed my other friend and the ass and then took off running again.</p><p>I stopped, they caught up, I came out of that trance. I was sobered up for a full ten minutes. They told me about it, I laughed, then I walked home. I needed some serious rest, and some water. I got home and went in my room. Damn it hit me again! this time it was confusion, not anger. I went retarded. If you saw me you seriously would have thought I was out of my mind. I tried to escape this crazy warped universe through my t.v. And no, not by watching it. I tried to fit through it. I remeber looking at my hands but not seeing them. It was so strange. I walked over to the only thing I could vaguely remeber, my bed. I slept for what seemed like days but was only minutes, possibly even seconds. I kept thinking it was a new day. Then I really went to sleep.</p>"
