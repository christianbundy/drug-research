I have had a fair amount of previous experience with Ayahuasca but the report below has had lasting positive effects.<br><br>
A few  months ago I dreamt of drinking Ayahuasca with 3 other people. In the dream, the tea was made from vine &amp; what turned out to be very weak Chackruna (from a Peruvian Supplier.) The host had gone to great lengths to bless the area with tobacco smoke &amp; instruments were laid out if anyone felt the need to make music as well as everyone having bowls if needed. Anyway, a few hours after drinking, the atmpshphere in the room felt extremely positive. The strength of the Aya was weak (maybe this was a good thing as there were 2 first timers present.). This was not due to inexperience of making aya but IMO due to the plant potency. After a while of silent contemplation, those that had taken it before agreed they could really feel the power of the vine but without the light of the Chackruna. The host began to sing beautiful &amp; unique Icaros which were a pleasure to listen to. This gradually became a loose jamming session (for want of a better description) as one by one, those present began to pick up instruments including a bongo &amp; a rattle. Together with the icaros this was a magical moment &amp; the sound we were making seemed to be in harmony with one another but at the same time sounding completely random. Some of us began to whistle and personally I find whistling the most beaufiful &amp; tender sound when under the power plants. After about 30 minutes of making music, I volunteered to have some healing work performed on me. The host has a special gift for healing &amp; I wanted to experience this. For some reason my legs were aching like they have never before and I relaxed in a chair, &amp; closed my eyes.<br><br>
After a few minutes of shaking his hands over my head (like some kind of manic hummingbird!) he moved down to my chest &amp; that's when something strange &amp; wonderful happened. My left thumb began to rise independently of my brain. I noticed this and continued to watch it with some amusement until it stopped rising &amp; looked like I was ready to hitch a lift. Just as I was commenting on this, I began feeling a hot sensation in my chest that can best be described as similar to when you rub Vics vapour on your chest. The hosts hands had stopped over my chest and as I watched them flutter I began to shake. I shook like you would if your whole body was freezing cold - it was completely beyond my control - I couldn't have stopped it if I had wanted to. Actually, I did want to stop it as the shaking was becoming more violent. I said to the host 'what are you doing to me?!' It suddenly got too much! I jumped out of my seat &amp; told him to stop. I have never felt a physical sensation grip me so suddenly. I was neither cold nor hot (apart from my chest) but I was shaking like a leaf! This continued while I was standing with no healing work being done. It gradually subsided over the next few minutes. As the night progressed and the plants left us I continued thinking about what I had experienced as it had blown me away somewhat. The next day, I began to notice my breathing was much better than it had been in years. Over the next week I became convinced my Asthma had disappeared thanks to the vine &amp; the healer. The real test came a few days ago. A friend had just moved house and was ripping up old carpets. If there is one thing that will cause me to have an asthma attack, it is dust. I could see the dust in the sunlight &amp; other people present were sneezing &amp; I was absolutely fine - not even a sneeze or cough! I hope I stay free of asthma for good. Also, no one at the ceremony knew that I had Asthma...<br><br>
The plants know what you need!!!<br><br>
I just wanted to thank everyone there that night as well as the host/healer (&amp; the plants of course) for making me healthier &amp; happier &amp; giving me something I will never forget!<br><br>
Love &amp; light!<br><br>
