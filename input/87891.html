At approximately 2 pm, after eating, I took two DMAE tablets, a total of 200mg.  I was at work at the time, and my intention was to harness the extra energy to motivate myself to get through the work I needed to get done.  I'm interested in finding a nootropic cocktail that works for me, makes me feel 'optimised', 'tuned up' and so on, so I decided to test out DMAE.  <br><br>
Within about half an hour, I started to feel the effects.  There's a feeling of 'speeding up', and I felt more efficient at doing whatever I was doing.  I had a mild headache, and became slightly irritable, but nothing serious.  I was able to get through the work, and able to concentrate, but not consistently.  It's hard to describe, I felt like my mind was an engine being revved - there's extra gas, and the engine is accelerating, but I can't change gear.  I had the impression I was damaging myself.  <br><br>
Nonetheless, I was in a good mood, and the DMAE definitely helped with that.  Because I could concentrate well for short bursts, I would get a lot done in a short time, then quickly lose interest.  I got up to talk to coworkers, and started babbling a little, and then lost interest in the conversation, and returned to work.  I was happy, but it felt like a 'dirty' happiness, like wearing your favourite shirt, but with a sneaky suspicion that it hasn't been washed and that you smell.  The headache got a little bit worse.  <br><br>
Eventually, the work was finished and I went home.  I started to get contemplative, wondering about nothing in particular.  I felt as though I was deep in thought, but I had no particular thought come to mind.  My brain was busy, but I didn't know what it was doing.  I didn't like the feeling.<br><br>
I cooked and ate, starting to feel a little resentful about nothing in particular, then watched a movie.  The movie was absorbing, but my eyes felt very tired, so for much of the film I had my eyes closed and just listened to the dialogue.  With my eyes closed, I began to notice how much I wasn't enjoying myself.  No particular reason for this, the film was good, and generally my life is in a good place right now, so I'm blaming the DMAE, I felt depressed - apathetic, miserable, insignificant, and just generally moody.  My thoughts became difficult to pin down, scattered.  I was definitely thinking about different aspects of my life, but in short bursts too fleeting to be of much use.  <br><br>
I became thoroughly upset, about nothing.  I just wanted to not feel the way I felt, nothing else mattered.  I lay on my bed, trying to work out what I was so miserable about - what I wanted to change, but mostly I was just lying there, moping.  My housemate came in to my room and asked if I was ok, I would normally tell her exactly what was going on, but I felt isolated, as though she wouldn't understand.  I lied and said I was tired.  She left and I felt abandoned and betrayed, which is just stupid.<br><br>
Eventually, I realised that the only thing that was different about that day was the DMAE, otherwise it had been a perfectly normal day, like yesterday, when I was happy.  It must have been the DMAE that made me feel miserable.  I threw away the rest of the bottle I had bought.<br><br>
Interestingly, as soon as I had thrown it away, and I had a reasonable explanation for my emotional turbulence, I started to feel better.  I even went and found my housemate, and explained what had happened.  For the rest of the evening, the headache persisted, and my eyes felt 'scratchy', but my mood steadily improved.<br><br>
All in all, the experience lasted about 8 hours, half of which were 'accelerated', but not controlled, and half of which were dampened, but not focussed.<br><br>
Overall, I would say that the experience was not pleasant.  It doesn't make me smarter or more motivated, it just made my brain overwork itself for a while, then left me tired and grumpy.<!-- End Body -->
