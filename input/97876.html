I was visiting my friend (let's call him T) for the weekend and we had decided to trip on some NBOMe-treated powder we had and go into the city to view an art exhibit. We have both had extensive psychedelic experience, especially with 25I-NBOMe, but had never done 25C or the 25I + 25C combination before. However, we kept the dosing fairly low and were confident in our ability to handle these drugs. We planned on spending the first few hours exploring the campus of Ts college and then heading into the city after peaking and getting used to the new experience of the 25I + 25C combination. To prepare for the trip we each took vitamin C tablets and one 800 mg Piracetam capsule, as in our experience Piracetam has enhanced the clear-headed, focused tripping mentality that 25I tends to create.<br><br>
At noon (T=0:00) we each snorted the contents of a capsule containing 400 micrograms 25I and 200 micrograms 25C. A friend of ours (C) took 300 micrograms of 25I with us and planned to take 2 tabs of LSD later before the trip to the city. We decided to wait until it had started to hit us before heading out on a walk around campus.<br><br>
T+0:15: As always with snorting NBOMe-treated powder, the come-up is fast and mind-blowing. Within 15 minutes we were all experiencing a warm, enveloping euphoria that left huge grins on our faces. My perception of everything seemed multiplied and my thoughts were racing. T was tripping pretty hard already while C, operating on a lower dose, just felt the rolling euphoria. So far this experience was fairly similar to our prior 25I experiences.<br><br>
T+0:30: We decided to go out for a walk around a nearby corporate HQ garden and look at all the statues, ponds, trees, etc. T and I were tripping pretty hard, feeling the warmth and bliss of the come-up euphoria, while C seemed happy. We walked around the garden for a while, laughing and talking and all-in-all having a fairly normal light psychedelic experience.<br><br>
T+1:15: After walking for a while we decided wed stay on campus and not go to the city, but have a lazy day. We were all fully into the trip by now, but it seemed a little lighter than wed thought. After the euphoria wore off our trip was more or less the post-peak plateau of 2 decent acid tabs. We decided to go back to the dorms and redose before smoking.<br><br>
T+2:30: T and I split and snorted 600 micrograms of a 25I-NBOMe powder capsule, our friend C dropped his 2 LSD tabs, and we rolled 3 joints to go smoke. The trip was in full swing now but was still a little disappointing. Neither of us were experiencing much visually, just the rolling happiness and increased thinking pace.<br><br>
T+2:45: The redosing started to hit and the euphoria went up significantly. We were walking across campus our way to a smoke spot, and were talking and laughing about all the absurd subtleties of everyday campus life that often require the altered perception psychedelics give you to notice.<br><br>
T+3:15: We smoke 3 joints (between 5 people) and immediately feel ridiculously high. T and I were tripping decently hard before this and were too happy and silly to consider we were probably smoking way too much.<br><br>
Everything was slowed down, we couldnt think efficiently, and talking had become challenging. It felt as if a huge block had come across our thought process, retarding everything. We had experienced this exact effect before after smoking heavily a few hours into a 25I-NBOMe trip, being far too high to function/think appropriately.<br><br>
T+3:45: Walking back to campus was slow and challenging. We were obliterated, and couldnt think appropriately enough to hold conversation with the others or even figure out what to do. We knew we were safe, so neither of us freaked out (plus we had been in this state before) but it was still a bummer to realize this would probably make the rest of the trip far more challenging and less enjoyable.<br><br>
T+4:00: At 4:00 we got back to campus and realized we couldnt function. My memory is shady at this point, but our conversations and actions for the next hour and a half pretty much just consisted of short exchanges and confused thoughts/statements as we followed our friends around. Our friend C, who at this point was tripping hard on 2 tabs, 300 µg 25I, and had smoked the 3 joints with us, was fine and enjoying himself).<br><br>
T+5:30: After being dragged around awkwardly for a while, T and I managed to decide wed be better off by ourselves in his room just listening to music and not doing much else. We went back, lied down, and just played music and tried to relax. At this point, were not so utterly non-functioning, just really drugged up and feeling stupid.<br><br>
T+6:30: The impairment of cognition still made actions, decisions, and conversations slow and challenging, but at least T and I are on the same plane and understand our mutual impairment, so its not awkward anymore. It basically felt as if we had lost 40 IQ points. Everything was slow and confusing and our perception of everything was just blunted.<br><br>
T+7:30: Wed spent the last hour talking and cleaning up the room and were starting to recover. We were still tripping and really high but thoughts and actions were easier. The rest of the trip was pretty much defined by us coming down slowly while we did yoga and meditated.<br><br>
The trip was more or less over by 9:30, though the altered cognition remained and was amplified after smoking again. We spent the rest of the night smoking weed and talking about the trip and other stuff.<br><br>
Overall, this trip was a (second) reminder of the effect cannabis can have on psychedelics, especially 25I-NBOMe. The lack of clear visuals and heavily impaired perception of most of the trip prevented us from really distinguishing the subtle effects of the 25C + 25I combination from a normal 25I trip. T and I dont plan on smoking while tripping on NBOMes again, as this combination produces a state of mind that can be confusing and terrifying, and detrimental to the overall trip. The effect of Piracetam, if any, remains unclear.<!-- End Body -->
