 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI have used GBL recreationally for about two years without any apparent problems. My honeymoon period with the substance was put to a quick end when I noticed that I was using it too often. I cut down my use to once every few months. So, while I am now only an occasional user, I have sometimes noticed, if the dose I use is high, or if I dose more than once in an evening, that I may get minor flashbacks for about a week after the intoxication. \r\nSpecifically, I will flash back to the psychological aspect of the GBL induced state of consciousness in between sleep and wakefullness where meaning is scrambled. I will, for example, be doing something, let's say washing a window, and suddenly, the meaning of what I am doing will get 'weird'... why am I doing this? what is this about? A brief blip in continuity, a memory tunnel to a confused GBL state, lasting so briefly that it in no way impairs what I'm doing, but just passes over me like a shadow, and is then gone. I'll get a few of these after an evening of doing GBL, and then they just dissapear. Not scary, but disconcerting nontheless, and making me want to use this substance even more infrequently.\n\n\n"
