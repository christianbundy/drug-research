     I'll be 60 years old next month and have been using Deprenyl for about the past 10 years. In most respects it's difficult to quantify the effects of this compound: in terms of its reputed anti-aging benefits I can say that I am very active, never get sick and am still alive. As a cognition enhancer it leaves me fairly unimpressed; my short-term memory isn't nearly what it once was and I seem to suffer the same CRS (Can't Remember Shit) syndrome as most or all of my peers. <br><br>
What keeps me coming back year after year is Deprenyl's aphrodisiac property. At the risk of seeming indelicate, I have to say that the erections are there on demand, whenever, wherever, regardless. For those lads on the happy side of 50 years, this may not seem like a big deal, but wait a few years and you may change your tune. <br><br>
     Apart from this, I have noticed that Deprenyl in the doses I use is a fairly good mood enhancer and is completely without any undesireable side-effects. Of the many interesting plants and pharmaceuticals I've experienced over the past 40 years, this seems to be one of the most unequivocally helpful and benign.<!-- End Body -->
