I had been wanting to trip for some time now, being that the last time I did it was about 4 months ago (Dec.)  I purchased 3 hits of acid that were dropped on sugar cubes.  <br><br>
Setting:<br><br>
In my room, with a little night light on at first; switched to black light later on.  Many glow in the dark things on the walls and around the room.  <br><br>
I ate the cubes at around 12:15 or so in the AM.  I expected it to take awhile to kick in, but I was wrong.  It took maybe 25 minutes.  It seemed like a rather short time anyway.  <br><br>
The first thing I noticed was my carpet.  There were designs all over it that looked like indentations.  I thought they were every single footprint that has ever been placed on my carpet.  I believe it was soon after this I started noticing the tracers.  I was using the computer for some time just looking for backgrounds on web pages that would fit the mood.  I was also listening to some trance.  When the acid first started to take hold, I could feel every beat of the music moving throughout my entire body.  It was the most wonderful sensation.  It made me so happy, I couldn't stop smiling.  <br><br>
At some point during the trip I lied down on my bed and held one of my stuffed animals.  I started to *deep* think.  Everything just (not just objects) seemed so wonderful in life.  I felt a great amount of love to everyone, even tho there was no one around at the time, except someone sleeping in another room.  I felt that everything was so perfect and that nothing should ever change.  I felt like I would never be unhappy again.  Everything fit together and was unified as one.  <br><br>
This was a pretty moving experience for me.  I don't know if I've ever felt so content in my life.  I'm in the after affects as I write this.  I'm running on about an hour of sleep and am getting pretty tired.  There's still the 'I'm not all here; funny body feeling' all over me.  I must say it was definitely worth the experience.  I hope to have more like this one in the future.  I enjoy going deeper into the trip than just thinking, 'Oh this is cool dude, everything's moving.'  I mean, that part is very cool, but it means a bit more to me than just that.<!-- End Body -->
