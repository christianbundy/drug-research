2-AI was very strong for me IV/IM. 100mg in the leg muscle produced a strong buzz 15 minutes after injection. Lasted for only about 10 minutes but a pleasent effect continued throughout the next 4 hours.  There is a noticable tolerance: First day I shot 50mg (mild effect), the next day I shot 100mg (strong effect), and later the second day I shot another 100mg with little to no effect.. The following (third) day I shot 100mg with no effect. I decided to give it a break for a week to see if tolerance would be back down.<br><br>
Another friend who shoots a lot of coke tried 200mg in the vein and didn't get any effect.  I'm not sure if Cocaine would have a cross tolerance with 2-aminoindan or if he was just expecting too much or if he was already far out.<br><br>
So the general consensus is that 2-ai is pointless to use orally and intranasally.  Someone tried to make a rock with it by mixing it with baking soda and a splash of water but the fumes produced were very 'dark harsh and scary'.<!-- End Body -->
