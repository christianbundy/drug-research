 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a tobbacco shop in the town where I live, called the Owl Shop.  I went in there one day out of curiousity; but intending to attemp to buy some herbal, tobbacco free cigarettes out of curiousity.  I saw ginseng cigarettes, $5.25 for a pack of 20.  The box says, 'tobbacco free, nicotine free.'  I decided to try them.  Because they have no tobbacco, I did not need to show an I.D.\r\nI returned to my fraternity house, and my roommate and myself each smoked one.  He experienced something similar to a strong nicotine buzz; I experienced a sudden urge to have a grin on my face and felt rather loopy and giddy.  Another person felt no buzz.  I enjoyed the cigarette and found it rather smooth, but they left a dead-fish smell in the room.\r\nI've hunted around a bit for info on ginseng cigarettes, but I have not been able to find any referances so far.  The pack says, 'Imported from England.'\n\n\n"
