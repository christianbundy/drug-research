I had been seeing this new girl named liz and we were starting to get close so i asked her if she wanted to do ecstasy with me on a particular friday night, and she said that she wanted to so we made arrangements.  I picked her up from her house at 7:00 pm and we drove to the parking lot of the Lucky's near my house and we both ate 1/2 a green motorola (pure product MDMA, my rough approximation on dose is 60 milligrams), and 1/2 a blue D&amp;G (pure MDA, approx. 50 milligrams). <br><br>
After we took the stuff, we went to the football game because we were playing our rival school and there was going to be people there to talk to and we didn't have anywhere better to go to that night so we cruised over and chilled for a while until we started to feel it coming on.  We talked with our friends katie and ben as we began to peak and they were amused to watch us acting the way we were because we were so euphoric and empathic.  We tried to explain to them how and what we were feeling, but they had never done any e-like drugs before, so they didn't get it. As we began to be hit by the waves with more intensity, we decided to leave so we could be alone.  We went and parked in a secluded little spot and climbed into the big backseat.  We talked for a while about how we felt our lives were progressing, and in our discussing she had a revelation that her stopping hanging out with her old friends was the best thing she ever did, because they just are nothing like her.<br><br>
Then we both started to really feel the e and we started to massage each other with lotion because it felt so good.  Soon we were heavily kissing and i began to suck on her ears and neck, and she wast strokng my chest and moaning.  Things progressed more, and we tried to have sex right there, right then but i couldn't get it up because of the e.  even though she only had her underwear on and was sucking my cock to try to get me hard.  I ended up playing with her clitoris until she had a mind bending orgasm, then we got dressed.  <br><br>
This whole time we were deeply under the effect of the two drugs and i noticed that this roll was slightly different, i felt as though i was more on a 'drug' than my previous rolls, but it still was pretty much what i would expect from e also.  At this point we went over to the park and met brian and katie there, brian gave us a fat bowl of chronic so me and liz smoked it to our heads right there.  <br><br>
This is when we both started to feel really really good. We already felt really good, but now we felt really really good. I noticed that the weed greatly intensified the visual aspect of my high, and also made me feel very mellow and it let my body high really come on strong. The rest of my roll consisted of me and liz talking about e and how it makes us feel so perfect and so wonderful, intermittently we would kiss and fondle each other while in the back seat of my car. And when we were coming down but not off of it, I drove her back to her house and she snuck me in (even though it was like 2, and her parents were asleep) and we started getting really hot, at this point the e was well on it's way out, so we got on the floor and had sex because her bed was too loud and we didn't want to wake her parents up.  <br><br>
It was the first time i slept with that girl, and the only time i've ever got lucky enough to definitively find a pill that i knew had MDA in it.  That in combination with MDMA and weed, made this a very wonderful experience.  At the time, i didn't even know the blue D&amp;G had pure MDA in it, but i saw the same pill later on erowid and dancesafe. I had a test kit and both came out positive in their tests, so I know the other pill had MDMA in it also.  The Motorola  was slightly fatter than the D&amp;G, which is why i gave the MDMA a slightly higher dose in my estimates of the dose I took. I actually noticed some differences before i knew i had MDA, it was slightly more psychedelic and gave me a more intense body high than my MDMA experiences had, i noticed that colored lights were even more spectacular than they are when on MDMA.  MDA in combination with MDMA made me feel as though i was drinking euphoria, in combination with weed i felt like i was bathing in it.  <br><br>
Afterwards, I noticed that my 'hangover' was actually a good deal more intense than it usually is, my brain probably took a beating from three different drugs in combo.  Liz and I saw each other the next day and we couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had had last night.  We plan on doing it again together alone soon, but I don't hink i'll be able to get MDA again.  I may never come across MDA again, but at least i know i tried it once and it was actually way fun in combo with MDMA and some good old weed.  My only regret is that i never got to take just MDA so i could really know what that is like by itself.<!-- End Body -->
