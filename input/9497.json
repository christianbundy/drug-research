 "report": "<p>\nIve been reading here about people tripping out on pot.  What you are having is a full blown anxiety attack.  Sometimes pot does cause anxiety. Anxiety might run in your family's genes, or you might just be stressed out about something.  Pot increases your hearts beating, and sometimes ends up causing your chest to get filled with gas or air.  I don't know why this happens but it can make you feel quite uncomfortable.  I know from personal experiences.  </p><p>My suggestion is to try and clear your head, and concentrate on your breathing.  Try to take deep slow breaths, and this will slow your heart down.  Find out what is stressing you out in life and correct,until then slow down on smoking a bit.  Smoke half or a quarter of a joint instead of a whole.  And if you are smoking out of 2 foot bongs, stop.  Hopefully your situation gets better.  Smoke the herb smart know your limits, and pay attention to what your body is telling you.</p>"
