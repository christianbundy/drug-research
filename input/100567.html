Throughout these past few months, I have been experiencing lot of physical and emotional challenges stemming from a devastating car accident that had completely changed my life. Physically I am much better, however the emotional experience has been quite hard. Adjusting back into reality after a near-death experience has been much more difficult that I had expected. A very close friend of mine had mentioned that they had recently purchased some 25C-NBOMe and suggested that we try it together. I was a little apprehensive, considering how bad my anxiety had been and figured an inward experience would be painful and nerve-racking. After doing research (quite limited because it is a fairly new substance) and talking it over with some friends who have tried it, I decided to take a chance in hopes of having a positive experience. We live in a beautiful city on the west coast and it was a gorgeous day, so we had taken advantage of the day and spent a lot of time in nature.<br><br>
2:00 PM. Take 300 ug tab, placed under tongue for 20 mins. My friend had left her tab under her tongue for 30 mins, but the taste had given me a stomach ache and decided take it out when I began to experience some nausea.  <br><br>
2:30 PM. Already beginning to feel a little loopy, slight visuals and color brightening. Starting to get anxiety, though I believe the anxiety mainly came from me just not knowing what to expect. We had decided to meet up with my friend's boyfriend who lives close to a beautiful park. When we met up with him, he had commented on how 'giggly' we seemed, nothing too unusual but we were laughing at some insignificant things and kept pointing out how beautiful everything in nature had looked.<br><br>
2:45 PM. Sat down at the park and BAM, I felt extremely disoriented. Laying down in the grass I felt extremely confused and giddy. My sensations and perceptions were completely warped, on a warm sunny day I could not decide if I was warm or cold. I kept putting on my sweater and taking it off minutes later. Colors were incredible, visuals were outstanding, but I had become very nervous because I was in a complete state of confusion. Deep breaths were helping. It felt as if when I had told myself I would be okay and that it was just a side affect of the psychedelic in the initial stages, I would feel better and more relaxed, then the next minute I would be afraid I was losing my mind. This thought process reaffirmed some advice that my friend had told me, which was that I was in complete control of my trip and experience, and it is up to me to mentally get through any physical discomfort.  <br><br>
3:15 PM. Euphoria has creeped in and we were both getting an extreme case of the giggles. Our surroundings appeared so beautiful and harmonious, from birds flying in the air to my friend blowing bubbles around us, everything seemed in harmony. I like to describe this part of the trip as being like a child again, just in awe of the beauty of the environment around us. We decided to walk barefoot around the park (something neither of us would ever do) feeling the cold grass under our feet. Our motor skills were a little off, and we would find ourselves getting a little dizzy at times. Nothing too uncomfortable though.  <br><br>
3:45 PM. Big smiles on our faces, almost felt like MDMA. My friend began to complain of slight nausea that I had tried to help her though, but I was on cloud 9. Music began to sound wonderful, and my movements were like fluid moving to the rhythm of the music. Visuals were still amazing, I felt as though I saw rainbows everywhere. So many tracers. We decided to walk back to my friend's boyfriend's apartment, who had played some Massive Attack and rolled us a few joints. I was a little hesitant to smoke at first, seeing that I was in a great place and smoking weed can intensify some trips. I decided to take a few puffs anyway  and the clouds of smoke were the most beautiful things I have ever seen. At this point, I would compare these sensations to rolling, but I did not have the speedy rolling feeling.<br><br>
5:00 PM. After spending some time listening to music and smoking, we had decided to leave his apartment and go on our own journey. Looking back on our cab ride back to our apartment I can't help but laugh, we were both smiling the whole time talking about how beautiful the city was and how perfect the weather had been that day. We got back to our apartment and decide to go on walk. We had no idea where we were going but we were literally 'going with the flow'. We gravitated towards this beautiful park behind our apartment which was a nice hike up to a great view of the city. I had realized in this moment that it felt as though our egos had diminished and that we were simply happy to be in the moment with one another, connecting on a deep level while going through the experience together. Our conversations became very meaningful, and all of the insecurities I had been experiencing within the past few months had disappeared. It was all about just being in the moment.<br><br>
5:45 PM. We made it to the top of the hill and the timing couldn't have been more perfect. The sun was setting over the city and the colors were magnificent. The best word I could use to describe my emotional state at this point was contentment, watching the movement of cars in the city and the sun setting over the mountains, it was a beautiful moment to take in. I had started having a peaceful conversation with my friend about my accident and had realized a few minutes in that it was the first time that I had no urge to cry while talking about what had happened to me. The negative emotions that had felt trapped inside of me for the past few months had been absolved. I realized that evening that I was healing and perhaps that particular day was the catalyst for my healing. This time with my friend made me feel so much more connected to her and I am forever grateful for her friendship that has been a major sense of support for me during this time in my life.<br><br>
7:00 PM. Still feeling blissful and calm and starting to review the events that had transpired that day, I couldn't be happier about my experience. It gave me a more calm and peaceful outlook on my life's journey. Life has been so dark and serious for me lately and that day had shed light on the silliness of life. There is beauty and love all around us but our egos like to tell us otherwise. I had also come to the conclusion that my ego has been getting in the way of my happiness and this particular substance allowed me to step outside of my ego to see it for what it is. I also began to feel grateful for overcoming that initial frightening and disorienting hump that I had experienced in the trip because without getting over that hump, I probably wouldn't have appreciated the overall experience of the drug, which turned out to be a calming and happy day. Sometimes it just takes time for a mind and body to get used to a new substance and for the intensity to wear off.<br><br>
All in all I am extremely pleased by my experience and I highly recommend it. If you are feeling that the initial affects are too intense and frightening, stay calm and take deep breaths, it will get better, I promise. I have created this report in hope of passing along the message about the benefits of this psychedelic, and perhaps helping others through their own personal healing processes as well.<!-- End Body -->
