 "report": "<p>So, my girlfriend was the one who actually told me about acid and how relatively safe it is.  so one cool and cloudy afternoon i decided to take a tab.  since it was my firt time i did only take one.  Now supposedly i am one of those rare ones that can't see any color.  Completely colorblind.  I can't see any of those numbers in the tests at the optometrists, so i guess i can't see color (bullshit in my opinion).  Anywho, it seemed to take a long time to kick in, roughly 45 min to an hour.  When i did start tripping, i noticed a slight change.  The colors i see and yes i do believe i see color, were slightly more vivid.  and as it progressed they softened and sharpened at what seemed to be random intervals.  The sky was green for a while and there were pink trails in it. they were all so pretty.  I can't imagine what being able to see color and tripping on acid would be like.  I had an amazing time and will do it again soon.</p>"
