Dosed approximately 200mg in one setting, over 6 hours.<br><br>
First noticeable effects we're dissociation, altered states of thoughts, feelings and emotions  &amp; sort of looping patterns began to take place in my consciousness - like I had been trapped in the house and the thought that I was now in the very meaning of the word in - like a was stuck in a puzzle like world, sort of the game called myst where there's different kind of reactions to certain things you do and the whole situation seems like a mystery of some sort with a time limit in it - so that you have to be fast in realizing what's going on - apparently I didn't - I ended up fucked up on a bed thinking what the hell is going on, perhaps there's something in to this, something in the universe, some secret to be revealed, I cant be sure but i'll have to think about this some other time, when I take a trip again with dissoative drugs. <br><br>
This and dxm have given me the same kind of feeling like I would be in a house inside the real house which is a constructed hallucination of my imagination - the trip consisted of me trying to solve out what's causing the weird feelings or more like what is the reason for the visions and feelings that I saw &amp; felt.<br><br>
The trip began to dimly fade away after maybe 6-8 hours, due to constant redosing. I experienced the peak maybe around 5-7 hours from the first dose, which was about 5-15 mg, after which I waited approximately one hour before an another dose of the same size.<br><br>
The major downside in this for me, I don't know if others have noticed the kind of feeling - feeling of losing control &amp; violent thoughts - fear of harming myself or somebody else.<br><br>
I think i'll need some rest - and I think that I need some opiates or relaxing pills, meditation, sex, love, friendship &amp; inner peace so that I can live the way I want to.<br><br>
Peace!<!-- End Body -->
