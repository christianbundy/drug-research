Trip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, ~10mg <br>
insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots <br>
of psychedelic experience.<br><br>
Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always<br>
trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.<br>
Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in<br>
a great trip, but the route which I took was quite <br>
reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals <br>
unless you have a scale that can measure the usually<br>
very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a<br>
very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT<br>
and I decided it was a must-try!<br><br>
At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty<br>
milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of<br>
powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this<br>
opportunity again to warn that these small amounts<br>
really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,<br>
I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into<br>
what I 'thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small<br>
lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would<br>
not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this<br>
was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The <br>
powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount<br>
of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.<br>
I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour<br>
after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for<br>
one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset<br>
to this.  There was little nausea, just barely <br>
perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.<br>
I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated <br>
the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if<br>
you redose on this chemical, the literature says you<br>
have to take more, but I think that up the nose results<br>
in a faster onset and better bioavailibility.  <br><br>
At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of<br>
low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright, <br>
colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what<br>
one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,<br>
morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The<br>
colors were really something, it was a continually<br>
 shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site<br>
cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could<br>
not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of <br>
the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,<br>
but overall I was very much in control at all times.<br><br>
I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso<br>
with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have <br>
something to do with the amount of control I maintained.<br>
The visual distortions were really something else, fully<br>
3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects<br>
swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared<br>
intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it <br>
turn into flowing sand dunes!  <br><br>
At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the<br>
effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started<br>
to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the<br>
body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,<br>
like near my belly button for some reason.  That was <br>
the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all<br>
over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen. <br><br>
At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong<br>
had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the <br>
kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips<br>
along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and <br>
devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and<br>
got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of<br>
fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this<br>
healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten, <br>
although maybe the majority of fruit contributed<br>
something to my cramp, who knows.  <br><br>
At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting <br>
mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was<br>
sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't<br>
need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,<br>
and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only<br>
night lumination coming through my shaded windows were<br>
very cool, with my shadows 'freezing' in my line of<br>
sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to<br>
appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I<br>
fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of<br>
my alarm clock.<br><br>
It's now almost two the day after,<br>
and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy. <br>
Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this <br>
substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally<br>
bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,<br>
a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to<br>
say how much I took, although in my research I see<br>
that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and<br>
at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable<br>
trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my<br>
first real experience with a research chemical, and I<br>
must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off<br>
to our country's chemists, always preparing new and <br>
exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration<br>
of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and<br>
say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see<br>
more work done on this and other chemicals so that they<br>
are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be<br>
'reasearched.'<!-- End Body -->
