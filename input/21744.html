I have always been fond of Ecstasy, and had little trouble with it. After pilling 9 times, in the space of 2 years... MDMA was always something extra and special to look forward too, an intensity which 95% of other people don't get to have.<br><br>
One night my mate rung me up, selling mitsubishi's containing MDA, exclaiming 'they're bloody strong, I had 1 and I was fucked'.<br><br>
Firstly it's worth pointing out that when you get MDA right, it is ALOT better than MDMA (normal ecstasy) 3 strong pills in as many hours, and I was more high than ever in my life. It was alot stronger, and gave me much more of a rush than MDMA. The way your head floats and your vision flutters makes you feel like your really on a drug. Hallucinations and an overwhelming feeling of 'this is so fucking amazing'. Where MDMA makes me feel happy, warm and loving, MDA also made me surging with confidence and power.<br><br>
For the awesomeness of this high, The come-down was TERRIBLE, a week later and I still didn't feel right.. And wondered if I'd ever return to normal. Then 8 days later, at 7:30... I started to have a panic attack. My heart started to beat faster, and I felt dizzy. I got up, went to the bathroom and my heart was palpating like mad! I was EXTREMELY scared, it felt like my whole body was going wrong and I really believed I was going to die. For 2 whole hours, my chest was hurting, I felt extremely dizzy, my mouth was dry, I was having hot/cold flushes, my limbs were numb, and I was fighting to stay conscious. This was 2 of the worst and most scary hours of my life. Afterwards I was thankfully okay.<br><br>
Now 2 weeks later, and I was invited with some people to a BIG club, and I REALLY wanted to take a pill. Instead of 3 pills, I took 1. I was so scared I even broke it into halves, and had them at different times. The high wasn't particually good.<br><br>
1 week later, and I had another panic attack. This time however it just lasted for a few minutes... But afterwards I was not feeling good.<br><br>
For 2 days I had to stay off work, because I was feeling fatigue, anxious... And a faster pulse rate. I was really worried I'd turned mentally ill, and decided to see a doctor. But I was also scared of admitting to using these drugs, the doctor looked over and said 'I probably had a virus'. I knew it wasn't though...<br><br>
2 days later, and this fatigue and anxiety had gone. I was so happy about this, all my worries were gone... I was so happy and positive all day. 'Perhaps it was just a strange virus?' I thought... However, that evening, I was hit by another panic attack... And all the anxiety and fatigue came back hard. I was too scared to go to bed, coz I didn't believe I'd ever wake up. The next day I actually did wake up, but with a really painful feeling in my head. This was it... I couldn't go on. I told my parents that *ahem* someone 'spiked my drink with a strong ectsasy pill' and it's had bad effects since.<br><br>
They were supportive, which is what I needed. For the next month or 2, I'd go through anxious spells but eventually got over it.<br><br>
Now, 5 months on, and perfectly normal I have been wondering about this. I've heard of pills making people depressed, but not anxious? Was it really the pill? Etc etc<br><br>
So, I really stupidly took my last MDA pill that I saved. MAN I MISSED THAT CHEMICAL RUSH... Mmmm for about an hour on the high I was the king again. A week later after the pill, my questions were answered in form of a panic attack, lots of fatigue, chest pains, and anxiety. MDA truely was the cause of all this. 2 weeks later and I still don't feel right, but I can get on with it now and not worry like I did the first time it happened.<br><br>
Through these experiences, I wished there was someone I could talk too who knew what I was going thru... But there never was.<!-- End Body -->
