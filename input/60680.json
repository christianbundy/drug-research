 "report": "<p>Here is my recipe for Kratom flour balls, and the amazing effects they gave me.</p><p>Yes, it is very simple, but VERY effective.</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>Recipe:</p><p>Kratom powder</p><p>Flour</p><p>Confectionery Sugar (Granular will also work)</p><p>A saucepan</p><p>Big plate</p><p>Add the desired dosing amount into the saucepan. (Mine was ~12g)</p><p>Add just enough water to mix with the kratom powder. Mix. Now add enough water so there is a layer a little bit more than the kratom 'paste.'</p><p>Put on very low heat on the burner. (I put it on '2')</p><p>Check every ten minutes or so, and stir.</p><p>When it gets to the point where its basically a thick paste and you stir it, it should almost turn back into a powder form, just with some water weight.</p><p>Put a plate on the counter. Add a thin layer of flour to the plate.</p><p>Take out an amount of kratom paste/powder that will roll into a ball the size of the circumference of a quarter. Roll it. Then roll it in flour to make it look white. Now remake the ball, and then roll in the flour again.</p><p>Now roll that in a good amount of confectionery sugar. If it is granular thats fine.</p><p>Grab a cup of milk if you have one, otherwise just put the ball in your mouth. Move it around on your tongue a little until it gets kinda slimy. Now, swallow (with the milk preferably, but I did it a few times without any liquid with no problem.)</p><p>Doesn't taste bad, and you get to actually use ALL of the kratom, so none is wasted.</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>Effects:</p><p>For the first hour or two before becoming ill...the euphoria was amazing. I was almost nodding, and the euphoria was probably better than the heroin I had last week. It was very strong, and the combination of kratom's ability to cause sedation and excitation made it feel like a speedball, which I also had last week. Now, I am just talking about heroin + coke that was smoked on foil...and not IV-ed or anything, but I honestly believe the kratom was BETTER than that feeling. It was stronger.</p><p>I went outside to smoke a cig, sat down, and literally said, 'Today is a beautiful day.'</p><p>My dose was obviously too high for me though. I ate some spaghetti-O's thirty minutes or so after dosing and threw them up a short time after. Once I threw them up, I felt a lot better, but still nauseous. If I tried to stand longer than 60 seconds I would get nauseous, and then would have to lie down for at least two minutes for it to fade away. This was annoying as I was trying to watch a movie on my computer before I had become nauseous. I would try to watch it for two minutes, and the nausea would slowly creep up on me, until I had to lie down before I vomited. Even during this, the euphoria still made me feel pleasant though. </p><p>In retrospect: Be careful if you use this method. Don't take more than you can handle.</p><p>The effects of the kratom lasted until the next day, and helped me for my first few hours at work in the morning until it faded away.</p>"
