I will keep this brief because the well-known 'positive' effects of phenibut are covered here and elsewhere more in-depth.  I will say that phenibut seems to be on a very steep curve when it comes to tolerance to a given dose.  As someone who experimented with dozens of drugs, both illicit and non-illicit, in the not-do-distant past, I don't recall another drug that seems to result in tolerance so quickly.<br><br>
I bought phenibut because of some lingering circadian rhythm issues from my misspent youth.  I very easily get on a 4am-1pm sleep schedule even after weeks or months on a more-desirable 12am-8am sleep schedule.  One all-nighter or similar is all it takes.  This is unacceptable for me, and causes a lot of secondary stress as well as the expected issues from circadian disruption.<br><br>
On to the negatives of phenibut use: while I noticed some benefit as far as sleep quality, they were  grossly outweighed by a recurring and nasty floating anxiety, occurring most intensely in social situations but manifesting as a general sense of dread and even nausea.  This started about three days after phenibut use started.  Oddly, the intense anxiety was followed by periods of near-narcoleptic drowsiness.  It got worse with prolonged use, and when I hypothesized it was the phenibut and cut down my phenibut use, it took a full week to get back to a semblance of normal.<br><br>
Luckily for me I am between jobs.  This was seriously life-disrupting and resulted in 4-5 embarrassing situations during dates with girls.  I can't emphasize how out of the ordinary this is for me.  I am not at all prone to anxiety in social situations, and tend to remain cool and levelheaded under any type of pressure.<br><br>
Most people who use phenibut are either looking for a good sleep aid, a cheap thrill, or are genuinely interested in experimenting with a variety of drugs and in the interest of thoroughness add phenibut to the list.  If you are looking for a sleep aid, I doubt phenibut will be worth the potential lost sleep and days of anxiety.  If you are looking for a cheap thrill, alcohol is legal and is very similar to phenibut when dosed at 2-4 drinks.  I won't suggest illicit drugs, but I think most of them are less psychologically harmful in an acute sense than phenibut.<br><br>
