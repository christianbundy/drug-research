 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've never heard of anyone being crazy, or stupid enough to attempt to combine tripping with a nice coke experience. The night I took all these chemicals began simply enough. Me and some friends were just drinking little and smoking a little bud, waiting for another one of my friends to get off work, so we could get some coke. I already had gotten together a bunch of 2C-E doses, and some of us were thinking about tripping.\r\nAfter we finally got the coke and all took a sample line, we returned back to my friends house. It is then I decided to take the 2C-E. By this time I had taken about 4 shots of some pretty garnly liquor. After taking a couple more lines and chilling for around an hour, I began to feel sick. This was the 2C-E coming up. I finally ended up feeling sick for about 25 minutes, and throwing up once. 30 minutes after that I was into my trip.\r\nI was allready blown by the time the 2C-E began to take full effect. The cocaine at times almost seemed to intensify all my thoughts and feelings. Yet I felt incredibly mellow during most of the trip. I felt like I could just sit back and melt into the reality of existence. When I was probably halfway into my trip I decided it was time to start sessioning the coke again. Fortunealtey my one friend, who was tripping was just about to cook up some sheets. \r\nI can safely say smoking crack on 2C-E is a very strage experience. As soon as I exhaled my first hit, the pattrens I was seeing in the bathroom started to slow down a bit and mellow out. The colors I was seeing however allready intensifed by the 2C-E jumped out even more. I felt amazing. The coke high combined with the trip gave me a feeling of utter peace and control. It was almost as if I was the master of the universe. I took another hit and then sat on my friends couch for awhile.\r\nAgain, my thoughts raced in my head while the world seemed almost slow around my. I don't remember thinking about much, all I can remember is that my thoughts were intense. The weirdest part is, about 30 minutes later I began to come down from my crack hits the patterns I was seeing began to become more intense again. After the crack, it was a much more intense clear reality, at least that is the best way I can describe the experience.\r\nThis was my 2nd time tripping on 2C-E, so I am still very unexperienced with how it feels.  Overall, the coke mostly seemed to mask the trip and the effects of the 2C-E, although in some ways it seemed to intensify it, mostly the rate at which I thought and my euphoria/body high. I eventually ended this night smoking bowls, and was surprisingly able to fall asleep about 11 hours after dosing on 2C-E. I felt brain dead for a few days after this experience, and this is definitely a combo that I will not be repeating.\n\n\n"
