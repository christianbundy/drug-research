 "report": "<p>Provigil was prescribed to me for excessive sleepiness,I have obstructive sleep apnea. I tried 200 mg for 4 days then upped to 400 mg for 4 days then 600 mg for 4 days and didn't notice any effect whatsoever, not even a side effect. The script with insurance for 30 pills still cost $50.00. </p><p>My experience is that it is no more than a placebo.</p>"
