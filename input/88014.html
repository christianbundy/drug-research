Rapid onset with first alert felt at around T+4 or 5 minutes, rapidly elevating in intensity--an overwhelming psychedelic body rush. It is too much for me, I vomit from the intensity, then go lie down. <br><br>
I am enveloped by geometric shapes. I am enveloped--but still it is all very subdued in a way, the visuals are not intricate, there are no fractals or complex, impossible structures like with DMT or LSD, although the sheer amount of disturbance to my visual field rivals either; the colors are primary and low in intensity, but everything is increasingly shattered into this fundamental geometry. However, I feel remarkably clear-headed; lucid, even. Mood is neutral. The ego is entirely intact. Fundamentally I feel sober, at least in comparison to the salience of the visuals, the most that I experience is a general drugedness, a stoning sensation, a flitting of the mind between different disconnected trains of thought, but nothing quite out of the ordinary. <br><br>
The visual aspect is truly remarkable, however, the colors become more brilliant and start to strobe towards the peak; there are also, unusually for me on a classical psychedelic, notable auditory effects, primarily strobing and rhythmic distortions of sounds present in the ordinary 'white noise' of city life going on beyond my walls. Also oddly, I find no enjoyment in music, on the contrary, I find it agitating. I vomit again. <br><br>
After the rapid come up, things plateau a bit and I feel more positive. Stoned sensorium recedes, and I start to think more clearly in an operative sense. There is still a good deal of residual tension; body load in the form of clenched jaw and a slight tremulousness, peripheral vasoconstriction. There is a diminished sensitivity to pain. At about an hour after the injection, the visuals die down. Light psychedelia to T+2 hours, and shortly thereafter I return to baseline with the exception of a lingering sensation not unlike haven drunken too much coffee. This persists a few hours. In retrospect, dose could be considered excessive, but experience remembered as rewarding.<!-- End Body -->
