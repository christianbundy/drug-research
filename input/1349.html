well I was at a friends house, who had a collection of the root bark, and was willing to share. he told us that traditionally the root bark would be ground and smashed then soaked in a cold infusion for up to 3 hours, maybe a little lime juice for better results, even a little heating of the water, but traditionally just cold water and bark. we tried 30 gms each which was recommended by our friend, soaked in cold water, had a meditation, and drank. <br><br>
After half an hour not much was apparent from the other world, so we smoked a joint. even before the joint the 3rd member of our experiement fell aleep. we sat and noticed colors and tones, very subtle though, for almost another half an hour then nothing. <br><br>
I will try this experiment again (without an MAOI) yet I suggest, and will try a 50 gm dose instead with lime juice and maybe a little heating of the solution.<!-- End Body -->
