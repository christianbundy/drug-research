 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known\r\nnursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea \r\nmethods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.\r\nWhere codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little\r\nalternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't \r\nlike wasting a useful substance... or puking, for that matter.\r\nAt least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric\r\nfryer pot with enough water to 'float' the matter freely.\r\nSetting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed\r\nthe mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.\r\nNext, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then\r\npoured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the\r\nwater content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.\r\nI carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and \r\nleft it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's\r\nconsistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate\r\namount of nicely dried 'tar' around the surface edges of the\r\nmeasuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in\r\na cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to\r\nair-dry. \r\nA few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. \r\nI recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.\n\n\n"
