 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known<br>nursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea <br>methods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.<br>Where codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little<br>alternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't <br>like wasting a useful substance... or puking, for that matter.<br>At least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric<br>fryer pot with enough water to 'float' the matter freely.<br>Setting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed<br>the mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.<br>Next, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then<br>poured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the<br>water content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.<br>I carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and <br>left it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's<br>consistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate<br>amount of nicely dried 'tar' around the surface edges of the<br>measuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in<br>a cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to<br>air-dry. <br>A few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. <br>I recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.\n\n\n"
