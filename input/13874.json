 "report": "<p>\nI purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known</p><p>nursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea </p><p>methods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.</p><p>Where codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little</p><p>alternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't </p><p>like wasting a useful substance... or puking, for that matter.</p><p>At least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric</p><p>fryer pot with enough water to 'float' the matter freely.</p><p>Setting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed</p><p>the mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.</p><p>Next, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then</p><p>poured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the</p><p>water content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.</p><p>I carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and </p><p>left it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's</p><p>consistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate</p><p>amount of nicely dried 'tar' around the surface edges of the</p><p>measuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in</p><p>a cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to</p><p>air-dry. </p><p>A few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. </p><p>I recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.</p>"
