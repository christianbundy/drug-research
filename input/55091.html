Recently, a bunch of my friends went to local doctors where they were prescribed 8mg Suboxone sublingual tablets for their so called 'addiction'. They really were in no condition to need these pills, but pushed for them anyway, until eventually getting their way. After trying them, they gave a few of the tabs to me to try. Mind you, I have a high opiate tolerance, and have been abusing OCs, Percocets, and Hydrocodones for quite some time now. <br><br>
To begin with, not knowing the absolute strength of the drug, I let one tab dissolve under my tongue. It tasted like oranges, with a little bit of medicine mixed in. A nice little buzz was felt approx. 45 minutes after first taking it, and I had high hopes. I waited about another 45 minutes to no avail, and without doing any research, dissolved the second tab.<br><br>
In know way shape or form should I have ever take down 16 mg of Suboxone on my first dose without knowing the full effects. Apparently, this is a 24 hour drug and I was nowhere near reaching a peak before downing the second dose. Well, as soon as I dissolved that second tab, the first one started kicking in hard, and I knew I was gonna be comatose before long. I popped in a movie, layed in my bed, and let the drug take its course.<br><br>
Wow, this stuff is really strong. For a while, I was dozing in and out, not really paying attention to the movie, loving life, and loving the feeling in my body. I've never done heroin in its pure form, so I don't know where it is on the chain, but Suboxone is very comparable to a strong OC dosage.<br><br>
Anyways, The next day I was still high, and my addiction did not ask for anymore the whole day. All in all, it was a fun time, and is a drug I may or may not use in the future.<!-- End Body -->
