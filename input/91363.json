 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI am a constant user of the 2c chemicals\r\nhonestly they are my favorites \r\nI have tested most of them thru friends and some orders I have made personally online\r\nbut 2cp was something I was not prepared for\r\nwe took the chemical around 9:30 ingesting maybe 10 mg each \r\nwithing 45 minutes all of us feeling the effects\r\nintense body buzz almost as erotic as 2cb but the visuals were so intense they over powered my attention to the body high\r\nfeeling ballsy I take another 5 to 7 mg on the tounge as well does my good friend\r\nthis is when things ran rampant, we decided to change location due to the police being very active in that area and who would wanna face the police on such a strong chemical,so we move to a park nearby, *I do not condone driving on any mind altering substance*\r\nthe car looks almost futuristic and as we drive I notice it feels as if were not even moving,\r\n*this is all within 3 hours of the trip, remembering this trip is 20 hours long* \r\nwe arrive to the park and I find myself rushed with energy almost explosive,\r\nwe found a bench placed very up high on a large hill that is where we set up all of our things my cellphone seeming fake I turned it off, contact with the outer world seemed impossible, all us now sitting around each other like a camp fire explaining the things we see and feel, every one at a +3 \r\n*15 hours in*\r\nthe last hours just filled with conversation and running around the park yelling and acting like children and fully enjoying my trip\r\nwhen one of the people I was tripping with began to freak out saying that the park had an evil undertone, she had to be carried out of the park, and sedated with strong xanax due to her \r\nwild antics\r\neveryone still at a plus 3 after that mess\r\ncome down was comftorble and none the less smooth smoked some hash and just \r\nrelaxed\r\nhoenstly very intense not for the weak minded after this experiance a good friend of mine, my fiance and my cousin have been hospitalized because of this chemical be warned\n\n\n"
