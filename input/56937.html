I am not someone who has much experience with K outside of using it recreationally at a few parties, taking small bumps occasionally, however, I recently had an experience that made me realise the potential for this substance.<br><br>
I had a small vial that was left over from the precious weekend and it was about 1/2 full. I decided to ingest it nasally and see what it would be like in my home, alone, with no sound, and with my body lying flat on my bed.<br><br>
I first noticed the usual slight dizzy feeling, followed by the awful taste and slight burn of the K hitting or dripping to the back of my throat (yuk). I had a chewable vitamin C handy to take this away as soon as it hit.<br><br>
After about 15 minutes, I felt that electricity feeling wash over my entire body, and the weird hum fill my ears. Right at this moment, any bodily discomforts simply vanish and I suddenly felt very comfortable (well actually, I felt nothing of my body). I closed my eyes, and went with it. The weirdest thing happened next. I realised I had visited this place I was now in and that I was not alone. I had actual memories of being here before! I am lying on some sort of table and everything I have ever experienced in my life has been a test by a higher intelligence of some sort, one that me, and every other conscious being in the Universe is a part of. Exactly like the shadows on a cave wall that Plato wrote about many years ago! I have been in this human form but there is more to reality than I could ever understand in that state. I tried desperalty to get off the table and to join the others around me that had made the leap in this consciousness evolution phase we are all destined for, but it was not my time. Why not I demanded. I wanted to wake up to this newer enlightened state right then, but could not.<br><br>
I was then aware of my body (sort of) but more specifically my brain. This is hard to describe, but I felt like my Brain had unfolded from its many loops and squiggles and was standing up straight and full of electricity. Almost like I was actually stretching the ability of this organ to understand the next phase of our evolution. It was incredible! I could see every molecule in the universe and could sense how I should be able to re-arrange everything as I wanted  shaping my reality, in an endless way for all eternity. It was almost like someone or something was explaining this to me  but at the same time it was myself as well.<br><br>
I think I may have actually said There is God out loud, because I thing I heard the words, right as my consciousness came back to my room and into my body in a rapid but steady and quite unscary way. I felt this sense of importance that I needed to say that to remind myself of what I had discovered. Not a God like the Christian sense, but that we are all a part of a God like state.<br><br>
It was so weird. Amazing and very hard to explain. Maybe death is the way we pass into this state, and the K allowed me to glimpse it briefly. I have never had such a psychedelic experience (I hate acid or shrooms) and probably will never again.<!-- End Body -->
