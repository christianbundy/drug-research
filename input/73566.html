I came across a bottle from a friend, I didn't find too much info on experience so I started out small.  On 8/19/08 at 2pm I took 1/2 pill, I took the other half one hour later at 3pm.<br><br>
3pm I felt slightly light headed and a little excited, mostly from the new experience. <br><br>
4 pm I took my second pill<br><br>
5pm I felt just slightly disoriented, like I had to think about what I was doing, but it was easy to make myself concentrate. <br><br>
8:30pm I chewed up 3 pills, then ate a bowl of ramen noodles and took a shower to kill some time. <br><br>
10:00pm, slightly aggravated that I wasn't really feeling anything, I was more talkative though while watching TV with a friend. <br><br>
11:00pm- Still no changes, everything was the same when I walked. My nose itched and I was getting tired. <br><br>
12:00pm- It had been three hours and nothing worthwhile had happened, I figured that night was a bust and I went to bed. <br><br>
2:00am- I woke myself up scratching my shoulder. I had Never broken out in Hives before but I think that's what it was. They looked and felt like mosquito bites, on my arms, legs, shoulders, and stomach. My stomach was a little upset. I got up and chewed 2 Benadryl for the allergic reaction. Then made myself calm down<br><br>
2:30am- Just when I was about to fall asleep I began to feel queasy. I fought it back for 15 minutes, then finally gave in a threw up only about 1/2 cup of fluid. I felt better a few minutes after. <br><br>
3:00am- I went to bed, with nothing worth writing home about. <br><br>
8/22/08- One last try<br>
I decided to start early. <br><br>
I started at 12:00pm and took one pill every two hours. <br>
12:00pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 7pm, 8pm<br><br>
I also took 1 Benadry just in case. But again no hallucinations. No weird feelings, I've had better stronger experiences taking OTC Sleeping pills.<!-- End Body -->
