 "report": "<p>Okay, so my grandmother has a huge garden at her house. I mean a HUGE garden, it literally takes up her entire acre of land that is her back yard (country home, big yard). Over the last few years ever since that magical day when I had my first experience with recreational drugs (cannabis, 13 yrs old), I have gathered (without my grandmother's knowledge) many a high from her glorious garden. Over the years I have collected opium, wild lettuce, and datura (bad shit man, badddddd shit) and I recently saw what I am sure is salvia(!). My report deals with the best drug I have yet harvested from her glorious garden, Morning Glory Seeds.</p><p>So, I had been looking for more 'fun' drugs to do all summer (all the rednecks where I live are content with their Johnny Walker) but now the summer was over and it was back to high school, 12th grade (last in Ontario*, the province* where I live) I am unfortunately not the most enterprising of young lads and have yet to acquire an automobial for transportation, so its back to the bus with all the annoying assholes going from Wee Kindergarten Tots to Idiotic High School Jocks. Anyways, the bus has always dropped me of at my grandparents house and I usually get a ride from a friend or family member to get me to my house. On this particular day, no one was home and my ride wouldn't be getting there for about half an hour. Hmmm.... What to do, what to do.</p><p>The answer was obvious, I grabbed a few ziplock bags from a drawer, popped a trank that I 'found' and ran out the back door to see what could be gathered from my grandmothers magical garden. The opium poppies had long been harvested and dried up and there were no 'misc. herbs' to be found. I was feeling dejected when I looked at the Greenhouse (yeah, she really has a greenhouse, the woman is MAD about gardening!) and noticed a particular kind of vine covering the entrance. Could it be? It is! I finally found a morning glory vine that I could harvest from without fear of getting shot by a drunken hillbilly (see 'Johnny Walker', above). The pods were not yet dry but they all had some huge white seeds in them. I figured that the seeds would probably be pretty much the same maybe better since LSA is water soluble and when you dry the seeds, you remove the water, food for thought. Anyways, I collected all the pods I could and put them in a ziplock. I returned to the house, had a beer, the old man of the house, aka grandpa, is a real cool guy who pretty much lets me do whatever I want when I'm there, including taking a beer or five. So my ride comes and takes me home.</p><p>The time is now eight P.M on the dot and I begin eating the juicy, sticky white seeds. Man their a bitch to get out of the pods when their fresh**, but their taste wasn't bad, like brazil nuts and peas. Not the most complimentary flavours, but its a helluva lot better than the devil drug (nutmeg). From now on I will be writing in standard 'time since ingestion' format.</p><p>T :30 - Ughhhhhh, shitttt mannnn. Talk about nasua! I really need to smoke a joint as I know it will help but I'm stuck in the basement and there are too many people running around upstairs that I don't know.</p><p>T :45 - Puke in the sump-pump. Haha, it'll be fine and its not like its the first time.</p><p>T 1:00 - Starting to feel first 'effects' (probably placebo), giddiness and still feeling sick as a dog. Sneak out a back door and away from the unfriendly strangers (parents friends) clogging up my houses main arteries. Go out to my 'special place' my lair, My Kingdom! ......My shed.......</p><p>T 1:15 - Wow! Naseau completely gone! smoked a perfect one gram joint that my friend made with his shiny new rolling machine. Bud is decent, especially for outdoor. But the amazing part is almost as soon as I took my first toke my vision EXPLODED! I'm seeing swirls of flashing pot leafs, which is a common visual for me, and crazy tribal patterns all over everything, which is not. I walked out of the shed and took a look at the tacky lawn angel my neighbours (fundaMENTAList, born again baptists) just got that I hate (the angel and the family). It turned its head and its wings started moving. Not beating mind, you, just moving like an arm or leg. I head back in and downstairs to my room and lie on my bed.......Ahhhhh.....Bliss.</p><p>T 1:30- Get up of my bed. Wow, serious energy and the most insane euphoria I've ever felt. In fact, it felt like a good roll, but with visuals. Get on MSN to talk to some friends when I get an unexpected message 'SL has added you to her list, do you wish to accept her?'. Now, SL and I have a long and storied history (she's my ex a few times over) but at the moment I couldn't have had a bad feeling towards anyone, and I mean ANYONE! Adolph Hitler himself could have walked into my room at that moment, ranting about Jews and the Sudetenland and I would have said 'Man, chill out and smoke a bowl with me, you need to calm wayyyy down man.' Not that I'm compairing my ex to Hitler but anyways. So, I of course accepted her.</p><p>We started having a very general conversation about what we've been doing the last few years, Me- sitting in my room, writing songs on my guitar and generally acting like an emo-ass bitch (I'm not though, really) Her- Alcohol counseling, rolling her ass off any chance she got and generally living the 'high life' so to speak (we fit together like two very twisted seeds in a rotten pod). After this she revealed that she was actually rolling at the time, which would explain her not typing 'fuck you' to everything I said, and quite out of the blue asked if I have a girlfriend. I said no because I've pretty much been celebate (not by choice my friend, not by choice) since we had broken up. </p><p>Her- 'Doin nething friday nite?' </p><p>Me- 'Never am'</p><p>Her- 'You should come over, I have the house to myself all the time nowadays'</p><p>WHAT!?!? She was basically propositioning me right out of the blue. What could I say.</p><p>Me-  'Sure ill come over, but I gtg now':</p><p>And I signed off. Crazy shit my friend, crazy shit. Back to the trip.</p><p>T 2:15- Have been lying on my bed groovin on the visuals (listening to Sgt. Peppers) and riding the wave of adrenalin I got from talking to SL, get up to spark another joint as I feel a slight (pleasent) burnout coming on.</p><p>T 2:30-  Am walking around outside, got lost for a minute. I'm my own yard. Morning Glory is some serious shit, and the visuals are still going strong.</p><p>T 2:45- Go back to my room, put on a mix involving equal parts Oasis, Stooges (not for the faint of heart when tripping by the way) and Ramones. Pure. Fuzzed Out. Bliss.</p><p>T 3:15- Go spark another, the visuals are slowing down and my brain suddenly had a switch flippped to 'on' somewhere in the mouldy recesses (how the fuck do you spell that word!?) of my mind. To many thoughts, cant hold on to any, mind slipping...AHHHH!!!! </p><p>T 3:30- The above 'ahh' is a good 'ahh' just so you know. I'm feeling more speedy than I've ever felt on ritalin, caffein, rolls, speed or any other stimulant. Can't play the guitar because the speedy effects are fucking with my co-ordination. Decide to take a couple Dimenhydrinate (30 mgs) tablets to calm me down and get me to sleep, as I had school in the morning.</p><p>T 4:00+ - Never got to sleep, just got spaced out from the Gravol. Went to school the next day and my pupils were still hugely dialated, this stuff stayed in me for a good eighteen hours of noticable effects. Defiantly a drug for a weekend, not a party though, I mite write a negative experience later about how the 'love for humanity' this stuff gives you seems to dissapate around actual humans. All in all, one of the best experiences of my drug-induced existence. Oh, me and SL never got back 'together' but have decided we work best together as close friends with 'privlages'. Definetly my favourite kind of friend.</p><p>* I live in Canada, eh!</p><p>** If you get them at the perfect time just squeeze the skinny end and they should pop right out and divide into four instantly. That took me alot of work to figure out if you believe it.</p>"
