 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMe and my cousins were bored one night. Tatum New Mexico is so small everything is just a bike ride away, so we went to town and country and bought a 2000 mg pack of ginseng juice. We went around the side of town and country and drank it all in 1 gulp.\r\n(8:00)no significant effect on the ride home, a little more energetic then usual.\r\n(8:30)change of mind state everything seems to be shifting.\r\n(9:00)weird feeling in our stomachs.\r\n(9:30)strung out all over the small room.\r\n(10:00)when we lay down it feels like an intense rush like were in a race car.\r\n(10:30)feeling nausious and a little buzzed.\r\n(11:00)coming down is like hell.\r\n(11:30)feeling tired my bro is on the computer.\r\n(12:00)I feel like I'm dead\r\n(11:00am)a bad hangover \r\nAll together it was fun and a good party drug with some not so fun side effects. I may try it again but I'll research other things first.\n\n\n"
