 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMe and my cousins were bored one night. Tatum New Mexico is so small everything is just a bike ride away, so we went to town and country and bought a 2000 mg pack of ginseng juice. We went around the side of town and country and drank it all in 1 gulp.<br>(8:00)no significant effect on the ride home, a little more energetic then usual.<br>(8:30)change of mind state everything seems to be shifting.<br>(9:00)weird feeling in our stomachs.<br>(9:30)strung out all over the small room.<br>(10:00)when we lay down it feels like an intense rush like were in a race car.<br>(10:30)feeling nausious and a little buzzed.<br>(11:00)coming down is like hell.<br>(11:30)feeling tired my bro is on the computer.<br>(12:00)I feel like I'm dead<br>(11:00am)a bad hangover <br>All together it was fun and a good party drug with some not so fun side effects. I may try it again but I'll research other things first.\n\n\n"
