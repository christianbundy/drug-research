     I, Along with some other friends got a hold of a bottle of Gabapentin (Neurontin).  The first time I did it i took two 400mg pills (800mg). For the first 20 minutes I didn't feel any effects and wondered whether it would work or not. 10 minutes later I felt a small reaction and felt a bit buzzed. 40 minutes after taking the pill I started to feel pretty high; similar to the high of marijuana but yet less as intense. <br><br>
A little while afterwards I started to have a weird reaction, when I turned my head in a new direction that side of the room would turn black and then look like it would warp back and become blurry before I could see it clearly. Everything turned as if some objects near me were 3-D and objects farther away were 2-D the effects seemed very similar to Ecstasy (MDMA) I was very calm and relaxed but yet had a very intense inner adrenaline rush. I had absoulutly no paranoia what-so-ever about taking the drug knowing that it is a pharmaceutical and is made clean and safe.<!-- End Body -->
