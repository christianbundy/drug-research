 "report": "<p>A little background on my experience with drugs, I used pot a lot when younger and I still go to Canada once in a while for 222s , when I had teeth pulled or got a  few hydrocodones, I enjoyed that.  Now, I got some Ultrams for my foot problem and . Ultram is between codeine and hydrocone, but trams do last longer than both, but Ultram takes longer to peak effect than either.      </p><p>My experience:  </p><p>T+0:00</p><p>Swallow 100 mg Ultram. </p><p>T+1:00 </p><p>I feel slight warmth and  energy. </p><p>T+1:30 </p><p>Feel good, like I could put my weight on my feet without a care, just forgot about the problem. Grab a beer, and listen to some music, my mood is really good, notice the sunny day looks great, relaxed but at the same time, I can get things done without any dizziness.  </p><p>T+4:00 </p><p>It was a gradual return to base.</p>"
