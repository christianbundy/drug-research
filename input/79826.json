 "report": "\n\n\n\nMy mother had two strokes and several TIAs.  As a result she was unable to speak most of the time, experienced confusion, cognitive problems and extreme emotional distress due to losing these functions.  On approx 6-14mg Hydergine daily and also Melatonin for sleep all her symptoms resulting from her stroke disappeared completely.  She carried on complex conversations at will with perfect fluid speech and clear understanding and thinking.   Her mood was better than it was before her first stroke.<br>Her board certified neurologist denied her this medication and she suffered terribly for the last years of her life.\n\n\n"
