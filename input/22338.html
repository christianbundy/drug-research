Substance: Cytisine (inhaled) in form of Sweet Broom flowers<br>
Quantity: unknown<br>
Setting: my house, alone; on full stomach; random music at medium volume in background<br><br>
8:35 unknown quantity (small?) smoked through a filter, taste rather pleasant<br><br>
+0:00 immediate cooling of body, relaxation, pleasant drowsiness<br><br>
+0:10 slight difficulty typing, though whether due to hand/eye discoordination or lowering of mental facilities unsure. Increase in brightness of light colours, decrease in brightness of dark colours. Fuzzy 'static' type patterns overlaying everything.<br><br>
+0:20 lengthening of sound, heightened awareness. Definately some reduction in mental acuity.<br><br>
+0:35 slightly off-balance, some tingling of extremities; feels like a sustained cigarette 'head-rush'<br><br>
+0:45 this is a very subtle and delicate state of being. It feels like a prelude to something bigger; but that 'something bigger' seems a long way off, whatever it is. Effects on music difficult to describe... bass sounds seem very heavy and muddled, highs sound a bit tinny. Possibly because of the 'sound lengthening' described earlier. Electronic music is not suited well to this material.<br><br>
+0:50 just noticed that the computer monitor is breathing. I hear a baby crying, though I can't seem to find where the sound is coming from.<br><br>
+1:15 whatever 'high' there was has faded to a subdued tranquility. A nice, safe, warm place of curious apathy. My eyes move to see new things, my ears move to hear new sounds; but my mind doesn't really care one way or another what my senses find. I don't think I've spoken since I dosed, which even in an empty house is unusual for me. I just feel detached, like an observer in my own body. I want to speak, but have nothing to say. Words roll through my mind, but it is, at the same time, empty. I've lost interest in everything. I know I wasn't always this way...or was I? I would say this bothers me, but for reason I can't even get up the emotion to be annoyed at this sudden loss of caring.<br><br>
+1:40 started drinking alcohol, just to feel something. I think the drug has worn off, but the apathy brought with it has stayed. Hopefully the booze will change that. I think it is already working. I just smiled for the first time since this started. A smug grin to myself...<br><br>
Comments: interesting material, nice as a mild downer; but no depth to it. I *might* explore this again at a higher dosage, or in combination with something else.<!-- End Body -->
