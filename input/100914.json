 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMindset: just got off work feeling a bit excited and anxious due to 8 hours of manual labor and recent delivery of RC's.\r\nPrevious drug experience: Alsmost everything, a lot.\r\npreparation: some mental preparation\r\nT+0:00\r\nInsuffilate 10 mg ethylphenidate. Slight burn, not as painful as most reports report.\r\nT+0:10min\r\nSlight mood boost, most likely placebo. Drain not too repulsive.\r\nT+0:20min\r\nDefinate stimulant properties, not unlike methamphetamine. \r\nT+0:30min\r\nStimulation building. Mild euphoria present, building.\r\nT+0:35min\r\nNiiiice, excellent body feeling, mental clarity, rush, moderate euphoria.\r\nT+0:40min\r\nInject 10mg. This is when I lose track of time.  I feel wonderful. Very clean stimulant, with quite a bit of euphoria. Mind is calm yet stimulated.  Body rush still going strong.  Slight dehydration present at this time but nothing more than you would expect from a stimulant. Ingest several alcoholic beverages.  Mixing well.\r\nT+2:00hr\r\nStill feeling great with a bit of a moreish quality but altogether feeling very good.\r\nT+3:00hr\r\nComing down.  Not bad at all.  Feel slightly dehydrated and wanting more alcohol. Still stimulated.  Altogether a small dose with a very positive reaction.  Lots of euphoria, nice speedy vibe, easy comedown.  Way better than any ritalin experience I've had.  Definatley a novel RC with potential.  risk of abuse yet to be determined :-)\n\n\n"
