I had been researching for some time, browsing and searching for all different sorts of experiences, when I came across Salvia Divinorum reports.  I read almost everyone and finally decided I had to try it, so I invited my good friend Quince up to my college and ordered 1/2 gram of 10x.  It arrived a couple weeks later, and I called quince to have him come.  <br><br>
We couldn't smoke it in the dorms, and we didn't have a sitter; so we ended up driving out into the country and parking in some field near a line of trees and underneath a full moon.  I loaded the 1/8 gram of Salvia into the bowl and let my friend take the first hit.  His eyes bugged out mid-inhalation, and I could tell he was already feeling it.  He was asking where he was, saying, 'I'm in the car? I'm in the car.  I'm in the car.'  <br>
I loaded up the another 1/8 and smoked it, immediately being propelled into a very trance-like, deep-humming reality, where things flowed by me in amazing grace.  Movement was not needed here, everything moved and manipulated as I desired it.  (First off, this didn't happen, I was moving, but it seemed as though I were still and everything moved around me.  I had found the center of the universe.)<br><br>
We started to feel trapped in the vehicle we were sitting in, so we got out to walk, and immediately realized we had more to do. (another 1/8 gram each)(The amt. We took is apparently a high dose, be VERY careful, its very powerful).<br><br>
We went back to the car after only about 15 feet and smoked the rest. <br>
I was launched into another world...of psychedelic spinning colors and patterns.  Clowns, cars, lights, laughter and walls.  I felt as though I had been enveloped in a circus of realities, all spinning out of control, tumbling over one another.  The doors on the car seemed to lead to other realities, and I didnt know who I was, believing my friend to be the friend of another man whose life I was now living.  I recognized this friend of this new man I was as 'Randy'; if that makes sense.  As if I was living someone elses life.  Randy (my friend) was trying to show me through his door, another reality, trying to lead me back to where I used to live.   I turned around and opened my door and looked up and down, the world, the trees and fields and car all disappeared and I was left staring at a myriad of alternatives to every moment.  As if, for every second I lived, the possibilites of reactions and actions I could have were endless, and I was able to jump around inbetween them; watching a 100,000 me's above and below, each acting out every possibility.  <br><br>
I was seeing all the levels on which God plays, the complete understanding of the infinite, fractally patterned with colors unknown to man. This terrified me, and I shut the door quickly, turning to see my friend again, who wasn't even the supposed Randy anymore, but was a being of this new universe.  <br><br>
At this point, I lost it, I couldnt understand what was happening, like I had died, was now in the infinite, playing among God's heights.  It was wonderfully terrifying, but I have no way of describing it accurately.<!-- End Body -->
