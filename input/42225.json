 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: 875 milliliters of hard alcohol is considered an extremely high dose.]</p><p>Mindset And Setting: I wasnt really saddened by the fact of leaving all my friends and life behind me due to the fact it hadnt become a reality to me that the next day id never see them again (which has affected me a lot).  Overall I was excited and pleased to be going out the night before I left and planned on getting pretty wasted. We made plans to meet outside the club at about 8pm.</p><p>Preparations: My first mistake was not having much food, being from Zimbabwe I really never ate much so the only meal I had that day was 3 slices of pizza at about 1pm. I made my way down to the store (I was only 14 but this was no issue in Zimbabwe) and I purchased a 700ml bottle of vodka and no cola to dilute it as my friends planned on bringing that.</p><p>Experience:I arrived at about 7:50 and waited for my friends which I had planned on meeting so I sat down at our usual drinking place and waited.</p><p>T= 8:00: Another mate of mine who I never planned on meeting came and sat down with me. I opened my bottle and he had his own as I put the bottle to my mouth and drank my first sip that warm cozy liquor sensation briefly overwhelmed my body. We began talking about stories and drinking from our bottles not taking notice of how much we were having.</p><p>T=8:30: My other mates arrived with there booze and came and sat down and the person who I was splitting 50% of the bottle came and sat next to me. I looked down at the bottle noticing I had already finished half of the bottle straight so I made a quick excuse and give him some money to go buy a half jack. We all began talking again about 15 of us just telling stories and drinking before we went up into the club.</p><p>T=8:40: The effects of about 3/4s of the bottle began to hit me just seeing trails of the lights as I swayed my head side to side looking at the street light and was very talkative. I felt altogether I hadnt stood up since I sat down so I never really felt the affects that much.</p><p>T=9:00: I had finished my whole bottle and decided to go upstairs to the club and say wats up to everyone. As soon as I stood up it hit me real fast, it all went to my head and I staggered into the club. As soon as I got to the top of the stairs another one of my friends called me down and helped me back to the drinking spot.</p><p>T=9:10: Feeling pretty wasted after a full bottle of straight vodka I didnt really care if I had any more so I took my friends bottle and had some of his which I couldnt even taste the usual burn it leaves on the throat. I heard someone spark up some good greens and in my state I didnt really care as the realization began to hit me that I wasnt going to be here tomorrow. I had 1 hit of weed and remember attempting to walk towards the night club after that I had no recollection of what happened:</p><p>Friends story of what happened: When I was walking I began to run and apparently ran full speed into a street light and passed out, I began throwing up bile as I had nothing to eat and about 30 of my friends were all helping me, getting me water and keeping my head up so I didnt choke on my vomit.</p><p>T=10.00: My brother managed to walk past and wonder what all the commotion was about, I was very secretive about my drug experiences to him so he was pretty shocked when he saw me passed out vomiting. He called my parents and they took me to ER.</p><p>The Next Day I wake up and in front of my eyes is 2 long poles so immediately I thought AHHHHHH FUCK I'm in jail. I then turned my head a bit and realized I was in a hospital bed. I looked down at my arms and I had 2 drips coming out of them and my parents were sitting down on the chair. My blood pressure was so low they wouldnt let me leave the hospital and if I was in the state I had been for 30 min more I would have been dead.</p><p>State I am in 3 years later: After looking at other peoples stories and noticing people saying how there perception of life is so messed up I came to the realization of why I have been so fucked up the last 3 years. I use to be able to study for hours but now I look at words and after 3 min I'm just starring at the paper and then 5 min later I realize I'm not reading anything. My vision ain't what it use to be fuzzyish I guess u could say and I have lost all sense of emotion I wouldnt care if I died tomorrow. I dont like being very social like I use to be and overall id say I'm pretty fucked up. Dont take this as a bad thing I love drugs now, had good experiences with alcohol, weed and recently DXM but I just thought id share my story for anyone who relates to this.</p>"
