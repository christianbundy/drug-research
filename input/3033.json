 "report": "<p>\nWell, I had a bottle of Codeine in my medicine cabinet and I decided to get high off of it.  I wasn't quite sure how much to take to get the full effect from it so I took 4 pills (30 mg each).  After an hour I felt a slight buzz I guess you could say, so I had a couple of beers thinking that would intensify the feeling, but no go.  </p><p>It wasn't bad.  The problem I had was that I probably didn't consume enough codeine to really feel it.  All I got was a slight buzz for about 2 hours and my coordination was off a bit also.  I also ate before I took it because I heard of people vommiting after taking codeine.  I had no upset stomach at all though.  That's it.</p>"
