When I first read about this new research chemical and its properties, I wandered if this might make for a cheap, quick, and semi-legal alternative to my beloved Ritalin, both as a study aid and occasional social lubricant.  However as I read on further, the experience journals of first time users displayed a whole spectrum of results.  Some found Ethyl was almost indistinguishable from methylphenidate (ritalin) both in effects and side effects.  Another reported that they found it actually hindered their ability to concentrate and he found no redeeming values in it.  On the other hand, one user said it was her new good-to party favor, replacing cocaine.  Most though, found it lacking as any kind of party enhancer even falling below Ritalin's standard in the department.  Everyone did agree on one point.  It hurt like hell when it was snorted.<br><br>
Now on to my experience.  It was a humid Thursday in July and I was busy preparing to take the Bar Exam the following week. I had been experiencing an outbreak of insomnia, a common occurrence for me and one of the reasons I like stimulants, though I'm aware that I'm just making the situation worse.  In the previous week I had 5 hours of sleep and was mentally and physically drained.  I got out of bed approximately 5 am (hadn't slept at all) and bumped 20 mg of Ritalin, my normal prescribed dosage.<br><br>
I laid around for awhile and even took 2 Ambien to see if I could get to sleep.  I soon abandoned the sleep aid plane and bumped another 10 of Ritalin.  At 11 in the morning, my Ethyl arrived along with some Etizolam for my sleep issues.  After determining how to measure out the powder which I estimated was about 25-50 milligrams.  And sniff.<br><br>
Holy hell.  I have snorted my fair number of legal and illegal substances in my life and none were as unpleasant as Ethyl save for Lunesta which has the most indescribably metallic taste that remains in my mouth for days.  Ethyl did not have a taste, unless being eaten by fireants is a taste.  After regaining my bearing and wiping the tears from my eyes.  I began to write this review.   <br><br>
Initial effects:  Mouth is numb, face flushed and sweating a bit,  slight increase in mood and cognative abilities.  Not unlike Ritalin but muted.<br><br>
0:15:  Slight hand tremors, little twitchyness, slight ataxia pain.  Less severe than Ritalin in higher dosages.  No increase in the effects mentioned above.  <br><br>
0:30:  Effects both good and ill are waning.  Concentration increase was negligible at best but I did not really put it to the test.  <br><br>
0:45: Effects all but gone aside from slight chest pain and sweating (God its hot!!)  Nose is surprisingly unclogged and undamaged at this juncture.  Will still run a Seline solution up there later.  Ethyl crystal are large and sharp and tend to do quite a bit of nasal damage.    <br><br>
Conclusions:  Meh.  Will try at later date with a higher dosage, but I doubt much of increase in effects.  Ethyl could probably be best described as Ritalin Lite.  Everything was just not quite up to the standards set by Vitamin R.  If you can get your hands on Ritalin, whether through a prescription or some other means, go with that over Ms. Ethyl.  She's just not like her older brother.<!-- End Body -->
