I was prescribed Ambien in January 2003 for a genuine sleeping disorder, i.e. me not being able to sleep. Duh. I took the pill when I needed it, about once a week for a few months. Then one night I was all out of pot and my car was in the shop. Instead of sitting around sober all night with no way of going anywhere, I just decided to take one and fall asleep at 7:00 pm. I took it, and instead of trying to fall asleep like all the other times, I stayed up until the drug hit me. This is the first time I seriously noticed the stoning effect that Ambien can have. It is kind of like being drunk, my vertigo was all screwy, I had a hard time focusing on a task at hand, and I felt sedated, but not necissarily sleepy. I didn't feel much pain, and everything became interesting. Some of my friends have reported a hallucination effect, where 'things get all wavey,' but I've never gotten it. I decided then and there that this might be a drug I'd like to exploit.<br><br>
Since then I have been changing my prescription papers from saying '1 refill' to '10 refill.' Soon after I started to enjoy them recreationally I started to snort them. I have snorted other pills before, and this is the harshest one I've ever done. It feels like snorting fire. However, the effects set on so quickly and so intensely, that I snort half a pill, and by the time the other half is crushed I can snort it without feeling any pain. If you haven't snorted anything before, it is best to just take them orally. The effects are still pretty good.<br><br>
Usually I just do one, or for an extra kick I eat one and snort one. However, I have snorted/taken up to eight within an hour period, and mixed that with large amounts of alcohol without getting sick or ODing. Every month or so my friends and I have an 'Ambien Party,' where we all hang out and snort vast quantities of Ambien. It's a pretty good social drug, so long as you don't mind your company to see you totally trashed.<br><br>
Probably the only downside to Ambien is that it wipes out a lot of your memory. I don't really do things that I end up regretting, but what I did is usually fuzzy at best. When we wake up from the Ambien parties in the morning, all we can really remember is that we had a great time. Sometimes we will walk aorund the house searching for clues of what we did, and find blood stains on the carpet when none of us had cut themselves, broken windows, spilled food, just grizzly remnants of an out of control party.<br><br>
Ambien is great, I love it, and it certainly is not addicting for me. I can stop using for months and not feel any withdrawal or inclination to do any more. You wake up in the morning feeling like a million bucks, and best of all, it is 100% legal to use or carry (at least for me, it's my prescription). It doesn't show up on any normal drug tests, so guys with government jobs or on probation won't test positive. I wouldn't recommend driving on it, for the reasons mentioned above, but other than that, knock yourself out. In my opinion, Ambien is definitely worth a try.<!-- End Body -->
