 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have been taking a regimen of:\r\n1600 mg/day Piracetam\r\n4.5 mg/day Hydergine\r\n250 mg/day Lucidril\r\nfor approx 3 months time now.\r\nFor lack of better control mechanisms, I have been using several software packages, including a database of several old GMAT CAT examinations(THE GMAT Verbal section is gerenally regarded as a measure of intellectual ability), and a memory recall speed and efficiency package.\r\nHere is a breakdown of the percentage change in scores I have experienced\r\nDay 0 - 0% Baseline established\r\nDay 7 - 3% decrease from baseline in GMAT verbal, 2% increase in memory recall speed, 5% increase in memory efficiency\r\nDay 30 - 5% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 4% increase in memory recall speed, 10% increase in memory efficiency/accuracy\r\nDay 60 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 1% decrease in memory recall speed, 8% increase in memory recall efficiency\r\nDay 90 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 19% increase in memory recall speed, 14% increase in memory recall efficiency.\r\nGranted this is not a very good indication of what effects the drugs actually have, as I am just one person, and I have emotional, occupational, and other factors effecting my life, and hence, my test performance, but I thought that the data I collected may assist others considering a regimen of smart drugs. I will update things in a few more months.\n\n\n"
