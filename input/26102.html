I was with my boyfriend, my best guy friend, and another close friend of ours. All the guys took way more than I because they're experienced shroomers, but for me, it was my first time and decided to take a small dosage. It was 12:30 A.M. The taste was horrible, so I made myself a mushroom sandwich to camouflage the taste; it worked. <br><br>
About 15-20 minutes later, I started to feel a floaty-drunken sensation; almost unexplanable. I knew I was tripping because the room started changing COLORS. We were listening to 'A Perfect Circle,' which made me feel at great ease. The sound of Maynard's voice was amazing. I felt the pounding of his words, which would soon turn to color, and soon that room would be that color. For the most part, the room was green with hints of yellow, and soon, I felt a relation to nature and the music.<br><br>
As time went by, the drunken affect began to increase, and I hate being drunk, so soon I was worrying that I would get sick, but kept it to myself. At around 1:30 AM, we all walked over to the lake behind my best friends house and watched the sky and the trees around us. It was beautiful, but too silent. No one would speak at all, and my hearing was so powerful that silence sounded noisy. I felt so confused because I was with my four closest persons, yet I felt so alone. No laughter, no conversation, nothing. <br><br>
Later, I asked my boyfriend to walk me back to the house because I had a sudden urge to go to the bathroom. When I finished using the bathroom, it seemed almost as if my boyfriend and I both started peeking at the same time. As we left the house, we both described it as if we were walking out of a black cave. And once we got outside, there are no words to describe how I felt! I looked at everything. Every little house, and every little car, and every little plant and it all seemed so fake. I told my boyfriend this and he said he saw it, too. It all seemed so fake, as if it were just a movie setting. Everything looked so little and plastic, and perfect, I began thinking about life in general. Then I started thinking that this life is all fake and temporary, like a movie. I looked at the skies and I realized there is sooo much out there; so many other worlds, and dimensions, and I felt so small.<br><br>
The visuals were insane. The trees were expanding and the grass was moving in circular motions. All the lights of houses were passing me by as if I were on a ride. and then, I saw my best friends shirt. His shirt was amazing, the patterns on it were soo beautiful and vivid they were comming right at me! We all decided to go back to the house for A/C. But as we walked back, there was just so much movement and motion, and everything felt sooo fast I couldn't take it. I felt nausiated and threw up. I hated it because my friends were standing there watching me. I felt ashamed and I didn't want to ruin their trip, but they said it was ok. The dizziness decreased a little but the visuals were almost too intense.<br><br>
When we walked in, my best friend put on Radiohead, and I love Radiohead but I really didn't want to listen to them at that very moment. All I heard from Thom Yorke was crying and wailing and sobbing! I couldn't take it so I went outside and sat on the porch. I was by myself now and I couldn't stop thinking about it. All I told myself was, 'Go! you're tripping, enjoy it!' But the visuals were so strong, I closed my eyes. Whoa! bad idea! it was even worse like that. The patterns I'd see with my eyes closed, crazy shit. A lot of snakes and a lot of flowers and shapes. Whatever, I went back in and decided to just 'go with the flow,' and I did.<br><br>
So for four hours we all just laid in the couch, without a single word spoken, and enjoyed the rest of Radiohead, Bjork, and Pink Floyd live. The best was absolutely Bjork. That musik is made for tripping. By the end of Bjork, my trip started to wear off but everyone still seemed to be tripping intensely. The funny thing is, whenever I would step into the bathroom, I'd feel as if I were tripping hard again, and when I'd step out, it would go away. So for a long time, I just chilled in the bathroom watching vines grow from the bathroom walls. When I came out, our friend was balancing a stack of glass cups on his knee. How he did it? We still ponder about it till this day. So by the time 6 AM came by, my boyfriend and I came back to our place and went to the lake behind our home. It was such a beautiful experience I will never forget. I will be doing it again soon, alone with my boyfriend this time though, and a bit more dosage. I kinda like feeling insane.<!-- End Body -->
