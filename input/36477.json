 "report": "<p>I first tried Dexamphetamine after I went to my shrink convinced that I had ADHD. I started on a dose of 20mg a day divided in two doses, one in the morning and one dose in the afternoon. For the couple of months it was amazing. I could suddenly do all the things I hated to do. It was as simple as popping the pills and then actually wanting to do the things I hated such as studying, reading, chores- anything. </p><p>As I got used to the drug, so did my tolerance for it. I went up to 30 mg a day and eventually I was popping well over 20-5 mg tabs a day. I would just pop them like mad all during the day and be totally off my face. I am married and would end up bullshitting to my wife and go out all night doing stupid stuff spaced off my head. I lost so much weight and was wrecking my family life, but still my love for dexamphetamine would prevail. I love that feeling of being 'Dexied up' and would walk around sometimes in the city all day long just high of my head lying to my family about what Im doing. </p><p>Sometimes I would find a seat in the shopping centre and sit there for hours and hours spaced out. I would take them every day and then to sleep bomb myself with sleeping tablets, wake up and do it all over gain. I hated myself, but still couldn't resist my secret love. Many times I was so spaced out I would hear voices, see imaginary things etc coz I would go without proper sleep for so long and stay awake artificially. </p><p>I havent had any Dexamphetamine now for three months but I will always love them and be addicted to them. Sometimes I remember a few of the adventures I have had on this drug and it makes me smile. </p><p>I will always love dexamphetamine and I'm gonna try and control myself and try it again. I want the benefits without the consequences. In my mind I know I have more chance of screwing up then doing it right, but I will always have a secret place in my mind and heart for this drug.</p>"
