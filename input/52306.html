Some mushrooms may be as venomous and toxic as the most lethal substances on planet. Even people that know about them make mistakes so thats enough to take care with this. That was certainly not my case since Im writing this after my experience but certainly this was one of the most horrible experiences i have ever had in my life and I dont want to repeat it and would be great to alert other people about avoiding such stress and panic as I passed through.<br><br>
I was taking a weekend on some farm out of the city. Im currently living in south America. So after having a delicious lunch I took a walk. Sooner I found a vast amount of cows around and saw a great abundance of mushrooms on some dried dung. I remember i picked some, some years before so I looked at them observed and definitively thought those were psylocibes. So I took four of them just to have some fun for a while<br>
I boiled them and eat the caps throwed the rest and drank some most of the liquid and peacefully took a seat to wait for the effects but nothing happened.<br><br>
So after a couple of hours and the night approaching I started to become paranoid (no it wasnt a side effect) I started to think that I had commited a great mistake and had eaten the wrong onesso I was dying. First I tried to calm myself but sooner the stress become panic and the panic into terror and I started to cry like a dog so my friends noticed and I told emThen the big horrible phase started. They become freaked too and took the car and run out of the farm in the middle of the night like a bunch of freaks. They ran frenzy until we arrived hospital 2 hours later<br><br>
I had to tell the doctor that I had taken mushrooms and when she asked why I did something like that I just could say: I dont know. I felt the most stupid person in the world. And effectively I was! They took me blood tests, faecal tests, urine tests and had to wait for them. When everything went normal a couple of toxic experts had arrived and they explained me that even though there was no symptoms of poisoning in my system, it could develop in the course of 1 to 2 weeks<br><br>
I felt like I was dead. Everything started to seem to me so distant, like a farewell to the world and my life and all the things I loved so much. I felt very desperate and sad and stressed. My pressure increased at incredible high rate 160 and im just 26 year old! I was entered into the hospital and they continued the exams for a whole week. By then I was so exhausted, clynically stressed and out of hand that I had to stop my work, and just wait for my death.<br><br>
Fortunately at the end of the week the hospital certified my sanity after a huge payment and I went home very sick of stress. This was by far the most horrible experience of my life. I took an apparently edible specie of the region that oddly grows in dung too it was rusky roulette anyway I could have picked psilocybe coprophila that grows in dung too and could have ended very sick too I was lucky, the gods forgave my stupidity. And im still here.<!-- End Body -->
