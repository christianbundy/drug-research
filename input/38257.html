I have two cats.  Leo has a distended stomach that wobbles side to side when he trots towards me.  Domino is quite different - a white line marks his handsome black face and we are his hotel.  He takes his meals here, spends the odd nights, has an apperatif at the bar, that kind of thing.<br><br>
Recently I got them some catnip as a treat.  They are rather picky and will only accept the finest catnip - no crumbly shake in vacuum sealed containers from pet stores for them.  This catnip cost me $2.99 cdn for 50 g from a local health food store and it came in big dried leaves.  I suspect that when people don't get results with this herb it is because they are using sub-standard catnip.<br><br>
So I gave them the catnip.  Their reaction was very amusing.  They snorted the catnip and then started eating it.  And then they rolled in it.  It was clear that they were experiencing a state of kitty euphoria.  I watched and I wondered if I can experience something similar.  I was a drunk and a stoner throughout high school and university so those drugs no longer do anything for me but perhaps I could get something off this catnip.  What was there to lose?<br><br>
I rolled a big cannon.  I could barely lift the thing.  It almost didn't fit through the door.  I felt really conspicous taking hits from it out in the woods near my church but that's what I did.<br><br>
Wow.  I suppose I hadn't really expected something but something certainly happened.  I felt mellow, my body was infused with a sense of well-being, and, for the first time in a long time, I felt that everything was going to probably turn out ok.<br><br>
I have continued to use catnip.  It is not like pot.  Pot makes anything fun.  To enjoy catnip, I have to do something that I already enjoy.  I like it for short, quiet walks or lying on the recliner reading a trippy book.  Or listening to low-key music (but no crap).  If I do it around one of my annoying friends it will destroy the buzz.<!-- End Body -->
