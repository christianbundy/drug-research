Background: I've had many experiences with different phenethylamines and tryptamines, but I had never combined the two. I decided to experiment and mix 10 mg 2C-E, a phenethylamine, with 10 mg 4-AcO-DMT, a tryptamine, for a total of 20 mg. I had plenty of prior experience with these two substances, 2C-E in doses up to 25 mg, and 4-AcO-DMT up to 40 mg.<br><br>
When planning this little experiment, I wondered what the experience would be like. Tryptamines and phenethylamines have always brought me to distinctly different states of mind. I wondered if I would feel myself going down each of these two tracks simultaneously, or if I would experience it as one blended experience. I was pretty eager to try it out, and didn't expect it to be too strong with only 10 mg of each.<br><br>
Setting: Beautiful secluded lakeside trail, right around 1 PM, on a nice windy day. Setting is crucial to me. I find that while tripping in nature, everything in every direction is beautiful, and these positive vibes come into me through my sensory systems and help direct the psychedelic energy in a positive direction. I was accompanied by my girlfriend, who was not tripping but did smoke a bowl of cannabis with me, and who drove us home afterward. Her company was also key to making the experience good.<br><br>
T = 0:00 - Took one pill, which contained 5 mg 2C-E and 5 mg 4-AcO-DMT.<br><br>
T = 0:30 - Feeling nothing, took another pill, containing another 5 mg of each substance, giving a total of 10 mg 2C-E, 10 mg 4-AcO-DMT in my body.<br><br>
T = 0:45 - Effects kicking in, including a little stomach unrest, which for me is typical of 2C-E but could've been from both substances. Anxiety can be held in the stomach during psychedelic experiences. I try to be aware of any subconscious tightening of the stomach and build-up of anxiety. It's important to be self-aware and to let go of stress. We sat in front of a flowing stream and smoked a bowl of cannabis, which completely cured my stomach pains and potentiated the effects of the psychedelics. My vision gets brighter and everything is visually enhanced. I feel very mellowed out from the cannabis and enjoy good conversation with my girlfriend. My mind is taken up by philosophical thoughts and a sense of peace.<br><br>
T = 1:00 - We get up and walk down a trail towards the lake. I feel ecstatic, seeing more and more of the familiar phenethylamine swirls in my hands. At this point it's very visually active. I start seeing patterns emerge out of the freckles on my girlfriend's face, exactly the same as patterns seen previously on 4-AcO-DMT. The colors in a piece of wood stand out brightly while patterns grow into the wood like carvings, accompanied by general swirling/moving.<br><br>
T = 2:00 - At this point I start to really peak, without a doubt enjoying the scenery much more than I did before dosing. I do not feel the two substances separately, but as one blended experience. I've entered a state of expanded consciousness, a state I would prefer over 20 mg of either 2C-E or 4-AcO-DMT taken alone. The experiment is a success. A smile is stretched across my face, walking a little goofy, and a positive light is cast on everything I think about. My field of vision somehow seems broader and more panoramic. Multiple thought processes weave together in my mind and I put my shades on because my pupils are dilated. I feel very energized which is typical of the 2C-E. Usually I feel very drowzy under 4-AcO-DMT, but the combination was very elevating and energizing, although I did start yawning which happens to me often under 4-AcO-DMT. My mind is still racing with philosophical thoughts and I have a minor revelation about all the things that Mother Earth's diverse processes provide for us, including our very being.<br><br>
T = 3:30 - I stand at the top of an overlook, gazing out at the lake scenery. A predatory bird is flying above the scene. Strong winds are being channeled through the valley below, straight up to the overlook where I'm standing, and the energy is refreshing to my body. Snow-capped mountains are in the distance, and the moment seems perfect. I appreciate this place much more now than before.<br><br>
T = 4:00 - My girlfriend drives us home. Throughout the drive, I get hit with waves of unstoppable tryptamine giggles, the same as with prior 4-AcO-DMT experiences. My words start getting scattered and mixed. My impression is that the 4-AcO-DMT-like effects were stronger than what I would expect from 10 mg by itself, and the same for the 2C-E-like effects. Visuals are still going strong, and when we get home I start smoking cannabis again, which continues for the rest of the day.<br><br>
T = 5:00 - Pretty much down in most ways, but visuals are still going, and mind is still racing in an altered space. As I come down, the skin on my head feels a little tight. Eventually, after 4 bowls or so, cannabis no longer has an effect on me although I keep smoking it.<br><br>
T = 8:00 - After effects present, swirly open-eye visuals still present on the walls. I go to sleep, with some colorful closed-eye visuals reminiscent of both 2C-E and 4-AcO-DMT. I find it hard to fall asleep but eventually slip away.<br><br>
Next day: Feel a little grumpy and drained but overall pretty good. Feeling healthy. Smoking cannabis brings back colorful closed-eye visuals, some of them visions of little green plants.<br><br>
Conclusion: This combination is a winner. Even at this low dose, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I believe these compounds act synergistically, and I would prefer now to take 10 mg 2C-E with 10 mg 4-AcO-DMT than to take 20 mg of either one alone. When I repeat this, I will probably raise the doses to 15 mg of each, for 30 mg total, which I expect to be a lot stronger.<!-- End Body -->
