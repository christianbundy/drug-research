 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFrom: John Anderson <br>Newsgroups: alt.drugs <br>Subject: Galanga Injestion <br>Date: Nov 1993<br>> I eat galanga all the time. I was first introduced to it when I started <br>> getting into Thai cooking. Galanga (also called 'Laos') is used <br>> extensively as a spice throughout Tropical Asia. <br>> <br>> Forget the dried or powdered stuff, get fresh! It is available in Asian <br>> grocerys all over Dallas, so it can't be that hard to come by. It looks <br>> much like ginger with a translucent skin. It costs around 2.50 to 6.00 <br>> dollars a pound, and that goes a LONG way - it's potent! <br>> <br>> I often make a spicy chicken soup, and through in about 10 slices of the <br>> fresh stuff (the receipe calls for 5). It's DEFINITELY psychoactive! I <br>> experience quite a buzz within 10 minutes of finishing a bowl. I agree, <br>> it's somewhat like marijuana - but I really like it. I make the soup <br>> often for friends and all have experienced the buzz - some quite <br>> intensely.<br>Excellent, thanks for the tip. I had some last night in my rice, but I didn't use quite enough for the effects to be noticable. For me it takes about two heaped tablespoons to get the effect. (into a cup of rice) Unfortunately any more than this and it gets too strong to eat!<br>> If anyone's interested, I post the receipe (apart from the psychoactive <br>> properties it's quite delicious!)<br>Yes do that! I'm sure there would be heaps of interested parties, including myself \n<br>> One final note: I have found other interesting things in Asian grocery > stores, like betel nuts (including FRESH frozen ones at one store), > assorted inhalents, and bizzare bottled herb & vitamin drinks.<br>Inhalents?? interesting, I have noticed all the herb drinks but never thought much about them. Ever tried any?<br>The inhalents are not as exciting. They're all pungent smelling concoctions based on volatile oils like camphor or eucalyptus.<br>Like I said, I'll post the galanga soup reciepe as soon as I get a chance to dig it up. There's also a file on galanga at ftp.hmc.edu.<br>=========================================================================<br>From: Kenneth23 <br>Newsgroups: alt.drugs <br>Subject: Re: Galanga experiments <br>Date: Feb 1995<br>Well, I don't know about brands, but fresh galanga is absolutely DELICIOUS in south-east asian cooking! I once had a Thai friend make me a sort of white curry with chicken and galanga. There wasn't much -- mabye a few 4'x2' slices in the entire (large) curry pot, so I didn't get any sort of 'high.' The flavor, though, was fantastic when cooked, vaguely gingery, yet distinctly different.<br>=========================================================================<br>From: Bruce Dale <br>Newsgroups: alt.drugs,alt.psychoactives <br>Subject: Re: Galanga experiments <br>Date: Feb 1995<br>Gees yeah<br>I also was very inspired by the galanga.rpts @ hyperreal.com's archives [http://www.erowid.org/herbs/galangal/] and followed what the instructions on what appears to be 'a modern legend' - that is two teaspoons of dried galanga(l)/laos powder and felt zilch !!<br>Tried 4 teaspoons in orange juice 3 days later and still nothing. !!<br>Had much better luck with Guarana...<br>Might stick to the real stuff in future !!<br>=========================================================================<br>From: Tommy the Tourist <br>Newsgroups: alt.drugs,alt.psychoactives <br>Subject: Galanga -Forget it! <br>Date: Mar 1995<br>I posted a few weeks ago about my experiments with galanga. At that time I had tried both powder and dried roots with no psychoaactive effects whatsoever. Last night I found fresh roots at the local Middle Eastern grocery. I bought about 10oz of roots that slightly resembled small onions with tops. I trimmed off the green shoots saving 8 1-1.5' diameter roots about 2' long. Probably 8oz of solid roots total. I put them in a blender with 24oz of V8 juice and blended until smooth. The mixture wasn't quite as foul as the powder or the ground, dried root, but it was still pretty unpleasant. I waited 20 minutes between halves to let my stomach recover. No psychoactive effects within 3hrs so I went to bed. A minor case of the trots the next morning for all of my efforts. No more galanga for me.\n\n\n"
