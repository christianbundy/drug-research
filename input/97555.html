I was prescribed Xyrem (GHB) for narcolepsy about 6 months ago.  I had done G a few times recreationally before and knew I would like it.  At first I was prescribed the lowest dose, but I kept waking up so the doctor upped the dosage to the max.  I started taking it during the day as I felt it gave me energy.  I was detoxing from Suboxone at the time as well and the GHB took the edge off and the chills away.<br><br>
I was taking 50 grams of Xyrem per day and the last 1 month shipment lasted me a week.  So here I am, detoxing from a really nasty drug.  I couldn't sleep the first night and I had massive tremors the first two days, anxiety through the roof.<br><br>
T0.0  My psych prescribed me Gabapentin as I am a recovering addict.  I was in full WD from the G when I took my first dose (900mg).  I went home and started reading about people taking handfuls to feel anything so I thought I'd do the same.<br><br>
T0.5  I took 6 more pills (1800mg) and relaxed as much as I could, the GHB withdrawals were still full force.<br><br>
T1.5. I still have tremors but they aren't causing my anxiety to spike, feel more relaxed but heavy as I try to get up.  I eat dinner (steak).<br><br>
T2.5. I fell great, still shaking but not like I was before.  I feel it peak very strong for t off about 10 minutes.  As intense as exstacy but didn't last nearly as long.<br><br>
T4.0. Had to drive and it was difficult but manageable.  Still feel high, kind of uncomfortable but a welcome feeling none the less. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> <br><br>
T5.5. Played a video game, was on pc for a bit.  Starting to feel the effects wear off but am happy, comfortable and tired which is nice.  Before lying down I took 2 more (600mg) and feel very good.<br><br>
I wouldn't have been able to get off Xyrem without Gabapentin.  I could see it helping opiate WDs as well.  I just hope this one isn't going to be as painful to quit.<!-- End Body -->
