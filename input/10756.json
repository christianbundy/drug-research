 "report": "<p>One day after a shithouse day at school, I decided a few cones of salvia would do good. I had aboot 7 or 8 packed ones, then went inside once I could start feeling the effects coming on. I went to my room, turned out the lights and layed there with the UV light on.</p><p>I closed my eyes and started to see the usual little patterns emerging in my eyes, then all of a sudden, it all hit me. It felt as if the bed dropped from underneath me and I started falling at an increasing speed. I decided to go with the feelings for a while, then opened my eyes... there was an Egyptian tomb sitting in the middle of my room, which was kinda cool.</p><p>I closed my eyes again and heard someone running past my door. I opened my eyes and this kid named 'Kit' (someone how I knew his name, but he never said it) was standing there smiling. In a thick pommy accent, he said :</p><p>'Snip yer knitter ay laddie?' (chop your dick off)</p><p>And ran off. I couldn't help but laugh... I just sat there, still feeling like I was falling, until I fell asleep.</p><p>I love salvia.</p>"
