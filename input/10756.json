 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nOne day after a shithouse day at school, I decided a few cones of salvia would do good. I had aboot 7 or 8 packed ones, then went inside once I could start feeling the effects coming on. I went to my room, turned out the lights and layed there with the UV light on.\r\nI closed my eyes and started to see the usual little patterns emerging in my eyes, then all of a sudden, it all hit me. It felt as if the bed dropped from underneath me and I started falling at an increasing speed. I decided to go with the feelings for a while, then opened my eyes... there was an Egyptian tomb sitting in the middle of my room, which was kinda cool.\r\nI closed my eyes again and heard someone running past my door. I opened my eyes and this kid named 'Kit' (someone how I knew his name, but he never said it) was standing there smiling. In a thick pommy accent, he said :\r\n'Snip yer knitter ay laddie?' (chop your dick off)\r\nAnd ran off. I couldn't help but laugh... I just sat there, still feeling like I was falling, until I fell asleep.\r\nI love salvia.\n\n\n"
