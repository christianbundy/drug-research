I have been a smoker now for 2 years, and I can't stop thinking about how stupid it was to start. My first pack was great, but I couldn't smoke more than 5 per day.  Now I can't smoke less than 10. <br><br>
The first couple packs were great. I would go out back of my highschool with my friend that introduced me to cigarettes (damn him) and we'd light up.  The buzz was great before class. Soon enough, 1 cigarette wasn't giving me that buzz anymore, and I would have 2. Sure enough I was becoming addicted.  <br><br>
About 6 months after I had started, I woke up one night coughing and wheezing. I knew it was from the cigarettes (or all the weed) so I decided NO MORE. and threw out my half pack. The first day was fine, but on the second I began to feel the effects of withdrawl. A horrible paniky feeling and an extreme urge to smoke. Sure enough, I started smoking again.  Since then I have made many unsuccessful attempts at quitting, but to no avail.  I now wake up every morning, hating myself for what I was about to do, then lighting up that first one of the day.<br><br>
This shit is so hard to quit, and I don't even know why.  I want to quit, but some part of me needs the nicotine.<!-- End Body -->
