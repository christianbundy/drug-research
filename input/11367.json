 "report": "<p>One day my buddy A calls me up and asks if I want to go smoke some opium in some weed with him.  I agree, but I figure something is up and am very much expecting him to have red rock opium, which I had been pretty sure of as being dragon's blood incense or whatever for a long time.  We smoke a normal joint on the way to our friends' house, and when he isn't there we just sit in his driveway and A begins to roll the opium joint.  He opens the tin and sure enough, it's a big rock of incense-smelling crystal.  Not at all what opium is supposed to look like.  </p><p>I try to tell him that it isn't opium, but he just says that it's synthetic and some other bullshit the dealer must have fed him.  I guess he paid 20$ for a gram, which is shitty because I guess the shit retails for 3$ an ounce.  Damn.  I had come down completely from the first joint and decided to see once and for all if that was opium or anything remotely similar, by, as I usually do, being a dumbass and just going for it.  I wasn't gonna let my friend go into it alone despite the fact that I knew better.  </p><p>The taste was bad, but nothing awful.  But the high was nonexistent, and if anything, the red rock crap killed most of what I would have gotten from the weed.  It took forever to burn and after that A was convinced that this shit was 100% bogus.  There is no doubt in my mind that red rock opium is totally bullshit, and that the only real opium is a black tar.  No such thing going around as synthetic, that's for sure.  I'm willing to try real opium sometime, but the fact that this crap is circulating makes that even harder.  Oh well.  Peace.</p>"
