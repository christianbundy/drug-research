I have been using weed almost daily for the last year or so to deal with OCD, moderate anxiety and insomnia. Several weeks ago I was prescribed Fluoxetine HCL 10mg x2 daily (generic for Prozac) for these symptoms. This has moderately altered my experience with cannabis, which I will detail below.<br><br>
Typical dose: About .8g of mid grade weed, made into hash oil, then baked into brownies.<br><br>
Before Prozac I would get slightly intoxicated, slightly unmotivated and extremely tired at this dose. Moderate visual scrolling, moderate euphoria, time sense altered. Since I was depressed, I would get an intense shot of emotions ranging from paranoia to empathy to increased appreciation of things. Sometimes at higher doses I could get closed-eye visuals (kaleidoscope vision).<br><br>
After Prozac I get moderately intoxicated, very unmotivated and only slightly tired. Visual scrolling, time dilation, closed-eye visuals and other psychedelic effects are greatly reduced. Almost no increase in emotions, and little euphoria. There's a new effect in that I feel pressure in my head. I feel as if it's made me stoned and stupid rather than high and mind expanding. There also seems to be more hangover (bad short-term memory, lethargy, lack of motivation) than before.<br><br>
I don't smoke it often, but the one time I've tried so far it has had less effect than before.<br><br>
Although the difference isn't HUGE, the lack of increased emotions along with the help that Prozac provides me has encouraged me to quit eating pot brownies on a regular basis. Prior to this I had never had trouble when withdrawn from THC, but from 3-5 days after discontinuing use I feel mentally distressed. Every time I return to it to finish off my stash I go through this withdrawal again, even if I only use it once. I think after this is gone I will stop for good, except possibly on rare occasions.<!-- End Body -->
