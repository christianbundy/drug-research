Having finished up my batch of 5meoDiPT, I was eager to try some of the other research chemicals available.  I procured some AMT and massed out two veggiecaps full of the somewhat chunky white powder.  One came in at 50mg and the other at 60mg, so I dosed the 50mg along with extra Vitamin C and a 120mg psuedoephedrine pill to clear up my runny nose.  I was careful to keep detailed notes, so here they are:<br><br>
4:25pm: Dosed ~50mg AMT along with vitamin C and psuedoephedrine, to trick my palate and for my nose.  Pretty empty stomach, ate three hours earlier but only lightly.  Another 60mg dose is waiting in the wings, if, after exactly 2 hours, this dose doesn't kick in.<br><br>
5:23: no nausea, but no effects either.<br><br>
5:48: Welcome nausea... manageable- noticing something<br><br>
5:57: Stuff is moving!<br><br>
6:10: getting started, pupils have become dilated<br><br>
6:20: two hours out and just getting started, so I'll save the other cap for another day.  Plus I have lots of nausea right now.  Pretty good effects so far.<br>
Ceiling is breathing, so that's a good sign :)<br>
Time for some nitrous... Pretty good!<br><br>
6:36: More nitrous- that last whippet was great!  Still nausea tho, bleh.  <br><br>
7:00: Euphoria!  A huge rush!  A nice clean feeling, not 'sloppy' feeling like Foxy.  Hard to ponder the differences right now though, eh...<br><br>
7:27: Pretty groovy!  Nice effects.  Glad I didn't re-dose, I need to get a feel as to how long this stuff lasts.  7:50: Still going strong, not overwhelming.<br><br>
8:24: Still nice and thick- I guess I could've done DXM tonight, but at least I'm cognizant for it all!  <br><br>
9:04: Teeth gritting, so I'm taking an ibuprofen<br><br>
10:49: Did all the whippets, oh well.  Still going pretty strong, headache though.<br><br>
11:12: Take melatonin and kava kava pills, gotta get to sleep after all- heh, or try<br><br>
12:43: Heh, my pupils are huge.  Take one generic Alka-Seltzer tab because that usually gets me sleepy in about 20 minutes.<br><br>
Well, and that's all I wrote.  Overall it was a great first time run with AMT.  I didn't quite believe all the hype I'd heard about it, but now I know it's true.  I didn't do anything crazy and I had some nice deep introspection about 6-7 hours into the trip, with only very mild paranoia at one point.  Nice to see that my pupils were dilated, that hasn't happened in a long time.  <br><br>
The only negative things I can report are being very tired right now, about 31 hours after the dosing, because I didn't fall asleep as planned.  In fact, even though I took a lot of OTC sleeping aides, I tossed and turned for quite a while, although I'm glad I got *some* sleep.  Even though I tried my best to keep from gritting my teeth, I seem to have done that as well because a few of my molars ache right now.  I'm considering buying a professional mouth guard like the ones boxers use; I feel it'd be more efficient and plus I don't want to look like a raver :)<br><br>
Also I didn't eat anything since about 1pm yesterday, but I don't feel overly starved.  I did eat one energy bar before leaving today.  This was a great first experience, and I would highly reccomend this substance to anyone looking for a good legal acid alternative.  I experienced no overall body load other than the lingering nausea, with no aches or cramps like from Foxy.  <br><br>
The nitrous oxide was a good component of the trip, but it served a purely supplemental role.  I've had many really in-depth nitrous and Foxy experiences, but with AMT it was just like doing nitrous while otherwise sober; there were noticable effects but it didn't really potentiate the overall trip for more than a minute at most.  <br><br>
Overall the euphoria aspect of the AMT makes it a great substance, I was able to take a satirical view of myself and my life without being too harsh on myself and on others.  Plus, I had a bit of narcissism at one point, I couldn't stop looking at myself in the mirror.  This was a very positive experience, and in the future I look forward to taking the 60mg cap and eventually working my way up to a 100mg dose, which seems to be the peak of normal dosing among my peers.<!-- End Body -->
