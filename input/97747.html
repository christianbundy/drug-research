I have tried methylone twice before (103 oral, 110 intranasal) before trying 147 oral, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br><br>
0:00  I orally ingested 147mg methylone mixed in water with KoolAid.<br><br>
0:10  Come up effects begin with out fail.  In other experiences I noticed the timeliness of this drug is impressive.  I feel light and bouncy, and as if I have a reserve of energy that I can choose to expend or not depending on my situation.  I feel sober even though it is obvious that I am on a substance.<br><br>
0:30  I am interested in any topic that is presented, and I continuously ask questions because of this.  Conversation is easy and natural, and I experience joy by simply listening to my friend talk about something he is interested in.  Focusing is not difficult, and complex thinking can be performed same as in sobriety.<br><br>
0:50  I feel a sudden drop in my energy like the feeling of a stopping car.  I am still enjoying conversation, but I do not ask questions or talk as quickly as before.  At this point I am enjoying talking and chilling, while before I wanted to talk and know as much as possible.  My drive to talk on this drug is out of interest, not out of stimulation.<br><br>
1:10  I work on homework as I continue to converse with my friends.  It is easy and enjoyable to do homework (genetics) which is surprising to me, and I do not get too distracted from my friends. I feel comfortable talking about any topic, and open to discuss personal ideas and problems.<br><br>
There were light after effects the next day, consisting of having a good day.<br><br>
While on this drug I termed it to myself as the 'Good Day Drug' because its effect is a concentration of how I feel when I am having a very good day.<!-- End Body -->
