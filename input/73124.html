I found myself temporarily exhausted from my commonly researched drugs and decided I would do some reading on the so called smart drugs or nootropics. Due to the lack of information one researching these drugs can face, it can become hard to make sound conclusions about making a first purchase of one of these products. To help with this information ambiguity I became interested in adding to this section of drug experience literature, not to mention I and most other people could use a little boost to their memory.<br><br>
My first and only purchase so far was some aniracetam. I chose aniracetam as my choice racetam analog to purchase after some research. I decided to purchase aniracetam which is reportedly longer lasting and widely available on the web for as cheap as 30$ for 100g. The recommended serving size is 1.5g a day making for a total of 67 standard doses in a 100g bottle.<br><br>
For the first 3 days I poured 2g of the fluffy white, glistening, nearly tasteless, slightly bitter powder into my mouth, aiding the swallowing process by chasing with a flavoured drink. At no point during these three days could I notice even a hint of mental or physical alteration, positive or negative. The next four days I continued the dosing procedure but with 3g and with the same results, nada. The next week determined to feel anything from this smart drug I up the dose again to a large 4g sample for 7 straight days. What did I feel? You guessed it, NOTHING! It is now the 15th day of the aniracetam regimen and still not feeling any results, with one last token of hope I heap a staggering 10g into my mouth swallowing every last bit one hour before commencing this article. WOWwait, ummm, hmmm, yes, oh wait, no, still can't feel S**T.<br><br>
If you look on the bright side at least there is no side effects or effects for that matter, so if your into wasting you money aniracetam is a good choice. It is important to note that the aniracetam was taken with meals and without meals in order to rid my curiosity of whether prior food consumption is a variable on the drugs absorption and effects. I also tested the variable of dosing size, and with the same result, no dose even up to 10g produces a noticeable effect on me. Maybe the drug needs to be taken for longer periods of time to become effective. I seriously doubt it will start working but I will continue to eat the powder like a meal until the bottle is empty, hopefully then I will feel a speck of something.<br><br>
Despite this one set back I will not hinder to try another nootropic drug. Hopefully in my quest to find an effective smart drug I find an affordable option. The next drug I am planning on purchasing is the MAOI-B Deprenyl (selegiline). I truly hope deprenyl or any other nootrpic can be held high up on a pedestal like the claims behind aniraetam, or at least be good enough to put in my medicine cabinet.<!-- End Body -->
