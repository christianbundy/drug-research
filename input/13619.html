Introduction<br><br>
Last night, I had quite a time.  After much research I decided to take LSA (via Morning Glory extract) in combination with Syrian Rue.  I had also intended to try Salvia Divinorum in combination but had such a time tripping on the LSA, and Rue that I was both incapable, and it slipped my mind.  I believe that now would be a good time to review my history with psychadelics, and a few of the life experiences which impacted this experience. <br><br>
I've tried LSD, Psylicybin Mushrooms, Salvia Divinorum, and now LSA, and Syrian Rue.  Also, as for other psychoactive substances these include: Alcohol, Marijuana, Cocaine, Ketamine, Nutmeg, Tobacco, Catnip teas, and a plethora of pharmasuticles (Codiene, Oxycodone, Demerol, Alaprozam, Morphine, muscle relaxers, and anti-psychotics) as well as Herbal Ecstasy (which I belive is primarily constituted of an herb known as ephedra).  Furthermore, I've experimented with Ecstasy which may have contained MDMA, MDA, MDE, PCP, 5-MEO-DIPT, and amphetamines.  Moreover, I've taken DXM via cough medicines.  Most of my experiences with substances other than LSD have been plesant save for Cocaine which creates such unfavorable social situations basesed on greed, money, and drugs.  I've had truly horrid times on LSD, but in retrospect wouldn't trade them for the world.<br><br>
I suffer from depression, and often have thoughts of suicide.  As may have been concluded, I am also an abuser of substances, and recent therapy sessions have led me to belive that I am dependant on alcohol, marijuana, and pharmacuticals.  My mother is an alcoholic as is hers, and as was my great grandfather, and faternal grandfather.  I was introduced to drugs at a very young age (I first smoked pot when I was eight), and have led a life which has forced me to grow up very quickly.<br><br>
LSA Extraction<br><br>
I began this experience three weeks ago with a trip to a garden supply store where I purchased 25 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds (Ipomoea Violocea), and some Naptha.  When I returned home I ground the seeds to flour with a coffee grinder, and placed them into a jar.  The jar was then filled to half of its capacity with Naptha, sealed, and agitated.  The solution was allowed to marinate in the jar for three days being agitated frequently.  A funnel was then set up with a coffe filter in it, and the solution was poured through into a second jar.<br><br>
The solute (seed flour) was saved, and the solvent (Naptha) was discarded.  The seed flour was spread evenly over a glass baking dish, and allowed to sit for three days with a fan blowing over top of it to ensure all Naptha was evaporated (I had a past experience where someone decided to forgo this step, and Naptha was a constitute of the final product, and I'm sure my stomache suffered serious irreversable damage).<br><br>
The seed flour was then placed into a jar, and the jar covered halfway with 100 proof (50% alcohol) vodka.  This solution was allowed to sit for three days being agitated frequently.  The alcohol-seed flour solution was poured throgh the same forementioned funnel-filter set up, and poured into another jar, and the solvent (alcohol with LSA) was kept, and the solute (spent seed mush) was discarded.  The alcohol-LSA solution was then poured into another glass baking dish, and allowed to evaporate over a three day period with a fan blowing across the dish.<br><br>
After the alcohol was evaporated I was left with my paydirt which existed as a gummy film at the bottom of the dish.  I used a razor blade to scrape this gum from the dish, and it was allowed to harden into a black  gummy rock.  I considered taking the extraction further; however, I do not fully understand the acidification, basification process.<br><br>
Experience Report<br><br>
I decided my experience should be conducted in a safe enviorment with a small group of close friends.  Therefore, I chose my home of 6 years where I live with my mother; however, I asked her to leave the residence for the evening, and she complied.  My friend J was the only person who dosed the LSA, and Syrian Rue with me, and was my only companion for the majority of my trip.  In retrospect I wished I'd have had a trip sitter for the entire experience.  My medication (an SSRI -- Celexa) was discontinued for three weeks to avoid an SSRI-MAOI interaction, and all dietary instructions were followed to avoid a Tyramine-MAOI interaction.  I kept notes on the trip best I could, and these shall appear in brackets with commentary.  The LSA, and Rue were placed into gelcaps.  The extract fit nicley into three caps, and the 5 grams of Rue took 15 caps. <br><br>
[4:30p:  Ingested ~2.5g LSA extract, &amp; ~5g Syrian Rue]<br><br>
My handwriting (it's awful) is as good as it gets here, and my stomache was unsettled as I had just eaten 17 pills in succession on a nearly empty stomach (I had eaten a bowl of rice a half hour prior after fasting all day to ease nausea).  J mimicked me here in every way dosing in a similar fashion.  J reported having no nausea what so ever; however, I was lying on the couch clutching my stomache in 15 minuites.<br><br>
[5:00p:  Ingested 4 gelcaps Ginger for nausea]<br><br>
This was done without weighing the ginger.  J too ate 4 caps containg Ginger<br><br>
[5:15p:  Slight headache, &amp; nausea felt]<br><br>
My handwriting here is starting to become more erradic<br><br>
[5:30p:  Smoked some pot to ebb nausea.  I'm trippin.]<br><br>
I remember this as being the first enjoyable portion of the trip, as the pot greatly reduced the turmoil in my stomache.  Also, the page after this is a bunch of scribbles I made with my pen, and I belive this is evidence of my state.  In retrospect my research was slightly off here as I hadn't planned on leaving baseline for another half hour or so.<br><br>
[5:45p:  Trailors have evolved. &amp; colors have gained that beautiful glow.  MJ ebbed nausea, but I'm still going to vomit I can tell.  It's just a ? of when.<br><br>
At this point I was starting to have fun, but expected this to soon pass as I had intended this to be a spiritual learning experience rather than a recreational one.  J still reported no nausea, and he was looking at the celing, and carpet describing how some of the patterns resembled faces, and clouds, and waves.  My handwritting at this point had become very erradic, and the words flow all over the page rather than in any form of order.<br><br>
[6:30p:  I'm most definatly TRIPPIN!  Nausea is ghost thanx to dad blazing some more weed w/.]<br><br>
The handwriting here has become awful, and I remember my pupils had dialated fully at this point.  My father also gave my three joints for my grades (ironic huh), and I went up to my room, and turned on some Bad Boy Bill (house music).  Shortly after turning on the music  J and I cracked our glow sticks, and started dancing.  At this point my dad left.  I was suprised I could get up and dance as I was nautious as hell several minuites ago.<br><br>
[7:00p:  Ceiling is starting to undulate]<br><br>
At this point I remember looking at clouds in the celeing, and I was sooo happy my stomache felt better.  I cannot recall what J was doing at this point, and my hand writing here is a nearly illegable scribble.<br><br>
[7:48p:  Things are starting to get bad but it's OK.  I will be OK.  It's just the drug.  In several hours everything will be OK.  I love life, &amp; I do feel better.  I love God, &amp; am (there is an indistinguishable vertical scribble here).  You'll be OK (my name).  It's not that bad.  You've had worse.  It's not the Rue.  You researched &amp; researched &amp; followed everything I was while still.  I forgot what I was writting.  I love god, &amp; when it's my time I'll be ready .  Thank you God.  Thank you Jesus.  I love my mother soooo much.  If you ever read this I love you.]<br><br>
I ended my notes here, as the last passage was written on the bathroom floor while I was violently vomiting.  The passage probably took about 30 minutes to write in between heaves.  Mv vomit, and spittle morphed, and undulated intensively, and the spit looked like little angels with trumpets dancing about.  There were twelve angels, and in my mind the represented the 12 apostles.  I continuously drank water as I vomited to stay hydrated as thoughts of death filled my mind, and I became weak and delerious.<br><br>
I remember thinking if I had too much Tyramine in my stomache, or if I hadn't discontinued my medication for long enough.  The following events are blurry.  I took a pot into the room where J was, breaking a glass on the way.  I layed on the floor, and had J call people to get someone over here who wasn't tripping.  I told J not to let me call a hospital as I feared I was entering a hypertensive crisis, or serotonin syndrome.  I also told J to keep remindindg me I was OK, and he did a stellar job.<br><br>
I had to turn the TV off because it was messing with me hard.  After about two hours some friends came over, and we blazed joint after joint (probably a total of 5 or 6).  This ended my nausea much; however, I was worn out from the violent puking, and was beging to feel totaly exhausted.  I was so glad we had trip sitters who J, and I were good friends with.  I felt so empathetic with everyone, and felt huge waves of love just filling the room.<br><br>
My 'near death experience' (I was only thinking about death in my mind) had put things into perspective.  I wanted to live, and realized how suicide would affect my loved ones.  I realized how much of an ass I had been to some lately.  The experience was most definatly a positive even though I vomitted severely for a good 2-3 hours.  It was almost as if the vomitting was a form of spiritual cleansing.<br><br>
Around Midnight I went to sleep, as J said he would be OK by himself.  J never was ill, and tripped harder than I did, as he never vomitted.  I wonder if my weak stomache wasn't from my past experience where I essentially drank petroleum ether.  <br><br>
In conclusion this experience was a sucsess.  I now feel much more in tune with God, and the universe.  However, the experience was also difficult, and I believe this is due to the Syrian Rue, and not the LSA.  I do not think I will try Rue for some time agian, as it is most definatly a tool, and not a recreational substance.  I do however plan on trying the LSA extract soon only in larger doses (perhaps 5 grams, and no Rue).  I belive my next Rue experience will be in it's classic combination with oral DMT.  <br><br>
[Side Note:  I'd say overall I consumed ~8g MJ]<br><br>
