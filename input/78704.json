 "report": "<p>Several years back during a lengthy stint of DXM abuse and legal woes, after a period of incarceration I acquired a 30g bottle of DXM. After much use and sale (whilst on adult probation in NH) one night I ingested a normal (for myself) dose of self capsulated DXM and after a sleepless night of pure pleasure (well after the trade mark hour of nausea) found myself at my weekly probation date with my bodybuilder P.O. Got a piss test, and some time later (cannot recall if it was same day or next week when I returned) was asked about PCP usage, saying that test was positive, however that he had not seen PCP usage in this area in many years, so naturally in order to dispell any potential violation of probation told him that I drank a bunch of couch syrup. I was then warned heavily as to future use as this story was believable because once on probation was jailed for shoplifting coricidin. So in conclusion high level doses WILL in fact cause false positives the morning after, although I am certaintly not sure what test they used.</p>"
