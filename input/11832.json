 "report": "<p>I wont lie I have smoked serious amounts of ganja in the last 15 months probably about 20 or 30 ounces but the experience I had last night has put me off that shit for life. The day started normally I phoned my friend E and we bought some cigarettes and a 10s of skunk, went back to his house and smoked a joint. I was really stoned after that felt fairly anxious and nauseous something which has got gradually worse over the time Ive been smoking puff. Anyway we smoke another joint later on and I dont feel so buzzing so I figured it would be cool to smoke a fat joint and fly off into my own world something I usually do on Saturday nights so we smoke the joint and then bang! I was totally out of it. </p><p>Ive been really stoned before and have never been sick, Ive smoked a half ounce to myself in a night and felt fine, but this buzz was different. I became gradually more disorientated, nauseated and paranoid. I kept saying where the fuck am I? and help me. I couldnt breathe and had a panic attack. This is when I knew my relationship with cannabis was very much over. The buzz became very psychedelic and as I was feeling sick and dizzy this just made it worse I felt very trapped. I looked at a window and the world turned upside down, and stayed that way. I managed to stumble to the toilet and vomited, very painfully and noisily waking Es mother who questioned me why I was feeling sick I managed to mumble something about eating too much. I return to Es bedroom and continued to feel very sick and disorientated for another 2 hours or so and had some mad visuals, I thought I was going mad. </p><p>When I woke up this morning I felt fine and thought I had just smoked too much too quick so stupidly decided to smoke another joint, I felt those feelings of insanity return and decided that this was it, Ive had good times and bad with puff but why bother getting high and spending money just to feel insane!</p>"
