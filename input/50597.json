 "report": "\n\n\n\n[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]\r\nUp until this event I was a coke addict. My usual dealer wasn't answering his phone so I called a new guy who said was out of cocaine and offered me and my 'girlfriend' some crystal meth. Of course we we're simply dying to get high and although I thought about it and was somewhat uncomfortable with trying something new I agreed when he told us he'd give us the first gram for free and even told us how much to use (according to how much cocaine we normally would sniff over 2-3 days, to cut it down by 75% because he said this stuff was much stronger) Well. We didn't listen, about 2 hrs after he gave us the first gram we called for more, this stuff was intense!! \r\nI felt great, kinda like I did when I did lines of cocaine but sooo much better, I didn't get my usual restless feeling where I couldn't stand a song for more than 30 sec or the paranoid feeling where I thought every car behind me was a cop car. (I had been doing coke much too long and too often and my good buzzes we're long gone) I felt absolutely amazing, full of energy, happy, every song on the radio was my favorite and my girlfriend and I just wanted to drive around talking and laughing, bouncing around to our 'favorite' song. And when cocaine would usually entrape us in my car for 3 days in a row without wanting to face anyone, we already knew this drug was a party drug and actually wanted to stop people on the street to talk or go for a drive with us. THIS stuff was good, so we got 3 more grams (despite the dealer telling us that was WAY too much for 2 people) and called it the start of a weekend!\r\nI was really high on this stuff and don't remember too much but I do remember going back to my 'old' appartment which I had moved out of that same month and only had 2 weeks left there so the eletricty was cut off and there was no furniture left but in order to escape my live-in boyfriend and his questions, we settled in with candles and a mini portable radio\r\nWe called around and invited 2 guys over to party for the first night, drove around all day and night the following day (just the 2 of us), we didn't leave the car much, we we're just so damn happy and in the moment. We finally decided to go back to my appartment when my eyes we're bugging out on me and I couldn't see the street lights and stuff properly (stupid I know) \r\nThat night (2nd night)I started feeling paranoid, I spent all night looking out the window thinking every car or footstep was someone after us, I then start feeling anxious and had some difficulty breathing but nevertheless we kept going. By morning I was completely stoned, beyond recognition. We retired to the floor, laying there talking when I noticed my breathing was getting crazy, I couldn't take deep breaths. My shoulders started to throb and my arms felt numb but I didn't want to freak my girlfriend out so instead of saying anything I asked her to go for a walk with me, the entire time I had shooting pains in my arms and shoulders, my lungs hurt every time I took a breath and my throat felt like it was closing in on me. I was freaked out! \r\nI confessed to her that I wasn't feeling right and needed to go home. We drove back to my my place and I told my bf about what I did and how I felt. He told me to have a shower and lay down so I did. The entire time my body was feeling really odd, everything felt numb and tingly and I couldn't explain it but I thought something was seriously wrong!\r\nWhen I was in the shower I noticed that my knees we're looking a bit blue but since my vision was so altered I ignored it. BIG mistake!\r\nMy bf helped me into bed and I laid there alone for about 5 min while he talked to my girlfriend about how much I did etc because at this point I was convinced I was overdosing. While I was laying there I got a sharp pain from the tip of my middle finger up to my elbow in my right arm...It was the strangest feeling ever. I was crying and scared so I called my bf to the room, by then, my arm was turning white and tingled, my fingers we're wrinkly and also very white so I told him I needed to go to the hospital.\r\nOn the way there my arms and legs got REALLY numb, I kept trying to shake it off to get my circulation going but it wouldn't work, about 5 min into the drive my hand turned blue, it was the freakiest thing I ever saw and it only lasted about 30 sec but my bf also saw it and started to panick. I told him I was dying, that I knew it and I was sorry, I started telling him my final wishes as both my arms and hands we're now completely blue...This was it I was dying! \r\nSo many things crossed through my mind, not only was I high as a friggin kite but I was gonna die before I made it to the hospital. All I remember after that was everyone yelling in the emergency room, yelling at the nurse to hurry up, that I was overdosing and needed immediate help, everyone was looking at me funny and someone asked me what was happening to me, I told him I had no circulation in my body anymore, I was crying.\r\nThey immediately stripped me down and put heating blankets all over me because my body was freezing, I was hooked up to a bunch of monitors and had about 10 nurses and doctors around me. I remember at one point there we're 3 doctors discussing my situation and one of them called another hospital, he was saying he had never seen anything like this and asked what he should us as as a poison control or something like that then I heard him say, 'you think she needs a bipass??' and hung up and left the room with the other doctors. They returned what felt like hours later to say that they had to give me something (can't remember what or why) and would wait to see if it worked before attempting to open me up. \r\nI was convinced I was dying, all I could hear was monitors and people talking loudly. I kept asking the nurse if I was gonna die and she had tears in her eyes, all she would say is 'I don't know' She looked at my heartbeat on the screen and rushed to talked to a doctor, I was told my heart beat was very irregular and my blood pressure was not looking too good (I can't remember the exact words to anything but my bf told me some stuff later too)\r\nMy entire body was still blue and freezing and no matter how many blankets or heat they applied, it wasn't working. I was told my system was shutting down but my heart was still beating, what that means I still don't know. A doctor told me I could lose my limbs, all of them, if my circulation didn't start back up.\r\nI spent the next few hours (minutes!?) praying, praying to be given another chance and that I would never touch drugs again.\r\nI was given something to make me pass out 'relax me' and was wheeled into intensive care, all I remember after this was having my blood taken once because it hurt like hell, I later found a bruise the size of my arm there. \r\nI was in intensive care for 3 days, highly drugged up with my bf at my side every single waking moment. He later confessed to me that he didn't think I would make it, after all, the doctors told him it wasn't looking too good, I can't imagine what he had to go through because of me.\r\nI still don't know for sure what happened to me because when I was released I was still drugged up and couldn't ask questions and I don't remember any of the doctors that took care of me, I choose to forget it all, it has been 1 yr and a few days since this episode and I am now engaged to my bf and have a newborn baby, needless to say I never touched drugs after this event and don't plan on it.\n\n\n"
