 "report": "<p>I have had a bottle of melatonin for a while and use it occasionally.  I only take it when I know I won't be able to get to sleep, and I have to get up early in the morning.  I am really affected by a lack of sleep, so getting a good night's rest is important to me.  What I do is take 2 mg of melatonin (which makes my body think its time to sleep) and some over the counter sleep aid (Unisom, which makes me so drowsy I fall asleep).  </p><p>The two work good for me in combination.  In the morning melatonin can leave me slightly drowsy, but its no big deal.  Unisom though, is annoying and I always feel drowsy from it.  I often try different combinations, and the one mentioned here is my favorite.  Though it may not sound like much, oversleeping with this combo, then drinking a big cup of coffee to reach equilibrium is something I find very interesting.  Almost high like.  I feel so warm and snuggly, quiet, awake, and mentally sharp.  Very mentally sharp.</p>"
