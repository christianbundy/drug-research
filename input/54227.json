 "report": "\n\n\n\n[Erowid Note: 5 grams of caffiene is considered an extremely high dose, see Caffeine Dose Chart] <br>I've never known such energy, such raw power. I got more accomplished then I ever thought possible, I managed to get all my yardwork done, wrote out some poetry, ran to the mailbox down the road.<br>I called up my friend and they asked me to slow down because I was talking a mile a minute, but to me it seemed normal, if he had dosed 5000mg would he be able to understand me? Imagine a nightly newscast that normally takes 60 minutes only taking 10, heh.<br>I'm not saying that caffeine is a godsend or any such thing, and I'm being repeatedly told how unhealthy the dosage I took was, but hot damn I've never ever felt so good, so confident. No paranoia at all, which I experience to frightening levels if I smoke marijuana.<br>Well that's it for me.\n\n\n"
