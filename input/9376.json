 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon visiting this site for the first time and reading other reports i became curious as to the truth to this matter.  Any previous experiences i have had with smoking mushroom dust has always been at the same time as eating them, for instance smoking a lil dust on a bowl while waiting for the ones i ate to kick in, naturally.. basically getting a body high which blended right into the body high i got from the onez i ate, thus headin right into a normal shroom trip.  <br>So back to today and my curiosity -  I ran upstairs and grabbed a cap it was .8gz, threw it in the coffee grinder and capped off a bongload pretty genorously... I must say after 2 rips i didnt feel the need to puff down nemore for about 25 minutes... Its definately a nice mood right now .. i see some visual effects after 2-3 more hits but nothing too intense... definayely feeling it tho prolly only .3gz to my head right now im sure if i smoked as much as id usually ingest i would be ballzin but i aint feelin that tonite, and so ends my report.\n\n\n"
