I got a free sample of 4-MeO-PCP. My intention is to write a decent report on my experimentation with the substance.<br><br>
This morning I took 300 mg dextromethorphan (pure). This is fairly normal for me. I take this amount 3-4 times on an average week. It plays multiple roles in my life, the two main ones being: my DOC, and my mood stabilizer. I have a high tolerance to the DXM and function fairly normally even on 300 mg.<br><br>
At 23:40 I ingested about 100 mg 4-MeO-PCP. My scale tends to be off by 5-10 mg. It tasted like I would expect a burnt transistor to taste. Very bitter like most drugs.<br><br>
T+0:40 - I feel normal mentally but I think I'm starting to sense a change in my body. Blood pressure change maybe, don't know. Going to play a computer game or something for a bit.<br><br>
T+1:00 - Laid down for a few minutes and started noticing patterns in the dark. When I opened my eyes I realized I feel kind of light and I'm getting slight tracers.<br><br>
T+2:00 - Weak feeling like I'm coming up on DXM or nitrous maybe. Brain is starting to act a little odd. I am taking 125 mg more to make up for what I perceive to be a dissociative tolerance.<br><br>
T+2:30 - Stronger CEVs, feel weird. Sensation in body like I'm anxious maybe. Thought I needed to pee but nothing came out. Feel tired but it might just be because I got up early today. Starting to get those sensations where you temporarily feel lost/confused. Losing balance and vision starting to 'lag.'<br><br>
T+2:50 - Comeup has never stopped. I keep feeling more strange. I was washing my hands and something weird happened. I started hearing a female voice telling me 'I know you are there' accompanied by a rushing sound. At the same moment my vision dimmed heavily for a second and my neck twitched one time quite violently. I have not been doing much. I talked to my roommate for a bit then laid down longer. Played one game of Starcraft II and did terribly. While playing or talking I found that my train kept getting interrupted by nothing. Basically I'd talk and lose part of a sentence but still be able to recall what I meant to say. In Starcraft I could still control fine but I couldn't strategize easily.<br><br>
T+3:00 - It keeps feeling stronger. I am accidentally bumping into things around the house even though I'm not wobbly. Just depth perception and self awareness are disappearing so far<br><br>
T+4:00 - I am quite dissociated. When I sit completely still there is a growing uncomfortable sensation in my body, particularly my arms and legs. It is very unpleasant. Strange disconnected thoughts that don't make sense.<br><br>
T+5:00 - With my eyes closed I go to a vivid dream world and unlike DXM or NO2 I can remember what I experience after I come out of it.<br><br>
T+6:00 - My body feels like it's being pulled to the ground but I feel weightless. Odd.<br><br>
Retrospect: I might test this more in the future. A bit before I peaked I felt very uncomfortable. It might have been histamine release. Next time I will definitely try to be well rested, 100% sober and take a dose more like 150mg. Another factor was that I dosed on a full stomach. The experience was not euphoric at all, it was not dysphoric either though.<br><br>
Another report described something like neutral paranoia. This drug made me hear voices and see shadow people but it wasn't scary at all. I didn't feel like anyone was out to get me but I kept sensing nonexistent things trying to interact with me.<!-- End Body -->
