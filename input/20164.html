The smallest duragesic patches are 25/ug per hour release 1.8mg over three days before they are changed for a fresh patch.  This actually theoretically leaves .7mg of fentanyl in the spent patches.  Fentanyl being soulable in alcohol, the spent patches were cut up in small peices and soaked in a small amount of 99% anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (70% would probably work too).  After some time, overnight or even weeks as the spent patches were simply added to the jar, the alcohol was filtered and the filter expressed so as much of the substance would fall in a glass dish.  Basil leaf or some other smokeable herb was placed in the alcohol and the alcohol was allowed to evaporate.  The herb was smeared and even a razor used to scrap up any residue to place it on the herb.  <br><br>
This fentanyl-laced herb was smoked for strong opiate effect.  The amount of herb used determines potency, more patches and less herb obviously makes it more potent.  One or two hits would produce not a rush but a definite floating feeling with colorful CEV's.  Standing up assured one was very intoxicating as one felt wobbly.  After a few small bowls, sweat would appear on the forehead and one certainly felt 'loaded' for a few hours.<br><br>
Warning, Fentanyl is extremely potent, this is why the smoking method was chosing by the explorer, as titration is easier.<!-- End Body -->
