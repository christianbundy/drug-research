My boyfriend and his friends had been doing what they called 'skittles' aka Coricidin Cough and Cold for a while and I wasn't too interested at first because I was unable to swallow pills. However after a sudden availability of Vicodin, I learned. My boyfriend and I had had an agreement that once I learned we'd do ecstacy but after seeing a moving commercial on TV I decided not to. So I asked about skittles and decided to try those instead. Hey, they're cheaper and way more available.. and legal.. so yeah.<br><br>
I forced 8 of those candy-coated suckers down my throat and waited. I really didnt feel anything till almost an hour and a half later on the way to my boy's house. We got there and I managed to be straight enough to stumble past his parents and sit in his room while he took a shower. After that we went to talk to his parents for a minute and then leave.. this was tough. My pupils were so dilated by this time and i was paranoid. I felt like they knew I was messed up, it was kinda creepy. I was scared they would know and then not like me anymore or whatever.. but I just feel like everyone knows I'm on them, but really its pretty hard to tell. <br><br>
After a while we were crusing around and picking up friends and chillin at peoples houses, stuff of that sort. I felt frustrated that I wasn't going to a party I wanted to and I was really anxious to leave this one persons house.. I just really couldnt stand being there. My frustration was increased when they all started to bug me about letting my boyfriend, who was the driver for the night take some skittles. I said no way because now i know what this is like and there is no way I could drive right now. <br>
The entire night i had this feeling in the back of my mind like I knew I was gonna die that night. It wasn't overwhelming, but it led me to some paranoia and I was really cautious. I wasn't trying to fight it or prevent it though, because in my head I just knew I was going to die. After a bit we left my friends house and headed to a park where my boyfriend and some other guys headed out to the forest to drink and smoke. I told them I wanted to stay in the car because I didn't want to get mosquito bites so they headed off. <br><br>
I put the seat back and made myself comfy, enjoying the high. I wondered if this was how I was going to die.. if I could suffocate like this.. but it didn't bother me too much because I knew it was inevitable. I could feel my breathing get weak and I passed out. I don't know how long it was until I came to to my boyfriends worried face. He was shaking me and calling out my name telling me to wake up. I remember when I started to come back I could hear him saying 'Wake up baby you gotta wake up' and thinking how worried he sounded. I figured I was dead. After that he brought me back to the woods and we all hung out back there for a while. When it was time to go home I knew my boy had drank some and he was high too and I was really worried. I told him to be careful driving because I had a feeling I was going to die tonight. I got home okay and went to be alright, after I came down. <br><br>
Although the feeling that you know you're going to die is creepy, I did not think it was worth skipping DXM over. Other than a bit of nausea, it was the only problem I came across. I took 10 skittles the other night and I didn't have the feeling this time. But I did pass out again and had either no or little breathing.. Not good.<!-- End Body -->
