FWIW, I've got about seven years of drug experimentation under my belt. My tastes lie primarily with marijuana and psychedelics. I've experienced LSD and mushrooms dozens of times, as well as 2C-I several times now.<br><br>
I was with a group of folks dosing 2C-I. I had been excited for this trip, but a minor alcohol hangover had me dreading the 2C body load. As the window for me to dose and remain on the same wavelength as the group came and went, I immediately began to regret my decision until I recalled this little gem I had access to. I knew that it had a fast onset (allowing me to 'catch up' with the other trippers), a short duration (keeping me from being left behind near the end), and I figured that tryptamines generally have less body load than phenethylamines. I reread the TIHKaL entry and was reminded of Shulgin's ++++ experience. My mind was made up.<br><br>
I waited until the 2C trippers were beginning to feel light effects. My goal was to line up my peak with the group's, and I feel I was mostly successful. 18mg capsule, down the hatch. All the normal pre-trip anxiety, compounded by the fact that I was taking a relatively obscure psychedelic for the first time.<br><br>
I felt the first whispers of activity very quickly, just ten or fifteen minutes in. Wow, I hope I haven't gotten in over my head--no, of course not, it's supposed to hit fast. Things begin to progress quickly from here.<br><br>
At thirty minutes, I am fully immersed in the trip. Just edging into +++ territory. It seems like the others are peaking as well, splendid. There is some anxiety, though its source is hard to pinpoint. Perhaps the bodyload (which was much greater than I had anticipated) was getting to me. In any case, I felt like curling up into a fetal position and burying my head--a feeling that comes to me quite often at the beginning of mushroom trips. I indulge myself. I vomit twice before the first hour is up.<br><br>
By forty five minutes, I am progressed to a full-on, unmistakeable +++. I am having some visuals, although they are not a strong element of the trip. OEVs never progress past light, generically psychedelic effects--tracers, creeping textures, etc. If I had been tripping this hard on mushrooms, there would have been a lot more going on visually. CEVs are not fully developed either but otherwise resemble tweaked mushroom visions. The mind trip is less confusing and emotional than mushrooms, but still feels deep. More like LSD, but less.... cosmic, perhaps.<br><br>
The body trip--that's where it is with this stuff! It's hard to explain, because it's not a body 'high' or a body 'load'; it's a true *body trip*. Quite wonderful (full of wonder), and I was lucky enough to have a partner for cuddling. It was not very sexual or loved up like a 2C can be, but rather a desire for physical intimacy.<br><br>
The peak/plateau lasted till about the 90 minute mark before beginning to subside. Somewheres in here, a few bowls were smoked with the 2C kids. Didn't seem to have quite the synergy that some psychedelics have with weed, but still nice, and still enough to boost the trip slightly (mostly the mental effects--visuals remained tame).<br><br>
FWIW, I urge caution to anyone reading this regarding use of cannabis while tripping. I always try to take it as slowly as possible; cannabis can take a tame trip out of control quickly. PSA over.<br><br>
At 2 hours, I was clearly no longer tripping as hard as the others, though effects were still noticeable. By hour three, all primary effects were gone and only the vaguest hints of psychedelic thinking remained, very much potentiated by the cannabis and remaining psychedelic energy of the 2C trippers (still very much tripping). I stopped smoking as I was elected to purchase, pick up and return with food. By hour four, I felt essentially back to baseline and at the fifth hour, I had no qualms about driving, feeling zero psychedelic effects.<br><br>
The timeline of this drug is absolutely astonishing. I wasn't sure that I'd like it, always being sad when a trip begins to subside and preferring long-acters like LSD, but this is something special. It feels almost like a pure psychedelic peak, with no plateau or lingering aftereffects. Not always what you want, but it's good to know it exists. The practical benefits are hard to ignore too--one could drive to a concert, take a dose, and be ok to drive home after the show.<br><br>
All the rest I'll say for now is that I understand why Shulgin was impressed and I'm not sure why this one has flown under everyone's radar for so long.<!-- End Body -->
