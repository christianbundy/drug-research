Im 31 now. I had my first experience with Cannabis when I was 16. I was at someones house, and took one hit off a bong. I didnt feel very different, but when I tried to back my car out of a steep driveway about 45 minutes later, I felt extremely afraid of the possible calamitous consequences. <br><br>
When I was 17, I was an exchange student living in Europe, in a place where people smoked hash mixed with tobacco, rather than the dried flowers. I had no clue about the relative potency of hash. On the way to a club one evening, my friend stopped in a public restroom to mix together the tobacco from two regular cigarettes and a small bar of hash, about the size of a stick of Dentyne gum. We started to smoke the spliff on the way to the club. I took three giant tokes in rapid succession, which turned out to be a massive overdose. <br><br>
I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I soon learned. The path reached a point where it was very curvy. I got vertigo and fell a little to the side, as I slipped further into an intense Cannabis intoxication. My friend, and the ones we joined up with, had little idea how profoundly altered I felt, and how afraid I was getting. The inside of the club offered too much stimulus, and I wanted to go back outside, where it was quieter. My friends allowed me out for a while, but it was bitterly cold, something to which I was oblivious. They half carried me back in and propped me up sitting against the wall, where I rested my head on my arms for hours, immobile, experiencing the intensity, panic and utter confusion, praying for the high to diminish. I distinctly felt strong sensations in the back of my head that I had never felt before. I imagined that the back of my head could burst off at any moment. My reasoning was totally disabled. I was enduring, and scared. I was also embarrassed to be so out of control of my own body and mind that people had to prop me, mute, against the wall.<br><br>
Once my friends decided to leave the club, the gathered me up, piled me into the car, and drove off back to our town. I got nauseated and threw up several times on the way home. I still felt just as intensely high, approximately 5 hours after smoking. I began to wonder if I would ever feel back to normal again. My so-called friend took me to his house to spend the night, so as not to deposit me so high at my host familys house. Once in his bed, he proceeded to molest me; I had barely any wits about me to form my protest. I continued to endure the hallucinatory state of mind I was in, grateful to just be in a quiet and relatively safe place.<br><br>
The next morning, I was still high. In fact, it took me 48 hrs. to come back to baseline. It was Sunday, and I was scheduled to go on a family outing to a historic town about 1-2 hours away. The whole time I pretended to be normal, and no one noticed I was feeling strange, but the obsessive thought that I would be like this for the rest of my life became the centerpoint of the day. It took an enormous effort to just speak and smile amiably to my hosts. I will never forget those frighteningly uncomfortable 48 hours.<!-- End Body -->
