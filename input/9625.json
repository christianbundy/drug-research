 "report": "<p>\nI'm about 15 years old and attending an all boy's boarding school for allegedly emotionally disturbed adolescents in Connecticut.  I read about the use of nutmeg by prisoners.  Having read some of Ram Dass and Castaneda, I am interested in the use of psychedelics for spiritual and mystical purposes.</p><p>7 pm (T+0) - I mix a tablespoon of ground McCormick's nutmeg into a glass of water.  I hold my nose and drink it.  Disgusting!</p><p>10 pm (T+3) - Nothing has happened.  I assume nothing will.  I go to bed.</p><p>2 am (T+12) - I wake up hallucinating.  I see a great object that's a cross between the letter T, a tricycle and the number 4.</p><p>About 4 am (T+14) - I go back to sleep.</p><p>Subtle psychoactive effects last for 3 days.</p><p>I realize that nutmeg reaches its peak effect in about 7 hours, and that subtle after-effects last for three days.</p><p>Still to come:  accounts of higher dosages.</p><p>Nutmeg is real.  And it's on your granma's shelf.</p>"
