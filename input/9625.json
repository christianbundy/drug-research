 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm about 15 years old and attending an all boy's boarding school for allegedly emotionally disturbed adolescents in Connecticut.  I read about the use of nutmeg by prisoners.  Having read some of Ram Dass and Castaneda, I am interested in the use of psychedelics for spiritual and mystical purposes.\r\n7 pm (T+0) - I mix a tablespoon of ground McCormick's nutmeg into a glass of water.  I hold my nose and drink it.  Disgusting!\r\n10 pm (T+3) - Nothing has happened.  I assume nothing will.  I go to bed.\r\n2 am (T+12) - I wake up hallucinating.  I see a great object that's a cross between the letter T, a tricycle and the number 4.\r\nAbout 4 am (T+14) - I go back to sleep.\r\nSubtle psychoactive effects last for 3 days.\r\nI realize that nutmeg reaches its peak effect in about 7 hours, and that subtle after-effects last for three days.\r\nStill to come:  accounts of higher dosages.\r\nNutmeg is real.  And it's on your granma's shelf.\n\n\n"
