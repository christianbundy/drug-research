 "report": "<p>After a great deal of research I decided to order 100g of the aforementioned substance.</p><p>As I do with most substances Ive ordered, I acquired the services of many individuals to help test the effects of phenibut.</p><p>Unfortunately the dose curve varied strongly between individuals. Some people responded to a mere 200mg (placebo?) while others required at least a gram to meet a threshold. After a week of testing and doses reaching a maximum of 15 grams, I determined from volunteers that phenibut indeed exhibited the effects mentioned earlier. Most individuals compared it to Valium, alcohol, or what they thought heroin would be like.</p><p>It should also be noted that we determined than an insufflated dose of no more than 50mg is about equivalent to 2 grams ingested. This implies some breakdown in either the stomach or intestines.</p><p>The following records my experience on phenibut.</p><p>At about 10pm I ingested approximately 5 grams of phenibut on an empty stomach with a friend of mine whom ingested about 12 grams of phenibut.</p><p>1 hour later I could begin to feel a strong sedative effect come over me. Every muscle in my body began to feel relaxed and I began to feel slightly drowsy. A few minutes later I began to lose motor function and my sense of balance. My friend was having trouble standing up and speaking in complete sentences. Despite his inability to communicate in a civilized manner, my friend assured me that he was having the time of his life. Unlike my friend (and everyone else I knew) I did not experience any euphoria from the phenibut; only a desire to go to sleep.</p><p>I will continue to purchase phenibut and continue my independent studies on it.</p>"
