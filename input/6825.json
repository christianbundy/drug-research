 "report": "<p>     This has happend to me a couple of times, when I smoked weed I sometimes swallowed a hit and then 30-60 min later I would puke. The high would very quickly turn to me wanting to passout. I believe this is from me swallowing the smoke: the smoke would go into my stomach and mix with the contents of my stomach and force me to throwup.</p><p>I now haven't puked in 6 months now. I have learned to be really carefull with how I hit my shit and I usually down a can of coke as soon as the sessions over so I will be forced to burp up the coke suds and any smoke which I had swallowed.</p>"
