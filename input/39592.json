 "report": "<p>My chronic pain doctor gave to me several boxes of free samples of a drug called Gabitril.  Apparently, it is good against nerve related pain (pinched nerves in the spine, etc) so I said I would give it a shot.  She warned me it might pack a punch though,  dizziness, drowsiness, the works. So I took the copious amount of free samples home with me.  Shortly thereafter, I forgot about them for two weeks.  </p><p>This evening, out of boredom, I am testing what, if any, recreational effects can be attributed to this new drug.</p><p>6:30- Ingested one 4mg tablet.</p><p>6:55- Feel a bit warmer than usual.  Mind drifting a bit.  Body buzz almost non existent, but it is there.</p><p>7:32-  Kinda sleepy.  Drowsiness kicking in.</p><p>9:00-  Still pretty much baseline.</p><p>Conclusion:  Gabitril, otherwise known as Tiagabine HCI has no recreational value for me.  Also, it is completely ineffective on pain. Taking it as an experiment was a waste of time, but maybe someday I will take three or four of the tablets and see what will happen.</p>"
