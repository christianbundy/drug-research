I take 200 mg sertraline and 300 mg bupropion daily for depression.  I had read that anti-depressants can lessen the effects of psychedelics such as LSD.  I figured that a little trip is better than no trip at all, right?<br><br>
I took just one tab at first, because I am sensitive in general to psychoactive substances.  I was with a very experienced psychonaut friend, R, just hanging out in my apartment.  I was a bit nervous because I've landed in the ER with bad drug interactions before and it sucks.  But I felt pretty confident that my day wouldn't end in a hospital.  R and I watched tv while I waited to feel something.  I did feel pretty weird.  It felt a little like the body high from a low dose of DXM, with almost none of the mental/emotional intrigue.  My neck got very stiff and sore, and I couldn't focus my eyes properly.  I had no visual or auditory hallucinations of any kind.  The most noticeable aspect was a kind of buzzing feeling in my whole body, like it was antsy and ready to blast off to outer space but couldn't quite make it off the ground.  I took a second tab about 4-5 hours after the first one just to see if it was a matter of dosage.  It wasn't.<br><br>
One thing that was mildly interesting: I couldn't taste food.  My brain was receiving the information all the same, but I was experiencing it in a way other than tasting, I don't know what exactly.  I guess that's a kind of synesthesia, like hearing colors or whatever.  I spent most of the 'trip' laying around watching tv and trying to sleep off the neck and jaw stiffness.  I couldn't sleep though.  Overall a huge disappointment followed by a massive 24-hour headache.  I will have to plan very carefully if I want to try to go off the meds for a few days so I can attempt to trip.  It's not usually worth it.<!-- End Body -->
