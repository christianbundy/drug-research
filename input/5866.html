<a name="Zam">by <b>Zam</b>: <br></a>
12.5 mg 2C-B + 1 beer, no noticeable change in effect.<br><br>

4 beers, solidly intoxicated, watching movies with lover.  14 mg 2C-B during peak of intoxication.
I enjoyed the transition which was very smooth and pleasant, unlike my normal coming up experiences.
The alcohol space opened up into a more stimulated, positive, clear space.  At T+4 of the 2C-B I slept
soundly, which is unusual.<br><br><hr>
<br><a name="Dagr"><b>by Dagr</b></a>:<br>
1st time.  25 Mg 2cb, drank 2 beers quickly.  Moving in a car and sharp
turns as the rushes came on.  Threw up a few times and felt fantastic
afterwards.  No further rushing.  People around me continued to rush.
Fantastic visuals.  Context: Outside<br><br>

3rd time with 2C-B.  3 beers,  hour later - Half Moclobemide, hour later - 20 mg of
2cb, and about 1.5 grams of mushies while peaking on 2cb.  At a Rave
Felt completely euphoric, fantastic visuals.  Sick moments of Hmmm, Ugh Oh,
especially in the restroom  :-).  Rushing a lot,  legs shaking (felt
good), nice insights...one of the best times I have had in years.  <br><br><hr>
<br><a name="Debaser"><b>Debaser</b></a>:<br>
I have to emphasize this combo as being absolutely fantastic. I've 
experienced nothing more psychedelic. Taking 15 mg  after about 7 or 
8 beers (about 3 litres) I found myself asking the same question over 
and over again (while feeling ecstasy like euphoria and 
experienceing an alice in wonderland state of mind):- WHY is this 
combination so damn amazing.<br><br>

In the end I supposed that it must be that the alcohol takes the edge 
off the 2cb and slows it down a bit so you can actually examine that 
amazing state of mind. It felt like I was surfing waves of 
consciousness,  but in a 
very mellow relaxed kind of way. The phenethylamine qualities I had 
always heard of with 2cb (but never felt) I REALLY felt this time. No 
paranoia, no fear... just pure psychedelic euphoria with visuals I 
didn't know were possible. I had trails that lasted for 6 seconds+ 
and morphing that had me rolling on the floor with laughter.
The most beautiful part of the experience was the understanding of 
the "Cosmic joke." It was as if I was forced to see it in all its 
cynical beauty. There were also moments when complete telepathy were 
"just there." In a way I'd describe the experience as a 
"3-dimensional MDMA experience."
And after it ended I just could not believe it.... 2cb and beer???
But I'm planning to repeat it again... Oh yeah... how about marketing 
a 2cb beer in countries where the substance is still legal? Seriously.... this would 
be a nice way for two opposite forces to come to ammends =) =)
Heh.. Budweiser's Bee-beer.<br><br><hr>
<a name="BMur"><b>by BMur</b></a>:<br>

Holy shit yer crazy man or am I such a sissy?<br><br>

This bee and alcohol combo<br>
does *not* match my experience.<br><br>

I had dry heaves all night until I really threw up<br>
and then was down for three weeks.<br>
My friend had bees after four beers<br>
was on his back nauseated for hours<br>
and has not wanted either substance since (four months)<br><br>
