I experienced my first opiate high after a serious ATV crash, about 10 years ago. It was no big deal, about 2 weeks worth of 10mg hydrocodone with APAP, then it was gone with no significance. I remember feeling constantly content with my life, and although some areas of my life at work and in relationships could use improvement, I felt as though things could be worked out rather easily. <br><br>
Flash forward to early 2006. A friend was prescribed a large bottle (60 ct.) of hydrocodone 5/500 with 3 refills. We went on a hydrocodone binge for a week. After that experience, coupled with the fact that my personal life with the recently ex girlfriend was in the shitter, I continued to self medicate since the drug made me feel so much better about myself. How classic.<br><br>
Several weeks later, I had a bona fide injury to my back after a rather nasty tackle in the back yard, damn football season. Lacking any real medical insurance, I went to the ER and was prescribed some hydrocodone. A prescription for 15 pills lasted about 2 days. <br><br>
A week later, I hit another ER at a different hospital complaining of back pain, using the same story, although my pain had subsided, I wanted more drugs. This time, I received a prescription for oxycodone. <br><br>
Oxycodone is, in my opinion, hands down the best painkiller out there. The effects of oxy are sooo much better than hydrocodone, though they are very similar in some ways.<br><br>
Since then, I've hit 4 different ER hospitals, using a similar story every time. I usually use all the medication in a couple days, then make a plan to get more. Faking pain has become easy for me, I'm very convincing.<br><br>
Things seem so much better while under the influence of opioids. I wonder if I'll ever stop now.<!-- End Body -->
