Here's a 2C-B trip tip that I thought I'd pass on to devotees of this substance: when you take 2C-B, also try taking single tab of a benzodiazepine tranquilliser (such as Valium, Ativan or Urbanol), or alternatively a couple of tabs of a natural over-the-counter herbal tranquilliser, such as valerian. <br><br>
One would have thought that by taking a central nervous system relaxant as well, the effect of the 2C-B would be diminished - but quite the contrary. My experience is that by relaxing the mind and body, the trank allows the 2C-B experience to flow in with much greater ease and far greater effect. In fact, I find that by using this combo I need far less 2C-B to reach the same space. (Using 2mg of Valium and 15mg of 2C-B gets me to the same level as 25-30mg of 2C-B taken on its own.) <br><br>
Another plus to this combo is that it takes away the slightly speedy, restless amphetamine edge that is often part and parcel of a 2C-B trip. When taking 2C-B on its own, I usually find myself compelled to be busy up and doing something. With the trank combo, however, I am quite happy to lie back in a blissful, introspective state of reverie.<br><br>
We are all tense to varying degrees and possibly the more tense one is, the more rigid one's mental and physical defences are to the stimulatory effect of a phenethylamine substance such as 2C-B. So, fairly highly-wired people might like benzo combos better.  I was sure amazed that a mild trank can make such a profound difference to the experience.<!-- End Body -->
