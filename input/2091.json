 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter having six pack of beer I took about 2 grams of dried mushrooms 'Amazonian Cubensis'. I also smoked half a joint. After about 1 hour I realised that I'm having visions. First it started with colorful geometrical patterns and a rush of relaxing pleasure. At this point I decided to go to bed because I knew that it's going to be intense. What followed was 6 hours of intelectual ORGASM. I chose 'ofortuna' music background, which played in my mind over and over. I was transferred into the world of angels. Particularly one angel. His name was Satan. I expected scary encounter, but no, he was magnificent, beautiful, sophisticated and genius. At this point I realised that of course he was this way, how otherwise he would manage to make other angels join him in his rebellion against God? I wanted to join him too, however I decided not to. He is a liar, and by knowing the effects of his deeds I knew that he is wrong. Because of him, humanity suffered tortures, for that reason alone I couldn't forgive him. Although the experience was a total bliss, I don't know if I want to do it again. It was so beautiful, it was scary. It was the most intense experience in my life. It was certainly mind expanding.\n\n\n"
