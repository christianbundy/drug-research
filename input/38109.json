 "report": "<p>After 200 mg, nothing. After 400 mg, slight transient palpitations. Euphoria, wakefulness, focus, and nausea equivalent to 20 oz of Caribou coffee.  If you have narcolepsy, this is the drug for you. If you need alertness and have adverse reactions to methylxanthines, by all means take it. Otherwise, have a good, fresh cup of strong coffee.</p>"
