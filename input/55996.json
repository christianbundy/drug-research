 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMe and a friend traveled to a cottage in the winter time, started a fire in the fireplace, and got situated. My mind set was one of knowing that a very transcendental experience was forthcoming. I was excited but also very relaxed, I had no hesitation or fear, but I was not in a rush I knew what mattered most was preparing all this perfectly. I had done salvia once before in order to be able to experience the trance upon my second try. We had a pipe, and the salvia extract. It was completely dark outside of the cabin, I barely even remember being able to see much moonlight reflecting on the snow. I decided to do my trip in the dark, only exception being three lit sticks of incense. \r\nThe night was black, its smoke of \r\nlife \r\nwas all over us in the cabin\r\nthree small coils of smoke \r\npoured up from three lit incense sticks\r\nthe salvia was smoked, \r\ntwo bowls held long\r\nand I drifted into hyper-awareness, \r\nI was frozen physically in reflection on my life\r\nI began to feel all my soul \r\nmoving downward, passing down into the skin that\r\ntouched my chair, \r\nthe soul enlarged and thickened downward\r\nmy eyes gave away to visuals, \r\nI traveled away from my consciousness \r\nI entered into a consciousness of flawless fatality\r\nwhere the final processes of an ending life approach\r\nmy soul was engulfed by this fragment of my brain\r\nthat is close to ones death or even \r\nto be enlightened in ones dreaming \r\nI became aware of being next to land in the dark\r\nI felt there was a river forty feet away or closer, \r\nthere was earth that I stood upon, \r\nand there voices came to me, \r\ntheir voices were clear and loud before I saw them\r\nTheir spirits came downward or forward\r\nsome from my right side, I believe one entity, \r\nthe prevalent speaker and perhaps one of her friends, \r\nand some from the left, more so before me. \r\nThere was a line extending out of my heart, \r\nit glistened like a wall of skin and made itself aware to my eyes, \r\nit attached its presence to all of my consciousness and maintained its angle, \r\nit angled off to the right from my heart, and seemed to point upwards, \r\nThe voices cause me to speak, to yell, I was turned on \r\nto their investigative qualities, their sentences of half-questions\r\nOne predominant female voice exchanged with me\r\nall that she had come to know about my life \r\nand how I live it \r\nshe confronted me with my most deeply personal fates\r\nshe comforted me from my fears, she showed me my inactivity\r\nshe made me sing with her in rhythm, \r\nthough I have forgotten her song I thought I never would\r\nshe caused me to surrender, \r\nmy chanting bowed before her and my voice grew\r\nsomething about her being the for real, \r\nshe is the power, I know you are the speaker\r\nThey were close together now, the entities, She was nearest to me\r\nDid they leave together back up the path to the road\r\njust up away from me almost on the left-side  or \r\ndid she return back to the right-side while the others drifted \r\nup their own paths, The land off in the distances was hard to see, \r\nit was in the dark of night, \r\nthere may have been something like moonlight but it seemed to be faint \r\nand right over us, dissipating when they moved away, \r\nif I had taken enough to move those entities right into me\r\nI may have seen an even different entity, perhaps a louder voice, \r\na searing light,\r\nit seems I may have been standing next to some cottage or house\r\nwhen they were talking to me, perhaps the house was a part of my brain, \r\na cavern of my brain that I have never dissolved. \r\nThings became a wash as they still had me in song and they floated off\r\nit seemed they were slowly closing a door...\r\nand now I could see something else, \r\na visual hallucination still strongly under the effect of drug\r\nyet based off something that existed around me in the immediate world\r\nthe three lit tops of the incense sticks came into my eyes much like \r\nthe silk strings of skin or light that had such a profound angle earlier in the high\r\nI watched how this concept of points of orientation with accompanying lines and strings\r\nresembled much of what I had seen in the high, \r\nand it was the most pleasing way to come back into my surroundings\r\nafter an experience so dark and personal, blinded from life and then all of life turned on\r\nwithin my soul. \r\nI was still dazed and still felt the urge to repeat her rhythms, \r\ncertain feelings of song and music she had conveyed to me, \r\nI thought maybe one thing I could show for that experience, forever, might be \r\nthe rhythm and song of salvia. \r\nEven in following salvia experiences I heard the rhythms. \r\nI Dont bother doing salvia in the day, unless I do quite small doses such as using it to gain a light stone, a clear-headed buzz, because if I take large amounts in the day like I did that night most of what I see will be a buzz kill, almost depressing, \r\nAnd the sense that Ive driven myself insane and unable to move and do normal things with people will leave me quite saddened and at the time of the peak very unnerved \r\na feeling that is like a hot flash is extremely typical for daytime salvia use. My body will reach a new temperature because of the smoke I have inhaled, and then my body will itch and I will become unnerved because it will feel like I cannot have an enjoyable experience just because of the heat, its a very scratchy feeling, not very desirable, it can be lessened by wearing no clothing at all when I take it. \r\nI did not receive the trance on my first time, smoking it for the first time in the daytime was actually quite pleasant since the effect for me was a lot like laughing gas mixed with a stimulation that makes me want to run and shake my body and head in order to squeeze the most from that. After that initial rush and peak the other effects were light visual hallucination that is kind of like hash and low dose mushrooms, yet I felt like something great and amazing might be on its way\n\n\n"
