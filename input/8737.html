 all my friends were out of town for the weekend. i had just lost my job so i couldnt go to the lake with them. I was kinda bummed because i had purchased half an ounce of mushrooms and 3 grams of salvia from another friend. i decided that since i would be by myself i should try eating mushrooms because i had never done that by my self.<br><br>
 i waited till 9:45 at night. it was a beatiful half moon out and i said now is a better time than ever. I downed an eigth of mushrooms with a bottle of beer because i dont taste them that way. i crossed my legs and meditated while listening to enigma for an hour. <br><br>
By 11:00 i was really starting to trip hard and went for a walk. i had two half gram salvia joints pre-rolled. i said a short prayer, lit the joint,laid down, and stared into space. in about 2 seconds i was rising into the hevens. the stars broght me up with them . i saw god in them. not a face of god but a cloud of energy, it was telling me not to be sad but to rejoice because he had created the whole universe for me. when i say that i don't mean just me but all of us as people. i felt a great sense of relief. he showed me that all the little things that we get mad about and stress about don't really matter. what matters is being true to yourself and following your heart. no matter what anyone says or if you're afraid. <br><br>
the whole experience lasted about 30-45 mins. i wasnt really keeping track of time. i got up and went back to my house to get a glass of water and listen to a bit of music. a couple hours later i decided to smoke the next joint. i went back to the same place. before i stared to smoke i noticed a lot of fog was coming out. moreso than before. i took out the wooden match and stared to hit the joint. within seconds i was in the stars again. this time i saw an outline of a face. i looked and the fog had become people beeging for mercy. the face just moved and started to swallow up the fog. i was a little tense. i started to her a voice in my head telling me that with joy comes sorrow, that with the good comes evil, that with god comes satan. there has to be a balance to keep our universe in check. that is one of the problems now with our world is that we are losing our balance and it is slowly destroying us.<br><br>
i learned that night that there is a god, there is a satan. god isn't a man in the sky telling us what to do, it is a force of energy that keeps us in balance. god is our conscience, it is everything that is true. god is the little voice in our head that we sometimes dont want to listen too. satnan is just the absence of that energy. it is the absence of the light. <br><br>
i would definitly recomend this combo, it was the best trip of my life and i've done a lot of psychedelics.<!-- End Body -->
