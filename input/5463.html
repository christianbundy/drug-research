The first time I tried Salvia Divinorum I was waiting for my arms to grow like a long vine plant or something.  Nothing grew except slight anxiety.  The second time I tried I inhaled not one but two tokes -- an experience worlds apart. <br><br>
First, slight anxiety like the coming on of a bad trip, but no time to unfold, I was hit with a force that decided to dunk my head up and down in water struggling for air.  Over and over and over again, until like in that movie The Abyss, your lungs get accustomed to the vibrational flow of water down your lungs or energy flow and you continue! My girl friend, standing in front of me just staring at me (very annoying) turned into a Jabba-the-hut girl with tail and all.  She kept the same face, but her body grew big and fat.  This grotesque image took up my whole visual field.  It was like a Jabba-the-hut room with the edges of the room peeling in a psychedelic manner.  Next segment: I'm suddenly in a vaguely familiar but alien bedroom of a friend from high school and there are about 8 of us but everyones behind me for some reason.  They all know something I don't and are waiting for me to speak as some sort of evidence of my condition.  This is really starting to freak me out so I don't say anything, or should I say I can't say anything! I have that uncomfortable feeling of 'on the tip of your tongue' and then it turns into a big joke, and/or lottery of some sort and feel really quite embarrassed like I'm sitting there nude, or worse like I am a poor animal trying to understand a human joke of some sort.  <br><br>
After this segment I start to remember my name and what I am doing there.  I had the common feeling that my whole life was leading up to this one point in time of all these friends from high school + my girl friend ready to tell me the secret of my life (exactly like The Truman Show).  I now know how it feels to be Truman! It feels kinda cool actually.  I also had a flash of a sort of greenhouse room I dreamed many years ago that was neat.  I finally had the courage to walk out of my room into the hallway and felt extremely fucked up and unsure.  This comes close to the best acid I have ever experienced.  TOTAL EGO LOSS, except no good thoughts more like sick, twisted, demented, dumb, funny, nonsense, scizophrenic, paradoxical, struggling thoughts. I dont even really consider it a drug because I can't even relax and watch like a movie.  I have come to the conclusion that I have a way too complex mind for smoking this material, so next time I have decided to try sublingual extract instead.<!-- End Body -->
