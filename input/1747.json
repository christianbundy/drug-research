 "report": "<p>\nThis type of cough syrup is highly recommended, if only for it's taste.</p><p>If I was actually taking syrup for a cough, this'd be what I'd buy, because</p><p>it's so much easier to swallow.</p><p>- From about 5:30 - 6:30 pm</p><p>Went to Shopper's Drug Mart in a nearby mall, bought a box of Robitussin</p><p>Honey cough syrup, as I had seen the previous day.</p><p>Medicinal Ingredient: Each 5mL contains: Dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg.</p><p>Non-medicinal Ingredients: Flavours, glycerin, honey, liquid gluecose, methylparaben, propylene</p><p>glycol, sodium benzoate, water.</p><p>Cost just over $9 Canadian with taxes for the 115 mL bottle.</p><p>I stopped in at Music World.  It's full of shit, so they had nothing worth while.</p><p>So I then went to HMV, looked around, spotted the Electronica section,</p><p>remembered someone saying DXM enhances music like that very well, and grabbed a Massive Attack CD ('Blue Lines')</p><p>- Approximately 7:25 pm</p><p>Just ate dinner (KFC - bland gravy) and decided to have a go of the stuff.</p><p>Called a friend to check the conversion rate from 2 oz to mL, turned out to</p><p>be about 1/2 the bottle.</p><p>So I poured a glass of milk, guzzled down half the bottle (tasted like honey,but with a bitter backing, and the same aftertaste as cough syrup) then drank some of the milk.</p><p>I've heard the trip doesn't start until about 1/2 hour after taking it, so I'm waiting.</p><p>Incidentally, this is around a 2nd plateau dose, perhaps a little lower.</p><p>If you don't know, there are around 5 plateaus.  The 5th is, generally, death or a coma.  Not fun.  Not to scare you off, you'd have to have quite a lot to acheive 5th.</p><p>- 7:55 pm </p><p>I'm just watching some Kids In The Hall right now.  </p><p>Nothing yet.  I'd try to concentrate on any effects and enhance them, but I'm afraid of creating a placebo effect, something that tends to happen to me with many drugs, including caffeine and alcohol.</p><p>My heartrate may be speeding up.  I didn't time it earlier, so I don't know.</p><p>I seem to be getting distracted by other things more easily, and I become very engrossed in them.  It's hard to type a text file like this ;)</p><p>I'm putting my new CD on.</p><p>I just looked at my watch: it's only 8:05 pm.  I thought it'd be later than that.</p><p>Then I realize that little time has actually passed.  It just seemed to take a long time.  Neat.</p><p>- 8:35 pm</p><p>While talking to MMLJ online, I polished off the other 3/5 of the 115 mL bottle, since I had</p><p>no effects so far.  Still nothing.</p><p>What am I expecting?  Intense audio and visual effects, but that's expecting a lot...after all, DXM is much more like ketamine that it is like shrooms/LSD.</p><p>I just remembered (it's 10:45 right now) that while talking to MMLJ time went much faster than earlier, when it seemed to be taking forever.</p><p>- 9 pm</p><p>It seems really easy to concentrate on one thought, or one thing.  I noticed this when I realized I was thinking about absolutely nothing, just sitting here, listening to the music.</p><p>Of course, that state is impossible to return to on purpose: you're too busy trying to not try to succeed.</p><p>Parents just got home.  Let's see if I can still talk alright, shall we?</p><p>Incidentally, I had no grapefruit juice.  Apparently it enhances DXM trips: I won't know this time, I guess.</p><p>- 9:05 pm</p><p>I talk just fine.  Standing is a bit of a problem, as I sort of sway a bit.  But I'm weird normally, so it goes unnoticed.</p><p>Let's see how well I do at some computer games.</p><p>First up: 4D Stunt Driving.  Good game... dos based graphics, though, so you know.  Let's see.</p><p>Results:  No better than usual, and no worse.  The course seemed to take forever to drive, though.</p><p>Next game: Lemmings.  The original, bitches.</p><p>Results: Same as usual, again, except I'm seeing things, minor eye trickery similiar to when you're awake too long - like I saw a 10 as 11.</p><p>Friend called, playing command and conquer, I'm thinking real clearly tho, games aren't affected.</p><p>- 10 pm</p><p>I'm really dizzy.  I just sneezed, and I got a weird pulsating feel, like a headache that didn't hurt.</p><p>It's cool, but if I look around to much I get really dizzy.</p><p>- 10:30 pm</p><p>Still really dizzy.  Lost the ability to get distracted and then very engrossed in things.</p><p>Just dizzy right now.</p><p>- 10:37 pm</p><p>I just tried masturbating while in this state.  Very... odd... feelings.</p><p>Until I came, I was pretty much just numb.  I stopped at one point, and realized my penis felt the same as a finger... nothing erogenous about touching it.  When I came, it was a sudden, intense orgasm, very short, it started just before I ejaculated and it stopped just after.  After, when it was softening, it felt very numb around the head.  Like if it was numbed by a dentist, but not cold.</p><p>- 10:45 pm</p><p>I just discovered that if I put one hand in front of my face so it divides the TV screen in half, then move it left and right, and screen looks like it's warped, or warping...</p><p>I am thinking perfectly clearly, my body just is ignoring me to a certain extent.  I still type just as quickly as normal, with the same accuracy.  In fact, I think I'm typing faster than normal - but how can I tell?  My perceptions of time are rather warped.</p><p>I am still as grammatically competent as ever, and my vocabulary doesn't seem to be shortened.</p><p>However, my body is feeling very dizzy, and sometimes I type a suffix onto a word without thinking, like worden instead of word.  It's odd, because I don't realize I typed it at all unless I read over it.</p><p>Just now, I thought I saw the screen scrolling, as if I were on IRC.  Odd, since this is a text file.</p><p>Also, I highly suggest you jump around while high on DXM.  Occasionally I get the feeling that I'm hovering in the air.  For some reason while typing this I'm rocking from left to right... perhaps the music?</p><p>Just now, I thought that my mind had become totally clear of thoughts, but then I realized, uh, no it hadn't.  It was very odd, the thought came out of no where, and it was based on nothing.</p><p>Incidentally, I don't suggest you close your eyes and move your head up or down quickly - this might make you fall right over.  It didn't me, but I've had the effect happen to me many times, simply as a result of being tired, or possibly while drunk.  Perhaps I'm not thinking as clearly as I think I am.</p><p>Perhaps I will lie on the floor for a little bit.  In the dark.  I should go get a candle!  That'd be cool.</p><p>(I never did go get a candle.  I decided I didn't want to set the house ablaze inadvertantly. - Ed.)</p><p>- 10:57 pm</p><p>Simply put, holy shit.  Holy fucking shit.</p><p>I just lay down in the dark, listening to the CD, and I got this really, really intense feeling of having discovered something very important and very deep.  As soon as I got up to type it, though, I forgot...</p><p>I am playing in God's domain, and I never wish to return.  I am in heaven.  I can not find words to express the raw beauty of what I am feeling.  It is like... like being in love.  In love with the world.  I feel in touch with everything.  There is energy building up in me, I have something to say, but what it is, I'm not sure.</p><p>(This is, easily, the weirdest thing I have ever said. - Ed.)</p><p>By the way, I remembered what happened while on the floor.  I felt like something inside me: 'soul' came to mind, it moved to the top of my body, and was pressing on my skin, trying to get out.  I wonder if I was getting close to an OOBE?  Or perhaps this is just a combination of what I have been studying in physics, re: how electrons move and are attracted/repelled, that combined with my deep spiritual belief.  Excuse me: I'm going down for another dip in this pure, intense, raw pleasure.</p><p>- 11:10 pm</p><p>I just took control over my nervous system.  I was lying on my stomach, and I could feel my heart throughout my entire chest... then I decided, I wanted to feel it here, and I did.  Then I tried to move the feeling to somewhere else, and it moved.  I could move my heartbeat anywhere in my chest, and the top of my stomach.  I'm waiting for my friend, who I just called, to call back, so I can tell him about this.  I'm in love.  I'm in love with DXM.  I'm in love with everything.  Thanks, Slipknot.  Thank you very much for cancelling.  I also, while lying on the floor, forgot that my eyes were closed.  I just remember because I wanted to make sure I didn't fall asleep.</p><p>Turning the monitor on and looking at it from above, it looked like a dusty, rocky pathway.  Very neat.  Down I go.</p><p>I'm back up for a second, just to relate an odd thing that keeps happening.  You know when you look at a bright light, then look away, you can see it imprinted on what you see, sort of greenish coloured?</p><p>And, if you look at a bright light, then turn it off so you're in the dark, you see it as being darker than the area around it.  Well, I keep seeing a rectangle like that when I -open- my eyes...as if when I close them, I am seeing the bright light, then I open them and it's imprinted on my vision.</p><p>Down I go.</p><p>- Approximately midnight</p><p>I was lying next to my phone, and I thought 'I hope it doesn't ring, it'll surprise me' and it suddenly rang so I answered and yelled at my friend, 'Don't do that to me!'</p><p>On the phone with some friends.  I keep interrupting them, and I don't realize it.  Definately not a social drug, if you're stopping people from being social, huh? ;)</p><p>They don't seem too impressed that I drank cough syrup.  They seem to put it in the same category as huffing: stupid, and not a real drug.  I will have to convince them otherwise.  Not, of course, to try to get them to take DXM.  Just so they know.  And now, I will return to the floor, and</p><p>probably awake next morning.  Hopefully I won't be too sticky, sleeping on plastic...</p><p>- 11:15 am, next morning.</p><p>I couldn't sleep - whether it was the music, or the pillow, or the hard floor, I don't know.  I doubt it'd be caused by the DXM, since when I ventured over to my bed and got in, I was asleep almost right away.</p><p>No hangover of any kind.</p>"
