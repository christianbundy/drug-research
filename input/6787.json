 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk about a neutral experience, I readied myself for this little event for quite some time only to come up empty handed and a bit disappointed. I purchased a nice size T. peruvianus last year for about a C note. I tended it, watered it with phenylalanine and tyrosine, trying to add a little uumph. \r\nThe big day came and I yanked off a lobe measuring about 14 inches with maybe a 10 inch diameter. I threw it on the ground in a dark shed, nipped off the spines at the skin, and generally traumatized it for week or so, having heard that initiates defensive alkaloid production. Anyway, I carefully peeled the parchment-like out skin off and excised the interior pulp saving only the most chioce layer of green between the pulp and thick, tough outer skin. I food processed this and let dry in the sun, yielding several ounces of dehydrated powder. \r\nSo I eat all this gunk.......nada!! At least I didn't get a stomach ache or anything. It was quite literally a wash. Maybe you can see some element I missed here, but genrally, the vaunted mescaline in T. peruvianus turned out to be a no show for me.\n\n\n"
