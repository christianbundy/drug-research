Recently I have had the chance to try this incredible little substance called difluoroethane. I think it, like DXM, is very undermined as a drug in today's culture, but I believe it has potential as a powerful entheogen, though it has not been tested for safety in humans, so I would not recommend constant usage.<br><br>
Set: Calm and relaxed, due to the 2 hits of weed that I had taken 20 minutes earlier<br><br>
Setting: Outside, in the middle of a small forest. In a clearing about 7 or 8 feet wide, with my friend, M.<br><br>
I was quite apprehensive about trying it, but since I was kind of stoned, it was easy for M to talk me into it. I took a smallish hit of it, and the result was a suprisingly intense feeling. It was a tingling feeling, almost itchy, under my skin. It felt partly good, partly annoying. <br><br>
The next hit was a much bigger one, easily 2 normal sized hits (I used to be a swimmer, so I know how to take big ass hits and hold them in for a long time). This time I could no longer stay sitting, and had to lay back on the ground. I could feel EVERYTHING so clearly under me, it was astonishing. But within seconds, I forgot completely about it, because I saw something even more amazing. The world had suddenly turned on its side, so I felt like I was standing up again, with the ground as a wall behind me. The tree at my feet suddenly became what appeared to be a narrow pathway, stretching on up infinitely, into the sun which was now intensely bright. <br><br>
Strangely, though the sun appeared so bright, I had no need to even squint to look at it. I wanted very much to try to walk this narrow pathway, because some feeling told me at the end of it was something amazing. Of course, since the law of gravity still applied, though I did not feel it, this was of course impossible. It frustrated me to no end at the time. After 30 seconds of this, though it felt like years, I sat back up, feeling very floaty. I could feel myself coming down, but  it wasn't over yet. <br><br>
Suddenly I thought of how incredible living was, and how much it would suck to die. I felt everything going on inside me, it seemed. I could feel blood pulsing through my entire body, and I could feel all of the electrical impulses traveling to and from my brain, and I was amazed past the point of words at it. Literally, words cannot describe the intense feeling of simply LIVING that I was feeling. I started breathing very heavily and quickly, as though if I didn't, I would stop living. My friend took this to mean that I was freaking out and tried to comfort me, but weirdly, I felt no fear of dying, I just very much wanted to live. After another 30 seconds of this, I was back to normal.<br><br>
Even now, a week later, I still have that feeling of how incredible life is, and how thankful I am for being alive right now. This definitely has the potential to be a powerful life-altering drug, right up there with shrooms and LSD in my book. It is however, still an inhalant, and as such, can be very dangerous. Use extra caution with this drug.<!-- End Body -->
