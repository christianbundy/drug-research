Having read reports on the P.Torch cactus, and how best to consume or otherwise use it, I decided to try an experiment. This was my third PT trip, so I had had 'controls' against which to judge it.<br><br>
I had read that the greater part of the mescaline content is in the green, outer layer, and that the ochre, inner core is fatty and makes one nauseous. I therefore cut away the ochre parts of each dried cactus 'chip', and ground up only the green flesh. I weighed out around 15g of green, and disposed of ~ 5-10g of core; I then put it into capsules and ate it.<br><br>
The effect was about what I would have anticipated after 15g of whole cactus; weird and flashy, but not as happy or bubbly as after 20g. I didn't have diarrhoea, although I did take an immodium (and vitamin C) about two hours after the last capsules. Towards the end of the trip, I had quite a bad headache, and felt a little uncomfortable; aching muscles and dehydration.<br><br>
In retrospect, I think that removing the core of the cactus makes one less nauseous 30-60 mins after consumption and may prevent some diarrhoea 1-2 hours later, but for some reason, one pays for the lack of gastro-colonic distress 6-8 hours later with a form of hangover.<br><br>
I would speculate that this is because the alkaloids or toxins in the core (hordenine, etc) cause diarrhoea, removing other toxins in the cactus and within the colon generally. One's stools appear different during the rectal purging stage, like they do after a detoxing enema. These Cacti are believed to have medicinal properties, and this mild-ish purge may help one to feel fine after the trip.<br><br>
My conclusion: Eat all the cactus, and don't take immodium until you've had a few good, violent shits. You will feel thoroughly cleansed.<!-- End Body -->
