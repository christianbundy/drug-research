I have heard that grapefruit juice has an impact on the DXM experience and I just recently got a chance to test it out.  It apparantly makes the DXM experience a lot stronger and longer in duration.<br><br>
I use DXM pretty heavily and it has been a while since 1 bottle of Vicks 44 (cough only) will give me a real good buzz.  I usually dose between 500 and 1000 mg.  And that is all through cough syrup I drink.  I don't have access to the pure DXM powder.<br><br>
Anyway, I drunk about a liter of grapefruit juice an hour or so before I took only 1 bottle of Vicks 44 (cough only), 236 mg of DXM.  And expected to get only slightly buzzed since I am used to much higher doses.  Well, I could feel myself coming up and I knew that I would get a much better buzz when I felt myself enter the 2nd plateau (see the DXM FAQ).  My buzz just kept getting stronger and stronger and the experience lasted probably a half an hour longer.  <br><br>
I would recommend this to anyone who uses DXM because it made me trip like the first time I had ever taken DXM which is really fun, for most people anyway.  I think next time I am going to try more DXM probably in the 500 mg range and the grapefruit juice.  Well, that is all I have to say for now.  Take care everyone and stay safe. <br><br>
