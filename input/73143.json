 "report": "<p>I have been smoking weed for about 5 years and only lately I've been getting paranoid and these anxiety attacks whenever I get high. It's been like this for the last 6 months. Sometimes it isn't as bad as other times but I felt it was getting worse. I read an article on-line that says that psychosis and paranoia could be cured with Niacin. I started using 500 mgs three times a day and I felt a difference within 2 days. I now have no paranoia or anxiety attacks when I get baked. It actually sounds pretty silly niacin (vitamin b-3) can be better at reducing anxiety and kill all the paranoia from heavy marijuana usage than clonazepam which I once used as well as seroquel.</p>"
