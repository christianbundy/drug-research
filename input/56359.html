I had been smoking weed for about a year and a half when I decided to try LSD.  I became hooked on it immediately.  I loved the high.  I used frequently, about twice a week, for almost a year.  I realize now that I had many bad trips, but I never realized at the time that it could be the acid doing what it did to me.  I would experience great feelings of anxiety and paranoia.  It even got to the point where I would experience minor hallucinations when I wasn't high.  I talked to a good friend of mine about it and he said he experiences the same thing and told me to just ignore it.  Thank god I didn't listen to him.  I knew I had to quit.<br><br>
I quit doing acid and just stuck to weed for a while,  I stuck to weed for a while but realised the feeling weren't going away, even when I wasn't high I felt them.  Time to quit everything.  It was over a year before the feelings went away, it was very gradual.  It was during that year that I learned that any mind altering agent brought these effects on stronger.  I was helping a buddy paint a store and started getting affected by the paint fumes and had to leave him to finnish on his own.<br><br>
Finally about 2 and a half years later I was free from these feelings (so I thought)  I decided one day that I was gonna test the waters when someone offered me a joint.  After just a haul or two off the joint and the feelings came rushing back.  I knew then that I would have to stay drug free if I wanted these feelings to be gone for good.  I haven't experienced these feelings since.  Painting and minor toxins no longer bother me, although I've only tested them in short bursts.  I'm not brave enough to test out prolonged exposure.<br><br>
It took me a long time to openly admit to other people what I had gone through, for fear of disbelief mainly I guess.  I eventually opened up though and am glad for doing so.  I have to say though, I don't regret any of what I did or what happened to me.  I believe I learned a lot about people, life (morals,etc.) and most importatly myself from all of it.  So again I don't regret it, but I don't recommend it either.<!-- End Body -->
