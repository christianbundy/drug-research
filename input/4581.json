 "report": "<p>\nAs I see some people might be interested in this, I thought I'd submit my experience in order to keep people from making the same mistake I did.  </p><p>I heard from several people that LSD could be administered through the eye and that the onset would be much quicker.  I decided to give it a try but could not find any liquid LSD.  Finally, I said screw it and decided to put a hit of blotter under my eyelid.  The onset wasn't any faster than the oral route.  A little bit after it had kicked in, I felt it come out of my eye and fall to the floor.  I started to look for it but couldn't find it.</p><p>I finally came down and was able to sleep.  The next morning I woke up and noticed the hit was still in my eye.  Of course, I took it out and went on with my business.  </p><p>It's been a few years since the experience now.  Every two or three weeks, the area in my eye closest to my nose gets red and irritated.  It was not until a couple years ago that I realized it was the same eye I put the hit in.  I would blame it on impurities, but the acid was very clean.  I never experienced any backache or cramps on it.  Thank God I didn't repeat the experience.</p>"
