Last year when I was 15, I was arrested for battery and taken to juvenile.  Before I was put into a cell, I had to be frisked and drug tested. I had nothing on me at the time so the frisk was ok, but what about the drug test. I have been smoking marijuana almost everyday since I was 13.  I had also smoked the day I was arrested, I figured I was screwed.  I was taken to a restroom and told to pee in a cup, the problem was I didnt have to pee at the time so I sat down and forced to drink cups of water.  They told me they were going to make me pee.  I sat in a room drinking cup after cup of water for two hours before I had to pee.  I was taken back into the restroom and watched as I pissed in the little cup.  I then was forced to take a shower, put on jump suit, and taken to a cell.  <br><br>
A few days later my new probation officer told me I passed my drug test for all substances and would not be charged with anything else but the battery charge.  I was very confused, how did I pass the drug test.  I had just smoked that day and besides smoking marijuana daily I also took pills quite often. Im guessing the water had to have done something.<!-- End Body -->
