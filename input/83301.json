 "report": "\n\n\n\n[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.] \r\nI have been an IV user for a long time, maybe 3years. I have tried almost every drug there is, Ritalin, Morphine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Benzopiperazine, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates.\r\nGood Things:\r\nRitalin is defnitely one of my personal faves. Of all the drugs I have tried, ritalin is one of the best maybe second to methamphetamine. After it is administered through a syringe and needle in the vein it puts me on an intense rush but after about 10-15mins it wears off a bit and I start clenching my jaw. I usually spend the rest of the night doing random things to pass the time. And I go to sleep the next day, and wake up feeling allryt but generally pretty shit.   \r\nBad Things:\r\nIt makes me stay up for a very long time sometimes days.\r\nFast Heart Rate\r\nDialated Pupils (really obviously wasted eyes)\r\nRandom Behavior\n\n\n"
