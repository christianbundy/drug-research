 "report": "</p>\n[[Erowid Note: IV injection of crushed pills/tablets can be very dangerous due to unknown binders and fillers present in the tablets.] </p><p>I have been an IV user for a long time, maybe 3years. I have tried almost every drug there is, Ritalin, Morphine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Benzopiperazine, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates.</p><p>Good Things:</p><p>Ritalin is defnitely one of my personal faves. Of all the drugs I have tried, ritalin is one of the best maybe second to methamphetamine. After it is administered through a syringe and needle in the vein it puts me on an intense rush but after about 10-15mins it wears off a bit and I start clenching my jaw. I usually spend the rest of the night doing random things to pass the time. And I go to sleep the next day, and wake up feeling allryt but generally pretty shit.   </p><p>Bad Things:</p><p>It makes me stay up for a very long time sometimes days.</p><p>Fast Heart Rate</p><p>Dialated Pupils (really obviously wasted eyes)</p><p>Random Behavior</p>"
