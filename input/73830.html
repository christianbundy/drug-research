I decided to try this tryptamine during the Boom festival 2008. I bought the material from an on-line vendor and I measured the weight with a 0.001 balance. My past experiences with drugs include mdma, lsd, psilocibin mushrooms, dmt, 2cb, methylone and bzp.<br><br>
I took 5 mg of 5-meo-mipt in a gelcap at about 11 a.m. I was very curious to try this material: the reports I found online made me very interested about it. A very good friend of mine was sitting for me. After about 1 hour I could feel just a mild +1, so I decided to take 5mg more. After about 30 minutes I started to feel a soft mdma-like effect. Then we moved toward the lake and I washed myself in the water. After the bath, I did lay down and when I started to see the sky I noticed beautiful fractals in the clouds. I also felt full of joy: I was smiling in front of such a beauty. I kept watching at the sky for about 20 minutes. Then we decided to go to the dance floor. When we arrived, the impact of the psy-trance music was fantastic. I started to dance, feeling very good. The empathy toward the people around me was very clear, but not strong and deep as with mdma. <br><br>
After one hour we went back near the lake. There I met some friends of mine. When I started to talk with them I notices a little bit of difficulty in keeping concentration, in the same way I would under the effect of a small amount of lsd. After a while I decided to lay down on a mat to enjoy the last part of the experience. After a couple of minutes another friend of mine came to me and we had a very nice connection. She took my hands and we exchanged some very gentle caresses. Then she gave me a kiss at my forehead and she went away. <br><br>
I spent the last part of the experience feeling very well, at peace with myself. The experience did last about 4 hours.<br><br>
Conclusion: my opinion is that 5-meo-mipt is a very interesting material and it could be used in psychotherapy. I definitely will take it again.<!-- End Body -->
