Before I write what I am going to write here I will give a little background about myself. I have been using drugs for roughyly 10 yrs now and I've been using Research Chemicals in particular for about 6 years with the most of my personal research being done with AMT, 5-meo-AMT, 5meo-DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-E, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, 4-Ho-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT with many others in between. Throughout time Ive been able to pick each of these well known friends of mine apart; as far as characteristics go, including duration, routes of ingestion, body load, appetite, sleep afterwards, nausea, differences in visual patterns/effects, touching of the soul, ego disturbance/loss, etc. <br><br>
As of recently I had obtained what I was told to be 100mg of 4-Aco-MiPT (dont have a scale). It looked like alot more (which the quantities always do from this good fellow) and I got ALOT of trips out of it). Im glad I made this choice with this chemical. Being there is almost NO research done on it, I was hesitant to purchase it, but then I looked @ it from another light, and I felt that gave me more reason to research Miprocetin. I unburied a beautiful treasure. Out of all the research chemicals I have tried in my day this has got to be my favorite and made the most impact on me. I tried it at many many doses that I was guessing to be 2-40mg (like I said above, no way to b sure on this but Im a master eyeballer) insuflated, orally and rectally. All routes seemed to work about as well as each other. I found oral to b the most sensible with this drug as insuflated burns and rectally,....well its rectally.  Booger sugar style is good for booster dosing tho, aside from the burn. <br><br>
With oral ingestion, the onset never seemed to b consistant, even with empty stomach. Sometimes I would b feeling it within 10min, sometimes it took up to an hour. Although of course some of this could b placebo affect of course. Coming up is a bit rapid and hectic and can involve some shakes and anxiety, but once I get to the top I feel at one with myself and everything around me. I can look just as deeply into myself as I can my surrounding. Some drugs I find limit me towards one or the other. With this drug I have gained more personal insight than with any other drug. Very therapeutic and also very recreational. I found smaller doses of this were nice to be with a few good friends, or even sometimes a party. It opened me up socially (which I have been having troubles with) and broke down many walls in and around me. It brought me out of a deep depression and deep amphetamine addiction and showed me so many things that I had blinded myself to. There are no words to describe the beauty and amazement this drug holds. <br><br>
Peak affects of this drug have lasted me anywhere from 2-8hrs, (~5-10mg=2-4hrs. Anything above 10mg can take u anywhere from 4-8hrs. [boosting can also lead to longer duration, of course]) and then from there the comedown is smooth and short and sleep is good. Next day feels non-hungover, but with a nice lite afterglow that can keep my spirit feeling fresh!  I have noticed little to no body load on this drug, even with heavy doses and what I might call binge using. tehehe<br><br>
P.S. 4-Ho-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT are not as similar IMO as many have said. But thats another story, another post...<br>
