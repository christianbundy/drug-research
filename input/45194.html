When I first started taking phentermine, I was 14 years old. I had never dnoe drugs of any kind before, and I didn't really know what this would do. I just knew that it was illegal without prescription and would make me 'not hungry'. I smuggled some illegaly in to the states from mexico. I wanted to be thin, and at 14, drugs were the obvious way to do it! <br><br>
Phentermine makes me happy, it makes me hyper... and it makes me manic depressive when abused. I developed a tolerance to taking one pill at a time pretty quickly, so I upped the dose to two. I also took it later in the day to give myself something to look forward to at the end of the day. Bad idea. this lead to entire nights where I would be up making lists. Lists of eveything. Lists of things to do, presents to get people for christmas, presents I wanted for christmas, things I should pick up at the store, songs I should download, CD's I should buy, money people owed me... I'd do it all night. I'd clean all night long sometimes. I'd fast for days. My diet was diet coke and speed. What a druggie.<br><br>
I was 145lbs to begin with. I was 115lbs when I realized it was time to stop. For someone who is 5'7'', this is not good. Because I was skeletal. But at the time, I thought I looked great. Eventually, I started to run out and had to weedle myself off of it. I was anorexic and obsessive about the drug so this was difficult.<!-- End Body -->
