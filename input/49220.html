It starts with a buzzing drone, like the spinning of a cd-drive penetrating the air as I feel my body falling out of agency to a state of paralysis. The room is lit by an ethereal light the colour of dark bruises, accentuating the shadows that lay behind the safety and familiarity of my bedroom decor. I know this place. I have been here before but for the first time come armed with the knowledge of eastern philosophy. I know this is no longer my bed, my room, my world, but the deepest antipodes of my mind revealing itself in the twilight between consciousness and sleep. <br><br>
Fear is alive and well. <br><br>
From the dark crevices of the room a creature manifests into significance, its long slender body, elastic in its movements and proportions floats across the room like a black shadow cast on air. The creature hovers just metres from  my bed, twisting, spiraling in slow motion as if it were swimming in a pool of water. I am reminded of the black demons from the movie Ghost, and am certain this is one of them, here to take me away from my world and its attachments, to a dimension unknown. As it moves closer, ever so slowly, a sudden pressure is felt on my legs as if I were being tied down like a hostage. The fear has now risen to fever pitch, but I know that I must somehow let go and allow this creature to take me where it wants, for the destination may reveal to me a place where no ones been, an answer sought after so long that has eluded my inquisitions. <br><br>
To my left it speaks. The voice of an infant, babbling away a series of indecipherable sounds so close to my ear I can feel its breath, pure and chilling, penetrating my defences as try and scream. I fail and continue to hear this voice, chanting now what could be to be a mantra in another tongue, summoning a part of me of which I know I do not own, whose very existence is not defined by abstract names,  symbols or memories. It is I this sentient being is summoning to its world. It is I I do not own, I do not know, I can not define.<br><br>
And all that Ive known, all that Ive held, all that Ive learnt about letting go, of releasing the ego to find this state of enlightenment, morksha, samadhi, heaven, is ripped to shreds, rendered meaningless in the face of a fear so terrifying, only my instincts for survival remain. <br><br>
I try and scream once more but fail. I try and move just an inch, enough to prove to myself I still can but fail once again as the mantra continues, the demon remains. I remind myself I need to stop fighting and let go, for I know deep inside that letting go is the only way to find this ultimate goal, but the fear is too real, the threat too close. I persist in this struggle for waking consciousness; painfully with every aching breath over what feels like several years until finally I wake.<br><br>
The room is now much darker without the presence of the demon or the unseen child. I lie relieved, breathing heavily. Though I can finally move through the security of familiarity, I feel a sense loss, a missed opportunity to go where no ones been. I feel a sense of defeat knowing this philosophy I have learnt and taken upon as the way has failed the ultimate test and can find no euphemism to gloss over the failure. The belief of letting go of ones self I had clung to was merely a ghost, a falling rock I held as both the rock and I tumbled naively through this random chaos conceptualised as life. The instinct to survive, to hold on, to live, rose to the surface as I find my self back at square one, the default state of no belief, no conception, no idea.<!-- End Body -->
