Psychonauts,  I tried dramamine and found it to be absolutely awful.  It is dark and delirious...here is my story.<br><br>
Feeling somewhat depressed and self-destructive, my impulse control was low.  I wanted to be obliterated, but the town was dry...not a hit of acid nor a dose of ecstacy to be found.  I recalled that dramamine, taken in high doeses, gives a dissociative, quasi-hallucinogenic high.  I bought two tubes and consumed 1 and 1/2 tubes.  Over a one-hour period, I began to feel heavy and very out of it...my body was not my own and was very heavy. This was by no means pleasant.  I was overcome with fatigue, and gave in to sleep that was not really sleep but a sort of passing out.  I came to the next day...VERY messed up.  My body was heavy and I had trouble mustering the energy to get out of bed.  My mouth tasted horrible...like the tablets.  I finally forced myself up, and I felt awful.  Tired and dilerious.  Hallucinations would overcome me, the walls would seem to move.  I heard conversations going on in my head...like voices in there were carrying on without my control.  I would close my eyes and see very intense visuals.  My thinking was disordered...I felt like I was mad.  Dramamine is very similar, in my opinion, to Datura...another 'drug' you are better off avoiding.  The dramamine 'trip' lasted that entire next day...I had to avoid friends I saw on the street, because my mind was paralyzed.  I was trapped in a wicked dream that I could not awake from...a waking nightmare.  I regret doing this stupid thing.<br><br>
I want to advise any who read this to think hard about their decisions.  I was a cocky fool who thought I could handle any hallucinogenic experience.  I was wrong.  There are substances out there that are too powerful to fool with...that are retrograde and contrary to the purposes of enlightenment.  They can hurt you.<br><br>
Take my advice, stick to pot.  You are not missing a thing, except for discomfort and regret.  Believe me!!!<!-- End Body -->
