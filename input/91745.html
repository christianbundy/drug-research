Set  Not perfect but Ive had worse. An hours sleep the night before makes me feel sleepy<br><br>
Setting  My House, kids due in from school  busy household  Im used to it<br><br>
T+0.00  Drink 3mgs of dissolved drug<br><br>
T+ 0.10 Faint perceptual changes, continue reading my book.<br><br>
T+ 0.20 Give up on reading as I cant follow the narrative, watch my dogs play fighting, grab a quilt &amp; lie underneath it on the settee, start to feel warm yet shivery, this is a fairly standard physical effect I get from a 2Cxx.<br><br>
T+0.50 Feels warm &amp; relaxed, introspective  then again Im alone with two dogs for company so intellectual discourse is out of the question.<br><br>
T+ 0.55 My wife rings to see if Im dead or ill from ingesting the drug. I toy with the idea of not answering the phone  however I do my duty and confirm that Im alive.<br><br>
T+01.10 I make a ham, mayo &amp; pease pudding sandwich then eat it  delicious  so much so I make another. I have a noticeable tingling up my spine &amp; the nape of my neck. This is feeling quite luxurious now. No visual effect to speak of it just feels good. I consider redosing; I consider for about 5 seconds then decide.<br><br>
T+01.25 - Take another dose of 3.5 mgs in orange juice.<br><br>
T+ 01.50  My kids come in from school  I orient my mind &amp; begin giving standard instructions such as uniform in the wash  take the dogs out  put your bait box in the sink for washing  do any homework you have. My vision is becoming noticeably blurred as the second dose kicks in. Brief CEVs of women  very realistic - like flash frames.<br><br>
Im still perfectly able to carry on conversations so long as I feign tiredness when a I feel theres a slight lag in mental processing before I respond.<br><br>
I find myself in a dreamlike state &amp; retire upstairs to have a bath  the timekeeping breaks down from this point as I got into what I was doing which was more interesting than writing stuff down..<br><br>
Theres a definite aphrodisiac quality to the drug  not in the same league as 2CE but definitely present. I coax my wife upstairs &amp; we spend a while in bed. Orgasms achieved x2  who knows if there wasnt other activities going on (kids in &amp; out of the house dogs barking etc) how that might play out.<br><br>
My wife tells me there is marked pupil dilation.<br><br>
At one point I get a feeling of anxiety  it lasts seconds &amp; is dispelled by a unique sense of wellbeing that seems to emanate from the ether  like a superpowers pick me up.<br><br>
I begin to drift, my mind wanders, there are inferences of mind movie type visuals which dont quite materialise, hopefully some of you will understand this interim state.<br><br>
I find myself a little more clumsy than usual, dropping a couple of things getting entangled in my clothes as I get dressed to go out.<br><br>
We set off into the foggy night  my wife driving  myself sitting with my eyes closed  just concentrating on feeling calm  which works rather well.<br><br>
I think Ive probably overshot the mark for going out maybe 4mgs would have been better suited as my concentration on external things is difficult to maintain.<br>
Anyway we watch the band.<br><br>
T+ 7.45 I suddenly come to life the internalising seems to vanish quite quickly &amp; I find Im up dancing &amp; having a great time &amp; the show ends too soon for my liking.<br>
I find Im fired up in a low key way (I have a tendency to get very fired up &amp; overly positive at times) &amp; I talk most of the way home &amp; chat with three of my kids when we get in, I find myself play fighting with my youngest son.<br><br>
T+8.45 Eat donner kebabs  they taste foul but so moreish  I imagine that cannibalism has a similar effect  you take a bite &amp; think yeuch yet are compelled by some strange force ( AKA greed) to eat more.<br><br>
T+ 9.45  The children are despatched to bed, my older son leaves &amp; goes to his house &amp; we eat a couple of diazepam, some codeine &amp; smoke some dope  which puts my on my back in short order.<br><br>
T+ God knows when  I fell asleep<br><br>
Overall a very positive feeling from the drug, at some points I felt lovely/ laid back blissful, there was some mild confusion at times, though this could have been due to sleepiness &amp; the fact I tend to get confused anyway. I enjoyed it. I shall sample it again in a single higher dose next time and hopefully in a better mindset.<!-- End Body -->
