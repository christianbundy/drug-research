It all happened the night of a university drinking contest. Before I left for the contest I already found myself to be enraged for some reason, but I didn't pay much attention to it and thought : 'well lets  just get hammered again and forget everything'<br><br>
So I set of to the pub and started the contest, I think I had about 15 beers in 3 hours (could have been more). After that we went to a party where I drank some more...and from then on my memory is shattered.<br><br>
So most of what I write now is what people told me afterwards.<br><br>
It was a party organized by some international student association and  apparently I met some foreign students. Those guys had some kind of strong alcohol with them (80%). I dont know if I drank some of it, but I suppose I did. Next thing I remember I'm in my own car with one of those lads driving it !!!! Why? I really really dont know ! Everything went blank from then on and the next thing I know I wake up in a police station.<br><br>
So what happened that night? Apparently we drove to where those foreigners resided for a week, and for some reason I must have REALY flipped out in that building. I tried to bust in a door leading to some sort of television room, it didn't work though so I broke the glass in that door and crawled through it, injuring my hand. Once inside I managed to yank a large wooden board from the wall and smashed the window leading outside with it. <br><br>
At that time some guys who where staying there heard all the commotion and found me there, in a frenzy of anger and despair and the entire room smeared with blood ! They managed to get me to the parking lot and tried to calm me down, cause I was in a SUICIDAL state. They didn't succeed however and had to call the cops (the guys who tried to call me were military for crying out loud !).<br><br>
I can tell you, waking up in jail and hearing that story is not at all funny ! The cops said that witnesses had explained to them that I was running round like a psycho trying to kill myself.<br><br>
This experience of course opened my eyes, I indeed had a SERIOUS problem that needed professional care. <br><br>
Later my dad explained to me that my family had a history of alcohol abuse and suicide, which explains a lot since Ive been having psychological problems my whole life.<br><br>
After that experience I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 months and stopped smoking weed for a week ( I hadn't even had weed that awful night !!!!!), the reason I did stop smoking for a week is that I wanted to grant myself 'a moment of clarity' since I've been smoking every day for 3 years...and wanted to pin point the exact problem in a sober manner before I went into therapy.<br><br>
Therapy indeed seemed to be the sanest solution, I dont wanna walk around like a walking time bomb waiting to kill someone else or myself...<!-- End Body -->
