On a warm summer night in the middle of June, and the last day of school, my 2 friends B and M wanted to celebrate. We got a ride to a rave in the middle of nowhere. Myself being someone who likes to smoke weed and drink, never popped anything. Going to the rave I was aware that people pop, and its kind of the norm for the rave community. But, I had no plans to pop any pills. This rave was around 11 hours long. After hours of dancing, B, M, and I, met  a man who obviously had a bit of a crush on me. He happened to have Molly on him. (since pretty much everyone at the rave scene has some kind of drug on them) He offered me some. <br><br>
I didnt know what Molly was. He told me it was just an intense form of pure ecstasy and it makes you feel really good. I thought Id give it a shot out of pure curiosity. I had no money so he gave it to me for free. I asked if it was laced with anything and he assured me it wasnt. I swallowed it with water and went back to the dance floor waiting for it to kick in. About 25 minutes late it started to kick in. I had serious dry mouth and had to sit down. I got in what is called stuck mode once you sit down, you cant get up. I sat for a long time it felt like. Being verrrryyy talkative with anyone I could talk to. All I wanted to do was talk. I was also very very cold, I had to have a guy give me his jacket. I was shivering and tweaking. I had a binky in my mouth which prevented me from biting my tongue. I had paranoid thoughts and just wanted to lie in my bed. I was scared it was my time to die. I had to have some movement, so I moved my head back and forth uncontrollably. After it wore off I felt so much better. I still had the Molly in my system and still felt dazey, but in a good way. I was happy and energized and buzzed. The last hour was really fun. <br><br>
The first time for me was over all a good experience and I would definitely recommend having water and also have someone to talk to.<!-- End Body -->
