T-0:00<br><br>
I had nothing to do the other night, and I had a old medication sitting in the medicine cabinet. I knew there was some Lyrica in there, and it was scheduled. So I look online, and only found it could have a euphoric effect. I took four of these to make sure I felt something.<br><br>
T-1:00<br><br>
Not much change, but when I look at lights, the light would stay in my eyes when I looked away. So I take two more.<br><br>
T-2:00<br><br>
Still nothing more than before, so I take the last two.<br><br>
T-3:00<br><br>
I thought that would be it so I just went to my bedroom and started spinning a few tracks on my turntables. I found myself dancing, then when I stopped I felt this huge rush of energy flow through my body. I have never felt such a happiness before, I just wanted to dance some more, and get out. I wanted to go out clubbing, so I was looking for some clothes. I thought I was going at 100 miles an hour looking for something, and when I left, I almost fell down the stairs cause I felt so good.<br><br>
I eventually got to the club, and took a .5 mg Xanax that I keep in my wallet for my anxiety, and to make me feel at ease, also to fuck me up even more. When we got to the door, I was already dancing like I was at a rave. Then about half an hour later I took another Xanax. I was still hyped up and was dancing everywhere. I even had the balls to go in the DJ booth and chill with the guy who was mixing. I would never do such a thing when I was sober, but this was a special occasion. The night went on, and I met a whole bunch of people and had a great time. The only reason I am saying this, is because I never go clubbing, and when I have, I never wanted to dance or anything.<!-- End Body -->
