 "report": "<p>Being a bored during the school holidays can lead to interesting discoveries. I was bored so I look for drugs that I could find around the house OR get very cheaply I discovered several substances, among them, Ginger. I thought why not if it did anything it could be interesting and I had nothing to lose so I took it 1 tbsp in a glass of water with some sugar to make it more edible. Instantly I felt a buzzing sensation and as quickly as the sensation had come it went so I sat down by my computer and carried on with what I was doing i.e. surfing this site and talking to friends on msn.</p><p>After about 5 minutes my vision had a slight red tinge and I mean slight, barely noticeable. Everything seemed slower but my I was thinking much faster than normal or so it seemed I was able to type much faster and accurately than normal and I felt rather good although when I tried to think about anything more mystical than the world around me it was hard to stop my mind from wandering into other ideas so I gave up on thinking and had a drink and and went to sleep when I woke up I wasnt feeling the effects.</p>"
