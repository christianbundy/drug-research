I trip sporadically-from every day spanning a week to once every couple months- each time taking in excess of 3 hits.  I usually trip with at least one other person.  My experiences transpire generally with my peers who have dosed smaller amounts than I (e.g. they eat 1-2 tabs while I eat 3-7) and I am much less affected by the drug.  My trips range from no effect at all to a felling of euphoria and/or anxiety accompanied by a most entertaining and subversive train of thought.  Last time I tripped I took 3 hits and my girlfriend took 1 and my trip lasted about an hour and a half.<br><br>
I experienced no visual hallucinations, just a heightened perception of beauty in everything around me, and the usual unsusual and insightful train of thought.  I felt high and happy with no ill effects (I have never experienced any ill effects besides a sore neck probobly from looking around so much).  My girlfriend on the other hand had a very intense trip lasting about 10 hours.  We both took the same acid, and we both smoked the same amount of pot.  The pot seems to have little or no effect on my friends and I while we are tripping.  My girlfriend had finally come down around 5 in the morning and she wanted to smoke some pot.  I used the lavatory, noticed my pupils were no longer dialated and returned to pack up a bong.  We smoked about 3 grams of pot and then my girlfriend freaked out and started crying saying that she was still not finished tripping, but then she came to her senses and began to laugh, thinking that the pot had caused this to occour. (is this possible?) I went to look and sure enough my pupils had widened, but I felt no different.  <br><br>
On a seperate occasion I took 5 doses of lsd and felt nothing but a bout of hot flashes and anxiety.  My pupils never dialated but I did feel dosed.  All effects stopped thereafter and my peers who had taken only 1 hit of acid were bouncing off the walls and they ended up having an 8 hour trip. I ended up going to sleep about 2 and a half hours after consuming the 5 sugar cubes.  <br><br>
I have done a bit of searching and cannot find any explanation behind a tolerance to lsd besides dormant or active pschotic disorders.  I am pretty sure I have no psychotic disorder but I have been told I need to be checked for ADD.  I would like to find out any correlations between tolerance and biological/psychological make up.  I smoke pot every day and meditate occasionally.  If any of you guys has any info on this subject I would be happy to hear it.<!-- End Body -->
