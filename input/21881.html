Dosage: 10g sinicuichi concentrated tea and a little bit of fine greens.<br><br>
Mind Set:  Relief from a long days work.  Highly curious about this new entheogen.<br><br>
Setting:  Alone in my bedroom late at night.  Very chill.<br><br>
Preperation:  15 grams of dried sinicuichi leaves were put in a small aluminum pan of water (48 oz?) with 1500 mg ascorbic acid (vitamin c) to aid in extraction.  Allowed to sit in the sun for a day (it wasnt very hot or sunny that day so i suspect it did not ferment).  Some wild sweet orange herbal tea was added.  Liquid was then boiled down to about 8 oz of the bitterest liquid on the earth with a slight citrus flavor.<br><br>
The Experience:<br><br>
After a hard days work and a long shower i plopped down in my chair in front of my computer.  I smile as I see a cup of nasty tea and a small ubie vaporizer full of herb...<br><br>
10pm - I drink the brew in large gulps followed immediately by swigs of water.  I could only get down about 2/3 of the tea before it threatened to come back up.  I'm not expecting much, so I listen to some chill classical music and waited for what would happen...<br><br>
11:30pm - Vision has a little yellowish tinge.  Still nauseated.  I begin to pick out minute noises in my room (the humming of my computer fan, the ticking of the clock, etc.) and I heard them all work together to create a symphony of ambient noise.  I felt relaxed and my eyes were a little droopy as I had smoked a little bit at 8:45.  But this is something different...  I decide to vaporize my bowl.  By the way, I strongly advocate the use of vaporizers.  I love mine.  But I digress...<br><br>
11:45pm - WOW!  Vision is all oversaturated with yellow and slightly darkened.  Slight chills.  Listening to some classical music.  Bach's 'Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring' comes on and I am filled with this powerful sense of joy and wonder at this music.  The music itself seemed so perfectly fluid and harmonic.  When I closed my eyes, I was instantly shown some amazing closed eye visuals.  A sense of euphoria washed over me as the visuals began to sync with the music I was listening to.  Quite amazing.<br><br>
12:30am - Still enraptured by the music and having closed eye visuals.  Chilly.  I'm listening to The Crystal Method and all the sudden, when one of the big beats hit in the song, I felt as if the music was somehow a flat, 2-dimensional plane that I 'could stretch the music to infinity'.  This was a very profound concept and for a brief moment, I felt like my mind stretched across infinity.  I try to explain this over instant messages to my friend, but he doesn't understand me.  I smile for about five minutes straight.<br><br>
1:30am - I begin to create some crazy-looking digital murals.  I made quite a few of them and they all amaze me.  I am in a state of intense and abstract bursts of raw creativity.  I somehow grasp the concept of another dimension that affects our world, which has yet to be discovered. I am slightly dizzy and my vision is shaky.<br><br>
2:00am - Just before I drift off into a vivid and dreamful slumber, I hear all the ambient noise in my room and conclude that it must be the heartbeat of the universe.<br><br>
Wow.  What a trip.  The sinicuichi was great aside from the nasty taste and nausea.  I think I will try it by itself next time, but it added this absolutely incredible audio awareness and appreciation for music.  My herb and the sinicuichi synergized beautifully.  It must have greatly exaggerated my high as I had only smoked a little, but was very high indeed.  Walking was a little difficult.  No hangover at 8am the next morning either.  Great stuff!  I recommend this herb for anyone looking for a awe-inspiring musical experience.  If taken in higher doses, I am sure some profound entheogenic experiences could happen.  Hey, it's relatively inexpensive and still legal (sniff..... I will miss salvia).  Anyone know about any MAOI interactions?<!-- End Body -->
