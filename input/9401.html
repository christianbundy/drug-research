Current time 4:10pm<br><br>
At 10:30 am this morning I began to grind and consume what would be 10 nutmeg nuts. I put 1 ½ nuts into hot water and milk with lots of sugar. I began to drink it. It was disgusting. It wasnt so much the taste that I couldnt stand just the feeling that I was going to throw up a few seconds after it reached my stomach. With this method of ingestion I decided to bomb the rest of the nutmeg (wrap the powder in rolling papers and swallow them like capsules).<br><br>
10:30 am to 12:30 PM Wednesday- ground nutmeg and bombed it. Total 5 nuts.<br><br>
12:45 PM- used Internet to see other peoples nutmeg experiences and the amounts they took. Decided have more nuts.<br><br>
1:15 PM to 3:25 PM- ground and consumed more nuts. Total 10 nuts.<br><br>
3:30 PM- no change. Decided to watch TV.<br><br>
3:50 PM- started to feel slightly stoned. Light sinking feeling. Decided to write up experience so far.<br><br>
4:10 PM- started writing. Now feel very stoned- like ive had a 2/3 spliffs. No nausea. Eyes not red.<br><br>
4:15 PM- quite difficult to concentrate. Mind feels blank.<br><br>
5:45 PM- just been for a walk. Almost got hit by a bus. Getting very hard to write.<br><br>
6:25 PM- Feel VERY VERY stoned. Very difficult to write. Eyes turning red. Will definitely use as a weed substitute.<br><br>
9:25 PM- hard to keep my balance. Feels like my heads floating off the rest of my body. I walked my girlfriend to her bus stop (she was going to work). I couldnt tell how far away she was from me. Feel tired. Feels quite trippy. Better than MJ buzz. Felt a bit it intense at times. Walked into a few lampposts and bins.<br><br>
10:00 PM- very clear closed eye visuals rapidly changing into different things (mostly geometrical).<br><br>
8:00 am Thursday- woke up in bed. Cant remember much before I fell sleep. Still feel very stoned.<br><br>
9:00 PM- still feeling stoned and very relaxed. Keep having very clear memories from my childhood that make me feel VERY comforted and warm.<br><br>
1:15 PM Friday- feel a lot more normal. Still a little stoned though. Feel lazy and occasionally dizzy when I stand up.<!-- End Body -->
