 "report": "<p>I got my yohimbe in the mail awhile ago and was looking for something stronger that coffee and a new experience. Well I found it. The yohimbe had been ground to a very fine powder and it was reddish-brown. It smelled like dirt and spices, cloves? I put some on my tongue, not bad tasting but I played it safe and gel-caped in about 15 caps with .5-.7 grams each.  It was 10 at night and I did not want to stay up all night.</p><p>The next day I was going to work. I'm a cook at a very nice hotel where the atmosphere is hot and sometimes tense. With orders being yelled at you and the need to get it all right and done fast.</p><p>+10 minutes into my shift I took 1 pill, minor stimulation after 40 minutes, kind of lousy for what I thought this stuff did or lack of info I knew.</p><p>Then got some hot water in mug and cracked open 2 cap and dumped the powder into the water. It turned a very dark color and the tasted and smell were better that coffee (but that's not saying much). I downed it all in about 2 minutes. The reason I made tea is it would take a least 20 minutes for the gel-caps to dissolve and a another 15 or more to kick in.</p><p>+20 min it was kicking in and I felt energized. Mild but it got stronger quick.</p><p>+30 min I was moving faster and wanted to keep moving can stop now but it was a slow day at the hotel and very little orders were coming in.</p><p>+40 min I got a erection it was not self-induced. I was happy the yohimbe lived up to its name.</p><p>A little latter a co-worker came in and took over. I was cleaning up, the feeling in my pelvis area was very noticeable but is was not painfully so.</p><p>I went downstairs to the bathroom and had to masturbating. The pressure in my groin was growing even stronger, walking around was humorous (I thought so). Splat in my hand at 3 min into masturbating. WOW that was some good jerking off. I washed up and went back to work. (I know I was working in a hotel kitchen but if you're a guy you know what I'm talking about when you just have to. Theres  stuff go on, you just never know what those cooks do back there)</p><p>+ 1 hour I was folding boxes my face was red and I was sweating. The yohimbe was even more powerful effect now. I took my heart rate it was about 90 beats a min. I was folding the boxes like a mad man. Man I was jittery and felt tired but energized at the same time. Part of my body were cold like the back of my neck. My legs were sore and my groin was throbbing.... Down to the bathroom again. This time was different I lasted a whole 6 min (I timed myself) and the same more but powerful eruption happened. After that was done my face was beet red and my breathing heavy I sat on the toilet seat trying to catch my breath. I went outside to take a break the weather was good and the cool breeze felt nice.</p><p>+1.30 hours the effects were wearing off but I say I was about 60% from baseline that's when I went and typed up the report.</p><p>+2 hours about 40% from baseline feeling like I had 2 cups of coffee just now my body is feeling fine no tiredness or sore legs.</p><p>As for yohimbe I liked it. I will use it again but not for awhile.</p>"
