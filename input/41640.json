 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI recently obtained some 4-Ho-DiPT and was very eager to try it. Ive had a fair amount of experience with drugs. Ive done weed, alcohol, shrooms, meth, speed (pills), coke, various opiates, Salvia, DXM, LSA, MDMA, 2C-I, and a few others.\r\nOne night I arrived home from school at about 10:00 pm. I was in a pretty good mood; school had gone great (my grade became a B from a C that day) so I didnt have any of the negative vibes I normally have from school. I should also mention that the last time I ate was 5-6 hours before dosing.\r\nI had 30 mg of 4-Ho-DiPT to work with and planned on talking 20 mg and maybe taking the additional 10 mg if I felt like I could handle it. The half hour leading up to dosing was spent preparing the area and glimpsing over a few trip reports to see exactly how long it takes to kick in.\r\n10:30 pm - I ingested 20 mg spread onto a piece of peanut butter bread. This disguised the taste quite well.\r\n10:45 pm - Im definitely feeling it. I feel very alert, and happy. +1, but quickly approaching a +2. I had a few hits of reefer at this point.\r\n11:00 pm - Over the last 15 minutes effects had slowly grown and now I was in a full +3 state. At this point I was almost peaking and felt fantastic. Amazing tactile sensations surpassing any drug Ive ever done. It proved difficult to sit still, and so I paced back and forth a lot. The OEVs were reminiscent of MDMA (ecstasy), only stronger. No real hallucinations yet, other than light related, although everything does have a very surreal look to it. I looked at my eyes and the black part filled my entire eye.\r\n11:15 pm - I decided I was up to taking 10 mg more, so I had 10 mg on another piece of bread. I tried closing my eyes and was greeted by some faint hallucinations. These visuals are hard to describe. I could see something moving around but could really tell what it was. It was very fascinating nonetheless, and Id lose myself in the CEV world and snap back to reality. The first time I snapped back I was greeted by an amazing OEV. I looked up at my ceiling, which is textured, and it was flowing in small waves or currents like water. A few minutes later I snapped back again and stared at the ceiling, this time it was breathing rather than flowing like water. I closed my eyes and opened them again and there was very little movement on the ceiling, just a slight distortion.\r\n11:30 pm - I explored my house a bit and stared out the window into the neighborhood. Looking across the street I thought I had seen lights turn off at their house, but I couldnt be sure in this state. Right outside the window are two big trees, and I spent probably 5 - 10 minutes just staring at these trees. They somehow seemed wise, and seemed very majestic. They also moved around a bit. This very much reminded me of looking at trees while on shrooms. I decided to play guitar at this point, and found I was too jittery to play well, and gave up quickly.\r\n11:45 pm - 12:30 am - This time was spend wandering my house and also laying down with my eyes closed. I found myself having extremely bizarre thoughts, and my memory was horrible. I also had some minor paranoia where I felt like something was there, and would see things behind me. It was very strange. Ive heard of this happening on acid, and was glad I finally experienced it. I was also having a constant inner dialogue with myself which I found very amusing and humorous. I dont remember most of these thoughts I had, but do remember one: I was thinking about whether itd be possible to sneak drugs into space if you were an astronaut. I got a picture in my mind of an astronaut strapped to chair for blast-off which drugs secretly hidden in his space suit. Then I got to thinking how itd be impossible to do drugs with no gravity because theyd just float away. Then I realized you'd have to inject everything you take, so you cant be an astronaut pothead. I had all sorts of similarly strange thoughts going on throughout the night. Also, my brain kept confusing what order to do things. This made doing simple things, like getting a cigarette and ashtray, very difficult. As a testament to this, the next day I found the peanut butter in the fridge and a can of Pepsi in the cupboard.\r\nMusic. I just want to mention that at most points during this trip I was listening to music. The music euphoria was nice, and songs seemed amazingly good. I listened to mostly Hallucinogen, Shpongle, SYNsun, Pink Floyd, and Velvet Underground.\r\n12:30 am - 1:00 am - Decided to play a video game (Counter Strike to be precise). In this game you can talk to other people via microphone and I was cracking up laughing at things people said, which normally I wouldnt find funny. It was hard playing with jittery hands, but enjoyable anyway.\r\n1:00 am - 1:30 am - I went out on my deck and smoked a couple cigarettes, and listened to some old Indian (the country) and Chinese music. Being outside with nature was a powerful feeling. Everything had beauty, despite it being very dark and winter time. I would love to try an outdoor trip in the woods on this drug. I think itd be perfect for it.\r\n1:30 am - 2:30 am - Just laid down and closed my eyes and listened to some music, and smoked a bowl.\r\n2:30 am - 3:00 am - The drug is slowly wearing off, although I was still very messed up.\r\nBy 3:30 am to 4:00 am the drug is pretty much completely worn off. I definitely feel some after effects, but nothing significant. I got a very mild headache at this point which went away after smoking some more ganja.\r\nThis drug is definitely something Id like to experiment further with. It was somewhat similar to shrooms, but also very different. If I had to compare it with drugs Ive done Id say its kinda like 2C-I and shrooms (not implying actually combining the two). This drug gave me the most powerful tactile sensations Ive ever experiences, but at times it was overwhelming. It only became overwhelming when sitting still though (moving around made it fine). This is the only real negative aspect I noticed. All in all it was a great experience, and Id do it again in a heartbeat, and I probably will.\n\n\n"
