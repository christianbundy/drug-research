I had heard alot about kava good and bad.<br><br>
After alot of research I found a supplier of high quality kava (the stuff at local stores or health food markets is useless) and got a good receipe.<br><br>
First of all the kava must come from a plant that is at least 3 years old to have any stimulating effects. Secondly it must be prepared correctly. I took 2 ozs. of 6 year old ground kava root and 1 quart of water (heated to 170 degrees F) never boil it will kill the chemicals.<br><br>
I put in a blender and blended on high for 5 minutes (must have a high quality blender). After blending I took some frozen pinapple juice that I put in ice cube trays, (about 10 cubes), 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 shot rum, and 3 tablespoon of honey, blended again for I minute. I drank in gulps of 1/2 cups, shaking the blender container before each pour (must always do this as the stimulating properties are not water soluble).<br><br>
The effects are wonderful. Deeply relaxing, both body and mind. Numbing of mouth, and muscle relaxation are also other effects. The buzz is very social and I simply feel wonderful. Also with the right kava there is no hangover, although i have had viscious hangovers with other kava.<br><br>
The buzz lasted 4-6 hours. I got the receipe and kava from a woman in the islands of Vanuatu and believe me the product and preperation are key, otherwise I spend time drinking stuff that taste like bitter dishwater that does nothing at all.<!-- End Body -->
