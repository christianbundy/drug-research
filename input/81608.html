I started using around the end of my eight grade year. My friend is a complete druggie now. She had been begging my to try any drug with her and I agreed to skittles because I didn't think cough medicine would be too serious. The first time I took 5 pills of Corocidin and woke up fine. I kept using it because at first I was fine. I kept taking that dose too, 150 mg.<br><br>
After about my fifth time using them I woke up and was still a little buzzed. I thought I'm never touching them again, but when I asked my 'friend' (the same one who got me into them) if I would be ok, she told me it was all in my head and that it was from lack of sleep, so after about a week or 2 I tried them again and woke up the same, still buzzed. Soon, school started and used them about 2 more times, after each time I stayed a little higher and higher.<br><br>
Since the first time, it has been about 2 and a half months since the first time I stayed buzzed, yesterday I smoked weed with my boyfriend for the first time, and I felt a tiny bit higher then my normal and I still feel it....we smoked over 24 hours ago. Im terrified because I think I should say something to my parents because the only thing Ive found anywhere near CLOSE to my case is wet brain or brain damage, but Im scared my parents will FLIP. Im only a freshman in high school and Im in all honors classes.<!-- End Body -->
