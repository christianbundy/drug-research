Brennan B,18, was a classmate of mine since freshman year. on december 28, 2001, Brennan went to Jimmy's, a bar uptown.  He was partying, getting drunk, enjoying the end of the year.  Soon he was outside purchasing GHB.  The GHB was inegested .<br><br>
As the evening progressed, Brennan became 'overly intoxicated', and was escorted outside.  Outside Jimmy's, Brennan collapsed.  He sat there not breathing for 30 MINUTES. He was taken to Charity Hospital, comatose.  When they tested his brain for activity, there was none.  Brennan was brain dead.  Nothing could be done to save him.  On January 8, 2002, they turned off the machine that breathed for him.  I attended his wake on January 10.  I never would have thought as a freshman, that I would be attending this kid's wake, and that this kid would die from the mixture of GHB and alcohol, months shy of his 19th birthday, and his graduation.  The Times Picayune reported yesterday that <removed> was arrested for the unintentional death of Brennan.  B faces 20 years for selling the GHB that killed Brennan.  He didn't even make it to the new year.<!-- End Body -->
