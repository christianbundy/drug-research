I'm about to travel to a malaria heavy region, so I've been taking Mefloquine. Given its reputation of inducing psychosis and suicidal thoughts, I was a bit hesitant to mix with psychedelics. <br><br>
I had not had any problems with the Mefloquine, although my dreams have been very visually vivid and more memorable than usual. Given this relatively mild reaction, I decided to give 2C-B a try. I had tried 2C-B once before, but I'm not sure what the dose was. I believe it was quite a bit smaller than this time around.<br><br>
It was the last night of a small 3 day outdoor trance festival. I was surrounded by familiar and friendly faces, good music, lots of pretty lights, and colorful costumes. I had had a couple of drinks and joints over the course of the day, but I was relatively sober. <br><br>
I took the 2C-B in two capsules, equal doses, totalling roughly 27mg, separated by just over an hour. I began coming up about the same time I took the second capsule. There were three of us that were tripping 'together,' but we were all at different places: one was mixing MDMA with 2C-B, I was just doing 2C-B, and the third was taking the same dose of 2C-B but about an hour behind my schedule.<br><br>
The overwhelming feature of this trip was the strength of my visuals, particularly when my eyes were closed. I felt mostly lucid intellectually, but I found myself not wanting to do anything aside from lie on my back and stare at the beautiful images on the insides of my eyelids. Tried to dance for a while, but quickly gave up. People tried to converse with me, but I was not particularly interested. The lasers, stars, clouds, and moon were much more compelling to me than conversation. As I stared at the sky there were multiple points where I had no idea whether I was looking at clouds or just inventing the clouds myself. When I looked at the grass I saw an elaborate Persian rug.<br><br>
This tendency toward staying still and just looking at things is typical for me when it comes to psychedelics. As I came down I wandered around with my tripmates, until the urge to dance took precedence over my urge to look. I danced for a few hours until my legs were jelly, then laid down near the dance floor for another hour or so before going to bed.<br><br>
By the time I went to bed I thought I was back to sobriety, but my Closed Eye Visuals continued as I fell asleep.<br><br>
I would definitely repeat this experience, but I would recommend caution if you're not accustomed to strong visuals.<br><br>
Also, I would have done well to remember that Smart Trippers Shit First.<!-- End Body -->
