Ok. I'm still on top of the world while I'm typing this, but I thought it would be a good idea to record some observations I've made about cocaine usage.<br><br>
I've used a lot of shrooms, some E, smoke hashish regularly but otherwise try to keep myself in shape. I use cocaine rarely, like once every 6 months. Tend to buy like 3 grams and spread it out over a short week. Use pills against high blood pressure regularly.<br><br>
Now, I came home from the new years eve party (slightly drunk) with 3 grams in my pocket from a friendly dealer, and it had been at least 6 months since the last time. I was excited, since I hadn't used much at the party. I tend to use drugs privately under controlled conditions with people I know well, or alone. I put on some calm Oakenfold house music and snorted the first line.<br><br>
The stuff was really excellent! That line made me the king of the world again, like last time. I immediately recalled everything from last time, the good and bad stuff.<br><br>
Now, the good stuff is that you feel you can do anything. I made complete sketches for a work project that I had been struggling with for some weeks in half an hour. I managed to convert the condo from a disaster area to a place where you can live in two hours. Cleaning is almost fun while on cocaine. And I spend a lot of time thinking, really fast, about what's bugging me. Sometimes it gets me really emotional, but that doesn't matter.<br><br>
The bad stuff... the main problem with cocaine (at least for me) is how to handle the comedown. I usually stop taking it when it doesn't get me any higher or doesn't keep me at the top anymore. There's no point in wasting more money, save it for tomorrow (at least at $120 gram here in Norway). The comedown really stinks. My brain seems to slow down to normal speed again, removing all the fast, snappy input and thinking. This really stinks, I mean, minutes back I was the quickest head in the world! For me, this is best tackled by smoking a lot of weed and playing ambient music. Bedtime 3 hours after stopping, they tend to be 3 really hard hours. Time doesn't pass, the mind is out of order. Slightly like a heavy shroom trip when my ego is totally gone, but I find that interesting and mind-boggling, not nasty like the cocaine comedown.<br><br>
And the stuff I do tend to be very half-hearted. Cleaning the place in 2 hours sure is great, but I do sloppy work. Remember, I'm the king of the world and don't do any mistakes! At least for some hours... That has to be taken into account, like with all (illegal) drugs, there are always pros and cons.<br><br>
Haven't noticed any side effects regarding the high blood pressure pills I take regularly, but it's a bit hard to tell since I've used them for several years, and have never done cocaine without them.<!-- End Body -->
