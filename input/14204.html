Alcohol is by far my substance of choice. But I don't really like being drunk. I drink to relax and to be social. I do drink quite frequently, so to the average person I'd appear to be an alcoholic, which I'm not. I just really, really, love beer. I usually drink to the point where I feel relaxed, slightly tipsy, more talkative, and warm-feeling. This usually occurs after about four or five 'lite' beers. Regular or Ice beer just gets me too drunk. I prefer not to drink it.<br><br>
Being really drunk is almost like being delirious to me. I slur every word, I say or do things you may later regret, my balance is fucked, and sometimes I make an ass out of myself. <br><br>
But if I am at a party and the alcohol is flowing heavily, I know I may end up drinking more than I planned. When I go to parties, I drink all night long and into the next morning without even feeling wasted or spilling my drink on the floor, with no hangover whatsoever. Here's how:<br><br>
1. Pace myself, because an alcohol buzz can really creep up on me, especially drinks made with hard liquor. <br><br>
2. When I reach the point of feeling pleasantly intoxicated (warm, happy, sociable, relaxed), I stop drinking. This is the best part of an alcohol buzz. If I must sip on something (which I do) I usually fill my beer bottle with water. I always drink out of brown bottles so no one ever sees me do it. <br><br>
3.Water is extremely beneficial to an alcohol drinker. Alcohol can seriously dehydrate me, therefore it is necessary to stay hydrated. Also, as mentioned above, it speeds the elimination process so I don't end up getting real stupid-drunk. So between my drinks, I take a few gulps of water. And before bed, drink at least two 12-oz. glasses.<br><br>
Some people like that sloppy drunk feeling. Not me. I do love beer more than anything in the world, but to me, being really drunk kinda sucks.<!-- End Body -->
