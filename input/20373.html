A little background information - I have used DXM from age 15 to 22 habitually, meaning I had used almost everyday from 190mg to 900mg. I stopped because all the fun effects had disappeared and was left with being overly hyperactive, long term memory loss, and extremely underweight. <br><br>
December something, 1996 I had been convicted of minor in possession. The judge required me to get treatment including drug tests. I smoked some grass for the last time on New Years Eve. Now if you ever visited Rhode Island, you'd understand that marijuana isn't just marijuana. Dealers shove every possible chemical from lysol to PCP. Supposedly the stuff we smoked had PCP in it. All I remember doing was laughing for two hours straight because my ass was tickling the floor. <br><br>
January 10, 1997 was the first drug test. I knew that the pot should have come up but I wasn't expecting the results that we got. I tested positive for morphine, pcp, 6-acytel-morphine, marijuana, and nicotine. The only time I knew that I used herion was two years previously so I was extremely surprised that it showed up. I knew that dxm had characteristics of both pcp and morphine but didn't think that it would show up especially in the levels that it did.<br><br>
After that wonderful experience I wouldn't use dxm until after the test and would try to skip it all together the day before. I never had another positive result until after probation when my parents were still screening me and I got careless. I don't remember if pcp or herion should up the second time around but it wasn't high enough to concern anyone besides my counselor which pissed and moaned for an entire hour about how using drugs wasn't helpful. Meanwhile I am sitting there watching his face morph into colors and animals.<!-- End Body -->
