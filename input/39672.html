Underwhelmed<br><br>
10mg 5-MEO-DALT - <br><br>
Taken sublingually - interestingly enough this is the only phenethylamine or tryptamine whose taste is tolerable. Its like MDMA but less bitter and way less strong.<br><br>
Went for a walk to a cafe then came home, watched a Yo Yo Ma DVD then went to bed with my  girlfriend who was already sleeping.<br><br>
I felt a slight buzz in the chest, slightly like MDMA but not necessarily pleasant, totally missing the silkiness of MDMA. Watching the movie was a bit harder, and I had no enhanced appreciation of music which is one of the most amazing effects of  phenethylamines and tryptamines for me.<br><br>
I felt a slight increase in sexual energy but not really libido. My girlfriend was already asleep so I didn't investigate further.,<br><br>
Total time 3 hours<br><br>
30mg 5-MEO-DALT<br><br>
Taken with 2 teaspoons of G ( less than 2 grams ).  Felt a very faint trippiness. Found it harder to follow conversations in sort of a tweaked way, not in a surreal way.  I had energy to dance but it was a bit rigid, not the wonderful melting into the music of MDMA.  For a few seconds, 10 maybe, I thought peoples faces were changing in a trippy way but then everything was normal.<br><br>
Went home and definitely felt like appreciating my girlfriend but though it seemed to increase my interest in closeness, it didn't increase my libido, but didn't impeded it either.<br><br><br>
Total time 4 hours<br><br>
The effects seem so subtle, I'm almost wondering if  5-MEO-DALT is a joke from Shulgin that maybe it doesn't do anything. On the other hand my girlfriend said I was acting different. I'd say it does a bit of everything (except music appreciation) but doesn't do any of them in an interesting way - I felt a bit amped, a bit trippy thoughts, a bit of CEVs, more appreciation of color, a desire to be closer to others, but none of it jelled or was pleasant. It does seem to be like a good beginners substance because it gives a hint but is totally underwhelming. On the other hand it might make substances seem too safe and easy.<!-- End Body -->
