My local headshop sells along with its amazing collection of glass pipes, various 'legal' herbal extracts and blends. Most notably, Salvia. A couple week's prior to the incident which warranted this report; I had purchased a gram of 10x extract, with the direction to 'sprinkle it on top of your herb'. I introduced salvia to my friends that night and asked them if they wanted to try it; of course the answer was yes, we smoked three or four bowls with salvia extract on top. Things seemed sparkly, kind of like shrooms in a way, but only lasted about 5 minutes. I felt pretty cheated having paid around 20 dollars for this gram of extract.<br><br>
A week or two later I was in my headshop again and told the owner, whom I used to be quite cool with, about how I thought his sh*t was overpriced and bunk. His immediate response; 'Well man, did u smoke it outa a water pipe or just your piece?' I admitted that I'd smoked out of my piece. He insisted I take an in store sample. He pulled out a bong from under the counter, loaded it up with a large hit of 10x, he told me to hit it as hard as I could and hold it. I easily complied with this order, it tasted like a tire on the way out. I felt light headed followed by a feeling like I was swimming through the air, I waved my arms around and marveled at this experience.<br><br>
I started walking towards the counter when all of a sudden gravity decided it was time to remind me of it's fundamental principals. I stumbled, and before I hit the ground 'reality' as I know it disapeared. I had become part of a wall of faces that I understood to be the 'lego layers' of hell time. I was attached to this wall, by most notably my mouth, which seemed to be stuck in the open position. Womens voices repeated 'It's ok Alex, it's ok Alex.' Things did not seems ok at all. I tried to speak but couldn't, finding that my mouth was part of this wall, then a large deep mans voice screamed from somewhere close to the wall; 'WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP!!!??' I was scared sh*tless, It was around then that the faces above me started pounding. Or landing, Im not sure, on my head. <br><br>
Then gradually I started coming back into the shop, I slowly turned my head to see the head shop dude, who looked like a lego pirate man, staring at me. My first words were; 'When can I leave?' which came out sounding like I had down-syndrome. His response 'It's only been about twenty minutes'. I then realized that my head was in my girlfriends lap, and she was gently caressing my hair. Which accounts for the falling faces on my head. I moved into a sitting position and sat there for about 10 minutes, dazed at what had just happened to me. I then decided that a cigarette was extremely nesesary, and stumbled out the door.<br><br>
I hop'd into my car and turned on the radio, my girlfriend jumped into the seat next to me. It was cold in the car and I was wearing a t-shirt, I slipped the arm not holding the cigarette into my shirt. A minute later I had forgottin this and thought I had lost an arm somehow. It was around then my girlfriend (half crying) told me what actually happened on the outside world. She said I looked like I was having fun till I turned towards the counter, where she said she could see that I looked like 'a scared animal', she said I then fell over with my mouth and eyes as wide open as possible, and started drooling and twitching, she said she thought I was going to die. I had to agree with her that indeed for about 20 minutes I was pretty sure that that was exactly what HAD happened. <br><br>
It took about 40 minutes in the cold car and 3 cigarettes before I could bring myself to drive us home. I am extremely experienced with drugs. You name it, shrooms, coke, x, acid, of course weed and a few others. After this happened to me, my bowls were all given to grateful friends, and I have been sober ever since. This is not just mind altering it's life altering. I am damaged and will never be the same.<!-- End Body -->
