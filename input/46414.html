After a long hard day of school, my friend went uptown to the local herbalist and bought as much Damiana as he could buy (at 1$ an ounce, who could go wrong?), and after he had aquired said herb, we sat down on his back porch and proceeded to imbibe as copious amounts of the herb as possible. <br><br>
After smoking one joint of it, which was double rolled, because he found the Damiana whole herb to be incredibly hard to roll into a cigarette, we followed it with two more bowls of his corn-cob pipe. The Damiana smoke is, to me as well as my friend who is well known in the ways of Cannabis, fairly harsh. We both ended up coughing out a large part of each of our hits. After smoking the herb, we both were completely coherent and talking to eachother, describing the 'high' as being 'stoned, but then not'. <br><br>
The way my friend put it, 'I start to notice the complete stillness of everything', it makes me zoned, but yet also completely able to still function.<!-- End Body -->
