I had previously tried PCP, or 'boat' 'wet' and 'water' (etc) as it is commonly called where I live, but only a minimal amount and as a chaser with Ecstasy, alcohol and marijuana. Needless to say I couldn't distinguish any effects. <br><br>
So I decided to try it alone.  My friends had purchased the 'dipper' and soaked a cigarette in the liquid.  They had already smoked one on their way back to the house and I had not noticed any signs of impairment, mental or otherwise, aside from one's gait, which had seemed clumsy and robotic.<br><br>
It was one cigarette between the three of us.  I gave it a few tokes, and carefully, knowing all the stories of depersonalization and delirium.  After it was down to filter I just felt slow, extremely relaxed and tranquil.  I amused myself by running my nails along the suede couch in my friend's livingroom.  I don't know if I wrote words or designs, and it really didn't matter at the time.  The atmosphere seemed shroud in clouds of grey and metallic blue.  My friend sat next to me, on her cellphone and involved in a rather spirited conversation the entire time while her older sister fell asleep on the loveseat across from us.  <br><br>
A few hours later they had purchased two more cigarettes for the three of us and had rolled up a blunt. I was far less anxious and less conservative with my inhales this time around.  By the time the second cigarette was filter I was in a state of complete sedation.  I must have sat with my face in the same lifeless expression for minutes, any movements I made were very concentrated and mechanical, and sounds, along with my own thoughts, were reduced to a single frequency.  Atmosphere escaped reality, and vice versa; not in a chaotic way but paradoxical as everything was suspended but remained at an absolute standstill.  There was no sense of panic or dissociation, just peacefulness.<br><br>
Somewhere amid this, my friend had sparked up the blunt and after a few pulls on that I decided to walk to make sure I still could.  Around the table, pass the couch, make a turn, it all seemed so precise.  I looked at myself in the mirror and got really close almost touching the glass with my nose.  I closed my eyes halfway, squinting at my reflection and I almost didn't recognize myself, but it was only for a split second and I wasn't in a mindset to be at all freaked out.  I walked back to the sofa and returned to my original position; sitting.<br><br>
Which I did for the next few hours.<br><br>
Having never really tried it, and hearing the stories from those whom had smoked either boat water or the 'dust', I was expecting to have to compensate and replace a preoccupation with death and insanity to achieve a peaceful high, but the latter was all I got.<!-- End Body -->
