It was getting near the end of the school year, when in my last period class of the day I got called out for an early dismissal. I had to get 4 teeth pulled because I was going to get braces. I was very nervous because the 2 teeth I had pulled before this time hurt very badly, even with the novacain and everything. So I got to the office and sat and waited. I felt very nervous and wanted to get this over with. I finally had my name called and i went to sit in the chair. The doctor offered Nitrous this time, and I agreed to using it. So they put the mask over my nose.<br><br>
I had a tiny bit of difficulty pulling in air with the mask over my nose and everything. It was a steady stream of nitrous and oxygen. A few moments later I heard the nurse say, 'Get ready to float around the room John.' But to my surprise, I did alot more than 'float around' the room. I was looking at a painting of a victorian style house on the wall. When all the sudden my vision became distorted and very fuzzy. My limbs became tingly starting at my feet and moving up to my arms. And for the first time in my life I had a tingly, 'pins and needles' feeling in my head, that I usually get in my feet or hands. The generator for the gas made a loud buzzing sound, which started to sound extra bold and loud. I could hear and feel the vibrations of the generator, and it started to echo. Then I started losing touch with the real world, and all I could hear was the buzzing of the generator.<br><br>
Then, I blacked out. I was gone from reality, all my awareness was gone. I wasn't aware of my own presence. Everything was black and I was in another world or dimension. 'I'm dead, but why?', I thought to myself. I started to panic, believing that I died and went to hell. There was nothing. I couldn't move, couldn't think, couldn't do anything except look into the blackness. I started to think of positive things in my life, like the girlfriend I had at the time or my family. I thought 'So this is what death is, nothingness.' It was an out of body experience. It was like all that existed was my soul, nothing else.<br><br>
Then, I started seeing my mouth, and saw my teeth talking to each other, babbling about who was going to get pulled and what not. This for some reason was very important. Then, I could feel myself falling from a black cliff. And I could feel my breathing, which felt like, long, giant inhales. My tongue was hanging on to this cliff, and the more I dropped, the longer my tongue stretched, and the farther I feel into the nothingness. Then I saw a red dot in the corner of my spirtual world, then I saw the sealing, and the doctor, and I found myself laughing at the doctor. I thought that he had finished the procedure, and that I've been laying their for hours, maybe days, maybe a life time. He said to the nurse, 'Turn back the gas a little bit, we knocked him out.' I was back to reality, and I asked him if the procedure was done, and he told me that he didn't start yet, because I wouldn't open my mouth. I had only been unconscience for no more than 40 - 45 seconds. This made me angry, knowing that I went to hell and back, and the doctor couldn't even pull a few teeth. He finished and I left feeling a little light headed. But it was an experience I will never forget.<!-- End Body -->
