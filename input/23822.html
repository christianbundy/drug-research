Too much, at one stage in my life I did not believe that a person could take too much of xtc as it every time I consumed it gave me another wonderful experience.<br><br>
I am currently 39 years of age and took my first xtc tablet when I was 18, and kept on going strong throughout the years.  I always have had wonderful experiences with xtc and never felt the need to change to another drug or mix it with anything else.<br><br>
I would like to share this experience with you I had on a Friday evening in December 2002.  This evening changed my life forever, and although I still take xtc on the odd night I hope that some of you can learn something of my story.<br><br>
During the year 2002 I went through quite some trouble with my marrige and my job and the dosage of xtc taken at one time increased tremendously as the drug was simply not effective to me anymore. I have heard this from several people who started taking 1 or 2 at the time and kept increasing the quantity to get the same old good trip.<br><br>
Anyway back to the evening in question, I had worked the whole evening till about 01h00 and decided to join my friends for an outside Hard house party in a near forest.  I had my dealer drop 10 tablets at work of which I swallowed 5 at about 01h30 and left straight for the party.  At the party I just danced and danced more and decided that the intake of 5 tablets will not carry me through the night and took 5 more round about 03h00.  My last recollection of anything sensible was at about 03h30, thereafter I cannot remember much.  One of the pleasures and the reason why I never had the urge to change or mix my drugs is that after tablet # 5 I start hallucinating more than I do on LSD, and the trip is so much better for me.  <br><br>
I remember sitting on a bench of some kind, looking at a big bottle of water, and as you all know water is good when your on pills, my problem however was that the bottle wasn't mine and that I was quiet paranoid about just picking up someones bottle of water without getting permission.  Anyway against my will I decided to just take a sip and put it right back, so I reached for the bottle and it didn't want to move, and I thought oh, no now everyboy will see that I was trying to steal water from someone elses bottle.  I continued trying to lift the bottle off the floor, but it just didn't want to move.  I was then tapped on the shoulder and asked what the hell I was trying to do by pulling a girls leg.  I could not believe it. Thank god these people were really understanding and offered me some water afterwards.  This happened round about 6am.  Between 6am and 10am the next morning I do not recollect what happened.<br><br>
10AM my name is being called, Danny you got to go to work! shit.  My friends who had taken me to their apartment from the party had left someone into the building that worked with me that didn't know I did drugs.  This person took me to into the shower washed me and dressed me thinking I was drunk.  She then took me to work, still tripping my head off. I walked into the restaurant I was the general manager of.  The restaurant was full of people having lunch ( Looking at all the food I nearly puked ) I looked around and to my amazement all people in the restaurant had blue hair and green faces and I thought by myself that I would not be able to handle myself here and looked for shelter in the kitchen, where to my surprise the owner of the restaurant was cooking the food due to the shortage of staff that day.<br><br>
I remember walking up to him seeing him with a beard longer that the average zztop band member ( G is always well shaven ) I walked up to him completely confused seeing him with this long beard. I said G since when have you got a beard?? You can obviously understand G's reaction and I was sent home.<br><br>
The next day I was called in for a hearing and dismissed on the spot ( no wonder ) My friends who took care of me between 6am and 10am came to visit me that day to see if I was still alive, and when I told them that I just my lost my job they said that that was no surprise after taking 13 tables.  I did not understand as I only had 10 tablets when I went to the party, they however told me that I bought 13 tablets from them during the party.  When I told them that I had already swallowed 10 tablets of my own they nearly had slight heart attacks and said they would have never given me more tablets if they had know I had taken 10 already.<br><br>
The moral of the story is that after a certain amount of tablets I loose total control, I do not know what could have happened to me that night I am just happy to have survived 23 tabs of xtc. Please I certainly am in favour of taking xtc, but be careful as it could really get out of hand.<br><br>
I lost my job and my marriage for a night partying, was that worth it? Not really now was it, so take care.<br><br>
Now nearly 2 years later my wife and I are back together again, thank god for understanding, My wife is fantastic!<br><br>
Party hard, but party safe!<br><br>
