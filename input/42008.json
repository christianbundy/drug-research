 "report": "<p>PREPARATION:</p><p>There are several ways of preparing the mate brew, but the easiest way (while still tasting good and with effects) is to use a teapot. First, I put the mate into the. Mate is very sensitive to 'extreme' heat, therefore I must not use boiling water (only hot), and I also pour a little bit of cold water on the leaves a minute or two before adding the hot water.</p><p>I Let it sit for about 4 minutes or so. Letting it sit too long will cause it to taste very bitter. I filter out the leaves afterwards. </p><p>It's also a good idea to add about a half teaspoon of honey to get rid of most of the bitterness.</p><p>TASTE:</p><p>One could somehow compare it to green tea, but Im not sure. What's certain is that it's got a very earthy taste that's just awesome in its own subtle way. It takes some time really appreciate it. A twist of honey makes it easier to like, I just don't overdo it.</p><p>EFFECTS:</p><p>I know that what Im about to write is partially contradictory to what the chemists say about mate, but this is what happens to me:</p><p>At first I can feel that something is happening to my muscles, Im not sure what, but its kinda pleasant. Halfway down the cup I feel that my muscles start to relax, followed shortly by a mental relaxation as well. I sit there and feel peaceful for a while. </p><p>I've also noticed that feelings of hunger tend to disappear very quickly.</p><p>If I then decide to move a little around, like stretching and jogging, then after a minute or so I suddenly get lots of energy. Not like tensing up, I just get an energy kick and I can endure more and longer than before. And it really feels good to run and climb and such.</p><p>But, if I choose to perhaps meditate, then that's no problem. If I don't show that I could need some energy, then I stay relaxed.</p><p>Actually, one of the first times I drank it I laid down, and suddenly I found myself at the edge of sleeping.</p><p>That's probably a coincidence since mate is reported to contain much caffeine.</p>"
