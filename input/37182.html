After smoking the dried wormwood, and waiting for the rather long waiting period, the effects of the drug peaked quite quickly. I hallucinated in a fashion that i would describe as being similar to mescaline in visuals (very bright colored visual hallucinations), but i found i had a much clearer head than with other hallucinogens. I did have one experience of a mescaline flashback, but this is likely because i did cactus only a few days ago. The overall mood of the trip felt almost salvia-like, but a lot more mellow. I sat and stared at my reflection in a window i was walking past, saw myself as i imagine i would look 50 years into the future, and then mutate into a beautiful young girl. Not the best drug ever, but for $5 USD an ounce, i would recommend trying it at least once. I found it mixes well with DXM, but found it depressing when combined with marijuana. The trip was only short lived and there were no negative side effects that went along with the almost non-existent come down.<!-- End Body -->
