I work at a gas station with my girlfriend, one day we were at work like normal (with one other employee) when my girlfriend pointed out a whiteish/translucent film canister on the ground by the front counter.<br><br>
We went up and looked at it and it had something on the side (chocolate or something) at the time we were grossed out and didn't know what it was. I was the brave one and I picked it up feeling like I was squishing a runaway spider.<br><br>
I popped the top off and looked inside and saw three little halfs of orange pills alone with two halfs of another green pill. We thought 'oh well, someone dropped their advils' and dropped it into the garbage.  As an afterthought I picked the canister up off the top of the garbage and stuck it in my pocket when my girlfriend wasn't looking.<br><br>
When I got home I had enough of the halfs to see one side said 'OC' the other '40'.  The other pills aren't important.  After a little searching on the 'net (not much, I had a hunch already as to what they were) I found out I had three 20mg chunks of oxyxontin.<br><br>
At the time all that I knew was that it was supposed to be like heroin and addictive, an opiate perscribed for pain.  I had thought that perscription pills weren't shit and you could never get more of a buzz of a perscription than you could from asprin. Damn, I sure as hell was wrong.<br><br>
I think I should say here that I had (had) zero opiate tolerance. I had heard about snorting them so one night I read the experiences about sniffing the crushed pills. After discovering I wouldn't die or anything I decided to give it a shot.<br><br>
I took one of the halves and crushed it with the side of a bic lighter and used a razor to powder it to an extremely fine dust, then seperated the dust into two small lines. One went up each nostril.<br><br>
'That was kinda fun' I thought, 'never snorted anything before..' and proceeded to load up a bowl of shitty mexican dirt weed. Not the only stuff we can get in my area, but definately the easiest and cheapest. Before I was done smoking, long before, I was already tingling in my fingers and toes and feeling a little buzzed and groggy. I headed downstairs to park my ass in front of the tv.<br><br>
After all was said and done, I was feeling good, really damn good. My nose was itchy but I din't mind because scratching it felt so good. I sat there in front of the television scratching lightly at my nose without a care in the world and my thoughts drifting in and out of my mind on a sea of serenity. Nothing bothered me, nothing made me feel antyhing but pleasant for the next few hours. I was feeling generally sleepy, but not tired. I spent some time in the fields of opiate bliss before I went upstairs to bed. I settled down and made sure to lie down with my hand by my face to I wouldn't have to move to scratch my nose occasionally as I fell asleep. The next morning the first thought that came to my head was 'Man, I sure wouldn't mind doing THAT again...        tonight...'  But I didn't, not that night anyway.<br><br>
I was almost shocked as to how powerful one HALF of one of these pills was, I remember thinking many times that I had no idea that even doctors had access to such strong drugs. At the time I totally overlooked the fact that I had taken half of a time-release tablet all at once in about 10 minutes.<br><br>
On another night sometime later I went through the same ordeal with another half. After more or less the same experience I went up to bed and found the last half while loading up my 'nightcap' bowl.<br><br>
I had started to come down by this time and was pondering over the little chunk. Now that I think about it I was still buzzing pretty hard, but more is better right? Crushed and snorted. Not long later I was thinking 'Woah...  this is heavy...' I felt so warm and fuzzy all over, and definately pleasant. I began to read a magazine as best as I could while on my bed sitting up. Minutes later I was stooped over the magazine barely able to keep my eyes open for more than a second or two.  Things were blurry and I felt soooo so tired, but all that was running through my head was Marla from Fight Club: '...it might've been too much, you're gonna have to keep me up all night.'<br><br>
Thinking I'd just stop breathing if I laid down to sleep I fought it for about half an hour when I realized I was just torturing myself.  I finally laid down and drifted off to sleep. The next morning (afternoon, actually) I woke up still a little buzzed and groggy.<br><br>
Since then I have tried poppy head tea aiming for the same buzz, but not even close. I've taken percocets from my dad (he gets them for back pain) and still, not the same, although poppy tea was nice for awhile before I just got sick of the vile stuff.<br><br>
I am currently looking high and low for another source (after all, I found the first ones by chance) and no real luck so far. Hopefully in a year I wont be writing an 'Oxy fucked my life' experience. I have control so far, mostly because I have no source...  but always in the back of my mind is a little desire to jump on anything even close to oxy that comes by. Good thing I don't live in a big city or near the coast, I'd probably have sold my computer by now.<!-- End Body -->
