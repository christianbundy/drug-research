I would first like to note that until I found this web-page in a google site about mushrooms, I refused to try any sort of psychedelic drugs. I began to read about the mushrooms and how they affect your body. Just before I exited the site I saw a link that said 'Mushrooms and Migraines.'<br><br>
Unfortunately I began having migraines when I was six. They stopped, and now I am 19 and experiencing them worse than before. I let my boyfriend convince me to take the mushrooms to help take care of my migraines.<br><br>
First I took 2 grams of mushrooms and chopped them up finely and boiled them in one cup of water for fifteen minutes. I drained them with a coffee filter and into a cup. I drank that first cup and boiled the mushrooms for fifteen more minutes in another cup of water, followed by the straining method once more. I drank this second cup and left the rest of the mushrooms in cup of water for two hours. <br><br>
I waited a half an hour and began tripping. This was an absolutely wonderful experience, I believe the trip with the mushroom tea is most definitely the way to go. Even for a person who just wants a good trip. I tripped so sweetly, and I was able to watch the walls and the floors melt while I watched a Color show on an Apple Computer. This was amazing.<br><br>
After four hours my trip began to dissipate, and this is where I messed up. Instead of making more tea, I just ate another two grams and waited for the effects. For someone with migraines, this doesn't help. <br><br>
I went about a month or so with no migraines, just a cloudy headache instead. Soon after I began to have migraines daily, disabling me. I got fired from my job and I am still looking. I am also a college student and am unable to attend a lot of my classes due to these daily migraines. <br><br>
I believe that if I had not eaten the second dose I would not have regained the migraines so badly. I am hoping to try it again someday to get rid of these migraines, but for now I am going to see a nuerologist to see what they can do for me.<br><br>
Thanks Erowid for the idea and the directions on how to get rid of my migraines, even if it was only for a little while.<!-- End Body -->
