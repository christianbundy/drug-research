Me, and two of my closest buddies are daily smokers of marijuana. About a month ago, me and my fellow psyconauts ran up on some money unexpectedly.  We heard all the tales of it, read all we could online, and decided we'd purchase 1 ounce of foilage (not extract).<br><br>
Purchase the foilage for $17.  Everyone is eager to try it.  After a week the big bag of what appeared to be dried leaves arrived.  We all begin to smoke it, taking turns sitting each other.<br><br>
Nothing happens.  None of us are able to achieve any effects beyond 'a little weird feeling', except for myself.  The first day, I smoked down on a whole bowl (about 2g of foilage), puff after puff, as hard as I can.  I was standing up, dropped the pipe out of my hand, started laughing at the world spinning around me, and that was that.  We were all very disappointed.<br><br>
The bag of salvia remains largely untouched for another month.  We try it a few more times here and there - never achieving more than a buzz.  Still disappointed.  Up until then, all the high we could get off of it was 'something was about to happen' high.  It felt like the substance could do something - but for some reason didn't want us to.  I guess we had to earn its loyalty.<br><br>
Snap back to 2 nights ago.  I'm alone (for the first time in a while).  I had only smoked pot once earlier that afternoon, and was completely sober.  I wanted to trip on morning glory seeds - I've grown several large morning glory plants this year and have yet to try them - and that night seemed to be the night.  But, where are the seeds?  I looked and looked, couldn't find the baggie of seeds. <br><br>
Screw it, I don't know what possessed me to, but for some reason I picked up the dusty bag of salvia.  I took the loaded .38 pistol beside my bed, unloaded it and returned it to the gun cabinet.  Don't want that near me during any of this.  It's about 3AM, I'm a bit sleepy, restless, but in a fairly cheerful mood.<br><br>
I laid down in my bed, first time with all the lights on, staring at a blank TV.<br><br>
I pack the bowl.  I used a clay, all-natural unfired (no kiln, just air dried to bone dry, made from creek clay) pipe.  The first time I packed a layer of salvia, followed by a thin layer of self-grown tobacco leaf, followed by another hefty layer of salvia.  <br><br>
I didn't think it would do much to me.  It had never done much to me before - even with twice the quantity.  I don't know what condition, what component is required to trip, but there is some variable there.  I hit the bowl as hard as I can...starting to feel something...hit it again and again...<br><br>
A wave of intense 'on end' feeling came over my body - like an adrenaline rush.  My heart was beating really fast, and I was very alert.  And then, the salvia struck me like a train, like so many other's have described.  I was instantly blasted into another world, and staring at my blank TV, _I found myself waiting for the circus to arrive_.  You cannot imagine how sure, and how much for a split second, I was so sure that a small circus was about to walk through my back door and the 'trip would begin'.  I waited for hours it seems, but it was only for maybe 3 seconds for this circus.  When they did not arrive, I realized I just had my first real salvia experience.  After the realization, I snapped back and was left with a very deep body intoxication.  It reminded me of the body intoxication I get from DXM.  It lasted for about 2 more minutes, and I stood (wabbled) up and sat down for a minute to get my head together.  A few minutes later I was barely above baseline.<br><br>
That was fun. Roughly 8 minutes after the first time hitting it, I want to try it again.  Lay back down, same method this time (salvia, tobacco, salvia).  I also crushed the leaves down a bit more this time.  Hit the pipe...this time, I had no salvia peak.  I was just back to the weird, heavyness feeling body intoxication, with a harder mind high.  I remember having a few mind hallucinations, seeing the wall in front of me move closer and further away.  I closed my eyes, and instantly was at peace.  At this point, it reminded me of the high you get from opiates, minus everything but the mind clarity.  <br><br>
I calm down and shake it off.  10 minutes later, It's time to give it one more try.  This time, I turn off all the lights in the room, and am left completely dark.  I do not add any tobacco in the bowl this time - 100% salvia.  I hit the pipe.  Hit it and hit it.  I lay my head back and begin to see ambient white lights fly around the room.  They were telling me: welcome to the salvia world.  Do you like the salvia world?  You need to invite your friends.  The salvia world is great.  Come closer to the salvia world.  At first, I was afraid of the ambients, but within a split second, I realized like a lucid dreamer that it was all a trip, and continued to be amused by these little creatures.  I tried to get up and hit the pipe again, but when I tried to lift up on my body, it was instantly pushed back on by the salvia gravity.  I decided that this wasn't such a good idea, and watched the remainder of my trip.  10 minutes later I was back to baseline and finally satisfied with salvia.  At this time, it was almost 4AM, and was time to try to get some sleep.  <br><br>
No sleep came.  I don't recommend this stuff anytime before bed, it may of not been caused by the salvia, but I'm pretty sure it was.  I didn't get to sleep until 7AM, but it's OK because I got plenty of things sorted out in my head between those times.<!-- End Body -->
