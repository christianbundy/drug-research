 "report": "<p>I was prescribed a daily dosage of 30mg of Prednisone and bought the prescription reluctantly. </p><p>I took the dosage prescribed and felt the effects within 20 minutes, noticing first the sort of 'speedy' feeling and the very slight tightness in my stomach. During the onset I found that two random activities (drawing with charcoal and a real time strategy game I haven't touched in years) were a lot more fun than they normally are, I spent about an hour on each with a smile on my face the whole time. Never did I feel 'high', just a lot more intensely stimulated and a little mood-swung.</p><p>As the hours went by, the feeling spread out into a more smoooth experience as far as physical sensation. About an hour after quitting my activities, the stomach tightness and 'speediness' were gone.</p>"
