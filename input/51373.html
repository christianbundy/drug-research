I have done both oxycotin and cocaine seperately several times before. Generally I do about 20-60 milligrams of oc or between .3 and 1 gram of cocaine. On this one fine february night I was feeling very ambitious and I came to the startling revelation that I have never mixed the two drugs. Well who hasn't really.<br><br>
So I started with oc because it is the more long lasting of the two. I broke out two large lines and proceed to blow one and then 5 minutes later the other. Naturally after I blow some oc I start to feel the effects within minutes.  The high is very euphoric and puts me in my 'happy place'. After a little bit I decided to get down to some lines of coke and continued to about 6 or 7 lines over the next hour. The coke got me up like coke normally does, but without the negative down. And, actually I never experienced the cocaine down all night. <br><br>
The outcome of the combination was a harmony of epic proportions. I was able to get coked up and then when the coke high went away I reverted to my oc high. Since the oc high last far longer, when the coke was gone I didn't have the normal down side where all I think about is more coke because I felt awesome. It was a good time, however the two drugs are very powerful and it could have easily been a horror story. Personally I was a dumb ass for trying it, but it worked out.<br><br>
Side note: I did experience a mild, cold-like feeling, with mild fever the day after. just a little fyi.<!-- End Body -->
