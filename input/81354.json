 "report": "<p>I had spent an entire night working on a program for my Computer Science class. I was burnt out, but still had some Italian homework to do. I thought getting a little baked might make the Italian more bearable. I had smoked pure JWH (not Spice product) on several occasions with my friends, and its effects have been almost identical to more psychedelic strains of marijuana.</p><p>However, this night, I took two hits instead of my usual one because I accidentally vaped more JWH than I meant to. At first, I was just really blazed. I was walking back with my friend, and we said good night, and first, on my way back, I realized I was experiencing time dilation.</p><p>Then, the sidewalk began to crawl in a fashion very similar to LSD visuals. I was slightly taken aback, and surprised at this turn of events. I went to my room and sat down to listen to music and work. I realized that I was almost completely dissociated and was hallucinating wildly. My static background was animated, and my music was completely overwhelming.</p><p>With the world spinning, I laid down and closed my eyes. The closed-eye visuals were very very intense. I became fearful, and said a prayer and made peace with God. At some point, I drifted off to sleep, but I don't know when. I 'came to,' about three hours later when my roommate's alarm went off, with a feeling that something profound had happened, but unfortunately I cannot remember much of it. Except for the sensation of falling down a hole into this state. Follow the rabbit, I guess.</p><p>It was an extremely intense experience and not at all what I was expecting that night from a cannibinoid.</p>"
