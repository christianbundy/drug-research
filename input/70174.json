 "report": "<p>My friend told me about morning glory seeds and how you can trip off them similar to acid. I was interested because I've taken acid before but not enough to trip and I've done 33mg of 2cb and I saw closed eye visuals/patterns with color that flowed with the music but besides that little distortion, nothing crazy. I wanted to trip out so I bought 7 packs of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds which was just over 11g for the coming up weekend.</p><p>Friday night comes and Im really excited cause I got weed to smoke and Im ready to trip out. After my mom went to sleep, I ground up the seeds into the best powder I could but there was still some bigger chunks in there. I put that in a mug and poured hot tea over it. Tried slamming it but there was still mush at the bottom after I drank all that I could. I tried scooping it out and eating it but it didnt taste the best so I poured milk in the mug, mixed it and drank it. I had to do this again because there was still mush at the bottom. Now I felt full and it was about midnight so I watched my bro play video games for about an hour waiting to smoke cause I wanted the seeds to kick in while I was high.</p><p>An hour goes by, it's about a bit after 1am. I pack a fat bowl of some decent shwag and start smoking it. By the time I finished I was feeling high and normal (I smoke pretty often it's almost a daily thing) so I got up and I was feeling really high. It was like the first time being high again (the scary Ive never experienced this before feeling) and it kept increasing. I started feeling tremers similar to 2cb. So now Im pretty sure the seeds are kicking in because danks dont even do this and my mind couldn't think straight, it kept jumping from one thing to another.</p><p>30 min go by, Im fucked up my breathing gets really heavy. I look in the mirror, my eyes are huge. I still wasnt seeing anything abnormal but I was extremely focused on whatever I looked at. I decide to turn on some led zeppelin and the doors to listen to while laying down on my bed. I stare at the ceiling and thoughts race through my head. I listen to the song and I couldnt think of who was singing it and I dont think Ive ever even heard it before actually. I stare at the ceiling again and I was in a state between awake and sleeping. My eyes were open but my mind was totally consumed by my inner thoughts. I realize my mouth was really dry and I realized that my whole body felt really good. Ive never done ecstasy, but it felt exactly the way people say it feels like. My head felt one with everything I thought of and it felt like wind was rushing through my head, my whole body. Everything I thought of, I understood. It all made sense to me. I felt really really happy I dont know why but I just did. A shitty song brings me back to earth and I look at the computer. It was after 3 am. Two hours felt like not even 5 minutes. I went to the bathroom and layed back in bed to fall sleep.</p><p>I wake up in the morning and feel well rested but out of place in this world. I didnt feel normal but life seemed so plain and simple and boring. My conversations were fine, but I would constantly be staring at something, thinking to myself. When I moved my head and looked to the side it felt and seemed different than usual. I was still being affected by the seeds. The time went by so fast, every time I looked at the clock another 30 min would go by feeling like a few minutes.</p><p>Later on in the afternoon everyone leaves except my brother and I decide to smoke a bowl in the garage to try and slow down time. It seemed to last a while and by the end I was starting to feel mary jane kick in. I go inside and start making some food. I staring feeling really weird again and was thinking randomly. I thought about the possibilities of life and how it could have been so much different. I was feeling much higher than normal again. When I talked it didnt feel like I was talking, it just felt way different. Thoughts went bizarre and I peaked at a point to which I was literally insane. Nothing made sense and I felt lost in this world. Tremors were hitting me and everything around what I looked at seemed to shake/wave/dance at the peak of each tremor. I had gone crazy and I knew it but I knew that I would come down from this eventually so I didnt freak out. This lasted for maybe an hour till I started coming down.</p><p>The next day (today) I felt completely sobered up. Those seeds are some crazy shit. Only disappointment was no visuals I wanted to hallucinate, but this definitely opened up parts of my brain I dont think Ive ever used before. Good experience Id definitely do it again.</p>"
