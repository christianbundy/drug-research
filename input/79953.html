I downloaded a program called 'IDoser' it has tracks you listen to to simulate the experience of almost any drug under the sun. I chose the dose called 'Dexies'. I prepared for the dose by lying on my living room couch and i put a shirt over my eyes (light is supposed to be a distraction). I put on my headphones and started the dose.<br><br>
Very soon after starting the dose I began to feel very relaxed. I felt like I was asleep but I was still capable of logical thought. I drifted deeper into the trip and suddenly felt like I was having a ketamine like experience. I was somewhere in the sky. All space consisted of a solid purple except for the soft detailed clouds beneath me. I felt as if I was traveling at a very high speed and there were tunnels filled with swirling futuristic lights in the corners of my vision. I was absolutely euphoric. I felt as if I had evolved past the point of having a body. It was a very pleasing experience, leaving me a more positive person.<!-- End Body -->
