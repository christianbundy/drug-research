 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\n+8:00 pm PST\r\nAfter a week of back pain I finally broke down and wanted to try some of my friends pills. This was the first time I have tried this drug and I wasn't sure what to expect. So I watched some TV and left the pills on the counter. I just wanted to look at the pros and cons of taking a pill I knew nothing about.\r\n+8:30 pm PST\r\nThat's it!!! I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to numb this pain. I am a regular user of MDMA and just like everything else you should know your source and your body. So I split the pill and took half.\r\n+9:30 pm PST\r\nNo adverse reaction no pain relief either. I take the other half and go down to the spa hoping that the pill might kick in. Damn there were some hot chicks in the spa......\r\n+10:00 pm PST\r\nOut of the spa and walking back to the house I felt a little out of the norm. Almost like a mild drunkness but not anything that was worth noting.\r\n10:30 pm PST\r\nThese pills suck they don't do much. Or so I thought. So I took my second pill. As I was watching TV I suddenly realized that I was going into a dreamy phase. Things were still normal. I would say that they reacted very slow.\r\n11:00 pm PST\r\nSecond pill is going pretty well. I am feeling no pain and I feel totally relaxed. I got to the point where TV was no more fun so I left for bed. I was out in a flash.\r\nThe only other thing I can compare my experiance to is taking two shots of nyquil. I mean I felt more relaxed and less drowsy but overall it was the same affect. I would recomend that you take the prescribed amount and if you are getting some from a friend start off with one and split the second tab. Better to be safe than sorry.\r\nPEACE OUT..................\n\n\n"
