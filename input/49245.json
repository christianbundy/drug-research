 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAt one point in my life I was taking 6-8mg of Xanax daily for nearly a month.  This was partly a psychological addiction on my part, but what I want to focus on is the physical withdrawal symptoms.  Withdrawal for me involved, no sleep, nightmares, constant nausea, pain, mental agony, major sinus problems.  In other words, a living hell.\r\nWould I do this drug again?  Yes, but I will never get physically addicted again.  Even though I had the mental strength to stop, it is so incredibly painful and dangerous I would not repeat it ever.\r\nExperience at 6mg:\r\nT+0:00\r\nPop 3 2mg pills.  \r\nT+0:30\r\nFeel very 'out-of-it', drunken euphoria, little nausea, all cares and worries go away.\r\nT+1:00\r\nGet hungry, my sinuses are cleared up, I like just hanging out watching TV.\r\nT+1:30\r\nMy ability to store memories is practically gone.  I have no inhabitations.  I fall off a bike and cut myself, but am completely numb to pain.\r\nT+2:00\r\nIt's a fairly sedate and restful feeling also.  The feeling is not euphoria per say, but a permeating numbness.\n\n\n"
