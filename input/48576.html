I have made it my goal to try everything once. Sky-diving, mountain climbing, surfing, everything. This is also true with psychoactives. I have sampled the best and purest only. My first opiate was pure Oxy (only dilaudid has continued to evade me so far), my first hallucinogen pure LSD, my first stimulant pure, uncut cocaine, and of course my first entactogen pure MDMA. I have sampled everything Amsterdam has to offer on various occasions, lived 3 years through the rave scenes in London, and have lived in the very south of florida for a time - taking a taste of everything along the road of my life. I don't do drugs frequently and don't consider myself to be a crazed druggie, just very curious.<br><br>
I was offered pure crystal methamphetamine by a very trusted friend of mine, lets call him Kal. I have tried amphetamines before, and was fairly impressed. I certainly placed them slightly higher than cocaine - I found the effects greater, longer lasting, and with fewer physical side effects (I can't stand the bubble I get in my throat from cocaine). I have tried Ritalin several times before and found it to be a much more controlled high, albeit less euphoric overall, and much easier on the nose than anything.<br><br>
Alone in a back room at one of his parties, Kal poured out a white, very crystaline powder onto a mirror. I noticed he had to crush several crystals into powder to make suitable to take through our nasal cavities. He then put on Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind, and pointed out the line 'Doing crystal meth/will lift you up until you break.' This made me both excited and nervous.<br><br>
We counted down from three and took our lines. A moment after, I felt a very intense burn in my nostril, even stronger than I had felt with amphetamines, which is saying a lot. I was in agony for about 30 secs, after which it subsided. A couple minutes later, the effects kicked in:<br><br>
I was very, very awake. I felt stimulated, but not jittery, very confident, ready to take on anyone, anything, anywhere. The confidence was even more so than on cocaine. I was Mr.Cool, and nothing that I did was anything but exactly right. I looked in a mirror and noticed slight pupil constriction. The music playing sounded amazingly fresh. The closest thing I have done to compare to the feeling is combining an opiate with a stimulant - a speedball: I was relaxed, euphoric, yet energized. I could not imagine a more perfect mindset for anything, I truly felt like I could do anything. I also noticed that I did not have a craving to do more as I have felt with cocaine. Kal and I left the back room and went to socialize with everyone, which was remarkably easy. It was like all the social limitations of regular life were suspended, and Mr. Cool had taken over. I said the right things at the right times, and was having a great time. I also noticed that my back, which had previously required vicodin for pain, no longer noticably hurt. I did, however, have a slight spasming in some muscles, and jaw-clenching. I had an amazing time that night, and wanted to look into this amazing substance. I can completely understand why people like this stuff so much!<br><br>
After researching the stuff, I've realized how incredibly bad for you it is. I can also tell you it can be quite addictive, especially psychologically, and that is coming from someone with an exceptionally un-addictive personality in my opinion. Fortunately for me, quality stuff isn't overly available in my location, nor do I want to find it, or it to find me, again. I had a great evening - yes, definitely - and I'm happy I gave it a try. In my mind, due to the addictive qualities and the damage it does to the brain, I will not do it again. Crystal Meth is not for the faint of heart, nor the easy influenced. If I let it take over, it will make everything seem possible, make me confident, charming, make everything seem 'easy.' I will become Mr.Cool, just as I was, but at what price?<!-- End Body -->
