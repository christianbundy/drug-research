I started taking Valium when I was 17 as a recreational drug; I only used it occasionally and was hardly addicted.  I had taken pills like vicodin and codeine and never had an addiction to any of them, but I liked them a lot. I never really had a steady connection with Valium until I went off to college the following year.  I first bought 130 pills for about 50 cents a pill and decided to sell them make some money and use them casually.<br><br>
I started out taking no more than 4 a day, really only using them when I smoked pot.  But seeing as how I smoke everyday I started to get in a real habit of using them.  After about only a week and a half I had only 50 pills left and had made my money back, so I decided to keep the rest of the pills for my personal use.  I started taking more and more each day until I was at 12-18 a day, but I ran out fast.  At this point I was hiding all of this from everyone around me, my friends, my girlfriend, my family and even my roommate were in the dark.<br><br>
The day after I ran out of Valium I felt really depressed and alone, I felt like I was trapped in my own head and all I had was negativity to think about. It felt like I was coming down from mushrooms for the whole day.  That night I didnt sleep, I hardly ate during the day because I felt like shit, at night I even found myself trying to tire myself out to fall asleep.  After a day like this I realized that I shouldnt be taking so many Valium and I started to get really hard on myself about it, telling myself that I was done, that I was out of pills and that I would be better off without them.  My band mates even wrote a song about how much I was gone from the group and about my Valium use, which I thought, wasnt really affecting anything or anyone.<br><br>
So I had my mind set on no more.  But, a business prospect arose and I took it, thinking I could handle selling Valium, but not taking it.  I bought 300+ more pills for about the same price and figured I could make almost 400 dollars if I played my cards right.  So I stashed the Valium away in my dorm, but that night as I lay in bed wide awake at 2 a.m. all I could think about was how easy and how good it would be, so finally I got up and crushed up 30mg and railed (snorted) it.  When I woke up the next morning I told myself that I had a weak moment and that was over, but by 2 oclock I was over at my friends house making and deal and I had popped two more valium.  After that I was right back into the normal cycle.<br><br>
I had already told all my friends that I stopped so now I was keeping it real secret, this dragged me away from all of my friends and even smoking pot.  I took about 15 a day, but it only lasted a couple of days, I came home one night after a good night of partying and crushed up 50 mg of valium, I only made it through about half of the lines when I passed out, probably more due to the alcohol and lack of sleep than the valium.<br><br>
I woke up the next day and saw the powder and my rolled up dollar bill still sitting on my desk and I left.  I walked out of my room and called my girlfriend.  I told her about all the using I was doing and how shitty I felt everyday.  She helped me realize the things that I knew in my own head and help me put it to action.  She made me realize that this was all about me and me taking the first step.  After a long talk I went to my room and pulled out all the Valium I had left and put it on my desk.<br><br>
I stared at it for at least 20 minutes then finally got enough courage (after several times of walking back from bathroom) to flush them all.  Ill tell you one thing, that was the hardest damn thing Ive ever had to do, but I felt a sense of pride in doing it.  I didnt feel good about it by any means; in fact I didnt feel good for days after I stopped using.  I felt like I was trapped inside that small room in my head for a few days after that, I was depressed, I couldnt sleep, my body hurt, I couldnt concentrate, I got some terrible stomach cramps(both during and after use) and I was constantly on edge, but I took some comfort in the fact that maybe my actions were helping someone else not feel like me.<br><br>
The only thing that I can say about this drug is that its damn nasty when its out of control.  I watched my sister struggle with drug addictions for years and after I flushed all the Valiums I had I felt like I had finally done something good for her and for me.  I felt proud that I might have in some small way helped someone else stay happy and addiction free.  Dont get me wrong, Im all for recreational drug use, but sometimes it can get out of control, and my only advice is be careful, cause this addiction crept up on me and I wound up using over 1400mg of valium in about two weeks.<!-- End Body -->
