 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nPill Description<br>----------------<br>8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.<br>Above score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I<br>guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that<br>non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]<br>1:50AM<br>------<br>I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT<br>earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real<br>snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked<br>a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or<br>less at baseline.<br>2:20AM<br>------<br>I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had<br>any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main<br>distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and<br>intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as<br>comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely<br>not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar <br>to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being<br>the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about<br>an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe<br>it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is<br>more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The<br>physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a<br>feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like <br>tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam<br>experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its <br>just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.<br>2:50AM<br>------<br>Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho<br>from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.<br>And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak<br>effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good<br>deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original<br>assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some<br>ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation<br>is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally<br>relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge<br>to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.<br>As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the<br>euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual<br>effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more<br>subdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much<br>more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie<br>down and just relax and absorb the music.<br>3:10AM<br>------<br>I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be<br>more of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just<br>listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot<br>less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.<br>This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be<br>easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out<br>that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically<br>increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel<br>very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to<br>GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk<br>around, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger<br>doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather<br>due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a<br>little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal<br>earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None<br>of my muscles seem to have any tension.<br>3:25AM<br>------<br>Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not<br>really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or<br>T+1:45.<br>3:35AM<br>------<br>I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this<br>snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy<br>cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.<br>Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...<br>though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering<br>the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last<br>opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another<br>hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good<br>luck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,<br>then describe it.<br>3:50AM<br>------<br>T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now<br>strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed<br>earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from<br>alcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But<br>this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far<br>fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no<br>feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,<br>just a drastic slowing of pace.<br>4:20AM<br>------<br>I take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this<br>report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and<br>how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be<br>as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot<br>less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than<br>anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much<br>less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd<br>like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party<br>drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find<br>them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to<br>seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm<br>sure I will sleep well tonight!\n\n\n"
