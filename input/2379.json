 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nPill Description\r\n----------------\r\n8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.\r\nAbove score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I\r\nguess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that\r\nnon-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]\r\n1:50AM\r\n------\r\nI ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT\r\nearlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real\r\nsnowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked\r\na little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or\r\nless at baseline.\r\n2:20AM\r\n------\r\nI begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had\r\nany benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main\r\ndistinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and\r\nintensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as\r\ncomparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely\r\nnot the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar \r\nto the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being\r\nthe depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about\r\nan hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe\r\nit, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is\r\nmore of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The\r\nphysical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a\r\nfeeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like \r\ntactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam\r\nexperience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its \r\njust beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.\r\n2:50AM\r\n------\r\nWell, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho\r\nfrom what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.\r\nAnd I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak\r\neffect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good\r\ndeal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original\r\nassessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some\r\nways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation\r\nis similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally\r\nrelaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge\r\nto close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.\r\nAs I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the\r\neuphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual\r\neffect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more\r\nsubdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much\r\nmore conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie\r\ndown and just relax and absorb the music.\r\n3:10AM\r\n------\r\nI'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be\r\nmore of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just\r\nlistening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot\r\nless noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.\r\nThis is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be\r\neasy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out\r\nthat GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically\r\nincreases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel\r\nvery mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to\r\nGHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk\r\naround, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger\r\ndoesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather\r\ndue to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a\r\nlittle jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal\r\nearlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None\r\nof my muscles seem to have any tension.\r\n3:25AM\r\n------\r\nStill about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not\r\nreally tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or\r\nT+1:45.\r\n3:35AM\r\n------\r\nI went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this\r\nsnow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy\r\ncold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.\r\nImmediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...\r\nthough it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering\r\nthe date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last\r\nopportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another\r\nhit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good\r\nluck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,\r\nthen describe it.\r\n3:50AM\r\n------\r\nT+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now\r\nstrongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed\r\nearlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from\r\nalcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But\r\nthis is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far\r\nfewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no\r\nfeeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,\r\njust a drastic slowing of pace.\r\n4:20AM\r\n------\r\nI take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this\r\nreport can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and\r\nhow the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be\r\nas an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot\r\nless than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than\r\nanything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much\r\nless of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd\r\nlike to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party\r\ndrug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find\r\nthem far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to\r\nseek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm\r\nsure I will sleep well tonight!\n\n\n"
