 "report": "<p>After slowly taking aprox 200 mg of DPT over the course of an hour i decided to snort about 100mg. Aprox 15 min later i was sure i had taken way too much and was experiencing the begining of a seizure (or so i thought). </p><p>Out side by the camp fire the trees were humming to each other in sign language but with out sound. my phsyical body began trying to seperate into the individual molecules that it was made of and it took every fiber of my being to stay intact. a fellow experimenter who took slightly less than I weighed only 100 lbs wasn't experiencing any of this and was just watching with an erie calmness that scared me because I couldn't comprehend her composure while under such an effect.</p><p>An hour later and cocooned in my room the madness began to subside after i had been confronted with all my resentments and personality flaws and had destroyed them. The panic that comes with an over dose subsided and i was begining to relate my experience when suddenly it felt as though an alien was about to burst from my gut. the drug it seems had an laxative effect on me that i believed to be a spiritual purge. I feel as though I have grown significantly from this experience.</p>"
