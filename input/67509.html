Before starting this trip rapport I should tell about my previous use of Methylone, because I believe that to be the reason I needed so much more of the compound than anyone else. I have been using methylone for about 2 years, sometimes quite heavily, but that is another case, you can read about that here: <a href="http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67196">Erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67196</a><br><br>
09:45  I woke up.<br>
The mood was great this morning, I had a good feeling about this day, it was Friday and one of my friends was throwing a big party tonight, and best of all, I had the whole day free. I put myself in front of the computer and ate a little breakfast. Hadnt even been there for 10 minutes when the door bell rings. Post I thought happily! I had been waiting for Mephedrone for only a few days, and it wasnt much more than 2 weeks ago I learned the existence of it, but I still had this feeling that it would be great.<br><br>
09:55  The packet.<br>
I didnt dare to hope that it was this new compound, I get packets everyday, and it could be anything, but I hoped. When I opened the door there was a man in orange TNT cloth with a little package in hes hand, I almost jumped around in happiness (this was perfect, at the party tonight most of my friends would be, they could help me test it!)  I took the packed, signed, closed the door and opened the it, there was a little zip back with a light yellowish compound which smelled very funny. I knew I had smelled this old smell before, but I couldn't see where, at least not until I snorted it.<br><br>
10:25  The first snort.<br>
After finishing my breakfast and answering e-mails I came to that conclusion of thought that; I was home alone, my girlfriend wouldnt come home for hours,  I HAD to test this new compound before giving it to others this night. I took out my 0,001g scale and weighed out 10mg (better safe than sorry, eh?), lined it up, and snorted it. It stings a bit, nothing much and the smell was very intense. Here it came to me; the smell was the smell of an old circuit board, a very nice smell for a guy like me that loves old hardware, very safe. After about 5 minutes I felt a few traces of euphoria, nothing much and could easily be placebo.<br><br>
I waited 30 minutes more and snorted 40mg.<br><br>
11:30  First real traces of Euphoria.<br>
That worked a little, I felt very sharp and clearheaded, a bit like a small dose of amphetamine. I felt very fast, ran around the house and cleaned.<br><br>
12:10  The bigger dose.<br>
I snorted another 100mg, just to be sure it wasnt placebo, and the compound really worked.<br><br>
12:25  The effect.<br>
That worked, the euphoria is even better than methylone, and I feel so speeded, like I can work for 100+ hours without getting tired. The music is so much better than normally, and I can both work, do homework and heir music at once, tho. I am not getting much work done, I use more time telling my friends on MSN how good it is.<br><br>
12:50  50mg more snorted<br>
The effect keeps the same, but I still chooses to snort some more.<br><br>
13:20  50mg more snorted <br>
The effect gets even better and I get Goosebumps sometimes, I choose to snort another 50mg.<br><br>
13:50  Big oral dose.<br>
One of my friends comes over, and he drives me to a swimming hall where we both takes 200mg orally. We swim around a little, the water feels really great! We find out that the swimming hall didnt have a Jacuzzi and both feels a bit disappointed, we then both goes to the sauna, which feels fantastic!! My friend says that he can feel the 200mg a lot, and that it feels a bit like mdma and amphetamine together, just much more euphoric.<br><br>
18:00  Another big oral dose.<br>
After the sauna we drives home again, and hit home around 18:00 where we both takes 200mg more (oral). I have a little jaw tension, but it really isnt much.<br><br>
We talk a lot and time passes, we snort a few lines but I have stopped weighing it now.<br><br>
20:15  Picking up my friend.<br>
Another friend calls and says that we should pick him up at the station, so we do.<br><br>
At first he cant even see that we are stoned, but he picks it up as we go drive.<br><br>
We now drives to the party.<br><br>
As we drive I want some more, and I get that crazy idea (as I often do..) to snort from the zip bag. I fold a note and snort, I snorted a lot.. I dont know how much I snorted, but I snorted a lot. After a few minutes it feels like my body is having an orgasm, my whole body, I get Goosebumps all over my body and it feels so great. <br><br>
21:00  The party.<br>
We now arrive at the party where people is very happy to see us, and us them. Everyone is so exited to try this new compound, and I haven't even taken off my jacket before I start lining up lines for everyone. 3 of them want it orally, so I weigh out 3*200mg for them and they drink it in a cup of water, and all 3 said it tasted better than they thought it would. Within long; people start talking about how good it is, everyone is getting much more effect out of it than me, and I believe this to be because of my tolerance to methylone.<br><br>
22:00  Coke<br>
Around this time I stop taking Mephedrone and starts on a little zip bag of coke, it feels so great. They fit really great together.<br><br>
02:00  Going home<br>
The effects of mephedrone are still very traceable, and I still feel great. But my friend wants to go home around this time and I want him to drive me, so I say goodbye and leave with my friend. Everyone else is still partying and I can see that they love it.<br><br>
03:00  Home<br>
Around this time I get home, I have some trouble sleeping at first but after some time I sleep without aid.<br><br>
15:00  The day after.<br>
I sleep right until 15:00 next day, and I feel great when I wake up. A little dizzy, but almost nothing.<!-- End Body -->
