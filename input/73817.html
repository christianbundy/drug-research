My psychiatrist prescribed gabapentin for me as a treatment for anxiety, insomnia, and THC withdrawal.  After getting the script I did research and was a little surprised that this was an off label prescription, the primary reason that the script is generally given is as a pain reliever for shingles.  None the less, being open minded, I popped three as soon as I got the prescription filled.<br><br>
On an empty stomach and within about 30 minutes, I began to perceive everything as more brilliant, more brighter, more fuller.  There was a brief euphoria, although nothing as extreme as marijuana, it was a leveling effect.  Suddenly my problems appeared to literally be melting away.  I knew they were there, but I was able to focus and prioritize them.<br><br>
About an hour and a half in, I was at total peace with the world.  Nothing could get to me.  I drove to the store well below the speed limit, because I could.  A man behind me insisted on honking his horn.  I decided to park my car in the middle of the road.  He drove around, shouting obscenities.  I continued on my way, with no one else behind me.  Wow, I thought, without this I would have either sped up to his liking or ended up punching him in his face.<br><br>
I drove and walked around town that day.  It was almost a wandering, but something was different.  Pieces of the puzzle fell into place.  I did not need a list, because it was clear in my head.  Whereas normally I would freak out over little things, my attitude quickly became, 'Oh well.'  My financial problems, which were a large part of my other problems, seemed to fade away.  Yet I didn't feel like they were unimportant, just not as important as my life and well being.<br><br>
I traveled that day and smiled to everyone, brightened their day.  Someone who knows me asked me, 'What the hell are you on?'  I told them I was on life.  The fact that I seek psychiatric help is no one's business but mine and is protected obviously by patient-provider privilege.  After being shunned by therapists, other psychiatrists, and even psychologists, I finally found the right provider.<br><br>
I had asked for xanax, but he refused on the grounds that as I had drug seeking behavoir, gabapentin is non-addictive.  It has been two weeks now, and I take it as needed.  It works wonders with just one pill.  I have yet to abuse it as I have seen online, although I may try it, I don't feel the need to.  It takes the edge off, literally, which sounds very cliche, and then a little more if you up the dosage.  There is a clear euphoria, but unlike marijuana it doesn't make me lethargic, dumbfounded, or lose many of my inhibitions.  And it sure doesn't make me paranoid, anti-social, or an avoider either.  It slows down my mind just enough to focus but without driving me crazy.<br><br>
I used this to quit marijuana, among other things, as I had used it as a psychological crutch and had smoked as much as an ounce per day for three years, although generally an ounce would last at least two weeks.  When they brought in one psychologist, two psychiatrists, and three therapists, all of whom wanted me to go inpatient, I knew that this is not something someone does every day.  In fact it may have been one of the worst addictions ever.<br><br>
I haven't touched it since then, but in the future I would do it again but not as a psychological crutch.  I had used it as exactly that.  I didn't need a medical professional to tell me what I already knew, that I had control, with a little help from this wonderful medication.<br><br>
I now use it as both a preventative and treatment measure for anxiety and panic attacks.  I take one pill before going into something important, and keep several pills on me as needed.  I have used it to treat at least three panic attacks, and if you sit somewhere quiet for about 15 minutes, it begins to work its magic.  The only side effect for me seems to be urine and fluid retention and moving slower, but that's what I needed.  Also I cannot stand loud noises while on this medication, whatsoever, yet, I'm able to cope with them by literally convincing myself that there is no loud noise, no horn honking, no beeping, just a nice beach with waves crashing down.<br><br>
In a nutshell, just what I needed...nothing more.  It may not be for everyone, but it is a definitely mood elevator.  Even if it is some sort of placebo effect for me, it works and that's all that matters...if I believe that it works, then it's all good, and I do.<!-- End Body -->
