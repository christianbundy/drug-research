 "report": "<p>Date of Consumption: July 10th</p><p>Around 8:00 PM that evening I ingested 600 mg (roughly 7mg/kg) of DXM in the form of two bottles of Robitussin Long-Acting Gelcaps, and I still have yet to make the distinction of whether this was a second or third plateau trip.</p><p>A description of my trip:</p><p>As I began to feel the effects of what I had taken, I had begun to think to myself the logistics of reality, and just how plausible taht everything occurs the way it does. I began to feel enclosed, almost as if even though there was a whole world outside of my basement that I was truly all alone and the only reality was the room I was sitting in. It began to feel other-worldy, as I began to recollect events of my past increasingly vividly, and then just discard them as though they'd never even occurred at all.</p><p>Suffice to say it was quite the surprise.</p><p>During my trip I encountered a mild fever, the 'robo itch', a terrible case of urinary retention, and sleeplessness like I'd been doing cocaine. **Prior to this I'd had no unplesant side effects.**</p>"
