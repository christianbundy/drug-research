When I first approached 4-ACO-DMT I looked up the dose [common 8-20mg], 20mg it is then. Me and a couple of friends all take 20mg. The effects between us appeared to vary wildly, me? very little effect, +.5. My other 2 friends? One had a pretty strong experience (+++) the other one somewhere in between us. Interesting I thought, what is the most obvious difference between the 3 of us? Body weight. I am significantly larger then my friend who experienced the stronger effects. I looked around, reading a lot of experience reports on 4-ACO-DMT and never really found mention of anyone taking it by weight (mg/kg). Further research led me to Erowid's dose page for psilocybin, it wasn't the listed doses that were interesting but what was below them in the notes:<br><br>
'In 2006, Griffiths et al published research in which subjects were administered .43 mg/kg psilocybin (30 mg per 70kilogram adult) and 61% of participants experienced a 'complete' mystical experience.'<br><br>
'Rick Strassman's research administering psilocybin to subjects involved both .45 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg oral psilocybin. At 0.45 mg/kg the 'subjects' experiences were strong, fully psychedelic. They could get out of bed but didn't want to.'<br><br>
When proper clinical research with Psilocybin is done, they give out the dose based on the subject's weight (mg/kg). Both 4-ACO-DMT &amp; 4-HO-MET are very closely rated to psilocin (4-HO-DMT) there is even speculation that the body metabolizes 4-ACO-DMT into 4-HO-DMT before it becomes active in the brain, as it does with psilocybin, but after significant personal research on both of these substances I find this to be not true, but that is for another discussion. The next thing obviously was to try 4-ACO-DMT at .45mg/kg to see what happens.<br><br>
Eureka!<br><br>
4-ACO-DMT at .45mg/kg was like nothing I had ever experienced before on any drug, it was fully psychedelic, an outstanding euphoria and visuals like nothing I had ever seen before. With eyes open there was rapid and very obvious changes to the color of the light in the room, looking at red bricks for a few seconds and looking back at the room caused the world to take on a deep blood-red color, everything sparkled like you were in an enchanted forest out of a fairytale, the walls 'breathed' and everything else was crawling. Then you close your eyes, the closed eye visuals mimic that of smoked DMT but slowed down, with less complexity. They are the same visuals though, from the same realm, it is as if you have taken the time frame and strength of the mushroom experience and applied it to DMT. Unfortunately the 'machine elves' were nowhere to be found. Another thing worth noting is the almost absurd connection to music that I felt, I listen to 'Bass Music' mostly Dubstep. The music felt like it was being pumped directly into my soul. I will never forget it. Surprisingly my thoughts were mostly clear and concise, much more so then a 5 Gram mushroom trip, and this felt deeper.<br><br>
The next step was to give out doses to friends and interested parties at .45mg/kg and see what they report. Almost every single report came back the same 'best drug experience of my life', 'amazing', 'best drug I have ever done'. Of probably 10-15 doses given out to people at .45mg/kg the only experience that seemed to differ from the others was one who sounded like they went even deeper, but finding people overly sensitive to a certain substance is pretty common.<br><br>
After a ho-hum experience with 4-HO-MET my first time, I decided it was again close enough to psilocybin that I would give it the .45mg/kg treatment. Again, wow. A different but very similar experience to the 4-ACO-DMT at the same dose, it was the open eye visuals that really stood out. Warping, melting, and a 'psychedelic soup' effect that I had only previously experienced on LSD. Everything shined and sparkled and bright bold colors really stood out, the experience of being in an enchanted fairytale forest was even stronger. The effect on music wasn't as pronounced and the trip did not feel as deep as on 4-ACO-DMT but the visuals made up for everything. I feel that 4-HO-MET more closely resembles Psilocybin, the head-trip is more evident on 4-HO-MET than 4-ACO-DMT, but the whole experience is shorter, maybe 3-4 hours vs 4-ACO-DMT's 5-6 hours.<br><br>
In conclusion I have not tried this with any other substance (I don't believe weight plays apart in a lot of drugs), the obvious candidates would be the other 4-substituted tryptamines,but I'm not so sure about this, none of the others I've tried (4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-ACO-DiPT,4-ACO-MIPT) feel as much like psilocybin as 4-ACO-DMT and 4-HO-MET and maybe they should be treated differently? Of all the tryptamines I have tried, these 2 stand out as the real gems.<!-- End Body -->
