 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt all started yesterday at noon, my friend D came over with a 4 grams of weed and 8 50mg Ultram pills.D told me that Ultrams were cool while smoking weed. I could have never dreamed of the effects of the two combined.\r\n(times are approx. and were written while on the drugs)\r\nSo D and I sat down at about 12:15 and took 2 50mg Ultram pills each with a glass of water.\r\nT+0:05-We sat down and smoked 2 grams of weed.\r\nT+0:15-We're really high right now and decide to take 2 more Ultram pills each.\r\nT+0:20-D and I smoked the rest of the cannabis.\r\nT+0:45-I start to feel a sense of wellbeing, start feeling extremely relaxed and higher than usual.\r\nT+0:55-Start to itch all over my body and I notice my senses are heightened(everything is vivid and food has a weird texture to it).\r\nT+1:20-Still high, itching, feeling good but starting to get tired.\r\nT+1:40-I finally get up to go to the bathroom, balance is weird, its hard to stand or move.\r\nT+1:45-Back from the bathroom, time is slower or so it seems.\r\nT+2:10-Talking seems to be distorted somehow.\r\nT+2:35-My friend D has to leaves and I begin to feel slightly paranoid.\r\nT+2:55-All paranoia is subsiding and I start to feel really really good, a feeling closer to ecstasy but a weaker effect and without the hallucinations.\r\nT+3:20-My friend D comes back and with 2 more Ultram so I take 1 with a glass of water.\r\nT+3:50-Me and D are still high of the Ultrams and the cannabis.\r\nT+4:35-Im starting to feel confused and nervous.\r\nT+5:00-Still high and becoming worried.\r\nT+5:15-Im just laying here wondering when I'm going to come down.\r\nT+5:45-D left and had to go home for the night.\r\nT+5:55-My skin feels smooth and slick.\r\nT+6:05-I'm sweating puddles.\r\nT+7:30-Im still higher than my life and I decide to lay down and go to sleep.\r\nT+7:40-About to fall asleep.\r\nI woke up today around 10:30 and I feel great and refreshed. It was a good experience overall. I don't know how or why it gave me those feeling but I hope I get the same exact effects from them again.\n\n\n"
