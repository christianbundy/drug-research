 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHanging out with a friend in a comfortable setting, we were both desperate for some sort of drug. Upon learning that a close friend had just acquired some Methadone, we decided to try it, despite the fact that we knew nothing about it except its use as a treatment for heroin addicts. \r\nI took the pills on a half-full stomach. Within a little more than an hour, I started to feel relaxed, and for some strange reason, my ears kept popping. I felt a slight disassociation with reality--not very strong, however. A couple hours later, watching tv, I began to get little adrenaline rushes in my stomach, not unlike the preliminary rushes of ecstacy. Yet at the same time, I still felt relaxed. I fell asleep fairly easily, a welcome reprise from some other drugs.\r\nFor the following day I felt sort of mellow.\r\nIn the end, I don't really enjoy downers.\r\nAn interesting experience, overall.\n\n\n"
