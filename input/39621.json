 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI really never thought myself the type that would try odd bits and ends to get a 'legal' high before.  But when you're in the middle of opiate withdrawal, you'll do about anything to get by.  I read about Nutmeg online.  I recalled hearing about it before, but had no idea how to prepare it, etc.  After doing some reading, I was on my way! Off to the store, where I bought a cheap scale and the most expensive nutmeg they had (Expensive has to be better, right?).  Scale: $7.99, Nutmeg: $8.99.\r\nI run home and measure out the what seems to be guideline of 1g / 10 pounds of bodyweight (About 17 grams).  Hey, that doesn't look like so much.  No problem!  Everybody says it tastes horrible, but I like horrible/strong tasting things, so I'm not too worried.\r\nOther drugs taking: Paxil (SSRI), Multivitamin.  Both early this morning.\r\nFirst spoonful: I spoon a good sized helping into the back of my mouth and wash it down with soda.  Hey, that's not so bad.  I actually maybe even LIKE the taste!\r\nSecond spoonful: Little smaller spoonful this time.  Wow!  Do I ever like this stuff!  I could eat this all night! (More soda)\r\nThird spoonful: Okay, no I couldn't. (Lot's of soda)\r\nFourth spoonful: Oh God, I'm going to throw up. (Soda, soda)\r\nFifth spoonful: Why is there still so much to eat?!?!\r\nI measure what's left.  I apparently gulped down 7.5-10g (Like I said, cheap scale).  Okay, that's enough.  It's now 2:35pm.  Time to wait.  The research I've done indicates a VERY long time to wait.  No problem.  That's why I took it earlier in the day instead of at night.  Ate around noon.  Hanging out in my office to evade the wife.  Good mindset, I'm looking at this with an open mind.\r\nT+0:30 - Nothing.  What I expected.\r\nT+1:00 - Nothing.  Nutmeg burps.  Going to hurl.\r\nT+1:30 - Nothing.  Maybe I'll stop paying attention for awhile.\r\nT+2:00 - MAYBE something, maybe placebo.  Play some quidditch with wife.\r\nT+2:30 - Feeling amiable and happy.  Not like opiates, but not bad.\r\nT+3:00 - Feeling something, just mellow.  Nothing strong.  I'm pleased at this point.\r\nT+4:00 - Feeling more.  I don't know what.  Just a lot more mellow and relaxed.  Tired.  Very tired.  It's what I expected benzo's to be like.  In reality they just knock me out cold.\r\nT+5:00 - Okay, am I peaking?  Feeling odd.  Having a hard time concentrating, following basic conversations, etc.  Still nothing too major.\r\nT+6:00 - Wow, I'm feeling it now.  Feels like I took a couple of hits of a decent bong.  No visuals or anything.  Just feeling nice.\r\nT+7:00 - Okay, STILL going up.  What the hell.  I read some trip reports, somebody says it peaks between 9 and 12 hours.  9 AND 12 HOURS?!?!  Oh great.\r\nT+8:00 - I'm really really stoned now.  I usually don't like smoking too much pot, makes me sluggish, etc.  I feel like I'm on the borderline.  If I had to get up (I'm in bed) My wife would know something was up.\r\nT+8:30 - I make my way to the bathroom.  SOOOO thirsty.  Dry mouth, really bad.  My eyes are SO red.  I might have well as smoked more than a few hits of good weed for how I feel.\r\nT+9:00 - Okay, that's enough now.  Please stop coming.  I want to sleep and I can't.  I just lay there, now I'm twitching periodically.  I have a full body buzzing, very strong.  No thoughts really, just awake and stoned off my ass.\r\nT+12:00 - I must have fallen asleep finally.  I'm still out of my mind.\r\nT+15:00 - Okay, coming down I think.\r\nT+17:00 - I'm still stoned, but nowhere near as bad.  I can function.\r\nT+24:00 - Just tired and mellow, that's about it.\r\nAt every single step of the high, I hit a plateau for several minutes, so I thought I peaked.  I really don't think I'd want more.  But at the same time, I didn't have ANY visuals, ANY cool lucid dreamy stuff.  Just a really really heavy, dirty body stone.  Didn't make me creative or lucid or anything like weed usually does.  Keep in mind though, my Paxil may be a factor.  I got really mellow and tired, but I was really paranoid the whole time, maybe because I was doing it around my wife secretively, periodically nauseous, and had to fight off minor panic attacks from time to time.  Not only did it take FOREVER to come on, it took forever to go away. \r\nIf I do it again, which I very well might, I'd mix it in a shake or something or find some way to encapsulate it and do it with a friend.  I was very happy to find that there's a relatively easy, cheap, legal high that actually works!\n\n\n"
