So I had heard about 2C-T-7 from some people in a class of mine, than from other friends on a message board. Being one who had a little fling with E in late 99/early 2000 I was curious about what this was. So I read up, mostly on Erowid and thought about everything. I told a friend, the same who I tried E with the first time. After some time and having him read everything I had read we decided to get a hold of some. Because of the exactness of doses we wanted to get it ourselves and split it up. This was harder than we thought it would be, but we found a safe way to come up with an exact dose by mixing it with vodka in a small container (like a travel mouth wash)where you can get exact measurements, than just do the simple math to figure out how much 2C-T-7 you have in each droplet (get a dropper). <br><br>
Anyways, we got it and sat on it for a while, not trying it. We tried to set a few party nights but it never worked out, so I told my gf about it. She had taken E when she was younger and a few times with me. I told her everything about it and we took it in her bedroom and around 10pm we snorted it and within a few minutes could feel it. I have some allergies and problems with sneezing and runnynose, so it hit my nose hard. The burn was bad, but not crazy bad. My nose was dripping a LOT and I sneezed plenty of times (15+) This worried me regarding dehydration so I drank some water. <br><br>
At first the feeling was of a soft warm feeling similar to E. Then not too much happened for me. She felt it some more, but then it got to her stomach. She went and threw up a LOT. That basically ruined the night for her. She could still feel it, but she hates to throw up. I felt a tad sick, but found it to be more gasy than vomiting. I would go on to not get sick the entire night. After she was done vomiting, I still did not feel too much. <br><br>
Beause we split 15mg I decided to take some more. Immediately it hit me and I felt nice. This was what I had been waiting for. I just wanted to dance and move around, my body felt very fluid and my mind was racing but clear. I found myself talking to her about everything, somewhat like with E, but not really deep things. As the time dragged by I became slightly weirder. She was feeling good, but nothing major. She was still bummed about the vomiting though. Anyways, we turned the lights off and just lay in bed with some of our favorite music on, talking and holding each other, just feeling good. <br><br>
Physically doing things felt good, just moving was nice. It was like my whole body was moving at one time when I was just raising my arm or touching her. So we did that for a while, until it started getting into my head. This was a few hours in and I totally let myself go. I was sliding my legs/feet around in the bed because it felt good, and mumbling things to her. In my head I was seeing things move around, and there were scenes playing out. Not sure where some of the images came from. At one point I convinced myself I was a mudfish and was trying to squeeze into a little hole when I was really just nesting up to her. At the same time of thinkng that, I was thinking to myself, Why am I thinking this, I know i'm not a mudfish. But I kept at it, probably to amuse myself because I wanted to see more things in my head. My gf did not like this however. The scenes kept happening and in just a few seconds I could see an entire story happen and then tell her about it. At one point I was being interviewed by a female reporter who was coming on to me and my gf did not like that either. <br><br>
The only rather scary part was when I was laying on the bed. The lights were off, but there were street lights outside. I thought that the light outside was trying to get in because the blinds were moving slightly from the fan blowing them. To me it was the light pushing them from the outsid, trying to get in. Then she turned the light on and I was scared because now it was the dark trying to come in to the room we werein and the blackness scared me. I was actually scared of the dark trying to come in. <br><br>
Overall it was enjoyable for me, but not her. She will never do it again just because of the vomiting. It seems to happen more with girls from the people I have encountered. I would like to say that I have vivid dreams often and consider myself to be very creative with an open and often exploring mind, so I was expecting something similar to the experience I had. It seemed like the more I thought about images and stories in my head the more they happened. The more happy thoughts I thought about, they doubled. Same wtih when I was scared. I became more and more scared the more I thought about it. On other experiences after this, such as insufflating 10mg at an Orbtal concert there were no such stories, just dancing and being happy and interacting with people around me. <br><br>
Just start off small and go from there. Be careful  : )<!-- End Body -->
