Here's a little background to start: <br><br>
I'm about halfway through my undergraduate studies in the areas of the science of consciousness so my understanding and interpretation of phenomenological experience is certainly skewed towards the realms of cognitive science and philosophy of mind.  I'm a rather experienced psychonaut, having tripped hundreds of times over the past half-decade on multiple psychedelics, both pure compound and ethnobotanicals.  So far, the 2C family and 5-MeO-DMT along with 4-HO-DET are the ones that have found a special place in my heart.  Lately life's been pretty good to me; I feel like I'm heading and developing in a positive direction and in a stable environment; which is more than I would've been able to say six months or one year ago.  So without further ado, onto the report:<br><br>
T+0:00 (7:30 am)<br><br>
Woke up this morning amazingly without needing my alarm at 7:30 after going to bed at 2:00, about two hours later than I intended.  I had pre-weighed 10mg of 2C-D HCl into a veggie-cap the night before to take first thing in morning to test out the reported cognitive-enhancement properties of this compound.  So after eating the cap with a glass of water, I got into the shower to wait for the first signs; this is the first time I've ever tasted this compound.  About fifteen minutes after taking the cap, I started having little burps that tasted powerfully like chemical.  It wasn't enough to upset my stomach or anything, but it certainly wasn't what I would call pleasurable. <br><br>
T+0:20- (7:50-8:15)<br><br>
Finished my shower without any strongly noticeable changes from the compound, but I was starting to feel something a 'clear-head' sensation where my thoughts came without effort, but I was still groggy as well, considering the early hour and lack of sleep.  I fixed the problem of the nasty urps with an orange and this fixed the problem promptly; I even conjured up a couple burps to see if the chemical taste remained, I speculate that it mainly involved my completely empty stomach.  At this point the mental clarity continued to build without any appreciable physical side effects.  <br><br>
I was starting to wake up more, with strong sun coming through the window and feeling refreshed from my shower.  My mood was in a general positive disposition; I had been a great mood the day before, which is somewhat out of character for me so close to the end of a semester.  So it was then that I sat down to pack some Herb into my pipe and read the first part of Nietsche's 'The Antichrist' for my philosophy class.  Usually it is very difficult for me to read anything that early in the morning with any level of appreciable comprehension, but today I was able to clearly focus on the text and make my way through the first 25 paragraphs without much break in concentration or thought.  Many times I find that I will have to re-read a few paragraphs to see how they fit into the text, but I experienced less of this.  <br><br>
The pot really synergized much more strongly than I expected and reminded me of combining pot and Modafinil in the past.  After taking a hit, a wave of something I can only call 'ego-drift' would occur.  I would be reading and suddenly my ego and self would soften and the semantic meaning of the text took on an animation of its own that would weave together into a tapestry of meaning as I continued to feed words into my mental loom like so much silk.  It was clearly an enhancement of the reading, but at times almost became hard to follow because of that same enhancement.  There were a couple moments when the text on the page appeared to break into blocks and segments that would 'drift' apart and then re congeal.  I was able to read for a solid hour before I had to take off and walk to class; the walk was fabulous.  Still no body load.<br><br>
T+2:00-3:30 ((9:30-11:00am)<br><br>
This was the period for my philosophy of religion class where we discussed N.T. Wright's critique of Robinson's work 'Honest to God' and Nietsche.  Normally I'm rather groggy for this class and can find myself spacing through a sentence here and there, but today I was keenly able to focus and absorb what it was that was actually being said.  Not that I usually can't, just that the earliness of the morning can have a detriment to the class.  Today, though, I was in a strange mix of being perfectly aware and focused while at the same time wanting to sleep and feeling groggy.  It seems that 2C-D provided a low level of stimulation (
<br>
T+ 4:30 (12:00 pm)<br><br>
Went and got some lunch.  I wasn't entirely sure if this would affect my appetite or not; while I knew that I wanted and needed to eat something, I wasn't feeling so driven to eat.  The food (a turkey sub with green peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, on Parmesan wheat with pepper jack cheese with orange juice and another orange grin) tasted great.  I took it outside to eat on the lawn since it was such a beautiful day.  I sat outside and enjoyed looking at the chemtrails that filled the sky; I used to find them disgusting, but now they seem beautiful in a Kierkegaardian sort of way.  It seems that whatever bit of a 'peak' this compound has is waning, but I don't feel so much that I've lost anything.  Not to suggest that it didn't have any effects or that they were innappreciable; but rather I am supremely pleased with the state that I've been left with.  Its a smooth clear-headidness with active mentality but not necessarily any push or drive to do anything with it, just whatever I please.  I'm also left with a serene calmness that may or may not be attributable to the drug; its just a general positivity and appreciation for existence.<br><br>
Overall this was a supremely enjoyable experience.  Completely un-intense at this level, but a great tool for academia, and maybe even as an infrequently-used mood stabilizer.  One trend that seemed to stand out throughout the morning was that I was noticing different things.  Not perspective-wise, but actual changes in my environment; I seemed very keen at detecting change.  For instance: gas went up five cents, the front doors of one of my university buildings got painted, my professor had his shirt un-tucked today; just things of that nature.<br><br>
So even though this was only a +1.5 on the shulgin scale, I'd rate it (at this dose at least) as an A or better for the DOSR scale.<!-- End Body -->
