 "report": "\n\n\n\nRecently, my friend introduced me to rolling tobacco which I have grown to love. He puts lavender or a dash of cinnamon into his rolled cigarettes. I decided to try it myself.\r\nI would either put a stalk of it into the pouch for the smell to rub off onto the tobacco, or place a small amount of flowers directly into the pouch. \r\nI don't notice a difference in the buzz, but I do notice a pleasent taste difference and slight sedative effects that may be placebo.\r\nI do enjoy adding lavander flavor to my tobacco.\n\n\n"
