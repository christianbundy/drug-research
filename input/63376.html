I tried DXM for the first time the other day, and it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I'm the kind of person who likes to read up on drugs before trying them out (I'm on a lot of different meds - currently Wellbutrin, Ritalin and Lamictal - and I've had some bad experiences in the past because of the interactions), so I made sure to do the research before going out and buying Robitussin Cough Gels.<br><br>
I only wanted to get to the first plateau that time, so at 10:30 I took 5 pills (15mgs each), which is a tiny amount, but I'm not very heavy, and according to the research I did 75mgs should have been enough. I figured they would take about an hour to absorb and a little over 20 minutes to kick in, so in the meantime I put on a movie (The Wizard of Oz) and some music (The Wall, Pink Floyd). :)  I didn't feel any effect at all until after midnight, and it was so minimal that I barely noticed anything in the first place.<br><br>
At around 12:40 I became more absorbed in the music and plot, totally drawn in in a way I never had been before, but that's about it. My mind still felt totally clear and lucid, I was exhausted, and I was completely connected with everything around me. My mom could have walked in the room, and I would have been able to hold a perfectly coherent conversation with her. If not for the fact that I had trouble walking upstairs later that night, I might have even put it down to a placebo effect. I did feel a little floaty when I stood up, which was actually pretty cool, but that was as intense as it got. The next morning I felt shaky and dizzy, but I took a shot of B12 and it cleared up fairly quickly. 2 hours later I was able to drive to school with no problem whatsoever.<br><br>
Overall, I was extremely disappointed. I think the problem might have been the dosage. Even though I'm pretty skinny and, according to some websites and a DXM calculator, 75mgs *should* have put me in the first plateau, 5 pills just isn't enough to get a high from. I'm going to try it again tonight, but this time I'll make sure to take more than 100mgs.<!-- End Body -->
