 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHello.\r\nI've been a very heavy marijuana smoker for almost 8 years. In addition, in the 6 months preceding the test I've gained 20 lbs (plenty of extra fat). I spent days searching the web on how to pass a urine drug test once I knew I will be tested for a new job and I had 7 days to pass it. Below is my account of how I've done it. During my search for information I was particularly thankful to people who posted their actual experiences, not just general advices, so I thought someone else might find my experience very helpful as well. Since I believe drug testing is a violation of my rights I felt I must make my personal experience of how to beat a drug test available to potentially help others. Please feel free to reformat the following information. What I have is pretty much is a time-line.\r\n-------------------\r\nDay 1\r\n  -- did nothing\r\nDay 2\r\n  -- ran a few miles\r\nDay 3\r\n  -- biked a few miles\r\nDay 4\r\n  -- did nothing\r\nDay 5\r\n  -- drank LOTS of beer throughout the day\r\n  -- took 2 tea-spoons of creatine (one in the morning, one in the evening)\r\n  -- took 2 pills of Activated Charcoal (same as above)\r\n  -- drank some *pure* Cranberry Juice\r\nDay 6\r\n  -- ate a very large meal in the middle of the day\r\n  -- drank some *pure* Cranberry Juice\r\n  -- drank about 12 beers\r\n  -- took 2 tea-spoons of creatine (one in the morning, one in the evening)\r\n  -- took 2 pills of Activated Charcoal (same as above)\r\n  -- took vitamin B-2\r\nDay 7 (morning before the test)\r\n  -- got up 5 hours before the test and made a gallon of 'Herbal Clean Master Tea' \r\n  -- took 1 tea-spoon of creatine\r\n  -- took 1 pill of vitamin B-2\r\n  -- 4.5 hours before the test started drinking the tea with little sugar in each cup, periodically taking gulps of *pure* Cranberry Juice\r\n  -- 1.5 hours before the test took 2 pills of creatine/B-2 (included with the tea)\r\n  -- pissed as often as I could during the entire time (didn't wait for full bladders)\r\n  -- pissed the final time before leaving home for the test\r\n  -- during the test pissed into the cup only from the middle of the stream\r\nPASSED THE TEST AND GOT THE JOB !!!\r\n:)\n\n\n"
