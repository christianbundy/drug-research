My boyfriend and I had been drinking for a few hours one night. We had bought a gram of DMT from a friend earlier in the week and had hit it a few times, always sprinkling some on top of a small amount of weed and simply smoking it. I'd tripped on acid and mushrooms many times before, so was not apprehensive of trying DMT at all; however, out of the two or three times I had tried it, I hadn't felt more than an uncomfortable, weird feeling that lasted for 10-15 minutes with no real hallucinogenic effects.<br><br>
This night, we only had one bowl, so my boyfriend tripped first. He put a little more than we had been putting in the bowl and had, as he put it, an amazing, incredible trip. He knew that I had had trouble feeling anything the past couple of tries, so he told me to just empty the rest of the bag when it was my turn. I took one long hit of the bowl, held it in for at least 15 seconds, and exhaled. Immediately I felt the DMT; I said 'Whoa,' and sat down on a bed in the room. I should add that the room was dark (some light was coming in from the adjacent room) and Pink Floyd's 'Echoes' was playing. By the bed on which I was sitting hung a Prussian flag that had a huge bird on it.<br><br>
Immediately the bird came to life and grew to about three times its normal size, making it about three and a half feet tall and two feet wide. I started spinning into a crazed, dark tunnel, with this bird flapping its outspread wings at me and screeching all the while. I really cannot describe what this tunnel was like; I know I definitely broke through in the DMT terminological sense, but it was certainly not in a good way. The only way Ive been able to describe it is that I felt like Alice in Wonderland when she is falling, but everyone I know and love (and those I simply know) were trying to kill me or otherwise hurt me as I fell. I did not see faces of these people, I just knew that everyone wanted to hurt me. Meanwhile, I was still experiencing the visuals that DMT trips are known for, but they were painful to look at and not pleasant at all.<br><br>
As soon as I got some grip on reality again, I called for my boyfriend, who was in the adjacent room. He ran in, and I was crying and convulsing on the bed. I told him to hold me, which he did, and I truly believe that had he not been there I would not have been able to recover the way I did from my trip.<br><br>
The whole thing lasted approximately ten minutes, maybe thirteen or so; I wasnt really keeping track. I do know that my body was physically affected by the trip for a good two hours after it happened. I couldnt stop crying, and images from the trip kept creeping back into my mind.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I believe that I could have had and will at some point have a good DMT experience. I had had a pretty rough weekend when I tripped, and mixing the drug with alcohol probably wasnt the greatest idea either. Next time I smoke DMT I will make sure that I am A)In a comfortable setting, probably where I can sit/lie down immediately and won't break anything; B)In a good mood/mindset C)Not drunk.<!-- End Body -->
