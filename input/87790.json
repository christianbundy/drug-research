 "report": "<p>Recently I was involved in a rock climbing accident, and although there was no real damage to my body, I was having terrible muscle spasms in my back. My doctor kindly prescribed me some 10mg Flexeril. </p><p>I took it throughout last week during classes, and I found it made me very relaxed and spacey. Almost like being really high, but not quite as fun. </p><p>So Friday rolls around, and we plan on going out to the bar. I took my regular dose (10mg) in the morning, approx 10am and anticipating a night out drinking, only took 5mg at 5pm. I started pregaming for the bar, with my 3 friends. We picked up a handle of Old Crow Whiskey. I had 2 large drinks of whiskey/red bull, and 2 more of whiskey/ginger ale. We then attempted to walk to the bar at 9pm.</p><p>That is where I blacked out.  Upon waking up in the morning, my friends made fun of me to no end. Apparently after getting to the bar, I sat a table outside alone, playing with my hands like an autistic dinosaur. I also tried to pick some girl up, but instead of talking i was only making gibberish noises...</p><p>Sounds like I had a great time, but mixing booze and flexeril was probably a mistake.</p>"
