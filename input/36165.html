Recently I had my wisdom teeth taken out, and my oral surgeon had given me a 5 day script for Percocet.  Before going into surgery I had no idea what it would be like (clearly) so I wasn't really worried about the pain and nearly scoffed at the idea that I would need a painkiller as strong as that.  I thought that I could get by on tylenol.  Just a little background, before this experience I wasn't exactly strictly straight edge, but I'd never done much more than smoke or drink, and never had taken any illegal substances.<br><br>
I went to my appointment, and I sat down in the operating chair and they gave me an IV drip of some kind of sedative.  I had been really nervous, but after the pinch of the needle and then waiting for the doctor to connect the tube, I felt the flooding sensation of the IV drip and began to laugh.  That's the last thing I remember until I 'woke up' still numbed by novacaine.  I got home, and someone had gone out to pick up my percocet for me, which I didn't believe I needed (I was still high from the drip, and felt pretty invincible if off-balance).  But then the novacaine wore off and the hell began.  I was in so much pain I was sobbing, and finally I got the percocet and took one pill, which was my prescribed dosage.  After an hour and 15 minutes I was still rocking back and forth and crying in excruciating pain, so I called the pharmacist who told me to take another pill.  I did, to no effect in 45 minutes, so then I took two tylenol, and while I was doing so the percocet suddenly kicked in.  This was my first conscious high experience, and it was...for lack of a better word, beautiful.<br><br>
First, I noticed that all my pain was gone, and a wonderful warmth had spread throughout my body.  I only realized that it must have been from the drugs because I realized suddenly that there was no blanket and that I was only wearing a sheet.  The lovely warmth was accompanied by a wonderful feeling of relaxation, like the feeling of finishing a workout and taking a hot bath and getting a massage all in one.  I didn't feel like I was necessarily sleepy because of the drugs, but that a nice nap would be the most pleasant thing in the world.  I stopped having any cares or worries, and it was mostly just a pleasant feeling.  I would have described the experience as bland had it not been so delightful.<br><br>
In the next days, I stuck to my prescribed dosage, but felt myself longing for a return of the pleasant feeling.  I didn't get the same effect with just one, and even the normal pain killing sedative effects weren't as complete.  I had already developed a tolerance (and probably already was, in a strange way).  One night after a day of popping 2 at a time twice instead of 1 pill four times, I noticed waking up after the effects had worn off for at least 8 hours and feeling shaky, anxious, irritable, nauseous, and I had a headache.  I can't believe that I would get withdrawal when I wasn't even sure that I was addicted, but whatever it was, it quickly went away when I took another pill.  This made me nervous, so I decided to hold off altogether, and stopped taking the percocet.<br><br>
After a couple of days had passed, I still had the remaining percocet, and I had been finding that I couldn't get to sleep without them.  I took them again not for the high, but just to be able to sleep.  Soon the normal dose didnt work, so one night I took 4.  It was even more beautiful than the first time.  I just lay on the couch, with my body feeling like a dead weight.  I couldn't move it or I didn't want to move it or both.  At one point I remember my focusing got fucked up and I laughed and counted my fingers (it looked like there had been 8 but I knew that there were really only 5) but anyway, the point is that I slept beautifully as well as felt amazing.  I tried a repeat performance the next night with little effect.  I got one hour of drowsiness tops, and I am back to insomnia, which I think was caused by this goddamn percocet.<br><br>
All I can say is, maybe it's just me but percocet would be a much better drug if my tolerance didn't leap every time I took one.  Unfortunately, this experience has changed my attitude about drugs, and opened up the door for new experiences.  If you knew me you would know that this is so atypical.<!-- End Body -->
