 "report": "<p>After reading so many positive things about this substance, its benign nature, warm body glow etc. I was eager as hell to give it a go.  Set and setting were ideal. I'm a happy little clam in my little clamshell home, which has been crafted specifically to provide a pleasant tripping environment. I was on no other meds.</p><p>As it turns out, the material yielded little in the way of positive results  I was only glad it was over quickly.  </p><p>As it happens:</p><p>00:20 - First alerts, developing quickly into hot flushes and a heavy feeling in my stomach. Im feeling slightly jittery and I may have arrhythmia. Im also feeling a bit sleepy.</p><p>00:45 - Feeling pretty crappy, jittery, achy, gassy, etc. Minor visuals not unlike 2c-e in nature are developing, but far more subtle, ahhh wait a minute ... Im starting to feel good ... oh, no Im mistaken, Im not feeling good at all. </p><p>00:50 - Im mentally lucid, but have a small amount of anxiety. The effects are getting more intense and I am having difficulty breathing at times. I am experiencing body tremors, and feeling cold, then hot. CEVs are present in brief moments, although gone entirely at others. My throat muscles feel constricted, like jaw clenching, only its throat clenching. This material is feeling a bit unfriendly, as if it wants to strangle me  it reminds me of smoked 5MeO-DMT, and it comes on in waves.  I ask my sitter to sit beside me and assist with calming my growing unrest.  Im feeling pretty glad at this point that I didnt take a higher dose.</p><p>01:15  In an attempt to settle my stomach and calm the tremors, Im eating an apple with cheddar cheese, and the taste is incredible  this is a definite food enhancer, despite the unsettled stomach.  I am now consistently cold and have a huge and unpleasant body load, which I would love to remedy with some yoga, but Im too damn cold to get up from under my blanket on the couch. At times I feel totally disembodied and certainly fatigued.  I am hypersensitive to drafts, and can feel the air moving about me.  </p><p>01:30  Wow, it seems the peak is over already, and I am disappointed, because I was waiting in vain for something interesting to happen.  Im going to the kitchen to make some grub.</p><p>02:00 - Just finished cooking a wonderful Tom Kah soup. While I was cooking, I went from sober to tripping and back so many times, the whole ordeal was very confusing. Music sounds very good though and has definitely provided a sense of comfort throughout the experience.  If nothing else, the substance has provided some minor visuals and a greater appreciation of music.</p><p>02:15 - Im feeling unsettled, not knowing what to do with myself. I dont know if I feel good or bad, but Im pretty sure its bad. The food tasted pretty good however, and took away some of my jitters.</p><p>03:00 - Just about baseline, but still jittery and somewhat cracked out.</p><p>03:50 - Ahhh  showered and beginning to feel somewhat human again.</p><p>By bedtime, I was feeling fine and slept soundly through the night. Next day as well, I felt fine.  All in all, this was not particularly enjoyable and Id say it was bordering on being difficult.  I will have to talk myself into doing it again, but I know I will, in time.  </p><p>As a further note, my girlfriend tried this one at 11 mg.  She had fairly strong visuals throughout the evening.  She reported a pleasant body buzz and was beginning to think she may have stumbled upon a nice recreational substance, up until about the 2 hour mark. From there she slid into a long drawn out comedown that kept her up all night with a stomach ache and a severely cracked out feeling, even puking at the 3.5 hour mark!</p><p>What a disappointment!  Im always a little sad when a new substance fails to offer up anything significantly beneficial. Ahhh well, such is the life of a research scientist, there are good ones and not-so-good ones to contend with.</p>"
