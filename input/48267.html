I ground 500 morning glory seeds in a coffee grinder and mixed them well with a glass of lemonade and drank them down.  Within twenty minutes I was on the phone with my girlfriend and the trip started to set in.  I felt overall just really happy and excited that the seeds actually worked because before taking the seeds I had my doubts.  I must of appeared out of it because it was around 8:00 at night and my mom came in to say goodnight and she ended up getting angry with me because she new I was high. <br><br>
After hanging up the phone with my girlfriend I went in the basement where my room was and I began to pace back and forth very confused.  Confused about life and what it would feel like to die and what was beyond all that we know.  At this time  I was lieing on my bed in my room with just my boxers on with my feet over my head and I kept saying this is what it must feel like to die and I kept saying this.  From what I can remember the idea popped into my head to cut myself because I knew that I couldnt feel anything.<br><br>
I got out of bed and grabbed a razor blade from my desk.  I slashed my wrist and laughed.  I saw the blood drip from my arm. I slashed my chest and stomach several times and even my penis and drew blood.  At that point I was convinced that I was insane and I told myself how insane are you nick?  I slashed my wrist again and it felt good, an intense feeling but not pain but closer to pleasure.  I pressed the razor to my wrist while I was looking up and dragged the razor along my wrist.  I looked down at my arm and said FUCK I had cut deep and was looking at my muscle.<br><br>
I knew I was in trouble so I ran upstairs and down the hallway to my moms room where she was sleeping.  I opened the door and said Mom Im sorry.  I kept saying Mom Im sorry for some reason she saw the blood and jumped out of bed and brought me to the bathroom.  She ran the wound under cold water and called 911.  I was standing in the bathtub when the paramedics came.  The paramedics asked me what I took and I said morning glory seeds.  They bandaged my wound and put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance I went.  I kept going on and on about the morning glory seeds and how good they where how the paramedics had to try them.  And off to the hospital I was.<br><br>
After getting to the hospital they wheeled me in and put me in between two curtain like booth things.  A nurse gave me charcoal to drink in a cup with a straw and I remember the charcoal tasting sweet as if it where a smoothy or something.  I drank it down as if it tasted good.  After sitting in a hospital bed all night the doctor finally came to sew my arm up.  He stitched my arm which took over 20 stitches and then I left the hospital with my mom.  Im still high mind you after all this time.<br><br>
Me and my mom were headed for Harbor Oaks Psychiatric hospital where my probation officer told me I had to go.  I was at the hospital for a week when they told me I was safe to leave.  From the hospital I went right to court where they had an emergency hearing for me and I was admitted in to the county detention facility where I was awaiting placement or a treatment facility to go to.  I was in detention for a month before leaving for a Youth Center where I was for just under six months.  Now Im home and still on probation and in drug court and am still getting high.<!-- End Body -->
