MDMA<br><br>
I'm writing this report about a week after my experience, I will do my best to report <br>
as accurately as possible. This was my first time when experimenting with MDMA, which I obtained in crystal form.<br><br>
----<br><br>
Me and J were attending a UK music festival. Over the course of the first two days, we took moderate amounts of cannabis and alcohol, nothing interesting to report there!<br><br>
Anyways, on the third day we got chatting to our 'neighbours' (the people camped next to us) and we found they had an amount of MDMA which they could sell to us. While I'm usually cautious buying unknown white powders from complete strangers, they seemed trustworthy and in truth we were coaxing THEM into selling us some from their personal stash, so I thought I'd make an exception. We bought 0.6g for £15, intending to split it 3 ways, between myself, J and Rob (a more experienced MDMA user we knew who<br>
was camped elsewhere.)<br><br>
Seeing as this J and me's first time, we split our share into 4 .1gram doses and folded them into seperate rolling papers to make a 'bomb'. Also worth noting is that I undertook this experience on a practically empty stomach, while J had just eaten a huge meal. This probably goes a long way in explaining the latency of his 'come up'.<br><br>
6:00 - Me and J took the first dose of .1g, then headed off into the stage area to watch some of the bands playing. The tent was completely packed with people and I was getting claustrophbic and irate, so much for MDMA the great empathogen I thought! Obviously the MDMA had not taken effect yet.<br><br>
6:30 - We left the stage area and began to wonder around, I began to feel lighter, sort of like I was floating or bouncing along as I was walking, I did not mention anything to J or Rob because I feared this was a placebo effect.<br><br>
7:00 - I'm talking incessantly to Rob, starting to 'come up' though I don't realise this until I'm told how dilated my pupils are. During this time my vision seems to shift occasionaly, almost imperceptably to the left or right. I'm very thirsty and am drinking a lot of water, Rob warns me not to overhydrate. The high is quite unlike my expectations, although I can very clearly feel its influence over me, I still felt mentally intact and capable of looking after myself. J still isn't feeling anything, I assure him that he will soon. <br><br>
7:30/8:00 - The high is really kicking in, I keep on wondering off from J and Rob and starting up random conversations with strangers. I don't have any inhibitions or feelings of self conciousness, just wanting to 'go with the flow', both literally and figuratively. Though I still feel slightly restrained, ensuring I don't get seperated from J and Rob. During this time, J has become impatient and has dropped his second dose. A short time after he informs me that he too is experencing similar symptoms to me (obviously the first dose finally kicking in). I grow a little aprehensive about J, <br>
fearing that when the second dose hits it might be too strong for him.<br><br>
8:30/9:00 - We spend some time in one of the many music tents, it feels very easy to move in rhythm to the music, in fact its very difficult NOT to. I also noted that I was quickly distracted, for instance I might me completely involved in a particular song at one moment, then stop dead in my tracks and become fascinated by the patterns of the strobe lighting the next. I genuinely feel that J and I are sharing an experience, we hug lots. At about this time I began to feel the euphoric buzz I experienced earlier was wearing off, so I decide to take my second dose.<br><br>
9:30/10:00 - Eventually we decide to leave the stage area and move into the camping section. This area still has plenty of tents blaring out music, but it feels much more relaxed and easier to meet new people. The second dose is hitting me hard, but not in a bad way. This is perhaps my favourate aspect of MDMA, the massive rush of energy building within, almost like a great beast growing within me. I feel no compulsion to fight the feeling or to control it in any way, it feels completely natural. J seems really spaced out alot of the time, but he assures me everything is ok. I'm finding it really easy to connect with other people we meet, especially those also using MDMA. <br><br>
10:00/12:00 - We make plenty of new friends and invite them back to Robs camp. At about this time I begin to experience jaw chattering, this was only a minor inconvience although it made it difficult for me to speak, which was all I wanted to do! One of our new friends (who was also on E) gave me a piece of chewing gum which resolved my problem happily. Though this might seem an insignificant detail to you, it really stuck in my head because it was symbolic of my entire experience. Here we were, just some complete strangers who genuinely cared about each other. there was no profit or personal gain, we were all just together, for the sake of being together. Robs camp was pretty active, with plenty of people comming and going, but that STILL wasn't enough. I was craving new people, new perspectives, every new voice I heard seemed to be like another piece of a cosmic jigsaw. I wanted to know everything about everyone, 'where are you from?' 'where do you want to be?'. I'd like to point about that I felt in control and capable of rational thought throughout this.<br><br>
12:00+ - Around this time it feels like the effects of the MDMA have worn off for me first, then later for J. The euphoria and exitement has disapeared, and what seemed like the greatest party in the world a few hours ago is increasingly looking like a cold, muddy field. Me and J relax, smoke a little bud, and contemplate our experience. The verdict: Defintely trying this again! And we did for the rest of the weekend.<br><br>
Aftereffects: None, I didn't experience any kind of 'comedown' and post e depression.<!-- End Body -->
