 "report": "<p>Having bought resin over the net I was disappointed to find I could only find dosage gidelines for kratom leaf tea. I started off with a dosage of 1g dissolved in hot water and the effects were negligible so a week later I upped it to 2g of resin. At this level the effects were far more noticeable so I'd consider this as a minimum dose for someone of my build. There was a fair amount of skin tingling and a general feeling of warmth and happiness. </p><p>The following week I tried a dose of 3g made up into a tea. This time I experienced a 'rushing' sensation and after 30 mins or so I felt as though all my body hair was trying to stand on end. The main effects wore off after a couple of hours but I kept a sense of wellbeing until I went to bed that night. The following day there were no ill effects or come down whatsoever.</p>"
