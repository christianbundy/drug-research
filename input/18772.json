 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI recently got 30 vicodin pills from my doctor for a cracked growth plate. \r\nNot having ever heard of this drug searched the internet and discovered the power which lie in my hands and so the experience began.\r\nT+ 00:00\r\nI ingested 4 X 5/500mg pills of vicodin and sat and waited for the effects to come on.\r\nT+ 00:15\r\nno major effects yet, feeling a little warm\r\nT+ 00:30\r\nfeeling quite comforable, warm and numb not a care in the world. jamming on the guitar is quite nice music flowing like water.\r\nT+ 00:55\r\njust kind of....here feeling tingly and very numb thinking of seeing what its like to ride a bike like this. hmm (running to bike)\r\nT+ 01:45\r\nsaw some friends while out got some eats at 7-11 and all was good\r\nT+ 02:15\r\nAlmost all the effects are now gone except a feeling that the best comfortable feeling ever, Im going to sleep well tonight.\n\n\n"
