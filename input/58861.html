After experimenting with Morning Glory extracts for sometime now, I finally made a batch this past weekend that was extremely pure and psychedelic. I started with the untreated Pearly Gates variety from an internet supplier and ground them with a coffee grinder. Not happy with the consistency of the grind, I've since purchased a burr grinder but haven't had the chance to try it yet. Anyway, I mixed the grind with Everclear (about 3 grams to 1 ounce ratio), sealed the container, and stored it in the refrigerator for what ended-up being several months. Not sure how the length of time may have affected the process, I was just waiting for the right time to trip :) <br><br>
When that time came, I shook up the mixture for a few minutes and then strained it through a gold mesh coffee filter twice. The resulting morning glory liquor was very pure in that there was little to no seed residue remaining. I then measured out 2 ounces and mixed it with enough grapefruit juice to make it palitable. <br><br>
Before I even finished the drink, within minutes, I was feeling quite 'electric'. The peak occurred a couple of hours later and included some amazing closed-eye, mind-morphing visuals. There was no significant nausia, only waves of bliss that kept me laughing most of the time. When my stomach did tighten-up a bit in the beginning, smoking pot was the perfect remedy. <br><br>
The night's entertainment consisted of several songs from the George Harrison Tribute concert, the 1st Woodstock DVD, and then part of Saturday Night Live before I got tired and fell asleep about 5 hours after drinking the concoction. It was the first Morning Glory trip I've had that didn't make me feel sick in some way and I attribute that to the extraction process I used. Happy trails!<!-- End Body -->
