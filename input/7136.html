Well,it all started on a Friday afternoon at my girlfriends house.We decided that we would go with her mom and younger siblings to wal-mart to buy a pair of shoes. We wandered over to the pharmacy and noticed as we always do, the Coricidin Cough &amp; Cold Tablets. We decided that I would steal some. So I picked up 3 boxes as she did also. We proceeded to steal them. We got home and took 1 box each. We then split the rest evenly. On saturday I took another box. Then on Sunday when I woke up I still felt it pretty strong. <br><br>
I dont really remember how we managed to get more but on that Sunday I took a box at about 11:00 a.m. We went to a local park and man was I hammered. Everything was moving even when I was standing still. I looked half-crazy and my pupils were about the size of pennies. <br><br>
Now, I have a chemical imbalance in my brain known as bipolar disorder. So depression is always around. I started feeling depressed so when I got home I took another box. Bad Idea....I stayed up half the night laying on the floor listening to Voodoo by Godsmack, which I ordinarily wouldnt be listening to. The next day when I woke up I knew I had to chill out for a couple of days. My mother drove me and my brother to wal-mart to buy a fish for him. I stole 2 more boxes of Coricidin. I took one when we got home. <br><br>
I was pretty sure that i was going to die. I called my girlfriend on the phone crying,sweating horribly,and not knowing what I was doing. I told her about it and she told me that it would be ok. Just not to take anymore. I told my mom good night,because she was going to sleep. We got into an argument. I then got really mad and took the other box. I called her again and she started crying and screaming because an overdose was in question we thought. She put her mom on the phone and she comforted me. <br><br>
The next day I woke up and I was still really fucked up. I went to see my psychiatrist in the morning. Then when I got home I started feeling really depressed. I took a razorblade and slashed my wrist and forearm 12 times...blood galore, dripping all over the floor. My mom came out to the garage and saw me bleeding pretty bad and rushed me to the hospital. I spit it all out about all the pills. They then committed me to a mental hospital.<br><br>
I spent 7 days in there. My blood pressure was high for 4 days. I slept for about 15-16 hours a day for the 1st 3 days. I just got out today and I'm trying to promise myself not to take them anymore...but who knows what will happen? I may take them again.<br><br>
For any recreational Coricidin users out there..I'm not going to harass you about it..just be careful. I wish i would have been.<!-- End Body -->
