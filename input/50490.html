Usually I take 600 mg moclobemide (selective and reversible type a monoamineoxidase inhibitor) per day for depression but prior to this experiment I abstained for 24 hours in order to lower moclobemide plasma concentrations to a clinically more or less insignificant level.<br><br>
I took l-phenylalanine and some aniracetam in the morning with the habitual coffee overdose to get myself going and then proceeded to smoke a little bit of cannabis. Coffee and cannabis were my vices at the time of this unfortunate experiment and I felt I needed them in my system to feel normal.<br><br>
After some consideration I proceeded with my plan to sample the recently acquired 2c-b-fly. To get some excitement through the mist of anhedonia in my mind I decided not to make a solution with known concentration and instead eyeballed something close to 1.5 mg of the powder and insufflated it. I didn't consider this too suicidal because looking at the molecular structure my intuition did not see any contraindicated affinities. While sniffing the mirror clean I accidentally insufflated an unknown second dose which might total the amount to somewhere in the range of 2-4 mg.<br><br>
At first there was nothing separable from the usual placebo I feel with all unknown new substances but then something moved inside my mind. I just didn't know what but anyway I decided it was a sign of activity, + on the Shulgin scale. I went to see some friends to share my cannabis with them. My hands and feet had an unusual cold sweat which I associated with the research chemical. We smoked rather copious amounts of cannabis and my tolerance to weed must've become apparent to the friends as they were close to kite high and I was just looping with the thought that maybe the 2c-b-fly was active or maybe not. I was obsessed with the thought that all I felt was the best placebo of my life, ++ perhaps. Only sure thing was that the cannabis had little effect. In retrospect my behaviour was probably out of social context and a little too introverted at first.<br><br>
I have vague memories that I insufflated something during the visit which might have been more 2c-b-fly, perhaps ketamine or who knows what. I also have even more vague and shattered memories that I turned myself off (somehow killed myself by ceasing to breathe) because existence was too boring and the company disappointing. Then I came to be once more and after an episode of hypothermic chills acted extremely extroverted and sentimental - switching wildly from utter despair to hilarious elation and back or whatnot. It was too much or just nothing, too real or just some fucked up mind game. I am too indifferent to ask them what the fuck actually happened. Some seriously skewed terminator/hellboy/matrix type of revelation or unveiling was definitely beginning and a lot of neologisms or otherwise obscure terminology relating loosely to theosophia, apocryphics, thermodynamics, computers and astronomy started to come out of my mouth. I was incapable to keep them inside because the flow of thought kept going faster and faster and became too intensely ecstatic to be restrained. I guess this could be considered an eerie transcendental ++++ or a sort of psychic channeling if plain toxic psychosis is too big a thing to accept. All this seemed to pass somewhat so that I felt almost completely normal when going back home.<br><br>
However, the sweaty hands and feet did not go away. I should have read that as some kind of warning sign but for some reason I did not see it or just didn't care. So when the tide of depression started to ebb again I just took my moclobemide as usual to get rid of it. But then I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep for days and the abovementioned unveiling came back with unforeseen force and I started to believe in it. <br><br>
I had the worst insomnia of my life. I tried pretty much everything. Zopiclone just made me delirious and I hallucinated profusely. Cannabis had no effect. Wine (Casillero del Diablo) was too tasty to get drunk with. Quetiapine had no effect, although I was probably too cautious in dosing it as I want my dopamine fresh with no d2-antagonism - even on the verges of insanity and beyond.<br><br>
I was hospitalized in the psychiatric ward for a night and finally got a good night of sleep. I don't know what they gave me (perhaps mirtazapine and lorazepam, probably something antipsychotic too) but the next day I felt refreshingly normal although kind of heavily sedated. I had some compulsive movements resembling dance in response to music but I am not sure if there was any music playing or if I just imagined it. Fortunately it passed as quickly as I became aware of it and I was subsequently released.<br><br>
So to cut this rambling short I conclude it was pretty stupid to experiment with such reckless disregard for my own life or sanity. Just don't go horsing around with 2c-b-fly + maoi until more is known about the pharmacology of this research chemical.<!-- End Body -->
