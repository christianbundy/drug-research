My name is Kayla, I'm 17 years old and now sober.  I had this experience on acid; it was fucking insane. I HATE acid.  I know a lot of people that would disagree with me but this is my opinion: Acid is a very dangerous drug and you really do have to be prepared for a trip.  Anything and everything will affect it, even shit from when you were 6 years old.  I've had a really messed up life so the first time I tripped was crazy. Here's my story.....<br><br>
One day I was just kickin it with my friends and they invited me to a rave.  It was my first rave so I felt a little awkward there but then I saw a few friends and felt a little more comfortable. It was about 11:30pm when my friend found some acid and we decided we both wanted to trip.  We each bought 5 hits of blotter acid and took them all at once.  At about 12:15, I started feeling weird, not hallucinating, but I just wasn't comfortable and I started noticing things change, like my fingers were discolored and it looked disgusting.  My arms and wrists looked like they were bleeding everywhere and I turned to a friend and asked them if I was bleeding everywhere and they all just sat and laughed at me and told me I was, and that scared the hell out of me.  That's when I realized how fucked up I was. I started to peak an hour later, and when someone talked to me, I couldn't understand them, it sounded like they were rats and they were just squealing so I'd run away...and the bass at the party was making me think like a psycho, like how much I just wanted to kill someone or what if I die....weird thoughts kept going through my head. I didn't know what to do with myself, I started puking, I couldn't understand anyone, my arms and legs felt like they were about to fall off, I thought I was bleeding everywhere, and the worst part is, none of my friends cared.  They just laughed at me like I was their entertainment and pretending all of this.  <br><br>
That's all I remember from there on. I don't remember shit.  All I know is I woke up at my friend's and I was completely out of it for 3 days. I was practically delusional. I wouldn't respond if anyone said my name and I couldn't walk.  Some of the other odd things people said I did:  I tried to run through a brick wall in front of the paramedics, and I was sweating and crying for about 2 hours.  As for my friend, she was hospitalized and put into rehab for months.  The doctors said her heartbeat was going up and down so rapidly she could have died any second....I guess I was just lucky, I took the exact same acid, off the same sheet, the same amount, and we weigh exactly the same.<br><br>
That's my story....you might laugh, but believe me, if that was you, it wouldn't be so funny......anyway, if you're gonna do acid, do it in a safe place you're familiar with and with people that care and have done it before.  If it's your first time, know what to expect and don't take more than two hits your first time!!<!-- End Body -->
