I think I just met God or someone like him last night. I met him the first day of summer. My parents had gone to sleep, and are really sound sleepers, so I went in the backyard and sat on a plastic chair and proceeded to smoke about $20 worth of good bud, about a gram of salvia, and a small bowl of opium all which where left over from a party I went to the other day. When I was done I got up and went inside, after wondering around my backyard and the nearby street of course for a good 30 min. or so trying to catch a butterfly because I had never see one at night and I tried to follow him to see where he was going and where all butterflys went at night.<br><br>
I grabbed a soda and went downstairs trying to be as quiet as possible, but for some reason the soda was so heavy I kept dropping it on the hardwood floor. I also tripped over my sleeping dog. By the time I finally got downstairs I realized I had left the T.V. on and it was trying to hypnotize me. I tried to fight it because I wanted to lay in my bed and listen to Exodus but eventually I was subdued and sat on the couch. What I saw on T.V. truly scared me. Here are a few excerpts from a piece of paper I found nearby that I scribbled on about the programs and commercials I was watching:<br><br>
'Breaking the law is really O.K., They (I'm not sure who) think I'm gay, and everything is Christian biased'.<br><br>
I'm only going to type what was on there because my other thoughts where so random and escaped my mind no sooner than I could think of them. After realizing that the Christians where trying to convert me I wondered if I was dead. I started wondering if I was dreaming at first and I remembered some things I had read about lucid dreaming to see if I was dreaming or not. I tried to spin in a circle to make myself dizzy and tried to move the hands on a clock mounted on the wall with my mind. None of it worked or meant anything considering I forgot what these things where supposed to do. But I couldn't shake the feeling I was not really 'there'. The whole time my head felt really warm and there was a constant buzzing in my head. Then it happened, when I sat back on the couch.<br><br>
As I laid back I looked out the window at the stars and suddenly I was thrust into outer space in the midst of them. I looked around scared but I couldn't see where Earth was or any of the other planets for that matter but endless stars and space. I'm lost in space I thought. There where 3 large stars in front of me, one purple, another blue-green and the last red. I asked them where I was and they said they couldn't tell me or they'd have to kill me. I said ok and asked what was happening, but before the stars could respond I blurted out 'YOUR GOD ARENT YOU!!!!'. They sighed and replied yes but I wasn't supposed to know that. I realized God couldn't be one being (I forgot how I came to this conclusion) so he split himself into three seperate beings and formed a sort of council. One star represented man, animals and life in general, another the earth and gases and air and all other things in the world that are there but are not alive, and the last represented spiritual essence, love, creativity and all the intangible things we know are there but can't touch or see.<br><br>
I asked if by praying one could really talk to him (or them). They told me that there are so many people asking for stuff that eventually they just tune them out. I replied by saying 'I totally understand what you mean man, I tune out people all the time'. I had millions of questions to ask but they didn't seem to matter because just being up there next to God put me at ease and I felt that everything made sense and was ok.<br><br>
I kept slipping in and out of this state and when I woke up I kept hearing foot steps upstairs. I knew it was my mom, for some reason and I felt that she had all the answers to what was happening to me but I was too scared to go up and talk to her because of how stoned I was. I felt that there was a sense of God in my mom that she had been trying to show me (by trying to get me to go to church and always trying to make me do the 'right thing') that God was trying to make me go see. Then I realized that God was in everyone that we love. That's why we don't need to pray constantly to have faith or a sense of religion, we just need to spend time with those we love, and it's different for every person, it may be a girlfriend you have or a really good friend. The sense I got from being with God up there was the same as being with my mom or dad when they take care of me or solve a problem for me.<br><br>
I guess I fell asleep sometime while coming to this realization because the next thing I know God was waking me up. He told me I had to go and I awoke on my couch. I'm not sure if I slipped into a coma, died, or just passed out on my couch but that was the most detailed, vivid dream I have ever had and it really scared the shit outta me.<!-- End Body -->
