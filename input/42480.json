 "report": "<p>I received 25 tablets of Clonidine from a friend, in payback of $25 he owed me. I and a friend went to pick it up, and we went with his sister to the mall to get her nails (??) done. On the way to the mall, me and my friend both dropped 2 of these tablets each. Within 20 minutes, we started to feel the normal 'drug euphoria' we get anytime we take a new drug, the giggling, the excitement, and all that good stuff...However, within 40 minutes of taking the pills, we started to actually feel some extreme side effects. </p><p>We sat in a Bose store, listening to some music they had playing. We began to talk, and things really started to come easily to the mind at first, then after about 10 minutes of relaxing, we both felt as if we had smoked an ounce of pot, and were really burnt out. Things were visually moving slow, speech was beginning to get slurred, and our hearing wasnt too great. We snapped out of it after about 25 minutes sitting on that couch, and we decided to make our way to the nail salon to meet up with his sister. </p><p>As soon as we stood up, an extreme sense of vertigo smacked us right in the face, and we both stood staggering. Walking was a challenge, and we found ourselves stopping every few minutes to sit and relax. Again, we came across 2 leather massage chairs, and again, we sat talking for about 15 more minutes. 3 other kids walked by and said something I didnt like (I also noticed I was more aggressive than usual) so this was the only thing that motivated me to move, as my friend sat and watched. Waiting for him, I noticed the floor wiggling, as a water bed would, and the lights seemed very dim for a mall. </p><p>Now, about an hour after taking these pills, the effects were devastating. Both of us were walking aimlessly, almost zombie like. Emotionless faces, mouths hanging open, and eyes half shut, if not all the way shut some of the time.  We stopped finally across from the nail salon, on a bench. I was barely awake, and I glanced at my friend, whose head was hung down, chin touching his chest, and a stream of drool falling from his lip, to his lap. I couldnt help but laugh at this sight, but I also worried a little bit. I whacked him with whatever strength and energy I had left, and he jolted like he was sleeping in the middle of class. (this was after a kid walked by and tried talking to him, and his mother scolded him away. I really felt like a druggie then) </p><p>The two girls walked out of the salon and were surprised at how messed up we were. I was just as surprised, as I could barely talk, see, move, or hear anything. On the way out of the mall, we both took 2 more tablets, and decided to totally chill the ride home. 5 minutes into the car ride home, we were both knocked out cold, unaware to anything that was going on. My friends sister said we were both talking to them, and we were conscious half the time, but I dont remember anything of the sort. When we arrived home, almost 2 hours after taking the first dose, our eyes were so sensitive to light we had to shield them walking into the house. </p><p>We smoked a little pot after getting home, and about 20 minutes later, our night was over. We passed out, at around midnight, and didnt wake up until 11 or so the next morning. The morning was pretty awful. I felt as if I had worked out 12 hours the day before, and my head felt like it was a log in a lumber mill. The day after is certainly the worst part about this trip.</p>"
