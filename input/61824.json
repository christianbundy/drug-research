 "report": "<p>A summary of 8 Amanita muscaria experiences. To start off with try the grade A caps work much better than the extract for me.</p><p>At low doses some traditional affects seem to be salvation, increase in mood, interest in previously uninteresting things. I was fascinated with water and gas lines coming into the house. Thoughts of religion, particularly Buddhism, and Christianity. Im more into Native American philosophy normally.  Laughter seeing he funny side of things, enjoyed television which I normally only tolerate.  Profound feelings of oneness.  Deep thinking.</p><p>Ive had some difficulty with larger doses however getting stuck in time loops for what seemed like would last forever one loop going into another constantly repeating itself in different degrees. I thought it would run itself out but due to contact with the outside world I ended up in the hospital then mental hospital until things got straightened out. Some negative affects at large doses were time loops, paranoia. Pissing my pants (it seemed like a good idea at the time, I thought I was caught in a mouse wheel spinning upside down and around in a figure 8 pattern and didnt want to move). Also extreme honesty, felt nothing wrong with giving honest answers to everything due to felt oneness with outside objects.</p><p>Many mystical experiences resulted. I can not remember most of these dealing with the laws of the universe, humanity and hope in general. Very open to suggestions. Strength wise Id say Amanita is far stronger than mary jane. Not a party fungus. More something to be taken and attend a local church or hang out in nature. Im not a party person lately. Environment is important taking it and attending school got me in a certain amount of trouble when I happily announced to a history class that owning slaves wasnt necessarily all bad and other bizarre conculsions coming out of  not believing what I was hearing plus intrinsic trust in the fabric of the universe. </p><p>Overall helpful in the spiritual centers of the body, aiding in compassion and understanding. I viewed these plants as devine and a blessing. I also enjoy the green, regular mushrooms, top 2, in various varities, never tried lsd, very interested. H.b. woodrose better than morning glory, gave me some interesting insights. Im scared very much so of datura, ayahuasca, and salvia. </p><p>Far more than a mild experience, amanitas can be downright intense and earth shattering. A 4 mushroom experience left me in a daze seeing opposities disappear, with the knowledge they were only real and maintained by me. I literally couldnt tell which way was up and almost walked up the side of a wall chris angel style, for real. Also couldnt tell difference between dry, wet, night, day, dreaming, awake, future, past all other imaginable differences didnt quite blur the edges enough to reach the white light or atman, but deep non the less, will continue to use these blessed plants.</p>"
