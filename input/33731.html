I'd read what other people had posted about extracting an opium type substance from opium poppy seeds so I gave it a go. In the UK poppy seeds are legal but hard to buy in bulk to I had to scrape the seeds off a big baggete...I got about 2g in the end (not much I know).<br><br>
I put the seeds in a saucepan with some water and boiled gelty until the water was reduced, I was left with a load of poppy seeds with a slightly sticky residue on them, I then proceeded to make a cheap bong out of a bottle a straw and some foil. I put the seeds in the bowl at the top and spent a long time drying the seeds out and trying to get the thing lit in the end I got a few good (but rather painfull) hits off it, and felt a mild relaxation and a noticable high when it first came on but only very slight...no more than about 4mg of codeine (very poor).<br><br>
I can still feel a skin high-touching my skin feels better than normal and I've had to go back and rewrite this post as my brain has slowed down a lot. All in all very cheap but not worth the damage to my lungs, I'd recomend extracting a few hundred mgs of codeine, much more pleasurable.<!-- End Body -->
