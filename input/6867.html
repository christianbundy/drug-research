Last summer in my midwestern city there was an influx of good, strong, clean ketamine, available at budget prices.  While I still keep K as an active member of my pantheon of recreational buzzes, I did most of my experimenting then.  Anyway, while enjoying a sunny-stony afternoon with my exgirlfriend, I remembered some friends of mine back in the day bragging about smoking K.  'Hmmmm, I think Ill check it out' I thought, and grabbed the bong.  <br><br>
Bong stats: 1 ft. plastic honey-bear, lots of water.<br><br>
Bowl stats: brass bowl, filled with cheap, shaky weed as a base, with a big snowy lump of powdered K (approx. 30mg)<br><br>
Set &amp; setting: already a bit stoned, chilling in my apt, music on, sitting in the corner under my turntables<br><br>
Mindset: curious<br><br>
I sparked the bowl and inhaled, and was immediately assaulted by the severely nasty-ass taste of burning K.  I can best describe it as strongly chemical/artificial, like when you get a whiff of some powerful industrial solvent.  It also sort of reminds me of the aftertaste of herbal speed pills.  It sucks!  It makes your mouth numb, burns the hell out of your throat, and tastes like sucking on a nickel.  Ive never met anyone who liked it at all.<br><br>
Of course, crappy taste isn't enough to stop me, so I smoked about 3-4 milky thick hits.  The buzz was a lot like Nitrous Oxide, actually.  It made my fingers and face numb &amp; cold, and relaxed my body.  I was a bit dizzy and my speech was thick and slurred.  Overall, I could compare it to snorting a small bump of ketamine, say 10-15mg.  However, there was no wait - as soon as I inhaled the smoke I felt the effects.  I guess that's the only bonus of smoking K.  Definitely no disassociation, spins, nausea or other major side-effects I usually notice on large doses of snorted K.    <br><br>
After about 10 minutes, I felt sober again.  Looking down, I saw that there was still half of the lump left.  So, I guess it's safe to say that smoking K is *economical*.  I started smoking it again, while arguing with my girlfriend because she said that it stank up the whole room.  (She wouldn't try it either, based on the smell.)  Same effects.<br><br>
And so on, for about 4 come-up's and downs.  After that, the taste was just so nasty it wasn't worth it.  Even worse, every bowl Ive ever smoked K out of has been permanently tainted with the taste.  Be warned!<br><br>
Since then, I smoke K occasionally, usually with a friend and in the 'there's nothing left to do, lalala, we're so wasted, hey let's smoke K HAHAHAHA' type mood.  One time, we had no weed, so I melted red rock (I know it's not opium) and ketamine together and smoked it.  Same effects as before.   <br><br>
In conclusion, smoking K is a quick, cheap buzz, a lot like whippets (nitrous canisters).  However, between the disgusting taste and the fact that it ruins your bowl, it's not my chosen buzz!<!-- End Body -->
