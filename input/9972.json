 "report": "<p>\nI'm not going to make a huge report here because, well frankly, smoking cubensis is completely overrated.</p><p>After a trip one night a while back I had together with a couple of friends decided that it once and for all was time to test if it really worked smoking cubensis mushrooms as we had heard from others. Since we during this period felt we had more then enough mushrooms we decided that we might as well spare some to ease our curiosity.</p><p>We took the shroompowder and placed it on the stove, rolled up a piece of tinfoil too a straw, and as soon as smoke began to emit from the powder I started 'chasing the dragon'.</p><p>My first reaction was that it actually tasted really good.</p><p>My second reaction was that I didn't feel more trippy at all.</p><p>And that's about it. If it wasn't for the price I would actually consider smoking cubensis on a regular basis because it tasted so good in my oppinion. But as I said, I noted no psychoactive effects what so ever.</p>"
