We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
Earlier this afternoon I filled up a vial with 45 ml of High Quality Lab Grade Chloroform (CHCl3) and pocketed along with a transfer pipette (kind of a big eye dropper). I grabed a thin rag at home and proceeded downtown with 2 friends, N and A. Both smoke weed but were not cool with anything else, but  I experiment with many things. I was doing the chloroform by using the pipette to soak an area of about a half dollar of the rag with the chloroform, and then putting it over my mouth and breathing in. <br><br>
It smelled sweet at first but really smelled more like gasoline or ether once I took a good whiff, so I was unable to hold the rag right up to my mouth, but instead had to hold it away slightly. After doing about 2 or 3 of the half dollar sized spots I would get very fucked up and the sound changed and I would be tripping around sort of. It would wear off in a minute and I could do another spot to get the feeling back. We got to this local headshop, and N and A went in but I stayed outside. I did another spot or so and walked in. I was really messed up just like earlier and my head seemed to be throbbing. The next thing I knew some guy was asking if I was okay, and I started running. I didnt know what was going on so I called N's cell and he said that what I did wasn't cool and to meet him somewhere. When I met him he informed me that I had passed out and knocked over a bunch of skateboards and things and that they were gonna call the cops when I ran out. N said I was banned from the store. <br><br>
After about 10 minutes all effects were gone except for a slight headache.<!-- End Body -->
