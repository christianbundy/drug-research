 "report": "<p>Im a relatively experienced morning glory tripper, but after several recent bad trips (severe nausea for 5-6 hours after ingestion), I began to eat the seeds in low doses of less than a hundred separated by an hour to an hour and a half. Some nights, Id get down 50 or 60 before Id stop, and later decide against tripping in favor of going to bed.</p><p>Im also an insomniac. On some nights, Ive been up as early as 4-5 in the morning when I have to be up at six. Morning glory seeds arent practical on weekdays, but a great way to make up sleep debt on the weekends without sleeping in; although psychoactive effects at such a low dose are hardly noticeable while awake (if at all), on a given morning glory night I have at least 10 dreams I can remember the following morning. Also, the dreams are unusually vivid, logical and long, with one or two of them being lucid dreams. </p><p>Even though I wake up feeling heavy and physically tired, after 20 minutes or so of this I feel refreshed and energetic, a great way to prepare oneself right before a long and exhausting week.</p>"
