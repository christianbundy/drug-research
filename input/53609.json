 "report": "<p>I have been diagnosed with Crohn's desease in 2005 (snr year of highschool). Though I have medication, Asacol, my stomach would never be settled and I would have to run to the bathroom several times a day. I felt like a prisoner of this disease as I could only eat certain foods and go to places that had bathrooms.</p><p>I started smoking weed frequently in college and noticed that it would take away my stomach pain and even settle it.  I began to smoke it every night around 1 or 2 am to sooth my stomach for the following day and it worked. For the first time in over a year I was able to go about my day in a normal fashion due to the weed I had smoked in the early morning.</p><p>Is it a cure? no, but it certainly helped me cope with eating disgusting campus food.</p>"
