 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have been diagnosed with Crohn's desease in 2005 (snr year of highschool). Though I have medication, Asacol, my stomach would never be settled and I would have to run to the bathroom several times a day. I felt like a prisoner of this disease as I could only eat certain foods and go to places that had bathrooms.\r\nI started smoking weed frequently in college and noticed that it would take away my stomach pain and even settle it.  I began to smoke it every night around 1 or 2 am to sooth my stomach for the following day and it worked. For the first time in over a year I was able to go about my day in a normal fashion due to the weed I had smoked in the early morning.\r\nIs it a cure? no, but it certainly helped me cope with eating disgusting campus food.\n\n\n"
