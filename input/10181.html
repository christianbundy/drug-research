After doing some research on nutmeg, I decided to give it a try on one boring Sunday afternoon. I filled clear gelcaps with nutmeg, yes, it sounds like a bit of work, but I was able to fill one ounce worth the capsules in about 10 min. I took the nutmeg and sat down to wait for the effects. Six hours later I was maybe feeling a little light-headed. I was rather disappointed with the results, and went to bed. The next morning I woke up and again felt a little light-headed, but not much. I then went to class (I'm a college student) and that is when it hit me.<br><br>
I felt like I had drank about 8 or 9 beers, but not in a real pleasurable way. It felt like a couple hours after I had 12 or so beers, and was coming down, and feeling a little tired and such. This was 8:30am, about 15 hours after I took the nutmeg. To make a long story short, I just got more tired, and felt more messed up all day. And while this was not altogether unpleasant, it was not that much fun either. I slept most of the day, skipping the rest of my classes and meals. I then slept all night, and when I awoke in the morning, I was still a little light headed until about noon. So I had felt the effects for basically 36 hours after taking it. The only really negative effect was my eyes, nose and mouth were incredibly dry for those two days.<br><br>
Good Luck!!!<br><br>Shift_Master<!-- End Body -->
