I am writing from 20 years of usage and 2 years of physical opiate addiction. I never expected to be addicted. I had walked away from cocaine, methamphetamine, clonazepam, diazepam, xanax,and nicotine. Withdrawal consist of intense pains, sleeplessness, cramping diareah, runny nose, chills, sweats...<br><br>
I went on methadone for a month and had to quit because I was afraid of having an auto accident and hated having to be at the clinic daily. Quitting the methadone was hard but I did it with the help of xanax and oxycontin. You cannot get off but it keeps you from being sick. A Doctor precribed Suboxone for me. He said it was like closing the door to my receptors but keeping it a little bit open with the opiates. I was on well on my way into withdrawal but It had only been about 26 hrs. since my last OC. The first thing I did was chomp the pill and swallow it whole.<br><br>
I did not feel better. The Naxalone was 'shutting the door' and giving me headaches. I went online looking for a way to chemically separate the medicine. I found that the Naxelone could not be absorbed sublingually but the Bup could. When I quit swallowing, life became much nicer. I keep the spit in my mouth as long as posssible then I put it in a bottle. The satisfaction does last longer than the other pills. I do plan on phasing off in a month or so. I do have daily chronic back pain that Suboxone supresses.I seem to be getting a lot more accomplished without wasting time looking for pills. It is better than methadone because it does not make me drowsy and it is easier to control.<br><br>
Abstaining builds reward.<!-- End Body -->
