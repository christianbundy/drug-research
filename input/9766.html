I've always been a very depressive, down and borderline-like person. At first I wanted to take all the Empracet K-30 pills I had to kill myself, but I soon realized that I didnt have enough of them. I saw on this website that you could get high on it, so I tried it.<br><br>
I put half a pill (so its about 15mg of Codeine and 150mg of acetaminophen) in a glass of cold water, crushed and mixed it up. It tasted quite bad. But after about 5 minutes I started to get funny feelings and soon I was smilling at nothing. I felt the void inside my mind, a total liberation of thoughs and from everything I hate in our world. I was listening to Radiohead' Amnesiac, and the music seemed soft and gentle, like if the songs were talking to me. My body was also very fuzzy (especially my muscles) and I couldn't stand up, so I couched on my bed, stayed there being very high for about ~45 minutes, then fell asleep.<br><br>
As I write this its morning and I just woke up. I'm feeling very great and relaxed. It's unusual for me, but I like it a lot. And I still have a lot of Empracet pills =)<!-- End Body -->
