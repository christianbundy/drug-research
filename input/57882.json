 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPrologue\r\nI originally wanted to dose 100mg.\r\nI have 2 bottles of water-dissolved chemicals, each having different potencies:\r\nIn my bottle of TFMPP, 15mls is one dose, but from my bottle of McPP, 5mls is one dose.\r\nGetting the two potencies mixed up , I accidentally dosed 15mls of mcpp. This is not my usual 100mg dose but equivalent to 300mg. Realising soon that this was the case, I felt a little worried.\r\nReport\r\n1 hour after ingestion: I felt a strong numbing of face common to this chemical. Nausea rises quickly from here due to dose and I end up over the sink, thinking I should make myself vomit as I overdosed. Do not let worry get in the way of a trip. I remembered this from my DMT days and remained calm.\r\n1-2 hours: Two fingers in the back of throat, and a  shower later, I'm feeling perfectly fine (stomach/mind-wise), albeit very happy. Ratings from the Shulgin Scale seem suiting for reporting levels of intensity, and I say a +2 describes me well here.\r\nThis ramp from the first to second hour reveals a strong come-up of my mood, like a dawning realization id just won a large sum of money.\r\n2 hours and onward: Despite being a +3 on the scale now, It contains a nature not unlike DXM, in being subtly powerful. By that I mean that I can feel anxious if I work hard at it, but very euphoric and glowing if I just let my mind meld and relax with normal, peaceful, neutral feelings.\r\nI begin to self-analyse my condition:\r\nPsychedelic effects: The psychedelic effects are best described while under the substance's influence, as opposed to after, so thats what my next report will focus on more.\r\nThis is because I concentrated more on the euphoria-like effects instead of them. Although I can say that colour enhancement is very strong and so is an overall psychedelic feel/vibe to the room/walls etc.\r\nLook at a black and white checkerboard with about 1cm squares and you'll know what I mean. It will sparkle and psychedelic lines will appear.\r\nMusic: Wow. Music is a totally absorbing experience with the effect of throwing me through many levels of introspection and journey all at once.\r\nI had recently downloaded a album called Killers Only, thinking it would be a 'best psytrance songs CD' as suggested by the name.\r\nNo such luck. I turn it on and am instantly blasted with deep, dark, evil darkpsy. And then the classic McPP laughter comes. I see my predicament, tripping on euphoriants and listening to the least happy/euphoric music possible.\r\nAnd it feels so good to just laugh at this. The laughter is deep, joyous and care-free. I find it very typical on McPP to laugh heartily at my misfortunes.\r\nSo I turn on some very ecstasy-like songs such as 'Astral Projection - Burning Up' and 'Kiker - A Night In Berlin'. The introspection is amazing. I fall through the songs and rise up high with the melodies. A perfect balance.\r\nMind-enhancement: Tonight I find the typical McPP goodies in this area. I go through what I get often on McPP, the problem solving.\r\n1. I can consider a problem, any problem, and can feel my mind work through a heap of possible solutions, most of them being stupid and instantly discarded.\r\n-- An example of a possible, yet stupid solution:\r\n-- Problem: need money---Solution: mug someone\r\n2. Then the Remaining thoughts are considered, and the best picks from this bunch move onto the next stage.\r\n3. This repeats until I have the perfect solution, or solutions.\r\nI feel very in-control. I can actually solve anything. So I sit and think, and come up with all sorts of problems to work through and work through each one quickly and with great precision.\r\nI even can solve complex math problems that I usually would have not the required time, Brainpower or concentration for. This chemical certainly has interesting/positive therapeutic and research implications. Very handy for writing papers and exams also.\r\nI now spend a lot of time just listening to trance music and solving problems. The solutions are very real and perfect, and wondering of their validity, I write a couple down to check while sober**. This is easy as, concentration and focus, I find, is increased tenfold on McPP.\r\nI then start meditating, which I am inexperienced at, just because it felt natural. The meditation had a 'revolutionary' feeling, as well as being very clean and refreshing.\r\nFrom now until I come down, a +3 rating seems suiting, breaking periodically into brief moments of +4 while meditating and melding exquisitely with the music.\r\nComing out of the meditation, grinning madly, I glance, then stare at my water bottle. It looks so pretty, pure and sophisticated. I smiling and laugh at it's clean/crisp/perfect/beautiful seeming label with its promises to 'Refresh your mind', 'Hydrate with a boost' and be the 'Perfect way to start a day'.\r\nAs previously organised, my friend comes to take me to his place, which contains 3 girls and 4 other guys. The girls are very beautiful, sexy and clean-looking.\r\nThe guys seem funnier and more laid-back. I soon become engrossed in their day-to-day stories, which seem more organised, meaningful and interesting than usual. I feel elated and tactically enhanced. Even after going into the bathroom, I just stand for a very long time feeling the running water on my hands.\r\nSo, having a laugh about this, I decide to pull myself together and go out into the old-fashioned room, which seems inviting and grounding with colours of gold and brown in the wood.\r\nI continue to have an enlightening time talking and laughing, deciding to go home after about an hour to trip out alone. I arrive home 4 and a half hours into the experience and spend the next 2 hours coming smoothly down to baseline in my friendly-feeling room.\r\n6 and a half hours: I feel +1 on the Shulgin Scale, then floating down to a +0 and almost impercebtibly a -0 soon after.\r\nBaseline: Feeling satisfied with night and that my problems  seem solved. Slight resistance to sleep due to excitement, yet fails soon enough.\r\nMorning-after: No hangover at all. McPP doesn't seem to create hangovers.\r\nPsychedelic effects still continue throughout the day in very small amounts.\r\n---\r\nNotes\r\n- Nausea is greatly reduced with about 300-400mgs of ginger. The liquid tastes like utter shit, like liquidised aluminum and seawater to be exact, but is much less intense if mixed in a drink, of course. Aftertaste quite weird/uncomfortable, although easily combated with food of drink.\r\n- After dosing, dehydration is pretty noticeable as is throughout the come-up. This\r\nhowever is not to a level of significant interference.\r\n- I absorbed all of the chemical, (300mg), despite the self-invoked throwing up later\r\n- Was ingested on almost totally empty stomach\r\n- I get all these same reported effects on lower dosages, but are not as intense .\r\n** I review my solutions written down, and they are still very wise.\r\nOverall, McPP is very worthwhile. I believe I had an absolute blast that came at no cost, despite a well-worth-it $2 price for the trip and having to throw up a few crackers.\n\n\n"
