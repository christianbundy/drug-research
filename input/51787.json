 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI went to my doctor after two exhausting weeks of insomnia, got, total, 8 hours of sleep in two weeks.  I stayed awake and alert by taking high doses of stacker pills, bad idea. I finially went to my doctor, and he gave me a script for Lunesta. First night, fine. Second night, I took one tablet, laid down, waited an hour, took another. Laid there for two more hours, then finally felt effect, not sleepy. I was wide awake. How could a hypnotic keep me wide awake?  I didnt care, I was up, and angry. Then the effects hit me. I felt my skin seperate from my bones, felt very weird.  Then I had bad hallucinations.<br>That made my night a living hell.  I was wide awake on a hypnotic, very stoned, very out of it, hallucinating. I love partying, but I hated this hell it put me in.\n\n\n"
