 "report": "\n\n\n\nBack in my college days I was offered 'Angel Dust' which was explained to me to be formaldehyde sprayed on mint leaves.  It looked and smelled to this pre-med student to be an accurate description.  A couple of tokes produced one of the more unpleasant drug experiences I ever had; something akin to being plugged into an electrical outlet.\r\nThat same year (late 70's), PCP pills were rather abundant; little purple or orange barrels, and I enjoyed them a lot - pleasant disassociatives that went nicely with a couple of beers; Like a dirty form of ketamine, though I never journeyed into anything I could call a 'P-hole'.  \r\nI had a very nice summer vacation at home that year, doing PCP at the beach or under the sun in my parents back yard.  A  year later I started reading in the newspapers how PCP was supposed to make me hack up my family with the  uncontrollable strength of ten men... oh well, maybe next time.  \r\nlegofeel\n\n\n"
