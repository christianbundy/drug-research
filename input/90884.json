 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have been on Effexor generic 100mg 2x a day for two months. The 2C family of drugs work fine. I can trip and do not need to miss a dose of my antidepressants. Methylone does not work very well, leaving me feeling physically warm and perhaps anxious, but nothing more.\r\nTonight I decided to try MDAI. Surprisingly there was no literature on combining MDAI with antidepressants. In my experience, SSRIs and SNRIs severely block the effects of MDAI.\r\nI took 100mg, waited an hour and took 100mg. It is now 5 hours later and I can confirm that I had zero effects. It's as if I had taken nothing at all. I had tried this MDAI batch before and had excellent experiences on 100-200mg.\r\nMDAI works like MDMA and so it is safe to assume that most of the effects are being blocked by the SSRIs/SNRIs. Perhaps a higher dose (300mg+) would be sufficient but may not be worth the money.\r\nAgain: Antidepressants that act as SSRIs or SNRIs will dampen my experience very much.\n\n\n"
