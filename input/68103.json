 "report": "<p>I watched a show called 'scared weeds' about blue louts and figured I would give it a go. I purchased 1gr of 25x extract. I placed the brown powder into about 3oz of hot water. I let it sit for about 10 min, then drank the foul liquid. This was on a totally empty stomach with no other substances.</p><p>And....Nothing happened. Nothing at all. Clearly anyone whoever felt anything from this was either in combo with alcohol or cannabis and were probably just over analyzing the experience. I can honestly say that this plant did nothing for me.</p>"
