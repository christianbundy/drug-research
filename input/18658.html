This report is a warning that some people may have adverse reactions when combining psylocibin and THC. I ingested 2 grams of medium potency p. cubensis mushrooms at 10 o'clock p.m. I wasn't looking for any profound visionary experience, just a trippy evening. After three hours I felt I was significantly past peak, as it was a small dose, and felt like calling it a night. The problem with that however is that I simply can't fall asleep after eating mushrooms, my brain just kicks into hyperdrive and leaves my body in the wrong universe.<br><br>
A lot of people I know have told me that smoking some cannabis will dull out their brain a little, at least enough to cop a few z's. I proceeded to smoke a gram of some high powered home grown over a half hour period. At first it seemed like I was just feeling stoned and that apparently the weed had taken over and I could go to sleep. Unfortunately for me, this was not the case. The THC effects just kept increasing and were getting way heavier than what I expected. The effects felt reminiscent of that period right before you pass out from anaethesia for those who have had surgery, extremely heavy and tiring, but I wasn't passing out. I was stuck in this state and it was fine by me (I was experiencing some nice visuals involving the moon and some wispy clouds) but when I realized it was 3 hours later I freaked.<br><br>
I had to go to work the next day and it was now 4 in the morning. I tried to lay down and go to sleep but couldn't, I was trapped in expanded time. Every time I felt like an hour had gone by it had only been one minute. At this point I didn't no what to do so I just lay there and thought maybe I would just stay awake. Then, to my suprise the next time I looked at the clock it was 7:30 in the morning and I had to leave for work. I have no idea what happened over those hours, but I didn't feel like I fell asleep and I have no memory off it.<br><br>
Anyway, I think it's needless to say that it might be wise to exercise precaution before mixing THC and psylocibin. I don't no if the two reacted or the THC just made me more susceptible to the psylocibin.<!-- End Body -->
