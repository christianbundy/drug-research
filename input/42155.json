 "report": "<p>One day I read that nutmeg was usable as a drug, and I got really interested and started to read all the experiences I could find. I didnt think it would be powerful at all, after what Ive heard from my friends. Me and two of my friends bought 48 grams of nutmeg nuts. We ate this and it didnt give any effect (4 nuts each). We bought whole nuts from the convenience store, but I think these nuts miss the magic ingredient.</p><p>My friends thought that nutmeg was total bullshit, but I didnt think so. Thursday I saw a guy who was selling fresh nutmegs. I bought 75 gram (13 nuts) for about $2,5. The different thing about these nuts was that when I tried to cut them with a knife, I could see some kind of black liquid appearing, something which hadnt happened the other times. I cut the nuts in small pieces and put them in my mouth and started to chew: 6 nuts equalling to about 35 g. Well, here is the stuff you probably want to read:</p><p>(I was having a test in German the following day. Take the test high, and get high scores (Redman) :p )</p><p>00:45 - 6 Nuts ingested</p><p>01:00 - Nothing except nutmeg burps. Went to bed.</p><p>06:30 - My dad tries to wake me up. I try to walk to the bathroom, but it feels like if my body weighs 300 pounds. When I got to the bathroom I was really nausea and I tried to puke. My heart raced like it have never done before. I was so dizzy that I felt absolutely NO GRAVITY. I told my parents that I wasnt feeling any well, and got back to my bad. (This was extremely difficult, I crawled back into the bed.)</p><p>Around 13:00 - My mom wakes me up and want to give me something to eat. I dont remember much of this, but I remember that I tried to eat while I was in bed. Suddenly I see white figures flying around in the room and my vision was flicking. Seconds later I was sleeping.</p><p>I woke up on Saturday at 06:45. I had been sleeping from Thursday night till Saturday morning. And when I woke up I was still dizzy and my vision was totally fucked. I wouldnt see straight and the image was very blurry the entire day.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This was a WAY to high dose for me. If the house would have caught fire, I would have had NO CHANCE to get out. I was glued to my bed. Nutmeg forced me to stay in bed for over 30 hours straight. I was really calm the entire trip, so I got out of if quite easy. But if I wasnt that calm the trip would have been hell. I am going to try it again, but this time with half of what I had now. This was the most powerful thing I have ever done. USE AT EXTREME CAUTION!! You dont want to end up in your bed the entire weekend. Or at the hospital!</p><p>And I dont get it when people say that nutmeg resembles marijuana effects? On that Saturday when I woke, I was still dizzy from the nutmeg and I drank 9 beers (0,33l) and smoked little less than 1g in one joint. After the joint I could barely stand and think straight, but the nutmeg was so MUCH, MUCH stronger. I think this drug is for people who have tried a lot of similar drugs, not by teenagers who want to find a legal way of getting high (as myself).</p>"
