(Having not eaten.)\r\n\t-Another back massage, and most negative effects have gone.\r\n\t(Note: Had I not previously had problems with depression I would \t have thought that I was feeling very depressed or shitty.  However, I was able to recognize it as mostly low blood sugar level, and stress.)\r\n7:26pm-  Tension only in wrists and forearms.\r\n\t-Still very small appetite.\r\n\t-Taking nap.\r\n\t-Took another two Bayer.\r\n7:50pm-  Finished nap took a wonderful feeling hot shower.  (Very refreshing.)\r\n8:10pm-  Hunger hits in full force.\r\n\t-Still a little drained, but otherwise normal.\r\nThe one thing I learned from this experience, is less caffeine.  Also, I wouldn't want to use this drug/combination recreationally.  It could very well have its uses depending on the situation though.  Last minute studying, finals, or some other equally valuable use.  I would suggest for most people to use much less caffeine than I did.  The only reason I used so much is I am a heavy coffee drinker, and have a huge tolerance.\n\n\n"
