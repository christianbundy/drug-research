 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFor the past two days I have spent the better part of my waking hours on diphenhydramine, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.  The more I read about its dangers, the more that worries me.<br>I had never used diphenhydramine before except as a sleep aid in the recommended dose.  I wasn't using any other drug at the time, except caffeinated soft drinks with meals, and my usual quota of cigarettes.<br>What follows is adapted from the notes I took at the time:<br>Tuesday<br>4:00 a.m.<br>Took 5 Maximum Strength Sominex -- at 50mg diphenhydramine to a caplet, that's 250mg in all.  I may take more in an hour.  I'm going to go out for a smoke.<br>4:33<br>I'm watching a movie on TV.  No noticeable effects yet.<br>4:55<br>Slight loss of balance (I may be imagining it):  I stood up and found myself lurching sideways.<br>5:00<br>I've taken another 250mg.<br>5:06<br>A slight, almost imperceptible sensation of warmth in my abdomen; I also feel definitely light-headed.<br>5:40<br>Light-headedness is more pronounced.  I am only slightly drowsy. The experience so far is comparable to a 1st-plateau DXM trip or a mild drunk.<br>5:46<br>My pulse is normal, but weak.  I feel slightly warm.<br>6:04<br>The drowsiness is delicious.  Only, I keep *almost* falling asleep, then snapping out of it with a start.<br>I just heard three computer-like beeps, one long and two short.  I think it is an hallucination; there isn't anything in this room that normally beeps.<br>I know I should not by lying down, but I am anyway.  I'm trying not to fall asleep, though.<br>My legs feel as though they were about to cramp up.<br>6:53<br>It's getting harder and harder to stay awake.<br>My stomach is uncomfortable.  Not painful, and not exactly nauseous, but *uncomfortable*.  The rest of my body feels the same way, though not as bad; still, I can't find a comfortable postion to lie in.<br>5:18 p.m.<br>And sure enough, I let myself sleep -- a long, dead, heavy sleep, but surprisingly refreshing.<br>10:15<br>I'm trying this again:  5 left-over Sominex and 8 store-brand softgels of the same potency, 750mg in all.<br>11:16<br>No noticeable effects yet.<br>Wednesday<br>12:15 a.m.<br>Still no noticeable effects.  Perhaps I should have taken it on an empty stomach.<br>12:38<br>I'm feeling *something* now -- a kind of wooziness.  I'm going to take one more softgel.<br>1:41<br>I've taken yet another softgel, bringing the total to 750mg. Effects are obvious now, but disappointingly mild.<br>1:51<br>This has been happening for a while:  any sudden noise makes me tense up.  *Any* sudden noise, from the elevator bell to people laughing on TV.<br>1:57<br>I keep hearing little tapping and clicking noises.  I do not know if they are real or not, but they still make me shudder involuntarily.<br>2:43<br>My hands are *light*.  It's rather the same sensation you get when you pick up a cup you think is full, only to jerk it two feet in the air because it was empty, after all.<br>4:43<br>About an hour ago I was sitting, smoking, out in front of the dorm and suddenly I smelled pot.  It was only for a moment, though, and there was nobody around and no apparent source for the smell.<br>I decided to walk to the computer lab.  As I was walking, I saw several people standing in the distance.  (It occured to me that they might be the pot smokers.)  As I came closer, they disappeared, leaving only one.  He was standing behind some shrubbery, so I could only see his head and shoulders.<br>As I came closer still, the man's head disappeared and in its place there was a white folding chair standing on top of an outdoor table.<br>I'm back in my room now.  The effects have largely worn off, though cottonmouth, and a kind of tired feeling in my muscles, persist.<br>5:01<br>One thing I forgot to mention, but probably should:  this stuff has been playing havoc with my memory.  I'd be in the middle of a train of thought, and suddenly my mind would go blank -- leaving me wondering what I had been thinking about only a few seconds before.<br>4:18 p.m.<br>I fell asleep shortly after that last entry, and woke up about half an hour ago. I have 300mg left, which I've decided to go ahead and take.<br>5:36<br>It kicked in while I was eating supper about 15 minutes ago.<br>For 'only' 300mg, this is surprisingly strong -- it almost feels stronger than the 750mg last night.  My head and limbs feel light, as they did before, and I have the sensation of something thick and heavy wrapped around the top of my head.<br>My memory is going again, too.<br>8:23<br>Effects held steady, neither increasing nor decreasing, until shortly before 8.  Then they tapered off very quickly, and now I feel no more than the slightest intoxication.<br>Of course, I frittered the experience away watching TV.  When will I learn?\n\n\n"
