 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFor the past two days I have spent the better part of my waking hours on diphenhydramine, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.  The more I read about its dangers, the more that worries me.\r\nI had never used diphenhydramine before except as a sleep aid in the recommended dose.  I wasn't using any other drug at the time, except caffeinated soft drinks with meals, and my usual quota of cigarettes.\r\nWhat follows is adapted from the notes I took at the time:\r\nTuesday\r\n4:00 a.m.\r\nTook 5 Maximum Strength Sominex -- at 50mg diphenhydramine to a caplet, that's 250mg in all.  I may take more in an hour.  I'm going to go out for a smoke.\r\n4:33\r\nI'm watching a movie on TV.  No noticeable effects yet.\r\n4:55\r\nSlight loss of balance (I may be imagining it):  I stood up and found myself lurching sideways.\r\n5:00\r\nI've taken another 250mg.\r\n5:06\r\nA slight, almost imperceptible sensation of warmth in my abdomen; I also feel definitely light-headed.\r\n5:40\r\nLight-headedness is more pronounced.  I am only slightly drowsy. The experience so far is comparable to a 1st-plateau DXM trip or a mild drunk.\r\n5:46\r\nMy pulse is normal, but weak.  I feel slightly warm.\r\n6:04\r\nThe drowsiness is delicious.  Only, I keep *almost* falling asleep, then snapping out of it with a start.\r\nI just heard three computer-like beeps, one long and two short.  I think it is an hallucination; there isn't anything in this room that normally beeps.\r\nI know I should not by lying down, but I am anyway.  I'm trying not to fall asleep, though.\r\nMy legs feel as though they were about to cramp up.\r\n6:53\r\nIt's getting harder and harder to stay awake.\r\nMy stomach is uncomfortable.  Not painful, and not exactly nauseous, but *uncomfortable*.  The rest of my body feels the same way, though not as bad; still, I can't find a comfortable postion to lie in.\r\n5:18 p.m.\r\nAnd sure enough, I let myself sleep -- a long, dead, heavy sleep, but surprisingly refreshing.\r\n10:15\r\nI'm trying this again:  5 left-over Sominex and 8 store-brand softgels of the same potency, 750mg in all.\r\n11:16\r\nNo noticeable effects yet.\r\nWednesday\r\n12:15 a.m.\r\nStill no noticeable effects.  Perhaps I should have taken it on an empty stomach.\r\n12:38\r\nI'm feeling *something* now -- a kind of wooziness.  I'm going to take one more softgel.\r\n1:41\r\nI've taken yet another softgel, bringing the total to 750mg. Effects are obvious now, but disappointingly mild.\r\n1:51\r\nThis has been happening for a while:  any sudden noise makes me tense up.  *Any* sudden noise, from the elevator bell to people laughing on TV.\r\n1:57\r\nI keep hearing little tapping and clicking noises.  I do not know if they are real or not, but they still make me shudder involuntarily.\r\n2:43\r\nMy hands are *light*.  It's rather the same sensation you get when you pick up a cup you think is full, only to jerk it two feet in the air because it was empty, after all.\r\n4:43\r\nAbout an hour ago I was sitting, smoking, out in front of the dorm and suddenly I smelled pot.  It was only for a moment, though, and there was nobody around and no apparent source for the smell.\r\nI decided to walk to the computer lab.  As I was walking, I saw several people standing in the distance.  (It occured to me that they might be the pot smokers.)  As I came closer, they disappeared, leaving only one.  He was standing behind some shrubbery, so I could only see his head and shoulders.\r\nAs I came closer still, the man's head disappeared and in its place there was a white folding chair standing on top of an outdoor table.\r\nI'm back in my room now.  The effects have largely worn off, though cottonmouth, and a kind of tired feeling in my muscles, persist.\r\n5:01\r\nOne thing I forgot to mention, but probably should:  this stuff has been playing havoc with my memory.  I'd be in the middle of a train of thought, and suddenly my mind would go blank -- leaving me wondering what I had been thinking about only a few seconds before.\r\n4:18 p.m.\r\nI fell asleep shortly after that last entry, and woke up about half an hour ago. I have 300mg left, which I've decided to go ahead and take.\r\n5:36\r\nIt kicked in while I was eating supper about 15 minutes ago.\r\nFor 'only' 300mg, this is surprisingly strong -- it almost feels stronger than the 750mg last night.  My head and limbs feel light, as they did before, and I have the sensation of something thick and heavy wrapped around the top of my head.\r\nMy memory is going again, too.\r\n8:23\r\nEffects held steady, neither increasing nor decreasing, until shortly before 8.  Then they tapered off very quickly, and now I feel no more than the slightest intoxication.\r\nOf course, I frittered the experience away watching TV.  When will I learn?\n\n\n"
