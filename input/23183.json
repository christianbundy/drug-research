 "report": "<p>This is more like a case study than a single experience. I was first introduced to Ultram when I was a senior in high school as a pain med for my back. I soon discovered that taking 3 or 4 50mg pills gave me a vicodin-like high that lasted about 2 times as long. </p><p>3 years later I am a junior in college, and have come across unlimited access to Ultram. About 4 months ago (Jan) I resumed taking 4 50 mg pills per session, which would be about once a week for fun with friends. slowly but surely, I started to up the dose as well as the frequency of use. For a while id take 300mgs, then 350mgs, and now I take 400mgs. Most every time ill take about 100mg to 200mg more after initial ingestion to prolong and/or intensify the high. </p><p>Also, I am not taking them for fun on the weekends like I had initially been doing, but often find myself getting high as a coping mechanism to deal with school and depression (Im going through a very tough time in my life.) I shifted to using from positive reinforcement to negative reinforcement, which I personally think is not a good reason to use drugs. </p><p>In the last 7 days Ive gotten high during 5. I do plan to drastically cut back, cause tolerance is a bitch. I have a great deal of self control, but yet have problems with Ultram. Ultram has been a lot of fun and a big help in certain situations.</p>"
