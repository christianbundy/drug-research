Prior to this experiment with opium poppy tea, my only experience with opiates was with an over-the-counter pain-reliever containing codeine (trade name Panadol, legal in Australia)<br><br>
After being clued in to the possibility of making opium poppy tea, I gathered eight average-size dried opium poppy pods from the garden of a community I was staying with in Western Australia (species/variety unknown).  The gardener's suggested dosage was about 12 pods, while accounts on Erowid suggested 5  thus 8 seemed a fine middle line.  While sitting one evening reading I removed the seeds and broke the pods up in my fingers as finely as I could manage, then added this crushed material to a large mug of just-boiled water.  I allowed this brew to steep for about 20 minutes, keeping a lid on the mug to retain heat and stirring every five minutes or so, watching the vortex with interest.  I then added organic Rooibos Tea (a caffeine-free antioxidant-rich earthy South African tea) and a generous gob of honey. <br><br>
I drank the brew fairly quickly.  The earthy Rooibos Tea was an excellent choice, dominating the flavor and leaving the brew only slightly bitter.  I did not experience the slightest hint of nausea.  Shortly after draining my cup I stood and immediately noticed that indistinct perceptually-wobbling fuzziness of substance onset.  I dropped the lights strapped the headphones (a mellow mixtape on tap) and laid down relaxing.  <br><br>
The sensory grace of opium manifested itself in smooth ascension, and as my body became increasingly warm and fuzzy relaxed, the mechanics of thought quieted accordingly.  I attempted to maintain a floating awareness on the entirety of the experience.  The perceived boundaries of my physical form smoothly dissolved until I had no real sensory reference for the presence of individual limbs etc.  I still had an awareness of the existence of my form, but only as an undefined plane of warm energetic presence.  I had effectively melted.  (This is the exact same experience of dissolvance I have had during extended meditation sessions, suggesting, as I'd guessed, that this meditative-dissolvance is associated with the release of endogenous opiates (endorphins))<br><br>
I occasionally experienced a synesthetic synch with the music; my entire form would feel as if it were bending spiraling and moving in accord with a particular melodic progression while also pulsing with rhythmic elements as well.  This pulsing was observed to be a very fine and uniform vibration that pervaded the entirety of my perceived form, fading at the parameters into indistinctness.  I also experienced a sensation where my entire form was rippling like a mountain stream or a banner in the wind; this distinct sensation did not seem to be directly related to the music.<br><br>
Satisfied with my observation of the experience, I decided to try a few experiments.  First, focusing attention on my body (or lack thereof) and almost entirely ignoring the music, I entered the buddhist meditative practice of metta-bhavana, loving-kindness.  This practice involves locating 'pleasant' sensations/emotions within one's self and then sharing them with others via visualization, extending loving-kindness as far and widely as possible.  The nucleus of this practice is always the heart-region, and I was now able to observe the sensations associated with loving-kindness much more clearly than in 'normal' contexts  an energetic transfer of fine and uniform vibrations felt as sensations of warm radiations extending from the heart-center  <br><br>
Despite the clarity and amazingnesss of this experience, I did not practice for very long.  Perhaps the music distracted me.  I then decided to attempt another experiment.  I shifted my attention to my thoughts and chose a suitable egoic fantasy thought-tangent, in this case one in which I imagined myself receiving admiration from a gathering of people.  I almost immediately observed that the warm heart-center halo that had been manifested during metta-bhavana cooled to cinder.  Perceptual awareness of the boundaries of my body immediately began to regain distinction.   Quickly satisfied with the experiment, I dismissed the fantasy, returned to a more floating awareness, and soon observed the departure of the opium in smooth descent.  By the end of one side of the tape 45min. my 'normal' bodily perception had basically returned, although I still felt nicely relaxed and now pleasantly sleepy.<br><br>
I slept normally.  After breakfast the next morning, my stomach felt very tight and cramped, a distinct and sharp pain that remained for about 30min.  Afterwards I felt fine<br><br>
Although this experience was insightful, it was rather short-lived and contained none of the immersed lucid dreaming typically associated with accounts of opium, which I must admit I had anticipated.  Assumedly the effects of opium tea and smoked opium are qualitatively different. Anyways always learning, an'on<br><br>
