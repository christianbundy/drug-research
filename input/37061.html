I hate doctors. I hate hospitals even more. This is very ironic because I happen to be very accident prone. Anyways, a day before I was to have foot surgery (don't ask) my doctor made the mistake perscribing me some Vicoprofen and some promethazine to help its effects.<br><br>
Well needless to say that being the spacecadet I am I filled it that day. That night I took 3 of the 7.5/200mg pills with a promethazine pill to take the edge off. Being out of action and not having to work for three weeks was very appealing with a script of this stuff. After taking the the pills I laid out on the couch and watched regular Monday night NBC progams for two hours. I really couldn't tell anything was happening till I tried unsucessfully to get up for some pizza I had ordered. WHOA! my brain said, but my legs didn't get the signal. I had never been drosy or dizzy before with any Pharms. After several seconds for the seemily 7 differnt parts of my body to begin to comunicat to each other I got up. Talk about a headrush, but in that nice 'Cool' way. Walking was a little uneasy but I made it to the door. I had a little trouble grabing the knob but finally jerked it open,....into my self. The pizza guy brought the food in after that and looking rather really stoned I told him to keep the 8 dollar tip.<br><br>
So with pizza in hand and and a head full of feel good off went the lights and on came Kimball collins on surround sound. I didn't feel like dancing but was totally in my zone. I lay on the couch upside down with my feet propped up on pillows and my head hanging off the side. The news to a nice trance album was very intresting. After that I tried to read and found my imagination take off. 'Red Storm Rising' was a film in my head. Very very relaxed and at peace. My wife found me the next morning when she came still upside down on the couch sleeping like a baby.<br><br>
In retrospective, This was the best chill out drug combo I have ever had.<!-- End Body -->
