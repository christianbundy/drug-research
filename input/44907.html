After originally thinking I had wasted my time and money (not to mention ingesting the most awful shit I have ever smelt or tasted) the effects have hit me.  I must say that if I could turn back time, I would without a doubt kick myself in the ass and pour this shit down the sink.  What I thought would be a 'fun' trip for all the hell I had to swallow.  <br><br>
I cant stress to you enough how awful the taste of this shit was.  <br><br>
Anyway, about the only real effect I am noticing is 'breathing' walls.  Everything is swaying in and out.  Other than this there is no hallucinating and after nearly 5 hours since ingesting that shit I can still taste it like I had just done it.  I can now honestly say after trying this that I have absolutely no desire to do it ever again.  The good things simply do not outweigh the bad things namely that horrible taste.  I cant seem to get over the horrible nausea.  I suppose it could be that I just screwed up on the extraction.  <br><br>
I read an experience that described the taste as 'The most bitter cucumber on God's green earth.'  If that were all it tasted like I would take that and be glad.  It was horrible.<!-- End Body -->
