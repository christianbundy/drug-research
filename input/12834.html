Probably ate too much beforehand.. chinese buffet was too appealing. Friend who also dosed (P) ate much less than me at the boo-fay. So we gave it at least 3 hours to digest. Rounded up movies (a few poor choices!) and relaxed on the couch. 185mg MBDB was premeasured into caps, down the hatch! <br><br>
P felt it long before I did, I attribute this to my gluttony at the buffet. I looked over and P is smiling his/her ass off. I'm only getting first alerts really and this is an hour and a half into it. Next time I will fast a bit. <br><br>
Waves of relaxation begin to sweep over me. Calm, soothing, sedate. Extremely pleasant. Would not compare to an MDMA buzz, really. No excitation. No Spark. Just soothing.. I think of it more like an exceedingly clean and nice alcohol buzz. Relaxing on the couch seems like all in the world I need to do at the time. <br><br>
Watching the movie 'Traffic'.. I hadn't seen it before, and wish I hadn't now. Or that I'd picked a better time to watch it. I'm in a very good mood and it's trying to pull me down. Won't succeed but I do have some moments of 'why do I do this?' thought patterns, which didn't help the experience. Had we picked lighter, happier movies, I might have opted for a 55mg booster. But this movie took my zest for ingestion away. Horrid flick, although I would have most likely enjoyed it almost any other time. Luckily the mbdb was still ramping up by the time the movie was over. Next: 'The fast and the furious.' This one was much better. Relaxation is overwhelming and wonderful. P looks over at me, smiling, and almost falls out of the chair. We get a kick out of that. <br><br>
I get up to use the restroom and my walking is exceedingly slow. Sort of like I'm on benzos and alcohol. There is definitely an intoxication here (notice I didn't say 'TRIP'). It's a very pleasant one, I might add. This material is most assuredly a downer. <br><br>
The relaxation lasts all the way until the end of the next movie, which for the life of me I cannot remember the name of, and then I drift happily off to sleep. Wake with no hangover and a pleasant feeling that lasts throughout the day. <br><br>
My opinion: nice material, but ~200mg seems extreme for me. Next experiment will be with 50mg insufflated, with 10mg boosters until desired effect is reached. Otherwise, I will have to discontinue experimentation, as the cost/benefit analysis dictates.<!-- End Body -->
