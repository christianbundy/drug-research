 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have a high stress, high pressure job that requires me to work long hours. I started taking 120 mg of Gingko in the morning about two weeks ago. \r\nI would have to agree with others who say their mood has been uplifted after taking it. Work no longer feels draining, and 10 hours fly by before I notice it. There's also a subtle feeling of being 'on my game,' i.e. increased sharpness/ adaptability. In general I feel like I can take on a lot more.\r\nI'm also finding that I can recall memories from my childhood with disturbing accuracies, down to small details, though I'm not sure if this can be attributed to the gingko. This continues on in my sleep, where I've been having vivid dreams about my childhood house, childhood friends etc. which is definitely not normal for me. I hardly dream at all, and usually can't remember my dreams.\n\n\n"
