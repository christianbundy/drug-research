   When vacationing with my family in West Virginia.  I waited till everyone was asleep and ventured from the cabin down the mountain to the lake.  I set myself on the steep beach of rocks and clay. And lit up.  About halfway through the makeshift joint, I became aware of nature's music.  Crickets and cicadas singing.  It was so beautiful.  Why did they sing? To attract mates and propigate their species.  Mother nature at her finest.  <br><br>
It was time for me to embark on a quest.  Looking up at the full moon and stars, I realized for these few hours I would be one with nature, looking<br>
through the eyes of our ancestors viewing the calm, peaceful lake knowing in 8 or 9 hours I would strap on planks to my feet and ride above the waterline, courtesy of the combustion engine of my family's motorboat.  I went on a quest.  I walked down the steep beach of the lake towards the moonlight.  I saw things and heard things I cannot explain.  <br><br>
I was no longer a part of the physical world. I moved on to the spiritual plane, where time and consequence held no meaning.  I was visted by euphoria. It was then I decided to cultivate the seed.  Two years later<br>
I started a closet garden.<!-- End Body -->
