 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've been taking 2x300mg adrafinil on mornings where it's hard to get out of bed.  With two young children in our home, and somewhat frequent nighttime calls, this turns out to be once or twice per week.\r\nI find that on the days where I've taken adrafinil, whatever I sit down to work on becomes effortless, time passes quickly, and I tend to be in a good mood, even when working on problems that would usually annoy or frustrate.\r\nOne other notable effect is a hypomania that is exhibited in conversation with others where my speech is faster and I tend to have lots of interesting stories to tell (have to watch out for monologuing).  Some are amused by it (coworkers), some are annoyed (wife).\n\n\n"
