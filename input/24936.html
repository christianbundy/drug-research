Being an enthusiastic grass smoker and a lover of nature, I had decided to explore the realms of ethnobotany. From various sources I discovered that some effective plants were catnip, skullcap, wild dagga and california poppy - so I decided to plant some seeds. Months later my Californians were in bloom and I decided that this was the point for my hardwork to pay off.....<br><br>
Selecting some prime petals and leaves I dried them out. Once this process was complete I rolled a large joint of pure poppy and took a walk wondering what to expect. <br><br>
At around 2pm I smoked the joint. The white smoke had an unusual and unpleasant taste but I dealt with it and after finishing it I lay down in the grass and watched the sky...<br><br>
2:15 - I felt nothing. It had so far had less effect than a ciggarette and I was deeply disappointed. However soon it started to kick in. <br><br>
By 2.20 I noticed slight tracers in my periphery vision and the trees seemed to merge into a mixture of green and brown. (May I stress at this point these were not really fantastic and did not impress me). Still, it was something...<br><br>
At 2:30 I knew I had to return to college but was strangely drowsy; to the point that I could not, and more importantly, did not want to get up at all. I felt incredibly sedated - similar to the effects of marajuana but without the fun. Eventually I overcame this and left.<br><br>
The california poppy experience was not at all what I expected. I had hoped for a weed like high but it acted more like a sedative. It is possible that if I were to smoke heaps of the stuff I would get a more noticeable effect. In conclusion I would not reccomend Californian Poppy for anything but a sleeping aid.<!-- End Body -->
