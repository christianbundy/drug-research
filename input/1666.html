 I tried the intriquing substance for my third time last night.  M7y first two experiences with smoking the divine mint among friends came up short.  I experienced only mild anxiety.<br><br>
    I was at a loss for a calming CD to put in so I turned on the local Classical station.  I packed a full bowl in my makeshift water bong (Chili's salsa bottle)...  I tried to relax and free my mind but I was very anxious.  My parents were just leaving for the night, so I went downstairs and poured a glass of lemonade and retired to my room.<br><br>
     A good song on the radio now, I set up my pillows, and cracked my window.  (Spring, nice breaze)  All was dark except the lights from my system.  I got onto my bed with my bong and started to toke.  After about 3 rips, I began to feel pressure all over my body.  I finished the bowl and closed my eyes.<br><br>
***mistake 1- no sitter<br>
***mistake 2- to anxious<br><br>
I started to almost dream, and i experienced a type of imagery, not like a vision...  But an Idea that I would imagine seeing.  I was in  a large pipe, Like a sewer pipe only bigger and running verticaly instead of horizontally.  I was on a platform, jutting out of the side.  This is what I thought to be my jumping off point.  I saw two entities flying in a circle above me and I could hear them speaking.<br><br>
  They discussed their need to get me to 'the higher level'  I had an understanding that the higher I went in the tube, the better things were... but if i fell... I would be in trouble.<br><br>
    I could hear them yelling to each other that I was too heavy and that they were gonna have to drop me!  Their voices seemed panicked, so likewise, I began to worry.  I DID NOT WANT TO FALL DOWN THE PIPE.  Sure enough, they dropped me.<br><br>
     In my mind I linked this vision to the amount of trip i was having.  I figured that those two people wanted to give me full fledged vision, but I was not high enough (or too heavy).  <br><br>
     In a panicked state I ran across my room and fell into my desk, a very painfull thing.  I opened many droors before i was able to remember where my salvia was.  I knew i needed another bowl to help them bring me to the top.  I was overwelmingly aware that I was in the bottom of this pipe and if I didnt get out soon, something terrible was gonna happen.  I started to pack the bowl, but then got extremely scared of going farther into the Ska Maria's touch.  I wanted it to end, there and then.<br><br>
     Unfourtunatley for me, that wasnt possible.  All at once, everything on me began to irritate my skin.  I ripped off my clothes down to boxers and took off my rings and hemp necklass.  I needed someone, anyone to calm me down.  I began to hear more voices, from the park behind my house (giggling and yelling)  So without thinking I ran out there.  Still in my boxers, i found nothing but darkness.  I was terrified, so I ran through the woods to my best friends house ( about a mile away)  I knew his parents were gone so i ran in and found him in his room.  There he put a fan on me ( i was sweating rivers)  and in about 10 minutes I calmed down.<br><br>
     Salvia was the most terrifying experience I have ever been a part of.  At the same time, It is somehting I look forward to conquering over time.  It is hard for me to explain what happened or the fear I was feeling.  The outside sky was shifting colors, and i was still mentally awake, for the most part.  When people ask me about it, all I can say is...  I went absolutely insane.<!-- End Body -->
