This was far from my first time using cocaine... I'd had it perhaps 2 dozen times since 1990... but this time I decided to try and document the effects as they occured.<br><br>
Nov. 23, 1997<br>
-------------<br><br>
11:27pm:<br>
        I just cut out two medium-to-small sized lines of cocaine. I've<br>
already had about 6 or 7 lines over the past 3 hours or so, the last<br>
being a little over an hour ago. I smoked a bowl of pot about 45 minutes<br>
ago, but its effects are pretty much unnoticeable, except maybe a slight<br>
reduction in the edginess of the cocaine effects. I'm definately still<br>
feeling the effects, although I'm in the come-down stage at present. The<br>
next 2 lines should give me a pretty typical high-dose cocaine experience.<br>
At present, I feel contradictorally wired and tired. I feel as if I could<br>
fall asleep if I wanted, although from experience I know I couldn't yet. I<br>
feel a warm fuzzy feeling all over my body, similar to the feeling of the<br>
second wind you get when you stay up all night, but there is also a mild<br>
feeling of stimulant tension. Euphoria has definately long since passed.<br>
Cocaine makes me dehydrated, and this manifests itself primarily in the<br>
feeling of dry mouth. I will frequently suck on my cheeks, trying to<br>
salivate, I guess. It's not really a conscious thing. Its a bad thing,<br>
actually, as it makes the dry mouth worse, and sometimes will leave my<br>
mouth feeling uncomfortable the next day. I'm going to finish my<br>
cigarette, then do these lines.<br><br>
11:33pm:<br>
        I snort the lines, and immediately feel both euphoria, and a<br>
passing urge to get the rest of my coke out and do more. I get the urge to<br>
smoke a cigarette, so I do. The high intensifies for a minute or two then<br>
levels. I'm mildly euphoric, but very stimulated. Its a distinct<br>
stimulation, more like amphetamines than caffeine. But definately<br>
different. There is a mild anesthetic property, mainly concentrated in my<br>
mouth and nose, and a generalized tingly, warm sensation. I notice myself<br>
typing alot harder, but pausing more between sentences. The urge to smoke<br>
my cigarette is overwhelming. There is a warm feeling along my spine.<br>
Mentally, I feel both calm and stimulated, somewhat paradoxically. If<br>
there were people here, I'd be talkative.<br><br>
11:38pm:<br>
        I am feeling a barely perceptible decrease in the high, and decide<br>
to stop typing for a little bit to enjoy it, probably with another<br>
cigarette. The urge to do more coke occasionally pops into my mind but<br>
then leaves just as quickly.<br><br>
11:53pm:<br>
        I went and smoked a cigarette, and alternated (quite frequently)<br>
between walking around my room smoking it, sitting on the edge of my bed,<br>
and putting down the cigarette to lay down and close my eyes. Laying down,<br>
I felt very calm, and as if my body were floating. The peak wore off<br>
gradually, and not evenly. I would alternate between feeling come-down<br>
effects and peak effects, with the come-down periods becoming longer and<br>
more frequent.<br><br>
        The euphoria is mostly gone now, and the thoughts of doing more<br>
coke are a little more frequent and longer, but are nowhere near<br>
irresistable. Simply being aware of the craving seems to make it go away.<br>
I took a multivitamin just now, which I always do before bed anytime I do<br>
any drugs outside of my usual ones (pot, tobacco, and caffeine). It<br>
generally reduces day-after fatigue. The stimulation is still quite<br>
strong, and more amphetamine-like, although it is beginning to fade into<br>
the post-peak mellowness of cocaine. I am almost back to the point I was<br>
when I began writing this.<br><br>
        Physically, the dry-mouth has become more noticable again. My<br>
lungs feel sort of grimy from smoking too many cigarettes (cocaine tends<br>
to make me chain smoke), and my nasal passages feel somewhat clogged and<br>
sore from doing coke all night. I snorted a few drops of warm water to<br>
help clear out my nose, which helped significantly. I can still<br>
occasionally taste cocaine in the back of my throat if I snort or breath<br>
deeply through my nose.<br><br>
12:05am:<br>
        I'm basically back to where I was at the beginning now. I feel<br>
calm and quiet. I don't really feel bad, although there have been times<br>
when I've felt quite depressed and physically worn when I've done alot of<br>
cocaine in a short time. I feel physically worn out, and mentally a little<br>
tired, but its definately not a bad thing - basically like being<br>
overtired, despite the fact that I know I could not fall asleep right now.<br>
I've probably done about 1/2 gram over the course of about 4 hours, which<br>
although is alot, is nowhere near the most I've done; that would probably<br>
be about 1.5 grams over 2 or 3 hours. Aside from the two lines I did while<br>
writing this, I used the cocaine in a social setting tonight, with a girl<br>
and a guy I'm friends with. Its when doing it alone that I'll sit there<br>
and do line after line until it's gone or I just can't take anymore.<br><br>
        I plan on smoking a small bowl of pot to relax, and write a little<br>
more. I'm going to take a 3mg melatonin tablet and probably a shot of<br>
tequila before I go to bed, to counteract the stimulant effect that would<br>
keep me from sleeping. I'll still probably be unable to sleep for about an<br>
hour, perhaps more, but it will definately help, though it will probably<br>
make me groggier tomorrow.<br><br>
        Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but not outstandingly so.<br>
Cocaine simply isn't my drug of choice. I'm glad I did it, but it'll<br>
probably be a while before I do it again.<br><br>
12:16am:<br>
        I take my melatonin, and take a hit off my bowl. This experiment<br>
is at an end.<!-- End Body -->
