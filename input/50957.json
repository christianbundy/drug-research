 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have had some experience with smoked drugs. Usually I smoke with one of my good friends. One of them told me he had discovered that I can get high or at least some effects from smoking Salvia Splendens which he had in front of his house. He had picked them some time ago so they were dry. We spent the night in a camper on his yard and had plans to smoke the salvia. \r\nAt about 10:00 we packed a huge bowl in a glass bong. We used a torch to light it with. We ended up smoking 3 bowls between the two of us. After putting the bong and such away we both sat on a bed and realized we were feeling the effects rather hard. I sat there and the whole room seemed to just look very different. Everything seemed to be so relaxing. \r\nAfter I dont know how long we got up from our bed and went to a friends house. There I felt effects similar to marijuana but not completely similar. Overall this was a very good experience and the price was right (zero dollars).\n\n\n"
