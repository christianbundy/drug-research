12:50AM<br>
-------<br>
        OK, so its actually the 18th now. So what. I haven't gone to sleep<br>
yet, so its the 17th as far as I'm concerned. Anyway...<br>
        I have 2.5 tablets of Propacet, each containing 50mg of <br>
dextropropoxyphene. They're the last of a batch of 8 of them that I was<br>
given. I ingest all of them. I had smoked a little cannabis earlier, still<br>
feel a lingering effect, but am close to baseline.<br><br>
1:09AM<br>
------<br>
        I begin to feel a hint of opiate feel kicking in. I also seem to<br>
be feeling random itches all over my body, but they are easy to ignore.<br>
This is a typical opiate alert for me. I feel slightly warm, a little<br>
'floaty,' and real calm. Not much else yet. Narcotics seem to take a long<br>
time to take effect orally.<br><br>
1:21AM<br>
------<br>
        The itching passed several minutes ago. But other than that, there<br>
has been no change. I almost even feel closer to baseline than at my last<br>
check-in. I'm yawning a little now though.<br><br>
1:45AM<br>
------<br>
        Well, I definitely feel 'something' - basically the same as I have<br>
been feeling, but its moved up a level of intensity. Its tempting at this<br>
point to smoke some cannabis to bring on the effects. I'm holding off<br>
though, so I can get a good description of an unclouded dextropropoxyphene<br>
experience. But damn... this slow come on time is a negative in my<br>
opinion. I would hate to have to wait this long if I were using it for<br>
pain relief!<br><br>
2:10AM<br>
------<br>
        T+1:20 and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. This is taking an<br>
unusually long time. I haven't eatin in 11 hours or so, so my stomach<br>
wasn't full. I feel slightly more than I did at last check-in. Same<br>
effects again, just a little stronger. A kind of warm tingly sensation<br>
diffused throughout my upper body and somewhat in my legs. A feeling of<br>
calmness. Somewhat quieted thought processes. But I'm not yet feeling the<br>
euphoria or the 'buzz' yet.<br><br>
2:15AM<br>
------<br>
        As I typed that last paragraph, things did jump up a level. The<br>
body tingles increased alot, and spread all over my body. There is some<br>
tinnitus in my ears now. Every now and then I get random itches, which has<br>
been going on since I felt the first hint of effects. I'm developing a<br>
decent 'buzz' and some euphoric sensations now as well. <br><br>
2:30AM<br>
------<br>
        Things still seem to be building, but I'm at a pretty decent level<br>
now. I feel typical opiate effects, though sort of mild. As I said,<br>
narcotics are very different from other CNS depressants. Its hard to<br>
compare this high to something like GHB or alcohol.<br>
        I feel a little warm, its a pleasant warmth. My body feels a sort<br>
of tingly, floaty sensation. I feel much lighter than usual. I don't feel<br>
like moving around at all. I tried to lay down, though, and that wasn't<br>
noticably more comfortable than sitting in my computer chair or standing.<br>
It doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in, I'm equally comfortable.<br>
Its a comfortableness that seems to come primarily from not caring about<br>
things that might normally make me uncomfortable. My thought processes are<br>
slow... I'm a verbal thinker, and the voice in my mind is much quieter<br>
than normal. Its not that thought is impaired, I *can* think if I want<br>
to... it just seems nicer to not think though. Opiates are a very<br>
detatched high. You just want to float around feeling calm, not doing or<br>
thinking. Its not that you feel unusually happy - you just feel mentally<br>
relaxed and physically good. Personally I find it sort of boring, but I<br>
can see how this state would appeal to alot of people, especially those<br>
with escapist tendencies. Music is slightly enhanced. Orbital's 'Halcyon<br>
On &amp; On' sounds prettier than usual, and goes well with the floaty<br>
sensations. Other minor effects... I have dry mouth, but its different<br>
than cannabis 'cottonmouth.' I was pretty hungry before I took the pills.<br>
The hunger vanished within a half hour or 45 minutes or so and hasn't<br>
returned. The itching is still somewhat there, but its so easy to ignore<br>
as to be a non-issue. Its concentrated on my scalp, face and arms now,<br>
though, whereas earlier it was all over. My juice tastes bland.<br><br>
2:50AM<br>
------<br>
        Its been 2 hours... peak plasma concentrations of<br>
dextropropoxyphene are supposedly reached at 2-2.5 hours, and I do feel as<br>
though I've gotten as far as I'm going to. There doesn't seem to be<br>
anymore sensation of increase in the effects. I'm kind of bored of the<br>
high already. Narcotics just don't do all that much for me on their own.<br>
I've been wanting to smoke some cannabis, but haven't yet because I wanted<br>
to write an accurate report of an unclouded narcotic high. I think I've<br>
accomplished that.<br><br>
3:00AM<br>
------<br>
        I smoke some cannabis. One hit from my glass pipe and I'm already<br>
feeling much nicer. Yes, I think this is what was needed.<br><br>
3:15AM<br>
------<br>
        The cannabis made a huge difference. I can feel the effects of<br>
both blended into a fuller high than the dextropropoxyphene alone. The<br>
cannabis also made me think more vocally again, and the combination makes<br>
mellow music AMAZING! It is making me a little sleepy though. Neither drug<br>
seems to dominate the high, its an even synergy, at least at these<br>
dosages.<br><br>
3:45AM<br>
------<br>
        I feel much the same as before, but the narcotic aspect of the<br>
high is starting to taper off ever so slightly. I'm pretty tired and plan<br>
to go to bed soon. This was interesting to actually document a narcotic<br>
experience, but I've never really been a big fan of this class of drug.<br>
I'd definitely do it again if I was given some more, although I'd combine<br>
it right off with cannabis. Ah well...<!-- End Body -->
