 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have read many reports on Lactuca and failed attempts to achieve the effects wanted. I have found by doing a simple isopropyl extract and then applying the product to a cigarette you can get better results.\r\nExtraction\r\n1. First place material in a suitable container and add isopropyl alcohol. \r\n2.Let sit for at least 1 day. Shake whenever you happen to pass by.\r\n3. After letting soak for a day strain and place liquid in a pyrex baking tray or beaker.\r\n4. Heat on low heat until you are left with a tar or thick liquid.\r\nUseage\r\n1. Take some on the end of a butter knife or other tool and spread on a cig.\r\n2. Leave about 1/4 of an inch clean from the tip of the cig.\r\n3. Light and Enjoy.\n\n\n"
