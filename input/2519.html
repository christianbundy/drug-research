Oh my god, I've never felt so sick in my life.  I was sitting at my computer and I looked at my chocolate chip and saw that it was completely full.  Sitting next to it was my chocolate easter bunny that I had never unwrapped.  A strange craving grew within my soul and I decided to eat.<br><br>
45 minutes later:  I had eaten all the chocolate and was feeling quite sick.<br><br>
1 hour later:  I threw up.  And my pulse is kinda faster.  Oh yeah, and I feel really sick still.<br><br>
4 hours later:  I took some valium and tried to get to sleep.  No luck.  My stomach feels really sludgy or something.  I can't explain it.  I feel like shit.<br><br>
6 hours later:  The valium seems to be working..I feel really relaxed..I'm going to go to sleep now.<br><br>
This was transcribed off of my Trip log (a yellow notebook).  My guess is that the best way to get the caffeine/theobromine high isn't through eating 5 lbs. of chocolate.  Nothing actually even happened to me besides the extreme body load of eating five pounds of chocolate.  (i.e. diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, pain.)  On the bright side of this experience, I don't think I'll be craving chocolate for a while.  <br><br>
P.s. I do have this strange feeling at the bridge of my nose that I get whenever I roll.  It's like my consciousness or my soul has shifted closer to the front of my face..Like I'm thinking out of that part of my brain.  Really strange sensation.<br><br>
