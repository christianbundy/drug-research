 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nT-0:00 - 10 mg of 1-(3,4-methylenedioxy-phenyl)-2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-pentan-1-one (MDPV) is insufflated.<br>T-0:30 - First effects are noticed; very mild stimulation, as well as slight gastrointestinal disturbances.<br>T-1:00 - Another 10 mg of MDPV is insufflated.<br>T-1:30 - A definite elevation in mood; effects are similar to a moderate amount of caffeine.<br>T-2:30 - 15 mg of MDPV is insufflated.<br>T-3:30 - Another 15 mg of MDPV is insufflated; stimulation is now much more prominent.  Body component feels like cocaine, and slight MDMA-like empathy begins to emerge.<br>T-4:30 - 6:30 - 30 mg of MDPV is insufflated in 10 mg increments, once per hour without any incline in effects.<br>T-8:00 - Stimulation begins wearing off; standard MDxx 'crash.'<br>T-8:30 - Back to baseline; the 'crash' is MUCH harder than with any of the standard MDxx phens, however, this could be attributed to a sleepless night.<br>Could possibly be used at 10-15 mg doses for ADD/ADHD treatment or as a caffeine replacement, however, doses above 20 mg did not produce the intense euphoria expected from MDMA and is therefore not recommended for recreational use.\n\n\n"
