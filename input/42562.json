 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI accepted Him into my world; He showed me the path He made.\r\nHe and I chose to kill me, but not before an hour of play.\r\nMy mind wouldn't surrender, so it was slayed. My soul washed away.\r\nAnd then, as I learned how everything really is, I realize I am God.\r\n'I am the alpha *and* the omega!' I remembered I did once say.\r\nAnd there We were, staring at each other in dismay,\r\nthinking, 'So this is how it all ends?\r\nI *never* would have guessed (what We had made)!'\n\n\n"
