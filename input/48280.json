 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI am currently on Valium, and I ended up taking more than was indicated when I first got my prescription filled, so I have been on the hunt for substitutes until I get it filled again to ease the withdrawls, as I can only take 5 mg. of Valium per day, as opposed to the 15 mg I am supposed to be on. I am on Valium as as substitute for alcohol, as I am an alcohol-dependant person. \r\nI had tried kava kava in fairly high doses many times, with some luck. It would simply make me feel dissociated and quiet, no noticible euphoria or intoxication. Tonight, I went to a local health foods store and picked up some kava kava gel tabs, and powdered valerian root capsules. The recomended dose of the kava is 1 tablet 3x per day (225 mg. kavalactones) and 3 caplets as needed (1,590 mg) valerian root. Because I have experiance with both I decided on 1 tablet of kava and 2 to start of the Valerian, as I wanted to play it safe. The experiance goes as follows.\r\n+0.00 - I down 1 kava kava gel tab and 2 valerian root caplets. I go to eat. I have a really bad headache. \r\n+1.00 hour - I feel more relaxed, hungry again and somewhat thirsty. Mild benzodiazapine effect. Head pain easing up.\r\n+1:30 hours - I feel good, but leveled off so I decide on 1 more Valerian caplet. No more headache. \r\n+2:00- I have now devoured a baggie of Dorito's and lots of water. I'm thirsty as hell, and a little off balance, I feel good.\r\n+2:30- I take three more valerian caplets. More than reccomended, but I feel like I can handle it.\r\n+2:30 - 5:00 hours later - Feeling intoxicated. I feel like I've had a few drinks, talkative and more social. Slightly euphoric. Cigarettes taste AMAZING. Slight nausea.\r\nAll in all, while I had to consume twice the recommended dosage, this can be a powerfull herb. Very relaxing and disinhibiting. Feels like low dose alcohol/ low dose marijuana. Killed my pain, but when the extra three began to kick in I have an awful taste in my mouth, alot of extra mucous and feel a little nauseous. I also have a slow, pounding heart. \r\nThis is a very safe alternative to illegal substances/ chemicals. I highly recomened it. It seems like dosing a second time after the first dose wears off is neccisary for maximal effects. The first dose acts as a primar, the second as a true tranquillizar/intoxicant. With a low dose of kava kava, this is really good stuff. I highly prefer it over doing more risky things like smoking marijuana, taking benzodiazapines or drinking. It is a much healthier alternative. I also suffer from high blood pressure and my blood pressure has dropped way down, which Valium does not do for me.\n\n\n"
