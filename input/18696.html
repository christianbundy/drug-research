First Ayahuasca Trip-<br>
I acidified 16 ounces of water with citric acid and added 9 grams of chacruna (Psychotria viridis). I brought this solution to a boil then allowed it to simmer for 10 minutes. I ingested 3 grams of syrian rue seeds by placing the powdered seeds into a small shot glass, adding water, and drinking this liquid. 15 minutes later I ingested half of the chacruna solution. <br><br>
In 10 minutes the drug started to take effect. Only experiencing brief minor nausea, I began an extremely intense trip. I had to be in a very still and quite area. I layed down in my bed and the visions began. At first I saw many beautifull patterns with yellow and green colors. Many which looked like the pictures in depicted in plants of the gods. Suddenly I felt as though I couldn't breath. Everything turned black and I saw visions of snakes and demons. I cried for help as my girlfriend entered the room. I calmed down mildly. I began to explain how I wasn't living my life moraly and how much i wanted to change, how much i wanted to be close to jesus, and how much i wanted to be happy. After the intense visuals died down, i was able to talk about and reflect on the changes that where occuring in me. after about 30 minutes all the effects subsided. <br><br>
This experience was very powerful. It was very difficult to navigate this journey and it is difficult not to fall victim to a bad trip. Even though i spent 10 minutes in hell i feel that i learned alot. And i actually did enjoy the negative and horrifying aspects of this trip because i learned alot about myself and freed myself of much sorrow.<!-- End Body -->
