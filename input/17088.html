Boring details of author: only tripped once before on LSD, had a month of beautiful chaos with MDA, have been jolted by 2-ct-7s secrets a handful of timesand have taken a reasonable amount of street-grade ecstacy.  19 years old, university student.  <br><br>
It was 4oclock and I decided that I should eat about 2mg of clonazepam (I get prescribed other pharmaceutical candy, though had unfortunately run out), thinking that I may have a quiet night in.  A friend rang me up, it was about 7.30PM and the message basically was that some acid would be coming up that night.  That was a very good thing, as acid has been nothing but scarce in my area for quite a time.  I was in an inhibited state, and thought that I did not want to experience the feeling of wanting more when in the drug statebut didnt know how strong the acid was so, we ended up having some tabs in front of us, and thought lets to 2.  And we did.  <br><br>
About 40-50 mins later we were smoking hash-oil in my college room.  I felt that I wanted to dance, and that I was aware of each sensory receptor in my body.  My friend returned from the bathroom, and I was confused.  I was on LSD.  It took me a while to pick up on itbecause the hallucinations and the experience came from things that I had suspected anyways.  A phone rang, and it was a friend, we call him P.  P met up with us at my friends, also very average middle class college room. We were smoking more hash-oil discussing how the universe was only what could be verbalised as everything man.. while also attempting to brutally simplify acidic conversational themes that always have a way popping up mid-sentence, paragraph or word.  P came around, and he was noticibly intoxicated by the poison, Ethanol.  But, all was good and we had another person born again with the Holy water of LSD.  <br><br>
So then there was three of ustripping.  Walking around the university discussing why it would be a bad idea to get caught smoking hash oil in a tree amongst other things.  Colour shifting was amazing, and I re-affirmed my love for psychedelic drugs.  I had felt like until that point, my mind had been operating in a box.  But upon taking the acid, it was though I became aware that the boxs walls didnt really exist they were not solid constructs that could not be manipulatedthey were mere curtains blowing in the wind revealing a universe of infinite conscious states.  Quite a revelation.  The experience was completely unbelievable.   <br><br>
Kept smoking throughout the evening/morning, taking a backseat as I watched the ego drama unfold.  I learned a lot during the experience, when looking out or simply sitting with my eyes closedhowever, the things that I did learn are not expressible using our language.  This disheartened me for the next dayasking what the moral of the story was.  Then I realised that the revelations that I experienced were very deep and penetrated the centre of my being and that everything that I think post that night, will be effected by the thoughts I was having on the LSD, many times more than any other twelve hour portion of my life.  So, I have been permanently changed after taking the LSD, and thats a happy ending.<!-- End Body -->
