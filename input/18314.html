6mg weighed out in room at 9:35pm in friendly entrepreneur's room. Scraped onto knife and promptly insufflated. No burn... Minor drips. Captain beefheart playing in the background. I leave because he's got homework. He wishes me a good trip, I'm out the door &amp; off...<br><br>
Perhaps because I was warily anticipating the nausea and vomiting associated with this drug, my body immediately began to prime itself for some hardcore wretching. I could feel the upper digestive parts tense up not ten seconds after dosing. My body was going to punish me for drugging myself with this particular. The nausea was accompanied by a queasy, soupy  light-headed feeling, and my vision was slightly yellow. A pale jaundiced yellow. It was worse than the onset of a dozen peyote buttons, much more rapid and just..eugh. Not a good feeling. Like being seasick and drunk. I also began to sweat, my forehead was sticky and feverish even though it was like fifty degrees out.<br><br>
After 10 minutes of walking down a dark dreary bike path path, on the way back to my dorm, fighting the gag reflex with every step, I had to sit down on a bench and commence puking into the dirt. Violently, oh so violently. But all I could produce was a small, glistening, skittle flavored pool of sick between my shoes. About twenty minutes of straight emesis, most of it was just dry heaving, I was afraid that I would tear something free and hemorrhage. After puking I did not feel much better, indeed the nausea was still heavy and now my throat and esophagus were coated in nasty corrosive stomach juices. I returned to my room and lay in bed with the lights off for a half hour, just riding out the phsyical discomfort, hoping it would abate. No visuals, other than just a hazy sheen to my vision. I was salivating excessively, had to spit into my trash can every couple minutes. When I thought I was done puking and took a sip of water, more vomit sprang up and I launched my surprisingly replenished stomach contents across the room before I could aim at the trash can. <br><br>
At this point I was pretty disappointed in the substance. My mind was clear, other than having to concentrate some mental energy to keep my stomach in check. I felt like if I let up it would start heaving and spewing, or trying to spew whatever secretions...<br><br>
Luckily I remembered the girl down the hall had a fair amount of weed. I knocked on her door and she immediately invited me to smoke. We smoked a few bowls and the pot quelled the nausea instantaneously. It was a marvellous relief. I did not enjoy her company however. Psychedlics turn me into a critical asshole and usually I can't be around most people while I'm tripping. The character insights were not nearly as sharp or  profound or disturbing as with lsd or even 5meo dipt. I didn't know how to extricate myself from the situation - so I had to suffer two hours of inane conversation. She was playing crappy generic nature company music which I found annoying all the while I feeling chagrinned that I was wasting time being polite and stringing her along into a bunch of bullshit patter, in exchange for her drugs. My brain was a little fogged so I asked some of the same questions a couple times, only realizing after she'd responded. She commented that my pupils were very large.<br><br>
Fortunately about 3 hrs post ingestion, some subtle but definitely pleasant visual effects started to gradually enhance the experience. I think the weed was mostly responsible. It lifted my mood and about made up for the previous ill effects. Everything had a mild psilocybin glow and little points of light would zip and trail like stringy little comets. <br><br>
I bade the girl goodnight and went to enjoy my trip (though it didn't feel at all like a trip in the lsd sense) by myself in the lounge. I ended up watching midnight express for the second time, for some reason. I don't remember actually selecting that movie, I must have picked one at random from the stack on my dresser. I hadn't been really impressed with it the first time I saw it, other than by brad davis' cheekbones. This time I realized that it was a dumb, heavy-handed movie with numerous laughably cliched lines, a formulaic plot and melodramatic acting. It bothered me. I had better movies at my disposal and I picked this one. I didn't want to keep watching, but somehow I felt compelled to finish it. Afterwards I took a short walk. But I forgot to bring a jacket and became quite cold.<br><br>
Back in my room I read, listened to acid mothers temple &amp; stars on the lid tried writing, but eventually just lay prone, staring at the ceiling. The visuals were gone all of a sudden and I was on the long comedown. My muscles were tense and I had a bit of a headache, but by 8 hrs into it I could drink and eat and drift into semi-sleep.<br><br>
So a decent material, if you can handle the stomach component. Minor cheerful visuals without any sort of mental turbulence. I would recommend  a slightly lower dose than I took. Smoking pot definitely helps. Maybe someday I'll try it again.<br><br>
Though, none of these research chemicals touch LSD, I'm afraid.<!-- End Body -->
