Its the end of a stressful week, for some reason ive had triping on my mind. Even though i havn't taken any psychedelics (except canibis) in almost two years.  I happened to find some 'foxy methoxy' and i was anxious to try something new.  I weighed out several 10mg and 6 mg doses.  I figured id start low but when the time came i said 'F' it and took 16mgs on a slightly empty stomach.  I washed it down with a homebrew.  After about 45min i began to feel something, then there was a smooth rise until it blew my top!!!  <br><br>
Sixteen mg on an almost virgin mind and you will go somewhere.  This substance is extremely interesting.  It opened my mind wide at about 2.5 hours, then some serious playtime for another hour.  If i am babbling its because i am at t=4.5 hours.  The comedown feels smooth and i don't forsee major problems with sleep.<br><br>
There was a slight body load and a little nausea on the ride up.  Overall definitely positive experience, i got much needed insight into my life.  Others be very careful this substance is powerful. (oh yea, i was on a solo journey)<!-- End Body -->
