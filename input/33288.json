 "report": "<p>I tried cocaine for the first time at a party when I was 15. I didn't even know what it was at first. I was drinking and smoking pot at the time and don't even really recall feeling anything from it. After that, I won't say how, but it was continuely (sp) available to me. I did it from morning until around 12:00 am everyday for about a year and a half. I became nearly emaciated from it making me have such a dramatic decrease in appetite. I lost 20 pounds one time during a month period. </p><p>It changed the way I thought after a while. All I thought about was when I was going to get more or where I could get it or how much I was going to do. etc. I stopped caring about myself at all. I started sleeping around a lot, being fearless when it came to any kind of drug, I would try anything to get high somehow at school if I had no cocaine, I never went to school, I stopped talking to anyone who didn't do it or have it, I even came really really close to trading sex for it. </p><p>I turned 16 and I was already a coke head in the 10th grade. Now, even though I'm off it for good, I messed up my credits so bad in school that I had to quit and get my GED, I still think about it every now and then, and if someone offers it, it takes all my will power to say no. I just wanted to put my own experience out there.</p>"
