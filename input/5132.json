 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI have heard many variations of codeines recreational use and mine follows suit with most of them with a few exceptions.  I have found the water separation method to be quite helpful in the separation of the codeine from other substances and just to aid in the absorption of the drug itself.  \r\nTaking large quantities (over 160mg) of codeine all at once has caused me some pretty intense headaches that are primarily at the back of the neck.  I enjoy taking the codeine dissolved in a small quantity of water.  I usually dissolve about 400mg of codeine in water and drink down a third of the solution and wait for the mellow hum to kick in.  Then every 20-30min take the water equivalent of about, 50mg of the codeine, water solution.  This seems to calm any adverse reaction to the drug and also greatly prolongs the peak from 1 hour to as much as 3 hours or in my case a whole day (with additional batches).  If youre ever in the mood to just mellow and zone, with out doing a lot of anything else, this is the way to go!\n\n\n"
