How to make 'Blotter Salvia' by The_Stalker<br><br>
This is simply a method of preparation so that you get all the benefit of salvia without need for a bong or tasting horrible smoke. This method is nearly tasteless, and produces a smooth trip.<br><br>
You need:<br>
5 grams Salvia Divinorum dry unextracted<br>
100 ml of solvent (more on solvent choice below)<br>
900ml water<br>
Jar or 1 liter flask<br>
Bowl <br>
Funnel<br>
Coffee grinder or Mortar and Pestle<br>
Filter Paper or Coffee Filter<br>
Tea strainer or fine mesh sieve<br><br>
1.	Powder 5grams of dry Salvia Divinorum leaves. A coffee grinder will work if it is the type with a small bowl and a spinning blade. A mortar and pestle is best though.<br>
2.	In the jar or flask, combine powdered Salvia with solvent. (A note on solvents; any polar solvent will work but for this extraction an alcohol is best, either 151 proof Everclear or 70% Isopropyl Alcohol [rubbing alcohol].)<br>
3.	Let this mixture sit for 10 hours.<br>
4.	Add your water to the flask or jar. Adding water to the alcohol lowers the solubility of the active ingredient Salivorin A to the point that it will fall out or ?precipitate?. This will make your 1-liter solution look slightly cloudy; it is the clouds that you want. Let sit for 5 minutes.<br>
5.	Set up your funnel with filter paper over the bowl. Get your tea strainer above the funnel.<br>
6.	Pour the solution from the flask, through the strainer and filter into the bowl. Do it slowly, don?t let the liquid get more than half way up the paper.<br>
7.	Wash out your flask or jar with more water to get any residue on the bottom, again pour it through the filters.<br>
8.	Discard the liquid and save the paper. You should notice a nice round area on your paper that looks slightly green or yellow.<br>
9.	Dry your paper in an oven; 2 minutes on 300 degrees work fine. It will now look as though you have crystals on your paper and indeed you do.<br><br>
Cut this circular green are into five equal pieces, each one is good for a nice oral trip or maybe two smoked. To use simply take one of your strip and place it under the tongue, the effects can be felt in about fifteen minutes. A strip may also be smoked for more immediate effects.<br><br>
The advantages of this method are that there is no harsh smoke, and no bitter taste.<!-- End Body -->
