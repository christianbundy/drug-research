I just read a Kava report that states some guy smoked Kava when he couldnt find pot, and felt Pot Like Effects.  I have smoked Kava, and my expirance was extremly different.<br><br>
I prepaired the Kava by taking apart two pills and mixing them with a tiny amount of water (the water was completely absorbed) and letting the kava dry into a pasty clump on a mirror.  Although the kava was from a pill bottle it smelled VERY strongly, making me think it was fresh.<br><br>
My thinking on this was, if you can smoke it and get high why the hell would you eat this foul tasting stuff?<br><br>
Well the kava dried and ended up looking like the weird off-white crack I see on Cops every once in a while.  So that night I cleaned out my bowl an blazed that rock.  The smoke was thicker thatn hell, and it smoked for a hell of a song time.  Nothing happened.  I went inside my house and went in my room, and waited for music to sound as awesome as I remembered it sounding.  Thhree hours later I was sleepy and dissapointed.  However, I do remember feeling a small Bubbly sensation in my lungs, similar to those early days with doty.  <br><br>
The next day I woke up with a terrible cough.  My lungs hurt like something you wouldn't believe.  It was like I had some bizzar cold that came out of nowhere in the middle of summer.  This intense discomfort lasted for a week and went away.  My lungs are fine, i can still hold my breath and swim great, although that wasnt the case for that week.  <br><br>
My thoughts on this expirance...  I think that Kava is a type of pepper, and if ya taste it it does taste kind of peppery.  I think that smoking the Kava released the basic pepper irritant that will make you sneeze if you smell it and will make you cry if a cop sprays it in your eyes.  I have taken that same Kava before, orally, with great results.  People are always knocking pill form Kava, but i've had alot of fun with it.<br><br>
People also say that you need to open those pills and mix a drink out of them, when this is NOT the case.  All that pill is is a tiny thin piece of neutral gelatin.  The stomach breaks that down like nothin.  Also people say that you need to eat 1.5 - 2  bottles of this to really get the effects.  I find that one bottle will usually mess me up so bad that I'll feel sick... 3/4 of a normal pill bottle is the most I should ever need.  Peace out<!-- End Body -->
