At around 11 o clock, my friends and I began drinking. It was nothing new. After about 7 shots or so of some vodka, I started to feel a pretty heavy buzz. At this time I remembered the Provigils I had recently collected from a friend.<br><br>
I have had experience with provigils before, and they have all been quite similar to the experiences listed online, but this was a truly different experience. I pulled two 100mg provigils from a bag and proceeded to finely crush them and form them into two large lines. I was expecting the normal upper feelings with the unique provigil intoxicated high that comes along. <br><br>
However, after my first line, the effects were immediate. I all of a sudden became heavily intoxicated yet almost clear at the same time. I sprawled myself on the floor where I could tell that sight and sound was amplified but somewhat unimportant to me. I then daringly snorted the next line which gave the same immediate feeling. From then on stuff began to get a little blurry, but I remember trying my hardest to have a normal conversation, but all I could focus on was the way my own voice sounded. It was almost as if I was hearing my voice echo. The experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it.<br><br>
Though the experience sounds very hallucinagenic, I believe that the unique feelings were just due to the strange combining effects of the drowsy intoxication of alcohol and the high of provigil.<!-- End Body -->
