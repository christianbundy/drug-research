 "report": "<p>I decided to take .25mg (half of a .5mg pill) of the clonazepam because Im not really sure what its going to do. The obvious effects shouldcome on in the form similar to that of Valium and Xanax (since theyre in the same family).  But Im almost positive that it wont feel the same since Xanax (alprazolam) feels different than Valium (diazepam).</p><p>TOI: 9:36pm, didnt notice any taste</p><p>9:40 My head is beginning to feel like its being squeezed ever so gently from the inside to the outside back to the inside.</p><p>9:42 Fuck, this drug took on quick. Im not kidding. Maybe it just seems like its quicker and more powerful since Ive never taken it and dont have any tolerance for it.</p><p>9:48 It feels like Im scared inside my chest. Its my heart. Its doing funny things. It feels like Im watching a horror movie, and my heart is jumping at the scary parts, which occur constantly.</p><p>10:17 About 20min ago, I went outside to smoke a cig, and I noticed a few things: balance was more difficult to control (weak feeling in the knees not like walking was difficult, but more like I couldnt support the weight of my body), and I could still think like I usually do minus any feeling of anxiety.</p><p>10:19 As of now, I feel great. A mind thats not infested with anxieties is a beautiful thing. This is how my mind should work on a normal basis; however, I had to be born and raised differently.</p><p>10:25 Im listening to old songs that would under any other circumstances make me feel sad, rerunning past memories of loneliness through me. But this time its like Im clean from the mind maggots that eat away at me every fucking day.</p><p>10:33 Im porcelain being, fragile to the touch. I dont want to communicate with others theyd just make me into themselves.</p><p>I found that social psychology has a tremendous impact on me. The more Im outside, the more hurt I get (either my people not liking me, or by adapting myself to my social surroundings: ignoring some people and turning into others). The only time I feel safe is when Im alone. If I could help it, Id make it so that I was the only one in the universe. Its been proven that people need other people, but my explanation is that my dependency drive is the lowest on the hierarchy of all drives.</p><p>10:37 I feel weak when I get up, but my mental functions are holding on strong. Its like Im more prepared for things. Its like I got what I need to take on the world (mentally). Physically, Id say Id need speed, but lets not be a total drug-head at this point.</p><p>10:51 My current opinion of clonazepam is that its a good drug, and I will do it again starting now.</p><p>TOI: as I swallowed, the clock struck 10:55</p><p>Total peace of mind is something so incredibly special to me that I dont ever want to let it go. The problem is that I might learn helplessness. This would be a very serious problem. These types of drugs cause the breakdown of the psychological self.</p><p>10:57 My mouth feels a little dry. Then again, I havent drunk water in a long time. Nevertheless, I know its the clonazepam.</p><p>10:59 Hey, its almost 11. Where has time gone off to? What have I been doing? Damn.</p><p>11:13 Lying down felt too good. I didnt want to get up for anything, but I have to go take a piss .</p><p>The head feeling is still present, but it feels like I got used to it. Its as if the only thing happening was that all of my anxieties were squashed, I gained a new found power to deal with life (confidence in myself and my abilities), and I think Id melt away in the sheets if Id lie down again.</p><p>12:38 This is a great drug.</p><p>TOI: 12:44, .5mg this time</p><p>12:48 The stronger head effects are coming back. This is good. This is what I enjoyed the last time.</p><p>12:57 Although, it just seems to stop there what are these head effects? What is exactly happening inside of my brain? Clonazepam in larger doses should cause sleep so where is it? I wont complain. I feel good.</p><p>1:17 Im feeling pretty good. And how about yourself? I wish I could go to sleep, but why would I want to wake up in hell?</p><p>1:24 I think I pretty much said all I needed to say all thats going on right now is that Im experiencing heftier effects than before. As I look around, I seem to want to smoke a little weed to blast myself out of consciousness. This is what I do. This is me. Dont judge.</p><p>TOS: 1:59, ahh</p><p>2:13 The weed hit (I took 5 hits from my bowl). Im high fucking high, and its all without any paranoia, nor anxieties rattling my brain. I thought about a few things too it felt like this was a comparable high to that of Xanax w/ weed.</p><p>2:18 Im getting dizzy too. Whoa, it fucking hit with power. Im falling backwards. Falling shit. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>I want this to end. I need to pass out.</p><p>2:26 My head is ready to explode. I feel like I am done for good. Will I wake up half brain dead and half wasted?</p><p>Shit, Im fucking wasted.</p><p>2:49 I watched the Iceman and the Psychiatrist on HBO+W. That was a tremendous experience, and it made me think about how much psychology means to me. I need it to understand myself and to understand others (so that I could figure them out so I could live without any of my anxieties with them).</p><p>3:12 Theres one thing I forgot to mention the weed sped my brain functions back up, allowing me to further stay conscious and report.</p><p>3:25 I went out, smoked a cig and thought. I came to a hypothesis: Clonazepam is a different drug from Xanax, thats why these chemicals are prescribed to different people with different problems. However</p><p>Xanax + weed (is just as enjoyable as) Klonopin + weed</p><p>I thought about barbiturates and how theyre addictive. What they do is send you to a far off different world thats absent of anxieties, and some fears are generally reduced. After the addiction develops, the return off of the drugs is into hell (like I said when I thought about how Id feel later when I wake up). A person then doesnt know how to deal with all of whats going on inside themselves (their minds).</p><p>This is a powerful high, and I could see how some people might fear it. Youre so fucked up and so far from reality, your head is spinning, dizziness kills, and the problems with the world leave your cranium.</p><p>Its not like heroin where youre off in a dreamland of pleasure.</p><p>Its not like weed where youre just high.</p><p>Its not like cocaine where youre just numb and dumb to everything, while horny.</p><p>And its not like speed where you figure out that youre capable of moving mountains.</p><p>Its like youve stepped out of reality and entered a world of absolute tranquility.</p><p>Nothing matters, and thats a huge problem.</p>"
