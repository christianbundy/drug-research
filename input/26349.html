This was my first time taking any type of DMT, and it was very enlightening, rather pleasant and a little confusing.<br><br>
I was in a comfortable place with three of my friends around me all huddled up with blankets and spliffs, making the environment comfortable and safe. I already had taken some LSD and the effects were still detectable.i had read some reports on DMT and was waiting for my right time to take it. One of my friends whom i will call d. was smoking a pipe of DMT and i thought   'is it the right time yet.....maybe i'll do it if its offered' d passed me the pipe and i noticed it wasnt like the other DMT it was a white powder which evidently was 5meo.  I thought  'ok then here goes' and razzed the whole pipe...<br><br>
What happened next was a similar experience to something i almost felt on a mild 2CB trip six months previous...<br><br>
I felt myself compleatly relax with no thought behind the action and then thought 'oh hang on a minute' as one of my other friends called  l. put her arm across my groin. I looked to d. for some sort of guidance and he nodded a 'Don't worry you know, relax and go with it' when i then relaxed d. and l. proceeded to place their arms and legs over mine and by then i could start to feel the edges of our bodies merge. i knew the feeling from before and focused my intent on getting rid of all the boundaries between us. The outcoming effect was a sort of flower effect with all the unmerged parts of us slowly merging untill the lines between us were pointing to a point at the centre of us. <br><br>
As the lines disappeared the centre point opened up and i got the flash memory of  being in the garden of eden holding a light beings hand asking him why we have to go back. as the answer 'because it'd be boring otherwise' came i realised that the light being was me and everybody as i already understood that we and everything are one. with all of these realisations my awareness of my body came back and i was in a three way  clasped hands embrace and our bodies had moved from the intertwined mess they were in before. i looked at l. and she had a tear falling down her cheek that i touched while realising how much i love these people. i find it strange how that was my first 5-MEO-DMT trip and it was the only one like that. all the others have been different  in lots of ways. It must have been the right time.<!-- End Body -->
