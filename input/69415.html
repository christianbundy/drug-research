Over the past six months, my friends and I have become involved in the Hollywood Afterhours scene. There we stay up for days on end partying and doing drugs. In about 36 hours I will do 5-8 E pills, Coke, K, Speed, 3-4oz of G, and weed. I know crazy hu??! and I'm only 5'9' and 135lb, and after all of that I'm still ok. <br><br>
This one day something was different, we were at a club in LA and we were drinking G. Well apparently this G was super concentrated after 4-8 caps caps I started to pass out. Leaning on the walls and falling all over the place, my friends saw this and decided to get me out of there fast. Right when we go out the door I fell and started to convulse, the security guards call 911 and I was rushed to the ER. I ended up having a catheter, several cuts, and bruises. I woke up crying cause I didnt know where I was, eventually my friends found me and I went home, but man that was one experience I never wanna have again!!<!-- End Body -->
