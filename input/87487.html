****Note - marijuana was consumed throughout the whole expirience.<br>
I am a heavy user smoking .3-1gram per day******<br><br>
Last weekend I indulged in some klonopin and adderall. The best high I recieved from this combo was today, monday, after 5 days of straight use. I almost cried, and I could feel the surge or dopamine and serotonin rush to and through my head. Before I get started I should give some backround info.<br><br>
Friday-Sunday consisted of me taking my benzos with my potentiators (Tagamet + Grapefruit Juice). Once the buzz kicked in I would Crush up some IR adderall and I would be in heaven. Free from all the anxiety in the world, free from what anyone thought, cared, did, and I was motivated to live life. At first, the smallest line(1-5mg) would send me soaring into the clouds ready for anything. I would take the klonopin 2hrs before hand then rail a small line and 1-2 bong tokes every 15-30 mins.I was high all day.  I snorted about 20mg addy on saturday, 30mg sunday = 50-60mgs. 1.5mg Kpin friday, 3mg Kpin sat, 1.5 mg sunday = 5-8mg<br><br>
Monday: probably have roughly 4-6 mg in my bloodstream still and I can definetly feel the 'who gives a fuck' benzo buzz when I wake up. I decided to put .5mg under my tongue at 7AM and railed 10mgs Adderall. I felt like the fucking man at school. Well, I was too drugged up to even care what the fuck I said or did. I felt no anxiety throught the whole day besides coming down from the adderall 1-2hrs later which I combated by drinking an energy drink. Normally, I would be extremely anxious at people judging me, thinking about stupid stuff, anxious about some thing I said a day ago, anxious about something I said a month ago, or even a year ago. I like this combo way to much, and my gut keeps telling me to do more. To keep partying. This was supposed to be the day I took a break and waited until friday to buy the ticket and take the ride.<br><br>
This is where the fun begins........<br><br>
4:00pm - by this time, I have roughly 3-6 mg of klonopin in my blood stream and I can definetly feel sense of calmness.  I went into my family's drug stash and took out a peachy addy pill. Broke it up, cut it up, and railed it. The monkey was finally off my back, for now.....<br><br>
I decided to enhance whatever klonopin was left in my bloodstream by taking 2 shots of vodka.  Wow, I felt warm and fuzzy from the booze instantly. I could feel me coming up from the speed though. I felt instant addrenaline rush and screamed at the top of my lunhgs, 'aaahh!!!' it felt soooooooooooooo fucking good. I yelled again followed by laughter. After 30 mins I could feel the alcohol fully, but I was way to tipsy/buzzin for only 2 shots. My speach was slowed, my eyes wide open but with no anxiety. <br><br>
Complete utter euphoria. I chatted some people on facebook and took rips out the bong. Took 1 hit of decent grade and I could feel this is going to be good. 2-3-4 hits and Im HAMMERED. I have tool playing in the background and Im having reallly positive thoughts. More than usual. At the time, tears came to my eyes and I loved this fucking world. <br><br>
This combo is extremely addicting for me. I get the euphoria and alertness from the adderall. Beneath it, a warm cozy blanket covers my brain. I start to have blurred vision. After 2-3 hours of euphoria, Im back down to the ground, still stoned and buzzin.<br><br>
The kpin definitely insures a smooth high and comedown.<!-- End Body -->
