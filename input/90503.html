I'll be writing a short report on my findings with Gabapentin.<br><br>
(past)Background:<br>
I'm not a heavy drug user. I don't regularly partake in any recreational drugs. Just the occasional weekend trip. In the past I've experimented with Pot on a few occasions, opiates, alcohol, ambien. I take Butalbital for migraine headaches when needed.<br><br><br>
On with the trip!<br><br>
A few weeks back I was a tad depressed, and needed to get out of my mind for a few hours. I knew of barbiturates, and had taken 4-5 times the recommended dose of my headache pills on a few occasions. Though, now I know it was mainly the codeine I was feeling.<br><br>
After throughly searching our cabinet, I found 5 full bottles of gabapentin. A close family member receives this for nerve pain, but won't take anything expired (go figure!).<br><br>
Thrilled, I messaged a good friend who's quite in-the-know and has much experienced with pharms. She informed me that this could be used as a recreational, and I would need about 1.2-3 grams. Along with her research, I read quite a few reviews and decided that tonight was appropriate, and started to set the scene.<br><br>
After running to the store to pick up some of my favorite ginger-ale and flamin' hot cheetos, I fasted for about 5 hours. At about 9:00 pm after the house had settled down and most of the family was asleep I quietly poured out 5 of the 600 mg pills. My mood at this time was very excited, I was in anticipation of the high, and ready for an escape.<br><br>
(Mind you the times are a guess)<br><br>
(11:00 PM)<br>
Take 3 of the pills (1.8 grams), with a can of ginger-ale.<br><br>
(12:30 AM) <br>
First changes in my body that I can feel.<br>
Slightly wobbly walking to the bathroom, and mild euphoria. Similar to a few shots, without the spins.<br><br>
(12:45 AM)<br>
I want to intensify the high, so I take the other 2 bringing me to the full 3 grams. Taken with 2 more cans of ginger-ale.<br><br>
(1:15 AM) <br>
All of the sudden it hits me like a brick wall. I feel warm and fuzzy, and cozy under my blanket. I feel like I'm slurring my speech, but I know I'm not. Short conversation with my father about camping this spring. Something inside of me screams for socialization. Decide to call my friend max.<br><br>
(1:30 AM)<br>
After a short bout of carpet sprawling, I find the phone and dial. Everything is okay, and nothing needs to be hidden. I speak of everything that comes to mind, and he's happy to hear it. EXTREMELY euphoric. The strongest euphoria I've ever felt. I see mild hallucinations. What I most vividly remember is a band I saw that stretched the distances of the ones I love. Hard to explain.<br><br>
(1:45 AM) <br>
I realize I'm being really loud, and try to quiet down. Not happening. Still feeling great, I log onto MSN while on the phone. My typing skills are impaired. People know I'm high, which isn't like me.. So I log off. Say goodbye to max. Back to the living room!<br><br>
(2:15 AM)<br>
Sitting on my couch, thinking about the world. Everything feels nice to touch. Great body high. I eat my cheetos and snuggle up to a weeds marathon on television. Still being really loud, singing and such. (mind you, the room I'm in has three sleeping people in it) I fade in and out of sleep, with super-awesome-colorful lucid dreams.<br><br>
(3:15 AM)<br>
I decide it's time to lay back for sleep, as I have school in the morning.<br><br><br>
FAST FORWARD!!<br>
I get a text at about 7:00 am, informing me my classes are canceled. I go back to sleep.<br><br>
(10:00 AM)<br>
Wake up, refreshed and feeling great! Happy! Still feeling slightly wobbly when I walk, and still very chatty. About an hour later this slowly tapered off.<br><br>
So, conclusion.<br><br>
This felt similar to an opiate, without the comedown.<br>
Wonderful, LONG high.<br><br>
After this experience I've taken gabapentin about 7 more times with about the same turn-out. 3 grams seems to be peak, with no other changes up to 5. Under about 2 grams I can function 100% normally and find that it just brings up my mood.<br><br>
I have plenty of it, and a steady supply. I plan to take this as a recreational as long as I have it.<br><br>
