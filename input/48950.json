 "report": "<p>I smoked some of this stuff combined/rolled in tobacco, moistening it in my hands to make it sticky (like hash oil or oily hash or very similar) and felt something. Head rush, spaced out... all for a very short time. Nothing 'psychedelic' in my opinion.</p><p>Also very hard on the stomach, yes stomach (nausea) when smoked. Although it wasn't terrible, the nausea lasted about as long as the other effects I felt from the mucuna.</p><p>is this worth it? probably, just not to smoke.</p>"
