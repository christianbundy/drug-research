 "report": "<p>I was a little surprised that I repeatedly got CNS effects from taking prednisone to treat a skin issue.  I got very noticeable mental effects starting 20-30 minutes after ingestion of 20+ mg prednisone.</p><p>I felt a bit stimulated, a tightness in my stomach/chest, sort of like </p><p>I've taken a solid dose of ephedrine or too much caffeine.  Continuing hints of nervousness and discomfort in the stomach.</p><p>3 days in a row, for a couple hours after taking the prednisone.  On the third day I  waited to take it for several hours after I got up and waited til I'd had a full bowl of soup and it still had the same effect.  </p><p>Partner who had taken prednisone recently found herself with mood swings after taking a single 10mg dose of prednisone.</p>"
