 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm an eighteen year old Ecuadorian American guy. I am a very liberal philosopher/photographer/mediator/student.  I am 60 and weigh about 160 lbs  Im a lightweight and I am rather sensitive to substances like alcohol and marijuana.  I consider myself intelligent, creative, ambitious, and curious, and only recently have I tried to expand my consciousness with mind-altering substances.<br>In my pursuit for altered mindstates, I discovered online info about cacti.  After extensive research, I decided to try and find a San Pedro cactus or something similar to that.  None of the nurseries around where I live carry San Pedro or any Trichocereus for that matter.  However they did have a medium sized Myrtillocactus geometrizans (Blue Flame) which reportedly contained mescaline.  Im writing this report to dispel that rumor.  While it may contain trace amounts of mescaline, it doesnt come close to producing the amazing visuals that San Pedro does.<br>The cactus I used weighed close to a pound and a few weeks previous to this, I fortified the soil with tyrosine and dopa.  I had even been taking 12 mg melatonin supplements for the past week.  So I honestly tried to make the most of the experience<br>I started by removing all the spines.  Once that was done, I painstakingly peeled off all that waxy skin on the outside.  I removed the core and then chopped the cactus up into itty bitty pieces and boiled it for close to 1 ½ hours.  I then poured the water into another pot (not aluminum) to boil down.  I refilled the big pot and boiled the cactus mash again.  I did this process for 5 hours.  To filter out the last of the floating debris, I poured the final batch through a tshirt.  By the time I was done, I had about 16 oz of a dark greenish brown, rank smelling liquid which I put into the fridge to cool down for the following morning.<br>This morning I choked down the terrible sludge for breakfast.  Prepared for a mind blowing trip.  Heres what actually happened<br>11:30 AM<br>Yuck, that tasted terrible<br>12:00 PM<br>Hmm nothing so far.  I decide to go out with friends to a Flea Market.<br>12:30 PM<br>Shouldnt something be happening now?  Slight nausea.<br>1:00 PM<br>I feel better now, but no visuals or body high.  Nothing at all.<br>1:30 PM<br>Colors seem slightly more vibrant.  Could be placebo.<br>2:00 PM<br>Yup, it was placebo.  Damn it!<br>2:30 PM<br>I sit down to write up this report.  Feeling very bitter about the whole ordeal.  Oh, well at least I didnt puke.<br>So what went wrong?  I did add 500 mg of tyrosine during the extraction.  That might have somehow affected the mescaline.  I dont know.\n\n\n"
