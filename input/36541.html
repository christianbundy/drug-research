I had just come off a pretty heavy DXM trip the previous night, and I was feeling pretty good (albeit a little funny in the head). So I raided my step-mother's pharm stash and basically downed a bunch of pills at once. I didn't feel much, so I smoked the remnants of joint maybe ten minutes later. <br><br>
About 20 minutes later I was feeling very buzzed and hyper, I was running about for no real reason. I was sweating hell of a lot. Then I rested down, feeling a bit of a headache but still very buzzed. Then I watched a movie with my parents, I can't remember what it was. <br><br>
I noticed I felt really sad about something, though I had nothing to be sad about. Afterwards I went to bed. I didn't get any sleep that night, not a single second. I kept thrashing about all night. And the next day. And basically for the next 40 hours or so. I couldn't sit still for very long, either my leg would move around or my jaw would clench, or something. <br><br>
Eventually I fell asleep, and I gradually got more and more sleep each night until I was back to normal in maybe 4 days. It's about a week later from when I first took it. I feel pretty good. I told one of my friends (an experienced drug user) about it, and she told me 'you could have killed yourself'! And even though I kept telling myself, late at night when I couldn't sleep at all, 'I'm never doing this again', I kinda feel like doing it again. Maybe I will.<!-- End Body -->
