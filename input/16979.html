We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
I am the kind of person that is tottally against inhalents and I usually only drink or smoke weed, but there is a time in every persons life when they need some kind of substance in their system and they are unable to find one.  Thats how my night was going, I was bored out of my mind and looking for a cheap high.  I went on the net looking for what I could do and I heard about inhaling gasoline, some of the things I heard about it were amazing, the trips that people had, I was scared but my curiosity took over my common sence.  <br><br>
I went in my garage and grabbed a gasoline can.  I poured it into a 2 liter bottle and tried it that way but really it had no effect but a light buzz and I was dissapointed.  Returning to the living and watching TV I became incredibly bored again, I decided to try it again but this time straight from the gas can.  The first hit I took was much stronger than any of the ones before and I decided to keep trying it, I put out a lawn chair in the garage and grabbed half a bottle of soda to drain out the taste and began to take 3 quick hits and put the gas can down.  I didnt really haluciante or anything but I was pretty out of it and feeling good.  I continued for a couple minutes or so and than went to bed.  I decided that night before I went to bed that I would never do it again, I didnt think the high was that great for what the gas did to the brain.  <br><br>
Although I made that promise to myself the next night when I became bored again I found myself sneaking back into the garage to try it again.  Once again I sat in the lawn chair this time with a large glass of water.  The first hit I took was great and I began flying.  I took anothing hit and than waited till I began peaking and took another hit, when I peaked higher I took another hit and conitued like that.  I was flying I had no sence of where I was at and all I could think was that something was pounding my heard into my shoulders but I loved the feeling and the small garage seemed like the whole world and I was one out of the four elements within it.  <br><br>
I remember trying to talk sence into myself saying this isnt the whole world, the world is much bigger but every time I peaked I entered that small world again.  The phone began to ring and it was my g/f, I told her that I couldnt talk but she could tell something was weird although she still let me go, her voice echoed madly.  After I hung up I decided I wanted to take some hits and when I peaked walk back into the house,  I did and I stumbled back into the house laughing at how odd everything was.  As soon as I reached my room I collapsed to the bed and my pants fell but I didnt really care, after laying for a few moments I began to feel extreamly nautious.  I ran to the bathroom and pucked my guts out, I washed my face off and walked back into my room and beggining to get a headache I tried to fall asleep intill I finally did.  <br><br>
The last thing before that I remember doing was taking to excedrin for the headache that seemed sure to come.  I suppose they worked because when I woke up I didnt have a migrane but everything tasted like gas.  I getting a huge bag of weed and staying the fuck away from gas now, but I have to admit it was the greatest trip ive ever had.<!-- End Body -->
