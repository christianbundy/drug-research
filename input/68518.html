I was lucky enough to be able to purchase a 40 mg Opana ER and had never used this specific chemical. At the time I was just begining to take opioids and devolop and small tolerance. I got it for a mere 60 bucks and shared a bump with my friend, who had a small amount of alcohol prior to the experience.<br><br>
After measuring a equal amount for both of us, We insufflated the substance. It took about 1 hour for the effects to truly peak, and were 5 hours of complete bliss. It was much stronger than any white heroin I've had and much more deep. I paced around the room nervously it became overwhelming at times, occasionally waking my friend who went in and out of the land of nod, most likely because of the booze. I soon became very relaxed and my body was in pure exctasy, warm and fuzzy with a feeling I like to call 'Comfortably Numb', meaning in a perfect state of tranquillity. It had almost a roll type feel to it, except instead of hyper and full of energy and empathy, I felt the previously described states.<br><br>
All and all, it felt very different from oxycontin and heroin and any other opioid really, except fentanyl and diluadid, of which it shared some very strong effects and similarities. I would love to have this again. One of my favorites, hands down.<!-- End Body -->
