 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHigh, well unfortunately not at the moment.\r\nI am in the military so I am looking for legal ways to get stoned and I'm testing such things as Salvia divinorium and Morning Glory and I came across a wierd experience. \r\nThis is really weird, or maybe I'm just highly affected by drugs easily. But I smoked like two or three bowls of White Sage from a smudge stick I got from a medicine woman (She told me that if I mixed equal amounts of weed/sage/knick knick that I would pass a piss test, I have since stopped rolling the dice) and I had this really strange feeling of extreme relaxation, I couldn't define it as being stoned but it definitely felt like being high. I am or was a serious stoner, so I know the feeling really well. \r\nI felt really good for 1-3 hours followed by a mild stomach ache and some diarrhea and a very slight headache, these other symptoms don't last long, the medicine woman says it's pretty healthy.\n\n\n"
