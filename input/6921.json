 "report": "<p>\nFeeling disconnected from the hipper segments of society (those with fun drugs) I resorted to something I read in 'Legal Highs'. I mixed dried catnip (from Target) with some cigarette tobacco from a Winston light, about equal amount of each.  I smoked it in a bong with a big glass bowl (one I intend to smoke Salvia divinorum in).  The effects were almost immediate.  A kind of marajuana feeling came on, but it was not relaxed and smooth as marajuana usually is.  It had a definate tense edge to it.  Not really pleasent.  The effect doesn't last long like marijuana.  </p><p>I felt nauseated for about ten hours after the initial 'high' and also felt a little 'off' the next day.  The nausea might have come from the cigarette tobacco.  I don't smoke, so it could be the nicotine (which I have never found pleasant) that caused the nausea. Either way I suggest you leave catnip to the cats.  You could do much better with a few beers.</p>"
