I'm submitting this experience to try and help clear up the issue about DXM showing up as a false positive for pcp or opiates. My friends and I got 3 5oz bottles of delsym around 9:00pm which contains 30mg of dxm in a teaspoon. I shared mine with a friend who was already tripping and another friend gave me some of his since he didn't want the whole 5oz. so I'm not sure exactly how much I drank but it was probably around 3oz. I had enough of the syrup to trip.<br><br>
Two days later my color was pulled for a drug test. I came in after school around 4:00pm. They give me a urine analysis 8 screen. My eyes were still slightly dilated while I was there. They told me it takes a few days for the results. So a few days later after my chemical dependency class (ha ha) was over, I got a copy of my transcript which said I was negative or clean for every test since I started. But keep in mind everybody is different, metabolism etc. I'm a little on the skinny side.<!-- End Body -->
