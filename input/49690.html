About a week ago i discoverd a variety of legal drugs. First i bought some fly agaric mushrooms. After they came in and i ate about 7g and i have to say i was very dissapointed, it just gave me a small body high similar to what a small amount of hash would give me so i decided to sell the rest of my stash to the dumbasses around town for like $20.00 a bag. <br><br>
Then an old hippie friend of mine said something about how nothing is as trippy as 5MEO-DMT. I did a lot of research on this drug and then acquired some. inside the envelope was a small zip lock bag labeled 5MEO-DMT and it had a small amount of yellowish crystal/powder in it. immediately after its arrival me and the son of the old hippie dude went to another friends apartment to test it out. I went first since it was mine and i put a very small amount on some tin foil and smoked it like dope. It broke down into a liquid like meth does also, but the first hit just made me feel kind of weird and my heart started beating fast. <br><br>
Then i started to think this shit might be bunk just like the shrooms so i put what looked about like 1/10 of what i had left on the tin foil. I smoked this just like i did before and as i inhaled the smoke i was already feeling fuzzy and everything was distorted. i held in the hit for about 20-25 seconds and upon exhaling i was tripping so hard i didnt even know what tripping was any more. My sitters said that when i exhaled my eyes got glossy and crossed and i fell back onto the couch. i had no idea what was going on or even what i was. <br><br>
The best way i can describe it is that my entire universe was compressed into an infinatly small piece of matter and suddenly it exploded like the big bang or something. I was the universe, I was everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing all at the same time. The trip must have lasted for at least an hour in my head but when i came to and knew what was going on only 4 or 5 minutes had passed. After i came to i was still tripping for a good 30-45 minutes. This sounds like it would be a scary trip but when I am that fucked up I dont even know what fear is. <br><br>
All in all i think this is a very fun drug. <br><br>
