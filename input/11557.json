 "report": "<p>\nAfter several years of reading about Amanitas, I thought it was time to give a very low dose a try.</p><p>T+0 : 500mg of dried A. muscaria collected on the Mendocino coast of northern California 12 months prior, stored as very dry crisps in a glass jar.  Boiling water poured over the chopped wafer of mushrooms and a small amount of lime added to acidify.  Let steep for 10 mins, drank liquid.</p><p>T + 30: Not surprisingly, no effects felt.  My partner decides to try to smoke some of the material so I join her.  Betweeen the two of us, over the next 40 minutes, we smoke 350mg of the mushroom through a dry bong.  The mushroom materials smokes profusely but the smoke is not as harsh as an equivalent amount of smoke from cannabis or psilocybe mushrooms we've</p><p>tried.</p><p>T+ 45: Initially there seems like there might be some sort of buzz beginning, but it quickly faded and it was clear that it was just the effect of smoking and not any real Amanita effect.</p><p>I stayed awake until about T+3 hours and found myself with just an extremely slight feeling of alteration, but one that is attributeable to smoking anything and being tired.</p><p>I suspect my next experiment will be with 2-4gram dose of tea to seek the threshold.</p>"
