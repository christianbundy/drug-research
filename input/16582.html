T+ 0 minutes: I placed the amount of 37mgs under my tongue, being careful not to spill any. A burning sensation followed, and what I can describe as something akin to an intense insect bite. I could literally feel this chemical penetrating the tender tissue under my tongue and absorbing itself into my skin.<br><br>
T+ ~20 minutes: Something real is happening. This can no longer by psychosomatic. I am falling into a not so clear-headed tryptamine space. I feel oddly disassociated yet still fully aware of what was happening to my body and brain. The best I can describe this point is merely the few seconds before a smoked 5-meO-DMT experience hits stretched out. I knew what was coming.<br><br>
T+ ~30 minutes: I am definitely up on this drug now. Very clear, bright, colorful 5-meO-DMT visuals. Theres no mistaking these visuals, geometric patterning, etc. I make a few notes that this does not seem nearly as intense as smoked of insufflated route of administration of this drug. Im very much peaking, but lacking the sheer terror and panic that sometimes washes over you in the midst of a smoked 5-meO-DMT experience. A few other notes that I scrawled out complaining of the taste which I could in no way wash out of my mouth during the experience. It was nagging me and poking at me. Uncomfortable. <br><br>
T+ ~45 minutes: I zoned completely out staring at the ceiling of the room I was sitting in. The visuals are beautiful, as always with 5-meO-DMT and I am once again drawn into their incredibly detailed web. They seem much more calmer and subtler though than smoked 5-meO-DMT. Less depth. <br><br>
T+ ~110 minutes: Thats it. Im coming down for sure now. The visuals are waning, the small body load that I was carrying is disappearing. This is nice though. Overall, its a lot more calm and sedate than any other route of administration that Ive tried. With other routes of ingestion, the comedown seems abrupt and final; this is coming in waves, like layers peeling off. Very subtle and something I feel I could learn to appreciate more as I understand this route better.<br><br><br>
I would also like to make the comment here, that I have a seemingly (in comparison to others accounts) high tolerance to pain from drug administration. I was not as bothered as some were from 5-meO-DMT insufflations, etc. But even this was almost too much for me. Unless I could find someway around the intense pain that goes along with sublingual absorption (perhaps a local numbing agent could be put to use here) I dont know if I would be too eager to repeat.<!-- End Body -->
