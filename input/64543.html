I just developed the most remarkable way to make opium today, it involves no chemicals except h2o and a little heat.<br><br>
First you take the entire papaver somniferum plant, roots and all, rinse off the dirt, strip any dead leaves and then throw as much as you can into a blender with as little water as possible to get it pureed. Once made into a pulp you can filter, I ended up just finding a thin apron,and placing it into a stainless steel sautee pan. Squeeze all the water out of the pulp that you can, discard the fibers, and start to boil off all the water from your resulting green fluid.<br><br>
As it boils remember to skim the foam that forms in the middle, that is a useless byproduct of plant matter with no alkaloids, compost it or throw it away. Eventually it will start to reduce and reduce and reduce, once the scums thrown away it becomes darker and browner. It will now start to dry on the sides don't worry you can scrape it off after.<br><br>
Once its down to just bubbles on the bottom, you can turn off the heat and let it cool. You now have the blackest tar you can smoke, but remember to make sure to scrape the pan thoroughly, theres a lot leftover on the sides and bottom. Well have fun, I sure did, off of about 40 small plants and two boilings, I have about the size of a golf ball drying on some waxed paper.<!-- End Body -->
