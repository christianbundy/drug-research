 "report": "</p>\nI just wanted to write about my bad experience with Kratom extract. I have been enjoying this substance for about the last year, purchasing about 40 grams at a time from e-bay. Two weeks ago, my order arrived as a controlled delivery courtesy my local drug taskforce. They claimed that they had tested the substance and it came up positive on a field heroin testkit. So they figured, it was 'black-tar heroin'. They searched my house, seized my computers, I hired an attorney, I still don't know how this will end. </p><p>Kratom isn't controlled, but you can sure be hassled. My advice, and what I plan on doing from now on is to extract my own. You might just save yourself a LOT of trouble.</p><p>1oz dried Kratom leaf</p><p>-Grind to fine powder in coffee grinder</p><p>-Add powder to 1 liter of water and boil slowly until about half of the water is evaporated</p><p>-strain the powder and set aside the water. Add the powder to a fresh liter of water and boil slowly until about half of the water is evaporated.</p><p>-Strain and discard the powder, combine the water and boil down to about 100ml. Boil further if you desire a tarry extract.</p>"
