I bought this peyote powder for $20 for '2 doses'. I wasnt really educated but I figured it was a one-time deal, so I bought it. Waiting for a good time to do it is hard when youre young, so when we had a weekday off of school I knew it was the right time. I gave the friend that held the peyote half for helping me out. <br><br>
So this stuff was fine grain powder, a greenish color with red, brown and orange speckles. I mixed it in with a milkshake and was off. First drink, horrible, made me want to throw it out and just stay sober. But I fought through and in 10 minutes, the green milkshake was gone. So now it was time to wait the time was about 7:15. After my friend finished his, we headed up to his brothers room to chill.<br><br>
At 7:45 I vomited my guts out. But then I felt better. This is when the trip began. My friends brother had this mushroom poster and it was tripping me to death. Peyote doesnt really make me out of control or dumber, but more or less simply different. I was looking a everything different. Well then I took a few hits off a bong and went into a dream world. It was really fun, listening to the doors and chilling, looking at colors and patterns were the funnest.<br><br>
Peyote was a great experience but it wasnt what I predicted, I thought I was going to be in a dream world, with floating colors and magic, but I was just seeing very little and felt like it was impossible to move. My body tingled the whole time.<!-- End Body -->
