A friend of mine is an RC vendor, and was kind enough to send me some samples, including the 4-MEC which is the subject of this report.<br><br>
I started with a small bump, maybe 40mg. This produced a stimulant effect, which I would liken to low dose amphetamine. <br><br>
I found myself coming down within an hour, so decided to redose. Again, not a large amount maybe 50mg. <br><br>
Definite euphoria, motivation, energy, and appreciation for music. At this point, still most reminiscent of amphetamine.<br><br>
I did a handful of key bumps which maintained the experience.<br><br>
After 3 or 4 hours, I decided to try a full line. I insufflated (probably) around 150mg.<br><br>
At higher dose levels, the serotogenic activity of the drug becomes MUCH more pronounced. I am a very experienced user of MDMA, so these effects were easy for me to identify. I felt cognitively foggy, and physically floaty. The euphoria, however, was not on par with MDMA, but still enjoyable.<br><br>
The bumps and lines continued for about a total of 10 hours. When it was all said and done, I had consumed the whole gram of 4-MEC.<br><br>
I ended up having drinks with some friends and smoking weed. The latter of which induced sleep, and I slept a full 8 hours.<br><br>
The experience itself was enjoyable, but not particularly noteworthy.<br><br>
What is noteworthy is how incredibly awful I feel the next day as I am writing this.<br><br>
The hangover is worse than taking a large amount of MDA. It feels like my brain hurts, and I am slightly nauseous. I feel sluggish and unmotivated. If I didnt have work, I would definitely be laying in bed, or trying to find some landing gear.<br><br>
I have used A LOT of drugs in my time, and this is definitely amongst the worst hangover/day after experiences I have had. <br><br>
I hope anyone reading this will use caution when taking 4-MEC and keep the total dosage low for your first experience.<br><br>
I suspect the neurotoxicity of this compound would be high if research were performed.<!-- End Body -->
