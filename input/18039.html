I've been given Neurontin for a few months now, for anxiety. It's not marketed for it, but apparently a lot of people taking it for their mood and whatever else they had noticed they felt less anxious.<br><br>
Well, at 1000mg at once, I can say I felt pretty hazy. I'd definitely up the dose gradually before taking higher doses.<br><br>
Today I took 2400mg at once. It's okay for 3600/day, but that assumes you spread it over three times in the day. Oh well, it's nicer to work at once. <br><br>
After two hours, all of a sudden it kicked in. A sensation is felt in my brain that lets me know it kicked in. I couldn't describe it except to say it's a soothing sensation in my head. Everything's very calm and relax.<br><br>
Blood flow seems to feel different, especially my brain. It causes my blood vessels to contract and expand occasionally, which is odd but considered normal.<br><br>
My thoughts seem slower, and a foggy haze seems to go through my head. It's best to take a little less than whatever dose this does to you at. Next time I'll take 1600.<br><br>
I'm social on it, even though I might appear slow. I can definitely pull off appearing 'sober' from it.<br><br>
I use this a lot to sleep when I am coming off Adderall all-nighters and need to re-teach my body what sleep is. The only problem with it is that it takes 2-3 hours to kick in and leaves after 5-6 hours. Besides that and a brain fog, it is a very soothing drug.<!-- End Body -->
