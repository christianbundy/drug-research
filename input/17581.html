I found myself in a situation where I had the opportunity to imbibe 10-15mg of 5-MeO-DiPT. At the time I didn't even know it existed and I'm the kind of person that would do anything put on the table. So I popped the pill and started to feel a buzz and increased energy about 30 minutes later. Within the next hour my mind had completely left my body. I had traveled into a picture of Radioheads album cover of Kid A. I was seeing things in a very different light.<br><br>
Absolutely incredible stimulation, almost felt like my brain was being cooked and melting out of the back of my head and running down my back. And when I would touch the back of my head to prevent this from happening. Id look at my hand and it would have blood on it. This was all of course an hallucination. So later I tried to sleep, but I could barely close my eyes so I got up again, and went for a walk hoping to expend some of this energy. That did not happen, it almost gave me more energy in a way. <br><br>
So now I come back...and I'm listening to Queens of the Stone Age. And I'm tripping so god damned hard I keep responding to questions that are being asked by my friend who lives a thousand miles from where I do. And I would occasionally turn around to ask him what he said..and he'd be explaining what he said and then I'd realise that he wasn't even there. I even started smoking a cigar that he passed to me. I hadn't any cigars prior to taking the foxy. And I hadn't any money at the time to buy any. But nevertheless I had a 'Black &amp; Mild' cigar in the ashtray the next day. Sleeping was not an option. I stayed up the whole night and still had enough energy for the next day. I've done it once since and the experience was basically the same. But I loved it.<!-- End Body -->
