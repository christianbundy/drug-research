First off Im very educated when it comes to RCs, meaning I've done my fair share of research with many research chemicals over the last 10 years. <br><br>
Ive recently come across a sample of 2C-D and have experimented a few times with it at doses from 15-50mgs.I have found 50mgs to be about as much as I want to take. At this level the visuals are nice and the headspace is great and the comedown is very gentle .2C-D tends to be a very forgiving phenethylamine. This night I was thinking about taking a decent dose of some 'cut' 4-FA and later mixing a little 2C-D with it to make it worth my while.  The setting was me, by myself, chillin at home. I had been waiting for this occasion for a week so I was pretty excited to say the least.<br><br>
4:30pm , I swallowed 180mgs 4-FA in a capsule.<br><br>
4:45pm ,I cleaned up a little and ate a little chicken just to have something on my stomach because I knew I wouldnt be hungry till the next day.<br><br>
5:45pm Im feeling good, mild amphetamine mood lift, but also very calm. I threw on some shpongle and got online for an hour or so.<br><br>
7:30pm  I feel the 4-FA ,but its pretty weak...the supplier had started issuing refunds to customers that bought it because it was found to be cut with table salt. <br><br>
8:15pm I decided to get the 2C-D ready. I planned to take 40mgs oral but I weighed out 20mgs and decided on a whim to just snort it.<br><br>
8:30pm I snorted the 2C-D...it burned bad but not as bad as meth would. In less than a minute my vision started to wiggle and I felt the psychedelic effects begin.<br><br>
8:32pm  the effects rushed up on me like a psychedelic freight train!!I ran to the sink because I started to heave. The world around me started to spin and all I could do was hold on. Sweat started to pour down my face and I began to vomit. I made my way to the bathroom to try to puke everything and be in a place where I could make a mess if need be. Within 5 minutes I was completely peaking. <br><br>
My ego was destroyed! Visuals so intense the only thing I can compare them to would be 50mgs smoked DMT. The world around me was moving in frames and I could see everything down to an atomic level. All I could do was hold on to the sink and vomit, sweat, vomit, sweat, heave, vomit. It was explosive vomiting .<br><br>
Even though I was in a full blown Shulgin +3 the vomiting was slightly painful to my throat and stomach.<br><br>
10:30pm , I spent the last 2 hours vomiting in the bathroom and  trying to grasp reality. I finally started coming down enough to see the mess I had just made and it was a mess! The colors and visuals were still moving around alot but I had stopped throwing up thankfully! I grabbed some towels and started mopping up the mess. Looking back on it I should've just wiped my face ,went into the living room and tried to enjoy myself but I was just happy to be coming down.<br><br>
12:30 I spent the last 2 hours cleaning up and Im finally down from the 2C-D. I can still feel the 4-FA though. I got online to warn a few fellow psychonauts about my experience. <br><br>
2:00am  I ate a benadryl to help wind me down and went to bed. I believe I fell asleep quickly because I dont remember laying there in bed for hours.<br><br>
The next day I woke with a bad headache, took an ibuprofen and it went away. I felt pretty good the rest of the day mentally. Physically I was pretty sore though.<br><br>
This experience happened 2 days ago and my throat is still soar from the purging. It feels like I pulled a muscle in my Throat. I also have some brusies on me and dont know where or when I got them.  I've pushed the envelope many times but that was one of the most intense psychedelic experiences I've ever had. The crazy thing about this experience was that I was'nt trying to push the envelope. I was expecting alot less .<br><br>
If there would have been people around they would have freaked out at what was going on. There may have even been a 911 call placed. I was pretty calm during the experience and never freaked out. I believe the combo is what set off the 2C-D. I've snorted about 15mgs 2C-D before and it was maybe a +2 with a come-up that took about 30 minutes to peak. Nothing like this experience.<br><br>
The moral of this story is that I shouldve thought more carefully about my dose before mixing these drugs. The only thing my experience helped me do was not freak out. I knew the damage was done when I started peaking and all I could do about it was ride it out. Needless to say, the 4-FA, 2C-D combo ride is one I never want to take again! <br><br>
