 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need for blind faith when you can experience that in which you believe.<br>We were to pay the Head a visit; before departing: two of us consumed a brew, carefully prepared a few days earlier:<br>I had taken 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and crushed them, leaving them to soak in boiled water before straining the liquid through an old t-shirt  Separating the none soluble, stomach-irritating fats, from the water-soluble psychoactive amide  being LSA, the naturally occurring precursor to LSD. Shared the tea with one other person.<br>I have some experience with the seeds and was expecting to peak in about three hours, to reach a mellow plateau from which I could soak in the surroundings.<br>An effigy of Buddha meditated on the brew as it brewed.<br>After a beautiful five mile cycle along the beach, we reach Hengistbury Head. We rise to the top as the sun sets deeper, casting fantastic reds & oranges into our atmosphere. <br>The third member of our group ingests roughly 80mg of MDMA.<br>In a place like the Head you could experience euphoria without ever adding extra chemicals to the swirling pool already you. We decide not to without ever making the decision<br>One moment rolls on, before our eyes the intense beauty of day morphs to a beauty more subtle.<br>In the moment.<br>We lie a top the Head, a mellow plateau, sitting one hundred and eighteen feet above sea level<br>Upside down, near the edge and all I can see is Sea,<br>And Sky!<br>And the curve of the Earth!!<br>In the moment.<br>The sky darkens, the wind chills<br>We cover ourselves in a blanket plenty big enough for three.<br>In the moment.<br>The curtains are drawn back and we are allowed to gaze upon the greatest show on Earth,<br>The Universe<br>We look out from a point.<br>We travel.<br>In the moment.<br>Three highs become one, then many.<br>I lose myself in the stars, the longer I gaze upon them  the more I see.<br>The only times I slip back from ecstasy are the times I tell myself:<br>Its happening<br>Response:<br>I dont need to know thanks, Im already there.<br>Sitting here, writing this <br>I am confronted by a memory in a different category to those recalling everyday experience. A memory less focused on what happened, more on what I felt. A memory that is crystal clear but open to suggestion, a living memory that I know still has the power to teach me<br>I felt what happened,<br>It felt a bit like this<br>LOVE<br>Im unreasonably happy.<br>Im filled with the most intense Love I have ever felt.<br>Mad, directionless Love that flows out of me as it flows in:<br>It blows through me as the wind blows over<br>And I have a feeling that, like the wind, its movement is circular.<br>As I lose consciousness of my body, I too become Love<br>And I move with it.<br>Having experienced such Love, and all it inspires. I cannot doubt that God exists,<br>For I have known God in his purest manifestation, God as Love: <br>And so I realise that God is Love, the very same force <br>That which inspires creation.<br>That which creates creation!<br>The Human experience of LoveGod, known to lie behind the words of the term Mystical experience, is both old & new, eternal & transient:<br>It is a fountain that human beings have been swimming in and drinking of as long as we have been apart  And we have always been a part<br>LoveGod:<br>The illicit truth of every Religion.<br>A muse that inspires the whole Human race.<br>The source of all existence  <br>As simultaneously spiritual and material beings, not only is our Consciousness born from it, Our Body as well.<br>My hand is inexorably linked to thoughts of my hand. <br>He is an expression of my consciousness, of its will to reach out<br>To Touch.<br>One cannot exist without the Other because: One and the Other are One and the same. <br>LoveGod is a paradox, being every word we utter and the gaps in between  <br>Explained equally inadequately by Good & Evil, Negative & Positive,<br>Simultaneously both and neither <br>It is being in the same moment as becoming, it never began and it still hasnt ended<br>And so we find The Human Condition:<br>I grow within<br>And on this strange world:<br>An impossible tapestry,<br>They try to unfurl.<br>Without knowing what to ask,<br>They question each thread:<br>Does it start when Im born?<br>Does it end when Im dead?<br>I grow within<br>And on this strange land:<br>An impossible tapestry,<br>Woven of its own hand.<br>Dont search for the answer,<br>For the answer will come.<br>Stand back far enough:<br>Two merge into One.<br>And so we find the Human race:<br>In our relentless search for the answer (which is so ridiculously simple no-one stands a chance of comprehending it) we have neglected the beauty of all that provokes question.<br>And so we find ourselves<br>There is nothing as perfect for now as the ecstasy of the infinite question:<br>The eternal involvement of self with other; finding out without asking a thing.<br>A passive exchange of energies, of information <br>If we concentrate on pursuing the answer, as opposed to cultivating a passive acceptance of the fact that the answer is immanent, we do ourselves no favours<br>First: We miss out on the ecstasy of the infinite question, in other words <br>We do not gain full enjoyment from our involvement with the outside and the inside worlds;<br>This involvement is to be marvelled at, celebrated, cherished and explored<br>Second: As we dream of the most sacred thing, we neglect the fact that everything is sacred.<br>This, combined with an unawareness of the inter-connectedness of all things, has contributed to the widespread destruction of our Mother Earth, Gaia:<br>She is our Garden yet we trample her plants and slaughter her animals, we suffocate her skin with a layer of concrete, pollute the air she breathes and the water she drinks with our foul concoctions<br>She is our Garden, the tree is our life  and we still forbid our children free run of her fruits<br>How I yearn for free run of her fruits<br>The Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I consumed belong to a family of Gaias fruits termed Entheogen meaning God Within:<br>Many Entheogens having been helping Human beings find LoveGod since we first looked outside of meat for food. They are gifts <br>First from God,<br>Then from Our Planet.<br>There is nothing less human about looking to nature for Mind food than there is about looking to nature for Body food <br>Yet the former lies well behind in the acceptance stakes  At least in so far as many Societies, with their Governments and Religions, are concerned.<br>*  *  *  *  *<br>The drugs had worn off.<br>We emerged from the woods, into which we had retreated after our Mystical experience a top the cliff, and lay once more under the blanket.<br>The sound of the Sea, its partner the wind thankfully absent, soothed us to sleep.<br>I awoke cold & damp but energised & joyous.<br>Climbing back up the Head in order to reach the warming rays of the morning Sun, I was sent two messages  arriving as thoughts<br>The first, from God, said:<br>No-one dies.<br>The second, from Our Planet, said:<br>Its not too late.<br>copyright.
