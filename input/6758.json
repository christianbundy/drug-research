 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThere is no need for blind faith when you can experience that in which you believe.\r\nWe were to pay the Head a visit; before departing: two of us consumed a brew, carefully prepared a few days earlier:\r\nI had taken 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and crushed them, leaving them to soak in boiled water before straining the liquid through an old t-shirt  Separating the none soluble, stomach-irritating fats, from the water-soluble psychoactive amide  being LSA, the naturally occurring precursor to LSD. Shared the tea with one other person.\r\nI have some experience with the seeds and was expecting to peak in about three hours, to reach a mellow plateau from which I could soak in the surroundings.\r\nAn effigy of Buddha meditated on the brew as it brewed.\r\nAfter a beautiful five mile cycle along the beach, we reach Hengistbury Head. We rise to the top as the sun sets deeper, casting fantastic reds & oranges into our atmosphere. \r\nThe third member of our group ingests roughly 80mg of MDMA.\r\nIn a place like the Head you could experience euphoria without ever adding extra chemicals to the swirling pool already you. We decide not to without ever making the decision\r\nOne moment rolls on, before our eyes the intense beauty of day morphs to a beauty more subtle.\r\nIn the moment.\r\nWe lie a top the Head, a mellow plateau, sitting one hundred and eighteen feet above sea level\r\nUpside down, near the edge and all I can see is Sea,\r\nAnd Sky!\r\nAnd the curve of the Earth!!\r\nIn the moment.\r\nThe sky darkens, the wind chills\r\nWe cover ourselves in a blanket plenty big enough for three.\r\nIn the moment.\r\nThe curtains are drawn back and we are allowed to gaze upon the greatest show on Earth,\r\nThe Universe\r\nWe look out from a point.\r\nWe travel.\r\nIn the moment.\r\nThree highs become one, then many.\r\nI lose myself in the stars, the longer I gaze upon them  the more I see.\r\nThe only times I slip back from ecstasy are the times I tell myself:\r\nIts happening\r\nResponse:\r\nI dont need to know thanks, Im already there.\r\nSitting here, writing this \r\nI am confronted by a memory in a different category to those recalling everyday experience. A memory less focused on what happened, more on what I felt. A memory that is crystal clear but open to suggestion, a living memory that I know still has the power to teach me\r\nI felt what happened,\r\nIt felt a bit like this\r\nLOVE\r\nIm unreasonably happy.\r\nIm filled with the most intense Love I have ever felt.\r\nMad, directionless Love that flows out of me as it flows in:\r\nIt blows through me as the wind blows over\r\nAnd I have a feeling that, like the wind, its movement is circular.\r\nAs I lose consciousness of my body, I too become Love\r\nAnd I move with it.\r\nHaving experienced such Love, and all it inspires. I cannot doubt that God exists,\r\nFor I have known God in his purest manifestation, God as Love: \r\nAnd so I realise that God is Love, the very same force \r\nThat which inspires creation.\r\nThat which creates creation!\r\nThe Human experience of LoveGod, known to lie behind the words of the term Mystical experience, is both old & new, eternal & transient:\r\nIt is a fountain that human beings have been swimming in and drinking of as long as we have been apart  And we have always been a part\r\nLoveGod:\r\nThe illicit truth of every Religion.\r\nA muse that inspires the whole Human race.\r\nThe source of all existence  \r\nAs simultaneously spiritual and material beings, not only is our Consciousness born from it, Our Body as well.\r\nMy hand is inexorably linked to thoughts of my hand. \r\nHe is an expression of my consciousness, of its will to reach out\r\nTo Touch.\r\nOne cannot exist without the Other because: One and the Other are One and the same. \r\nLoveGod is a paradox, being every word we utter and the gaps in between  \r\nExplained equally inadequately by Good & Evil, Negative & Positive,\r\nSimultaneously both and neither \r\nIt is being in the same moment as becoming, it never began and it still hasnt ended\r\nAnd so we find The Human Condition:\r\nI grow within\r\nAnd on this strange world:\r\nAn impossible tapestry,\r\nThey try to unfurl.\r\nWithout knowing what to ask,\r\nThey question each thread:\r\nDoes it start when Im born?\r\nDoes it end when Im dead?\r\nI grow within\r\nAnd on this strange land:\r\nAn impossible tapestry,\r\nWoven of its own hand.\r\nDont search for the answer,\r\nFor the answer will come.\r\nStand back far enough:\r\nTwo merge into One.\r\nAnd so we find the Human race:\r\nIn our relentless search for the answer (which is so ridiculously simple no-one stands a chance of comprehending it) we have neglected the beauty of all that provokes question.\r\nAnd so we find ourselves\r\nThere is nothing as perfect for now as the ecstasy of the infinite question:\r\nThe eternal involvement of self with other; finding out without asking a thing.\r\nA passive exchange of energies, of information \r\nIf we concentrate on pursuing the answer, as opposed to cultivating a passive acceptance of the fact that the answer is immanent, we do ourselves no favours\r\nFirst: We miss out on the ecstasy of the infinite question, in other words \r\nWe do not gain full enjoyment from our involvement with the outside and the inside worlds;\r\nThis involvement is to be marvelled at, celebrated, cherished and explored\r\nSecond: As we dream of the most sacred thing, we neglect the fact that everything is sacred.\r\nThis, combined with an unawareness of the inter-connectedness of all things, has contributed to the widespread destruction of our Mother Earth, Gaia:\r\nShe is our Garden yet we trample her plants and slaughter her animals, we suffocate her skin with a layer of concrete, pollute the air she breathes and the water she drinks with our foul concoctions\r\nShe is our Garden, the tree is our life  and we still forbid our children free run of her fruits\r\nHow I yearn for free run of her fruits\r\nThe Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I consumed belong to a family of Gaias fruits termed Entheogen meaning God Within:\r\nMany Entheogens having been helping Human beings find LoveGod since we first looked outside of meat for food. They are gifts \r\nFirst from God,\r\nThen from Our Planet.\r\nThere is nothing less human about looking to nature for Mind food than there is about looking to nature for Body food \r\nYet the former lies well behind in the acceptance stakes  At least in so far as many Societies, with their Governments and Religions, are concerned.\r\n*  *  *  *  *\r\nThe drugs had worn off.\r\nWe emerged from the woods, into which we had retreated after our Mystical experience a top the cliff, and lay once more under the blanket.\r\nThe sound of the Sea, its partner the wind thankfully absent, soothed us to sleep.\r\nI awoke cold & damp but energised & joyous.\r\nClimbing back up the Head in order to reach the warming rays of the morning Sun, I was sent two messages  arriving as thoughts\r\nThe first, from God, said:\r\nNo-one dies.\r\nThe second, from Our Planet, said:\r\nIts not too late.\r\ncopyright.
