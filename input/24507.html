I was recently put on probation because of drug use and was looking for something to get me high and that would get out of my system with in a week. I dosed up at 9:30 and felt the effects at about 10:40. 300 mg is a heavy dose but since I consider myself pretty immune to analgesics. <br><br>
I pop 8 of these things with 37.5 mg each in them, the brand was Ultracet. I obtained these through my friend whose mom works at a Doctor's office and she had stole about 30 samples each containing two pills. She pops a lot of pain killer and is pretty cool about letting her son have some, except he has to be home when he is under the influence. <br><br>
Anyways when the effects kicked in I feel like I took about 30 mg of Hyrdrocodone. I become very itchy everywhere and my mouth is pretty dry, also my eyes fell like there sinking into my head. it was a pretty nice high. As I watch T.V. I find myself staring at one point on the T.V. instead of the whole T.V. itself. Eventually at the peak anything I tried to focus on would shake back and forth. I feel this when I take DXM so it wasnt really making me dizzy but I could see how it could make others.<br><br>
All in all the drug is pretty nice and I will be taking more in the future. I took it to see if I could use it as alternative to get high when I feel the need to alter my consciousness.<!-- End Body -->
