Well, I have been reading up on  Amanitas - A. muscaria  for a while. Finally ordered an ounce. I have taken Acid, never shrooms of any sort. So I ordered an ounce of 'grade a' I had a friend come over that is very familiar with regular shrooms that you pick off manure. He made the tea.<br><br>
Here is the timeline.<br><br>
7:30pm he let the water boil. Soon as is began to boil he cut the temp. back until it was no longer boiling and dropped in the shrooms.<br><br>
7:45 we smoke a few bowls of salvia 5x extract. Felt the regular weighed down for a few minutes. put me ina  better mood for the rest of the nite<br><br>
8:00pm We decided to drink it. I ate the 2 smaller caps and the one larger cap. he at a med cap. and we share the drink<br><br>
8:15 we finished our drink. It didnt taste that bad<br><br>
8:30 we went our seperate ways for the night. we supposed to meet up in an hour or so. <br><br>
9:00 still fell normall other than the SLIGHT effect from salvia. no so much as an effect. just in a better mood. went to Wal-Mart got some vitamin C pills and Orange Juice. Took the vitamin C pills.<br><br>
10:00 Still no nausia no NOTHING. Smoke some more salvia 5x at a friends house. <br><br>
OTher than boring you with my boring night, I will end this saying. I ended up going to sleep out of boredom. My friend felt nothing either. We are going to boil the rest of the ounce tonite. and report back. hopefully i will be able to tell you about a mind blowing trip tomorrow. Or.. I will just get some Acid and take a couple hits<!-- End Body -->
