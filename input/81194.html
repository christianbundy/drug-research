I am a 22-year old student from the UK, well versed in the majority of drugs. I have experience with depressants (my favourite being benzos), opiates, stimulants, phenyls and psychedelics (probably my all-time favourites).<br><br>
I woke up on the third day of a four-day music festival, slightly hungover and groggy from a batch of methadone I had taken the previous morning. After a brief wakeup period going through the motions of dressing, tooth brushing, etc,  I decided to finish off a batch of 2ci I had been sold the previous day. Having already dosed myself with a similar drug on the first day (a very nice experience with 2ce), I decided a slightly higher dose was necessary, though I was acutely aware of my hangover, my methadone use yesterday and the lack of food in my stomach. <br><br>
At 11am I dropped 15mg of the drug before sharing some baked beans with my group of friends (hereby referred to as friend A, a 24-year-old guy with a love of stimulants, and Friend B, a 23-year old guy with a love for depressants). I had informed my friends of what I had taken, and both were well aware of how I like my environment to be when tripping. Thus we lay down in our tent out of the strong sun, I waited to come up and my friends and I smoked some nice pot we had brought to the festival.<br><br>
After only forty minutes, I knew something was slightly wrong with my digestion - as I had expected, the methadone from the previous night had left me nastily constipated, and a backlog of food coupled with 2ce was rapidly looking to escape from any way it could. I stumbled to my feet, very stoned and more than slightly worried, as I am not used to illness on psychedelics, and hurried to the festival lavatories. Climbing inside, I was met with what wasnt exactly an unclean toilet, but unpleasant enough to start a two-minute vomiting and dry-retching marathon. Eventually I purged myself, or so I though, sufficiently, and made my way back to the tent.<br><br>
1:00 - My illness had still not abated, despite a 5mg diazepam I had taken twenty minutes earlier. Indeed, all the benzo seemed to have done was strangle my movement potential, as I only got to the tent entrance before another vomiting fit hit me. Much retching and stomach pain later, my two friends kindly and thoughtfully provided me with an anti-emetic, some more good pot and some even more comforting music.<br><br>
1:30 - The visuals are returning much as they appeared on the first day - colours are heightened and there is a sense of thickness to the air, however strange that may sound. After my purging (which felt akin to how Id imagine an ayuhuasca purging to be) the high is far more pure - my mind state is calmer, and I am beginning to feel the speedy rushes I am more used to with the phenyls.<br><br>
2:30 - I feel comfortable enough to go for a walk with my friends, and I am amazed at the influence the drug now has on not only my vision but my hearing. A lot of flanging of music, and occasional whispers that I know could never have happened. Though normally this would frighten me, the lucid high from the drug is allowing me to appreciate the stranger elements.<br><br>
3:30 - As the visuals plateau for a short while, I decide to have some ketamine with my friends. This bolsters my visuals all over again; the colours are now shifting before me and I can see the typically organic visuals spilling across my vision. The sky is a cut of beautiful multicolour, and the clouds are moving with speed (even though there were no clouds in the sky!)<br><br>
5:00 - I am feeling my peak beginning to slow slightly, and with it comes a great feeling of calm and control, an almost LSD-style humbleness overtakes me. My musical tastes again change and I decide to go for a short dance with my friends, marvelling once more at the lighting effects and all the people around my having a fantastic time.<br><br>
7:00 - Approaching baseline for visuals. As the night starts to come in, our group changes to stimulant drugs, and this is where my 2ci report should end, as the predominant feelings from hereon in are more likely down to the MDMA and ketamine we took later.<br><br>
I did not struggle to sleep that night - when we finally came down from the rest of the stimulants we were taking, a few oxazepam nicely sent me off without the slightest problem. Indeed, I would say that the glowing after-effects helped me to a nice sleep which was punctuated by very calming dreams.<br><br>
In retrospect, I would say this is not my favourite phenyl. It certainly lacks the overt visual elements of 2ce, however following my nausea, I would say it is far more controllable than 2ct2, and stronger than my last year dose of 2cb. I'll never take it on a comedown again, because purging is likely.<!-- End Body -->
