 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</p><p>I am the kind of person that is tottally against inhalents and I usually only drink or smoke weed, but there is a time in every persons life when they need some kind of substance in their system and they are unable to find one.  Thats how my night was going, I was bored out of my mind and looking for a cheap high.  I went on the net looking for what I could do and I heard about inhaling gasoline, some of the things I heard about it were amazing, the trips that people had, I was scared but my curiosity took over my common sence.  </p><p>I went in my garage and grabbed a gasoline can.  I poured it into a 2 liter bottle and tried it that way but really it had no effect but a light buzz and I was dissapointed.  Returning to the living and watching TV I became incredibly bored again, I decided to try it again but this time straight from the gas can.  The first hit I took was much stronger than any of the ones before and I decided to keep trying it, I put out a lawn chair in the garage and grabbed half a bottle of soda to drain out the taste and began to take 3 quick hits and put the gas can down.  I didnt really haluciante or anything but I was pretty out of it and feeling good.  I continued for a couple minutes or so and than went to bed.  I decided that night before I went to bed that I would never do it again, I didnt think the high was that great for what the gas did to the brain.  </p><p>Although I made that promise to myself the next night when I became bored again I found myself sneaking back into the garage to try it again.  Once again I sat in the lawn chair this time with a large glass of water.  The first hit I took was great and I began flying.  I took anothing hit and than waited till I began peaking and took another hit, when I peaked higher I took another hit and conitued like that.  I was flying I had no sence of where I was at and all I could think was that something was pounding my heard into my shoulders but I loved the feeling and the small garage seemed like the whole world and I was one out of the four elements within it.  </p><p>I remember trying to talk sence into myself saying this isnt the whole world, the world is much bigger but every time I peaked I entered that small world again.  The phone began to ring and it was my g/f, I told her that I couldnt talk but she could tell something was weird although she still let me go, her voice echoed madly.  After I hung up I decided I wanted to take some hits and when I peaked walk back into the house,  I did and I stumbled back into the house laughing at how odd everything was.  As soon as I reached my room I collapsed to the bed and my pants fell but I didnt really care, after laying for a few moments I began to feel extreamly nautious.  I ran to the bathroom and pucked my guts out, I washed my face off and walked back into my room and beggining to get a headache I tried to fall asleep intill I finally did.  </p><p>The last thing before that I remember doing was taking to excedrin for the headache that seemed sure to come.  I suppose they worked because when I woke up I didnt have a migrane but everything tasted like gas.  I getting a huge bag of weed and staying the fuck away from gas now, but I have to admit it was the greatest trip ive ever had.</p>"
