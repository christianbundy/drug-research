One night my girlfriend and I decided to take XTC. For her it was the 2nd time, I took it it like 10 times before.  we were having a very pleasant walk trough the city we lived, really feeling relaxed and happy. And then, all of a sudden we heared somebody moan in great pains. It appeared that some guy had tried to kill himself by jumping out of a window on the 2nd floor of a building onto the street. It looked like he only brooke his legs. The scen was pretty shocking. Luckily for us, some other people, neighbours I guess, were there just before us; they told us, also with horror in their eyes, to walk on, they would take care of the situation, so we did.<br><br>
Ofcourse the night was ruined for us.  But not only that, because of the XTC we were much more open, so it took us weeks to loose the sad and horrified feeling; it was like some friend had lied there on the street. Even now I get cold shivers writing this down.<br><br>
Afterwards I decided only to use XTC in safe environments; which I forgot later etc. I think we just had bad luck, but I still think it's a neglected risk of taking E, a bad experience can just became a total nightmare.<br>
Thanks for reading.<!-- End Body -->
