I have been taking St. John's for depression for 1 year now every single day without fail, and have been feeling, for the most part-'normal', going along with the flow.   But this past weekend I didn't take it to see if there would be an effect.  On Monday I dosed the usual 900mg.  Tuesday I did without again &amp; let me tell you that by Tuesday night I had completely fallen apart. I felt like I could not see outside myself &amp; all I honestly wanted to do was die. I cried uncontrollably for an hour after being set off by a small disagreement with a friend. I felt completely worthless &amp; sick.  My head was throbbing on one side &amp; my eye hurt when I went to bed.  I woke up with a sharp pain in my temple where it had hurt the night before &amp; I felt very dark inside.  Of course I ran to the cabinet to get my much needed dose that morning.<!-- End Body -->
