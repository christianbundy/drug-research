My second time taking LSD was my most visual experience, but it was also the scariest trip I've ever had.  Me and a couple of friends wanted to get really drunk before we were supposed to be in a play the next day (which I starred in).  We had a hard time finding some alcohol, but we did come across a large amount of LSD in the form of tabs.  It was about 9:00, so I said what the hell.  It would probably wear off by the time I had to be in the play.  That was a very wrong statement.  This trip lasted even through the play.<br><br>
I took one to start with, and my other friends took more than one each.  An hour passed, and nothing was occuring.  We were outside in front of a bonfire, and it started to get pretty dark out.  I started getting worried, and decided to take 2 more tabs.  In about a half an hour I started to feel the effects coming on.  A tree branch seemed 3D as it stretched toward me.  One friend put in some Marilyn Manson, and it freaked me out. I stood up feeling very dizzy and plopped down on the grass to stare at the stars.  They were spinning around in amazing patterns, and sucking me up into a spiral.  This forced me to go back to the fire.<br><br>
I started getting very scared; I don't know why, but I was.  I looked over at my friend who was staring at my face awkwardly.  His face started to decay and his skin was falling off.  I turned my head in disgust, and told him what I saw.  I looked back, and his face morphed into a werewolf, then a zombie, and a skeleton.  I told him to stop what he was doing.  He told me to be calm, and think happy thoughts.<br><br>
The whole world was spinning around me at this point.  A large tree, looming over me, bent down and pointed at me.  I got up, ran into the grove area, next to the bonfire, and saw a sea full of waving skeletons.  I started screaming like a maniac, and the other guys told me to shut up and sit down.  I calmly sat back down, and totally forgot what I just went through.  I stared back at the same friend again, and suddenly his face turned into Herman Munster from the Munsters.  I started giggling, which caused all of the fryers to laugh with me.  I knew I was still frying hard because the fire was melting into my feet, so I stood up and said that I had to try and get some sleep.<br><br>
I went into the tent, and stared up at the inside of the tent.  I saw amazing swirls of color and different colored naked women dancing all around my eyes.  They kept calling my name, but I couldn't reach them.  I closed my eyes, and saw quilt patterns of women's breasts, followed by a hopping bunny, which zoomed off into a trail of psychedelic colors.<br><br>
I knew I couldn't sleep, so I got up and sat back with the guys at the fire.  I feel that at this point (about 1:00) my peak had come and gone, but I was still frying hardcore.  From the period of 1:00-4:00, I was in a deep state of confusion, not knowing who people were, who I was, what I was doing there, and why I took the acid.<br><br>
When the morning started to make its face known, we all got up and took a walk down the street, looking at the beautiful colors coming from the flowers all around us.  I was still feeling the effects of the drug, so I started to get worried again.  When the other guys got back to the house, I ran over to my house, which is down the street, and ran into my shower.  The walls on all sides of me seemed to be melting down to my feet.  I saw faces popping up on the walls and when I waved my hand in front of me, I saw a million hands tracing off of it.  I felt a deep sense of fright while taking this shower, which caused me to cry and punch myself.<br><br>
When I got out of the shower, I quickly ran back to the house where my friends were, and realized that the shower didn't help, because I forgot where I just came from.  The time was now about 7:00, and I had to be at the play at 8:00.  I felt scared beyond control.  Everyone told me that I would be all right, if I just calm down, and not worry about it.<br><br>
We all piled into my car, and I drove down to the school.  We got out, and I felt like I had been beat up.  I couldn't look at anyone in the face, and I couldn't do the play because I forgot almost all of my lines.  My friends that were with me the night before helped me out with my lines and, lo and behold, the first showing of the play started.  I did very badly, but luckily, I wasn't the only one.  I rested during the break between shows, and told myself that I would do great on the next show.  I tried to push the bad thoughts out of my head, and the show went on.  It went very good.  After the play, I felt like throwing up, so I went to sleep in my bed, and woke up the next morning, feeling great because nothing bad went on, even though I worried too much.<!-- End Body -->
