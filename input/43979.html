The day started off just like every day.  I didnt have to go into work, so I had a couple of beers with some friends.  10pm rolls around and my friends duck out for sleep and I am left in a house all by my lonesome.  So I decide to munch on some psilocybins.  Good ones too, probably the best I have ever seen in my entire life.<br><br>
The trip started off just like every trip. Having laughed myself out by 2am I decide to hit the sack, thats when everything slid down hill.  The visuals I had were nothing short of spectacular and terrible all at the same time.  This is the first time I had ever experienced a trip like this before.  Something was way different.  It was more than visuals, it was feelings, emotions, sounds, it was everything.<br><br>
I stumbled to my room, made it to my bed.  Everything in the room was just as I had prepared it.  So I layed in my bed clutching a waterbottle for what seemed like eternity.  Visuals continued, auditory hallucinations also.  I begged for sleep, but my mind was on overdrive and sleeping was the very last thing on its list.<br><br>
2am-3am  Something that I cannot describe.  Near death.  Epiphany.  Something. Nothing.  Who knows.  Something hit me like a ton of bricks.<br><br>
3am-4am The ton of bricks feels more like a freight train now.  I make my way to the bathroom and vomit up some of the most amazing things ever.  Stuff I know I could not have ingested.  I find my waterbottle and slam down the rest of it.  I vomit again.   Being a medical student, looking in the mirror, I can tell my eyes are dilated, breathing has decreased.  Skin tone has become flushed.  By the time I think to myself wow you look like crap, BANG.  I went crashing to the floor.<br><br>
Unable to move, not unmotivated though, I wanted like hell to get off that floor.  I was perfectly conscious and alert.  I could tell I wasnt breathing too well, coughing up liquid every now and then, but I couldnt notice breathing patterns at all.  At this point, I embrace death.   In fact I had convinced myself that I had died, telling myself 'Man Im too young' and 'I cant believe this is happening'.  So I laid on the bathroom floor in a puddle of my own vomit for 2 straight hours.  Perfectly alert, but I couldnt move.  Finally, I gathered up enough strength to pull myself up to the toilet, expel any last vomit.  Chugged another waterbottle full of water.  I had done it.  I got off that floor.<br><br>
Now looking back, and writing this, I am listening to music, drinking some OJ loving every aspect of life.  Call it whatever you want to, but something happened on this ride.  Still dont know whether to classify it as a bad trip or a good trip yet, time will tell.<!-- End Body -->
