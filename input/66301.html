I had heard of Ketamine (or 'Ket' as it's known in London) only a couple of times before my experience. It was usually your average wasted story about a 14 year old believing he was a tree, or walking into lamposts and so on. As festivals around the UK started pumping the new f***it generation with free drugs, I heard more and more of this enigmatic drug, and all of the myths that came with it. These stories varied and contrasted at every corner, each more fascinating and unreal. <br><br>
I've always been an explorative character with new and adventorous ambitions, and the hype that Ketamine seemed to be brooding in 16 year old party culture was simply too much to resist. I had tried many of the popular and available drugs on the market by this time - Marijuana, Ecstacy, Mushrooms, Crystal Meth, Cocaine. 'Ket is like nothing you've done before' was a phrase that popped up incessantly among us.<br><br>
It was this true novelty surrounding the drug Ketamine that attracted me to it in the first place. I was looking for something new, original, unique, of age. Joannah of course was the vital connection that made it all happen. Before I became friends with Joannah (an experienced K-head) my knowledge of the drug, it's effects and dangers were hazy and undecisive. All I had to talk about was the excited flood of myths and exaggerations that poured forth from every teenager's mouth in the aftermath of the big, expensive music festivals hapenning throughout summer. <br><br>
After some thorough research and talks with Joannah, we purchased 2g of Ketamine on a sunny monday morning. Before 1:00pm we'd already hit the bong a fair few times, and I'd even taken some free pills in my rhapsody. The scene was perfect, slightly nippy, sun shining through the trees, a free house to crash at. The Ecstacy along with a bomb of MDMA was spawning that love and hapiness for my close friends surrounding me, heightened furthermore by the chill of the sativa herb we'd smoked in the bong beforehand. I felt confident, excited and ready to experience the new and amazing.<br><br>
After sniffing two bumps I decided to ease back and let it all out, this was the correct, if not potent dosage for a first time Joannah had told me. For 30 minutes nothing different seemed to have hapenned. I was still buzzing immensely from the amount of Ecstacy I had taken, and although in expectation of the Ketamine 'kick' I was enjoying the high as it was. It came silently and unnoticed. I remember lying on the bed chatting amiably one minute to other first-timers, then noticing lapses in the group conversation. I felt at that particular moment that each one of us was thinking along the same lines. Everybody seemed to realise simultaneously.<br><br>
What came next was more noticeable and unexpected. I lost the sensation of my body as if someone had clicked their fingers and it had expired. Every cell, capillary, muscle, bone and organ had been wiped clean off the slate. I had no muscle control, no sensation of the existence of my body, nor even the mental state to believe that in fact I might still have a body. It was as if someone had closed a shutter, pleasant although I came to realise (without fear or emotion of any sort) that I was Alice, and I was about to fall very, very deep into the rabbit hole.<br><br>
With my body safely behind me on my trip, my mind encompassed a sense of relaxed suspense - a continuous train of thought that fluidly dripped from every neurone of my brain. Not strange, or unwanted thoughts. No disturbing hallucinations, no anxiety. In fact it was as if my mind was a whiteboard, cleaned with a damp cloth from edge to edge. I was able to focus intensely upon a certain thought or memory, but never it's connected emotion. Emotion seemed to go with the lot, and I was able to percieve concepts and thoughts with a completely neutral and unaffected poise. This was interesting, I remember saying to myself. Contently cut off from the world.<br><br>
As the drug worked it's way further, the effects became more and more noticeable. I felt further and wider security, becoming a single entity - one single, seperated and highly mentally active unit away from anything and everything I knew before. It was as if my spirit had moved on, not higher, or lower, but perfectly centered, hovering in an emotionless limbo. These effects didn't heighten beyond about an hour since the high started, but stayed with me for a good 40 minutes afterwards. I remember getting up to go to the toilet, and looking down at my legs quizically trying to calculate why my legs were moving, where they were moving to and what was controlling them. I gained a little more control and felt my body creep back into the issues of my consciousness bit by bit, and by 3 hours since sniffing the powder I was relatively over the pyschoactive 'k-hole' experience, yet my entire body was still anaesthetised.<br><br>
Exploring the depths of my mind to such an extreme level, and the sense of seperation and oddity made Ketamine the roller coaster ride I had wanted and expected it to be. A little adventure of my own making, whithin the colossal construct of the human mind (and later) spirit. Christopher K-lumbus I was later dubbed when trying to explain the events over a marijuana fix. It's true, like nothing I have ever done before. I'd recommend anyone to try it at least once, simply for the pure mental expansion it has allowed me to adopt, and for the weirdness of the entire experience. It takes your body and mind, and launches them beyond the human imagination and what it is normally supposed to accept, providing an interesting and unique trip and offering perspectives I will probably have never encountered otherwise.<!-- End Body -->
