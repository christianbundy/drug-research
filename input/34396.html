I recently received about 100 Anadenanthera Colubrina seeds in the mail and I have been reading reports about smoking.  I was a little anxious to try it out so that night I put about 20 seeds in my coffe grinder, then added approximately 3 grams of wormwood herb (used only because it was leftover from a previous endeavor, not for any specific purpose) and ground them together for a minute or so.  My two friends and I were ready to experiment.<br><br>
It was a nice summer evening so we sat in my backyard with some mellow lights and candles.  I packed the first bowl in my glass pipe and put the lighter to it.  I was not surprised by the fact that it was somewhat harsh and not exactly tasty.  It was a little difficult to hold in and I coughed out my first toke after 5 seconds or so.  The bowl was burning nicely without any help from the lighter after the first puff, and halfway through my second inhalation I felt an intense tingling start at my feet and quickly flash throughout the entire surface of my skin.  It wasn't painful, but very overwhelming.  It felt identical to the initial sensation caused by smoking Salvia divinorum.  After my third toke I was overcome with nausea and had to put it down because I thought I would puke. This subsided within about 5 minutes, as the cevs kicked in and I felt very relaxed and happy, although slightly disoriented like the first stages of a mushroom trip.  Colours seemed brighter and the details of the visual world around me seemed much more pronounced.  A typical, yet indescribably unique psychedelic visual effect.<br><br>
The intensity only lasted for 15 to 20 minutes before fading into a nice and dreamy afterglow.  We smoked several more times that night and got similar effects each time.  Each bowl lasted for at least 2 peoples tokes and I had plenty left over afterwards.  Although we experienced similar feelings, they were obviously described differently by each of us and my friends claimed to have a less visual but equally enjoyable trip.  It should also be noted that although we all experienced the intense nausea, (enough to make me go to the bathroom thinking i would puke), nobody has thrown up from it in my experience.<br><br>
I have used it several times since and always enjoy it.  The smoke is unpleasant and I always get a brief pang of nausea, I have been able to hold in more tokes at a time and have reached levels of extreme intensity, bordering what has been described as a 'breakthrough', which would take too long to describe at this time.  Next time I plan to force myself to toke, regardless of whether or not I puke, and attempt to take it to the next level, although having a few small tokes to add some pretty visuals before a bowl of cannabis is also nice.<br><br>
The smoking method seems to be superiour to the reports I've read about snorting, although I have yet to really push myself with the smoked stuff just yet.  I am hesitant to use it too often though, because DMT and Bufotenine can lead to problems with frequent usage, and this shit is legal, easy to obtain and very cheap - a combination that can be dangerous if left unchecked.  Athough I certainly look forward to the many trips to come.<!-- End Body -->
