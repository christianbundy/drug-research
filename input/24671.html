What a great website this is.  I felt I just had to contribute.  My experience with Lorazepam has been a love affair of about 3 years.  Nothing bad has happened so far.  Actually, this drug has just about saved my life.  <br><br>
I first took Lorazepam after being admitted into an emergency room for panic attacks.  I wanted to check myself in, since I was feeling completely insane.  The doctor handed me a script and said, 'Try one of these pills.  If you still feel the same, come back.'  About an hour after I took 1mg of Lorazepam - I was hit by a feeling I'll never forget.  I felt a thousand pounds lighter, my chest no longer hurt, I was smiling - something I hadn't done in months.  I hadn't slept in days before that, and I immediately went to bed for 7 hours.  I also got on anti-depressants and haven't had one trip to the ER for panic since then, however I still keep a bottle of L (I call it L) in my medicine cabinet for emergencies.<br><br>
Lorazepam is the best drug I have ever tried, hands down.  I have tried pot, acid, shrooms, speed, etc.  Nothing comes close.  If I feel I've had a bad day, or badly need sleep, I put 4 .5 mg pills under my tongue (2mg total) and soon I go sleepy-bye.  I have done Lorazepam many times just for fun, as have many of my friends who constantly ask me for it when they're stressed out.  Recently, a friend and I took 2mg together after smoking some pot.  He drank two beers and was so high, he just wandered around the house saying 'Oh god, I'm so wasted.'  This is a guy who smokes pot and drinks every day, and does a lot of Valium.  He said he didn't like the Lorazepam as much as the Valium, 'It makes me feel too low.'  He said.  <br><br>
Some people have said Lorazepam is weaker than Valium, although if you took 2mg of Valium, you probably wouldn't feel much of anything.  I've never taken it, so I don't know.  Lorazepam make me feel emotionally numb (a blessing at times), very comfortable, sleepy, slightly happy, and I hear music in my head.  When I lived with my sister, she'd hear me singing, see my glassy eyes and say, 'Oh, you took your pills again, huh?'  <br><br>
Another thing I'd like to say is that this stuff is very addictive.  Getting unhooked can be absolutely horrible.  I know, I've done that about 3 times.  It's not easy.  I vowed never to take this stuff more than 1 time a week.  Sometimes I go a month or two without thinking about it.  I wouldn't recommend this to people who have a history of drug problems, but if you're suffering from panic attacks, depression, stuff like that - it's the BEST.  It also has a habit of blocking my memory.  If I'm really high on this stuff and fall asleep, I wake up wondering, 'when did I go to sleep?'  'Wow, it's morning already?'  <br><br>
It's funny stuff.  Don't drive on this stuff EVER.  Don't take it every day unless a doctor has told you to.  Don't stay hooked on it, because if you're on it every single day, you're a zombie.  Fabulous drug though.<!-- End Body -->
