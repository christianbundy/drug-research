I was sold 6 hits of what was supposed to be LSD (white on white blotter).  I went home and started drinking with some friends, and after about 7 drinks I decided I wanted to take the acid I bought.  As a note, I am a VERY experienced tripper, having tripped on many RC's, LSD, Mushrooms, and Mescaline.  I have also done LSD many times while drinking, and each time has been enjoyable.  This time would be different.<br><br>
12:00am - I dropped all 6 hits of the blotter.<br>
1:00am - The alcohol seemed to be getting stronger (I have a high tolerance, and I had stopped drinking by midnight.  This was the first sign that something wasn't right)<br>
2:00am - I completely blacked out<br>
8:00am - I came to experiencing intense visuals, a body load similar to, but stronger than 2c-x drugs<br>
12:00pm - I was still peaking, the visuals were oddly colorful.  They seemed to be part of another dimension, and did not directly interact with the real world.<br>
4:00pm - I had come down enough to function, but there were weak visuals and a strong speedy sensation<br>
10:00pm - Visuals were still present, the body load became miserable.  Sleep was impossible.<br>
12:00am - I couldn't believe it was still going.<br>
1:00am - I took a few Ativan, and finally was able to get to sleep.  I had strange dreams throughout the night, and woke up early.<br><br>
The trip was entirely not fun, and lasted over 24 hours.  I later learned from my friends that from 2:00am until I came to, I had become violent and agitated.  This came as a surprise to me, since at first I thought I took Acid.  After reading PiHKAL (and various reports on Erowid), I determined the substance in question was a DOx - more than likely DOB.  This trip destroyed my love of psychedelic chemicals, and I can't help but wonder what could motivate someone to pass off a chemical like DOB as LSD.<!-- End Body -->
