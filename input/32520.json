 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThe primary materials I use are: the tin exterior of a tea lite candle, and a rock.<br>1. Over a lit candle, I put one anadenanthera seed in the tea lite tin. I hold this tin with pliers.<br>2.  I wait for that seed to either expand in size, or pop and then put it off to the side.<br>3. Repeat for as many seeds as needed.  <br>4. After getting 3-4 expanded seeds, I carefully remove the outer shell.<br>5.  The inside should still be a yellow or off white color. I grind the yellow seeds up, until they are a fine powder.<br>6. Enjoy my Yopo.<br>With 1-2 seeds, I use it much like the Yanomamo tribe at times of hunting, as a stimulant.  One or two seeds is just enough to get me going for a short period of time, and also puts me at ease.  For me, it is like a calm jolt of energy.\n\n\n"
