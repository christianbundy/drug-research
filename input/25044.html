A few weeks ago I had picked up a 500mg supply of 5-MeO-DMT from an [unnamed] research company. I had experimented with the compound, but in extremely small doses as I had no scale to measure out small quantities. No effects were obtained through these trials.<br><br>
I have since found a scale capable of reading 0.01g, so I divided up the powder into four 160mg capsules. Then, one capsule was divided into a line and cut in half, giving two 80mg piles. These were successively cut up, to obtain a number of dose sizes: 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, and 5mg.<br><br>
A few days ago I attempted to smoke 5mg out of a tin foil spoon, although too much smoke was lost and no changes were noticed.<br><br>
Yesterday, I decided to insufflate 10mg of the powder. At first, it didn't burn much, but the burning built up and it seemed to hurt more when I would breathe out through my nose. I would say overall, the burn is bearable.<br><br>
I proceeded to lay down. At T+0:05, I felt somewhat restless and went to get something to drink. I then laid down in another room in the house, one which I usually lounge in (comfortable setting). Soon enough, I was restless again and headed back upstairs.<br><br>
Suddenly, around T+0:10, my heart rate began to increase steadily. I feared my heart would explode, because I was not exerting myself or doing anything to make my heard race, yet it was beating like crazy. This made me slightly uncomfortable.<br><br>
I continually focused on my breathing, and had this general feeling of well-being around me. No psychedelic effects were noted although a body high was definately present. A stony feel accompanied the body high - A feeling of great relaxation. Even with my heart pounding, I sat at my desk having high hopes, with each breath feeling accomplished. Nothing extraordinarily trippy.<br><br>
Soon my heart rate went down, and I calmed down. Even so, there was some sort of fire burning from within. I went outside, to relax on the deck and smoke a blunt. During this time I would say I felt slightly philosophical - I was thinking about big things such as my life, and the past and future. I felt a strong feeling of commitment to my goals and motivations.<br><br>
All of these feelings I cannot directly attribute to the 5-MeO. The things I thought about, weren't the type of thing I normally sit around contemplating, so perhaps the 5-MeO facilitated my introspection on these topics.<br><br>
I plan to try 5-MeO-DMT again, although I'm not sure how soon. I might try insufflating 20mg next time, although I'm considering just smoking 5 or 10, since the come-up is so fast. I'm wondering if the racing heart could be related to the feeling of the oncoming experience (like approaching ego loss). With a quicker onset, if this is the case, there will be no time to think about what is happening and no time to be shocked.<!-- End Body -->
