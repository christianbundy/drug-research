 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nJust acquired a prescription for generic Ambien (Zolpidem) and figured I'd give its recreational value a test after reading a couple reports.\r\n11:50 - Ingest 15mg\r\n12:07 - Things might be feeling a little slowed down.  Noticing burps, which usually for me means the pill is being absorbed.\r\n12:09 - Noticing more frequent yawns, and a little jittery all over my body.\r\n12:18 - At this point, my desk starts spinning around like the tea cups ride at Disney Land\r\n12:20 - Getting the feeling like people are around.  Starting to feel like I do on a Xanax\r\n12:22 - Very shaky and confusing.  So far, it's just like a xanax stupor.\r\n12:35 - Now I am suprisingly close to baseline in my opinion.  Going to eat other 5mg half soon.\r\n12:40 - swallowed other 5mg, making it a total of 20.  I feel like I should definitely feel a bit more than what I am.  In the beginning it was promising, but then mellowed out drastically.  If things don't get more interesting, i'll spark this spliff.\r\n1:08 - Get up walk outside and spark spliff\r\n1:20 - Give up on it and go to bed.  Actually have a bit of trouble falling asleep.\r\nAll in all, it didn't really do much for me personally.  But through research, i've found Ambien can affect everyone differently, so someone else might have a vastly different experience.\n\n\n"
