During an ongoing series of Ayahuasca Experiments I decided to use Dramamine to alleviate the typical nausea. I'm identifying Dramamine with Dimenhydrinate.<br><br>
I ingested the dramamine pill (50 mg), prepared the harmala (grinding ~3g, putting it in capsules), and ingested it too, capsule for capsule, 30 min-60 min after the experience. I experienced a quite noticeable, specific drowsiness, which I attributed to the Dramamine.<br><br>
I ingested 4 Yopo ground seeds for getting DMT effects.<br><br>
Before the DMT really kicked in, i got sick and vomited, so that what followed was rather a slight DMT trip, together with a very subtle Dramamine trip (which appeared to be much amplified). After vomiting, i chilled out on the couch and enjoyed the DMT trip, which turned out to be quite noticeable. I still felt very very drowsy, unable to get up and do meaningful stuff. I did not have pupil dilation though.<br><br>
The thing why I write this was a very different beast though.<br><br>
During chillout, I ended up in a dozy state from which I had some effects in the dozy/daydream/nap/'paver nocturnis' range, which were much more pronounced and complicated than any daydream i ever had, though. For example, I dreamed typing my trip log. a 5 pm entry. this daydream was completely authentic, and partly lucid, and I snapped out of it thinking 'wtf its only 2 pm'. Others were not as dreamy, just normal thoughts, that suddenly became visual and had a got a life on their own.<br><br>
I'd love to attribute this to the DMT, but I've never had such a dozy/daydreaming/confused state on any other tryptamine or tryptamine+MAOI setting, and I've had quite a few. When i got up and did stuff (halfway not wanting to really fall asleep, halfway pissed by the low DMT trip), I could ignore the effect completely.<br><br>
I re-dosed DMT and it turned out to be quite a pleasant trip on a wonderful day.<br><br>
I'm very glad that I had this experience. It'd be insane to do a full-blown trip on this alone, though, and still a little insane to do so with a sitter.<!-- End Body -->
