 "report": "<p>50% catnip and 50% damiana mix.</p><p>Been drinking catnip and damiana tea for a while now; using it as an alternative to the illegal substance to relieve stress and enhance meditation sessions.</p><p>Smoking will give me the sensation quicker compared as a tea, finding out that the buzz is a lot longer as a brewed tea than smoked. For me smoking is too complicated; gets smelly, wastes a lot of the herb, not well for the lungs. Brewing tea on the other hand is simple to make, tastes good, most efficient method of inducing.</p><p>The herbal tea mixture gives me a mellow pot like floating buzz without the heavy jangled paranoid edge; will numb my arms and legs a bit and lasts for 1 to 2 hours. Its not the most potent buzz to be found, results in a laid-back relaxed disposition. Kicking back and listening to really good music helps.</p><p>Found at a local spice shop the catnip less than $1(us) an ounce & damiana $2(us) per ounce. Figure for the price its a good deal besides cant go to jail for it.</p><p>Usually will do an chilled iced herbal tea with spearmint.</p>"
