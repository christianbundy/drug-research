It all started when my parents left for work and I invited a friend over. We had plans on smoking bud, but there was one problem, we didn't have any at the time. So for the time being, we looked for some good pills my parents might have. We found Oxyxodone, Paxil, Codiene, Hydrcodone, and my mom has Xanax but she took it with her. Since all the bottles were running low, we each took one paxil.<br><br>
About 20 minutes later, we decided to split one 10mg tablet by crushing it up and making a line, then split the line in half and each just snorted a pile. THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE. The burning was unbearable. I could feel my whole prain just burning away. My friend and I tried snorting water to try and help the burn, we tried everything we could to get whatever was still left in our nasal passages out. I can truly say it was one of the most painful experiences I have ever had in my life. This pain lasted for about half an hour after that it died down slowly.<br><br>
Even though I experienced much pain, the effect were very noticeable, I felt disoriented and the back of my eyes felt heavy. The effects of the paxil are very pleasant just as long as you do not snort it.<!-- End Body -->
