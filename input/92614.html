Cocaine has well-documented highly pleasurable effects that are produced by block of dopamine reuptake at synapses. I was interested in whether the reward properties of cocaine could be enhanced in combination with the dopamine precursor L-dopa. I tried a number of self-experiments with this drug combination, starting with modest amounts of cocaine (e.g., ~50 mg) and extremely small amounts of L-dopa in the form of carbidopa tablets. The precautions were necessary because L-dopa might also enhance the cardiotoxicity of cocaine.<br><br>
What I first found from multiple self-trials with various doses of cocaine followed by L-dopa was that rather than enhance cardiac effects, L-dopa was an effective post-cocaine therapy to rapidly return to a normal state. I found L-dopa could relieve feelings of anxiety and increased blood pressure. As might be expected from these observations, L-dopa used before cocaine produced significant decreases in all actions of cocaine. But when I used L-dopa in combination with cocaine, something unexpected happened. The cocaine experience may have been a little better, but not much. The interesting thing is that for about the next 5 hours after combined use of these drugs, I felt great. My mind was sharp, rational, and lucid. I was comfortable in my body - no residual sympathomimetic effects. Words flowed freely. I could express my thoughts clearly and elegantly  almost as if scripted. I was motivated to do things such as complete neglected projects.<br><br>
My general impression was that this experience was similar to the actions of an MAO inhibitor or other antidepressant. Then after about 6 hours I noticed something else. I started to see patterns in the walls and the carpet. I looked into the air and I saw millions of small particles of light zipping in all directions at unbelievably fast speeds. Then I began to see objects start to melt (slowly). Photographs became animated. People in the photographs slowly made adjustments in their hand positions. These and other hallucinations that I experienced are closely comparable to LSD. Yet unlike LSD, I had no feelings of paranoia or confusion about my experiences. I was able to rationally evaluate my mental state and note that these hallucinations were drug-induced. I did not sleep the entire night and I felt fine at morning with no need for a nap later.<!-- End Body -->
