About a week and a half ago a friend and I smoked some Salvia.  I ordered the 5X potency and my friend took 1 hit, he didn't feel it much.  So a few days later he took 3 hits and felt the effects pretty hard. Then he didn't do any drugs for a week.  So today we smoked a few bowls of good kind bud and got real stoned.  We went to go get some pizza and about 2 blocks he said had to stop cause he said he was too stoned.  <br><br>
Then we sat for a little while, and he said he had to go back home.  We started walking and he fell flat on his face and didn't break his fall at all.  He was passed out for a few seconds then tried to get up and fell again.  His eyes rolled back in his head, and he was out cold.  Then he got up real confused, talking about the dream he had, he said that all he saw was yellow and he thought he was walking into the sun.  So, we slowly walked back to the building and got in the elevator.  The elevator was pretty full and he started to trip out.  His knees gave and he fell onto this girl.  <br><br>
We finally got back and he described his feelings just like an intense Salvia trip-sweaty and very confusing.  Aside from being real stoned and having a scratch on his chin and knee, he was okay after a long nights sleep.<!-- End Body -->
