I have tried HBWR seeds before.  I can't recall from whom I made the purchase, but I think the seeds that I recieved were bunk.  I remember I ate a number of them (it was a while back) with a friend and waited for 2 hours, ate the rest of the supply with still no results for either myself or my companion.<br><br>
But this is not the tale I intended to tell<br><br>
I compulsively ordered some HBWR the other day from an online vendor. I chose to order the Tahitian variety, whether this matters is a question i can't answer.  I got over 30 seeds for $10, much better than what i paid for the bunk seeds, though my new seeds look the same as my old seeds did.  Before I begin, I must note that I have eaten acid on several (15+) occasions and mushrooms a few times, so I have a decent trip background on which to base my analysis.<br><br>
I decided against trying to extract the desired alkaloids from the seeds, as my morning glory trials were never to successful and caused me to associate the taste of the final solution with the torments of the damned.  I simply chewed and swallowed 4 seeds one by one, chewing as best I could and swallowing with chocolate milk. prior to the ingestion of the seeds I had only drunk some juice and milk, my last meal having been the night before.  My seeds were swallowed at 9:30 am.  I should note that some of the seeds I got had a thick woody furry whitish (hooray for adjectives) layer on the outside, which I assumed was the furry white nausea layer described in various places on the net.  I ate 4 seeds that did not exhibit this layer, though they did have a very very thin whitish coating on them, which appeared to wash off with water, then returned once the seeds had dried.<br><br>
Anyhow, the seeds were in my belly by 9:30.  By 9:50 I felt different, very slightly dizzy, and I thought I noticed very subtle visuals consisting of transparent color masses in my field of vision.  I also began to feel sick, it was a sickness that centered in my stomach.  I tried to wait for the sickness to go away, but ended up willing myself to vomit at around 10:15.  I threw up only once and now i think it wasn't that bad but i wasn't too happy at the time.  It did, however, seem to make me feel a little better, only I did still feel a bit sick, and now noticed that I was feeling hot and cold on and off.  I basically rode it all out and waited and felt the same, with levels of nausea varying.  At around 11:30 I decided it was time to use my all-purpose medicine, and smoked a very small amount of pot, barely enough to get high.  Strangely, it made me feel much better.  I looked up and out my window at the snow and realized that things seemed brighter than normal, which is when I realized that my trip was beginning.  <br><br>
I basically spent the whole time lying around. After this, but was completely content.  I found myself to be having a great time lying with my head on its side, looking across my bed, and generally enjoying detail in a different way than I normally do.  By 12:30 visuals were more intense.  Various intricacies were observed on surfaces like the bed spread or a sheet of lined paper, these visuals seemed to be straight out of a mild acid trip. Patterns and such were seen with open and closed eyes, always predominately green and purple in those shades which I have only observed in Acid trips and on the surface of soap bubbles.  I didn't move around a whole lot during the trip, and noticed I was uncomfortable when I did. at one point when standing up I began to feel dizzy and heard a buzzing sound vibrating through my skull.  This buzz also intensified my visuals, but all subsided once I sat down for a while.  Thought processes were definately enhanced, I found myself coming across numerous revelations which at this time still seem valid.  I found myself to be very good at manuvering words, and felt inclined to write some poetry, though I haven't ever written anything for fun before.  I found reading difficult though due to my attention span, because my thoughts were racing on in the background about what I had just read etc etc.  It is now 9:30 pm and I feel back to normal, with very subtle acid after-effects visuals noticed when I look for them.<br><br>
Over all, this would be a great trip if it hadn't been for the nausea.  After the nausea went away everything was great though, it was just what I was looking for.  I think I may up my dose by 1 or 2 seeds next time, and try to take some nausea precautions like dramamine or fasting.  The trip reminded me of a weak acid trip, but with a different sort of mind trip, it somehow felt more spritual than dose i've eaten, and I really do believe that I learned from the trip in the revelations that occured. I noticed that i kept looking at things really close for long periods of time, and that my trip was a bit more euphoric than straight acid, even after the weed wore off.  This is a good thing to try for respectful trippers, and i recomend(sp) a partner for those who have not tripped before.<!-- End Body -->
