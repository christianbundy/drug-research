 "report": "<p>I bought 10g high quality 5X extract. I had never done salvia before. I used up three whole grams with no effects at all, even though I knew the stuff was good since it sent everybody else into outer-space.</p><p>Then I tried it after having three small beers (approx. 1 liter 4% beer in total), and I finally broke on through. Used exactly the same amount, method etc. as before. People might try a little alcohol if they have trouble getting any effect from Salvia.</p>"
