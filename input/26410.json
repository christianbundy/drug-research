 "report": "</p>\nMe and my wife have chewed and swallowed seven of these seeds each on two different occasions. The first time we did not scrape off the fuzzy coating, the second time we did, as we had heard that this may make a difference to the level of toxicity. Having conducted this relatively controlled research we can say that scraping off the coating did not appear to make a significant difference. </p><p>On both occasions we began to feel a sense of anxiety and nausea shortly after taking the seeds - in short a sense of being poisoned. Though it would have been possible for us to hold them down we chose instead to purge (vomit in an exorcist-like fashion) within the first couple of hours of ingesting the seeds.</p><p>Subsequently we enjoyed the effects of the LSA without any further complications from the cyanogenic glycosides (?) in the seeds. I would say that LSA is very similiar to LSD, though possibly gentler and more unreservedly pleasant. It lasts a good ten hours on this kind of dose and seems to pass more naturally into sleep than acid.</p><p>I have found that doses as low as one seed can produce noticeable results, including both the nausea and the pleasant effects. I have never vomited on doses of one to four seeds, but without purging there is definite yet subtle background sense of being poisoned even on these low doses.</p><p>NB: Treat with caution. Have tried sub-lingual method mentioned elsewhere  with three or four seeds - still felt somewhat poisoned, though is an improvement. Proper extraction definitely worth a go as this is a very sacred substance.</p>"
