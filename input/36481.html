I found myself with these pills given to me by one of my best friends who got them from someone else.  The first time I took one was about 2 months ago. I took one 10 mg pill and waited.  I didn't feel anything for about a hour.  I then started to get tingly and floaty.  I felt really happy inside.  One of the best feelings.  I felt like this the whole night until I went to sleep around 3 or 4. This pill does not get me high.  But overall it makes a good feeling inside.  I don't take them often but it is definately a mood lifter.  I will enjoy music and my surroundings more than ever.  I have also found the pills really good to take after a night of rolling.  The next day after I wake up and feel really down or tired.  I just take one and it helps with the day after.<!-- End Body -->
