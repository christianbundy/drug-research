Setting: Having nothing better to do I was having a few drinks (meaning I was drinking through the whole night until 3-4 hrs before going to sleep, about the equivalent of 1 beer 33 cl / hour + 1 line of synthacaine 2.5 hrs before) and gaming a little on my PC. Have had these two pills of each a mix of 100mg MPA and 50mg MDAI lying around for a while and thought 'what the hell'. So I scratched about 5-10mg off of one of them and put it under my tongue. No reaction after 20 mins so I decided to go ahead and try.<br><br>
Dosing: Since I have read all the trip reports I could get a hold of I felt like being cautious and decided to only take one half at first. It seemed like many had taken a high dose (up to 500mg!) and ended up feeling a horrible serotonin depletion for many days afterwards. Even though David E. Nichols labeled it a 'non-neurotoxic MDMA-like SRA' (paraphrasing here) there´s no reason to think that taking 5x the dose one would of MDMA and think it safe (I know, maybe not the same substance but you get my meaning). Be sensible.<br><br>
23:30 (50mg MPA + 25 MDAI)<br>
Felt a little better and a slight mood lift, but nothing major so I took the other half.<br><br>
00:30 (+50mg MPA + 25mg MDAI)<br>
Felt really nice stimulation with a moderate euphoria - very pleasant - no anxiety at all. Had a great time gaming and was never annoyed when it didn´t go well (as I can normally can get furious). Felt really good and decided to take #2 pill since the experience was not overwhelming.<br><br>
1:30 (+100mg MPA + 50mg MDAI)<br>
Kept gaming and had a blast. Got up some times because I wanted to feel what it felt like to move. Very nice. No trails or pronounced dizziness - felt especially good to breathe.  Everything seemed a little soft to look at, like the edges were smoothened, but other than that no visuals. All through this no pupil dilation!? Was looking in the mirror every time I went to the bathroom. Seemed weird since I would have definitely expected this to produced wild pupil dilation.<br><br>
5:46 <br>
(about an hour before this point, no more alcohol) Still riding the high and noticed the pupil dilation I had been waiting for - bigtime. Odd having to wait this long for the effects. Didn´t feel much different though - still high, pleasantly so and not overwhelming. <br><br>
8:00 <br>
Effects have attenuated a little bit but still high. Slightly sobering<br><br>
9:00<br>
Still feeling the effects - not much different from 8:00 apart from sobering up. Ok, have been awake too long now. Want to sleep so took 3 mg etizolam.<br><br>
9:30<br>
went to sleep and woke up at 16 feeling relaxed. No unpleasant after effects noted except the usual emotional numbness I feel after etizolam.<br><br>
Tip: Etizolam + alcohol or any other GABA modulator/agonist at the same time will often make my eyelids twitch for weeks after. I try to sober up before using etizolam to fall asleep (easiest with clean drugs). <br><br>
Conclusion:<br><br>
I would do this again. Was a nice experience and just what I was looking for in that it was not too much for the circumstances. Note:The next night (almost 24 hours after original dose) I took a rail of synthacaine which haven´t given me pupil dilation sofar - but this time - bigtime (same batch as previous)! Leads me to believe that MDAI, especially, might have a very long half-life akin to 6-apb. That´s another reason to keep the dose low. This might help to explain the people who got depressed after taking this. MDAI seems to be better as a mixer with MPA, which is also considered a good mixer - both might not be that great on their own.<!-- End Body -->
