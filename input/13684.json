 "report": "<p>\nI tried amanita muscaria. For that trip I took 15 g of dried mushrooms. The trip seemed slow for a while during the time I was awake. For a while I didnt feel much except very mild nausea when I sat down. It was hardly noticeable and easy to ignore. The nausea would go away if I got up or thought about something else. I walked around my house and attended to some ordinary tasks with no problem. I even went outside to see if I would have a greater connection to natural energies. I found that my connection was normal and I really felt the same. </p><p>I went back inside to try to sit down to feel the effects. I was a little jittery and sometimes it became hard to focus. I noticed that I didnt feel particularly good but didnt feel like eating or sleeping. However, I did try to sleep but I just couldnt feel it. At this point I noticed that I wasnt feeling very trippy like LSD or cubensis. I felt more like there was a void that I couldnt really reach and my mind was just trying to do things. I decided to leave the house to see how I would make it. I drove to the gas station with no problem. When I picked up a drink and was looking at the other drinks I dropped the bottle. I noted that it was because some feeling had left my body. I bought another drink and went home, reminding myself to pay attention so as not to have another accident. When I got home I felt like the trip wasnt going to do much else, so I smoked some pot and went outside again. I only felt a slightly better connection to natural energies. I got bored again and soon went to bed. </p><p>My dream was quite adventurous. There was something like a train of advanced technology, as if it were from the future. It could travel into the future and would then become another piece of advanced technology. Every time I went to the future the technology would be advanced and therefore my vehicle would change shape. After a while I had something like a space craft, only I could also travel in other dimensions. I went into outer space. Yet, it wasnt like Star Trek, the fabric or stuff of space felt like a different texture, on an interdimensional plane. It wasnt a physical pull in other dimensions, like the feel was different. I left the galaxy and the color of space was vibrating between black and yellow. I had a companion with me and I said to him, I need to learn more about the physics of this space before I travel further.</p><p>My insights into the mushroom were that we take the sacred plants so that they can have a human experience and we can have a plant experience simultanously. I also discovered that amanita shows you a void, but you don't get to be part of the void, it's like everything gets stuffed up front and you cannot draw from the back of your head. I believe there is a part of the subconsciousness that gives you another dimension to work with, but with amanita you do't get that, you can only work with what you know. It takes away body awareness but you do not feel like floating away.</p>"
