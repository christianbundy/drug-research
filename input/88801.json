 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually. <br>Set: Home with 1 friend.<br>Setting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.<br>8:00PM<br>Dose taken with water<br>8:20PM<br>Stomach feels a bit like ingestion, heart beat up a little.<br>More awake, possibly just music and relaxing. Clammy hands.<br>8:25PM<br>Notice subtle headspace change. Fluffy, floaty.<br>8:30PM<br>Not that jaw is clenching yet, but chewy sounds good.<br>Feels nice to move and stretch. <br>8:40PM<br>Chose chewy that tastes putrid, 'rotten berry flavour' . Spat it out. <br>'Need to poop feeling' but I know I don't need to.<br>Body temp must be up, sweaty 'pits'.<br>Pupil Dilation<br>Feeling mood lift and nice body high coming in waves.<br>9PM<br>Definetley feeling nice. Desire to move about. <br>Getting harder to write, concentration not as good.<br>Enhanced colours, music is enveloping me.<br>Still want to poo. <br>9:30PM<br>Keep thinking about getting comfortable on couch but keep getting distracted.<br>Hot and cold waves. Sweating with jumpers on but want a heater. (I get this on MDMA and 2ci also)<br>9:50PM<br>Put a heater on, bit more comfortable. Making sure to drink water. <br>Music is hard to chose, no particular genre' sounds good, just particular songs.<br>I STILL WANT TO POO! I think my bowels must be relaxed.<br>10:10PM<br>Had a water pipe hit of THC, got chills and prickly fingers. Very nice.<br>Conversation is deep, but not serious. Laughter feels good.<br>10:20<br>Some slight jaw tension. Want chewy but don't want the disgusting berry one.<br>10:45<br>Starting to mellow just a little.<br>Debating a little more. <br>50mg oral?.'woops I did'.<br>11:20<br>Feeling the 50mg. It doesn't bring me up in any way just sustains the buzz.<br>2:30<br>Finished watching watchmen. Still feeling awake<br>Talk to friend.<br>4PM<br>Fell asleep<br>Conclusion:<br>I used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.<br>Unlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends. <br>Mentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.<br>Although it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything. <br>A novel treat*\n\n\n"
