 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually. \r\nSet: Home with 1 friend.\r\nSetting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.\r\n8:00PM\r\nDose taken with water\r\n8:20PM\r\nStomach feels a bit like ingestion, heart beat up a little.\r\nMore awake, possibly just music and relaxing. Clammy hands.\r\n8:25PM\r\nNotice subtle headspace change. Fluffy, floaty.\r\n8:30PM\r\nNot that jaw is clenching yet, but chewy sounds good.\r\nFeels nice to move and stretch. \r\n8:40PM\r\nChose chewy that tastes putrid, 'rotten berry flavour' . Spat it out. \r\n'Need to poop feeling' but I know I don't need to.\r\nBody temp must be up, sweaty 'pits'.\r\nPupil Dilation\r\nFeeling mood lift and nice body high coming in waves.\r\n9PM\r\nDefinetley feeling nice. Desire to move about. \r\nGetting harder to write, concentration not as good.\r\nEnhanced colours, music is enveloping me.\r\nStill want to poo. \r\n9:30PM\r\nKeep thinking about getting comfortable on couch but keep getting distracted.\r\nHot and cold waves. Sweating with jumpers on but want a heater. (I get this on MDMA and 2ci also)\r\n9:50PM\r\nPut a heater on, bit more comfortable. Making sure to drink water. \r\nMusic is hard to chose, no particular genre' sounds good, just particular songs.\r\nI STILL WANT TO POO! I think my bowels must be relaxed.\r\n10:10PM\r\nHad a water pipe hit of THC, got chills and prickly fingers. Very nice.\r\nConversation is deep, but not serious. Laughter feels good.\r\n10:20\r\nSome slight jaw tension. Want chewy but don't want the disgusting berry one.\r\n10:45\r\nStarting to mellow just a little.\r\nDebating a little more. \r\n50mg oral?.'woops I did'.\r\n11:20\r\nFeeling the 50mg. It doesn't bring me up in any way just sustains the buzz.\r\n2:30\r\nFinished watching watchmen. Still feeling awake\r\nTalk to friend.\r\n4PM\r\nFell asleep\r\nConclusion:\r\nI used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.\r\nUnlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends. \r\nMentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.\r\nAlthough it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything. \r\nA novel treat*\n\n\n"
