 "report": "<p>Background: Healthy. Tried many substances but never binged or used habitually. </p><p>Set: Home with 1 friend.</p><p>Setting: Eaten a small meal 1 hr prior. A stressful 4 weeks had gone by, and I had received some MDAI as a white crystalline powder. The week before a friend and I tried 5mg, then a few hours later 40mg to determine whether we thought it was actually MDAI and it's purity. We subtlety noticed 'something nice,' and concluded it was probably high quality.</p><p>8:00PM</p><p>Dose taken with water</p><p>8:20PM</p><p>Stomach feels a bit like ingestion, heart beat up a little.</p><p>More awake, possibly just music and relaxing. Clammy hands.</p><p>8:25PM</p><p>Notice subtle headspace change. Fluffy, floaty.</p><p>8:30PM</p><p>Not that jaw is clenching yet, but chewy sounds good.</p><p>Feels nice to move and stretch. </p><p>8:40PM</p><p>Chose chewy that tastes putrid, 'rotten berry flavour' . Spat it out. </p><p>'Need to poop feeling' but I know I don't need to.</p><p>Body temp must be up, sweaty 'pits'.</p><p>Pupil Dilation</p><p>Feeling mood lift and nice body high coming in waves.</p><p>9PM</p><p>Definetley feeling nice. Desire to move about. </p><p>Getting harder to write, concentration not as good.</p><p>Enhanced colours, music is enveloping me.</p><p>Still want to poo. </p><p>9:30PM</p><p>Keep thinking about getting comfortable on couch but keep getting distracted.</p><p>Hot and cold waves. Sweating with jumpers on but want a heater. (I get this on MDMA and 2ci also)</p><p>9:50PM</p><p>Put a heater on, bit more comfortable. Making sure to drink water. </p><p>Music is hard to chose, no particular genre' sounds good, just particular songs.</p><p>I STILL WANT TO POO! I think my bowels must be relaxed.</p><p>10:10PM</p><p>Had a water pipe hit of THC, got chills and prickly fingers. Very nice.</p><p>Conversation is deep, but not serious. Laughter feels good.</p><p>10:20</p><p>Some slight jaw tension. Want chewy but don't want the disgusting berry one.</p><p>10:45</p><p>Starting to mellow just a little.</p><p>Debating a little more. </p><p>50mg oral?.'woops I did'.</p><p>11:20</p><p>Feeling the 50mg. It doesn't bring me up in any way just sustains the buzz.</p><p>2:30</p><p>Finished watching watchmen. Still feeling awake</p><p>Talk to friend.</p><p>4PM</p><p>Fell asleep</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>I used MDMA 3 times, 4 years ago but for comparison It felt somewhat reminiscent.</p><p>Unlike MDMA though, there is no 'blast off' like something starts and ends. </p><p>Mentally it feels mellow and very non-toxic, although a definite mood lift and desire to socialise.</p><p>Although it's somewhat sedating, I wasn't able to fall asleep easily. Thankfully a solid 8 hour sleep followed. The next day there was no real hangover. Maybe a little tired if anything. </p><p>A novel treat*</p>"
