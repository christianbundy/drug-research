 "report": "<p>Well, it was finals week and I had a paper to write and two finals to study for so, I was really stressed out. My girlfriend had told me that alot of people in her school take adderall to focus and she's tried it a few times to study and it works. She gave me 3 pills for the week and told me to take one a day, maybe one and half if its not strong enough. This was my first experience with Adderall so I didn't know what to expect.</p><p>I took one 30mg pill, after about 30mins I really didn't feel much so I decided to take another 30mgs. About 30mins later I started feeling it. I felt very focused and I felt a cozy feeling. I felt nestled into my book and my work. I was actually excited and enthusiastic about doing my work. After about 2 hours or so of reading and typing I caught my self taking very slow deep breaths. I felt my pulse and my heart was beating very very slowly, unusually slow, then there was no beating for like 4 seconds and I began to panic knowing I was about to passout.</p><p>Then all of a sudden my heart began to race beating very quickly. I stood up from my chair and tried to regulate my breathing in the hopes to regulate my heart rate. It work for the time, so I continued to due my work but, all I could focus on is breathing and my heart rate. I tried to forget about it and just focus on my work. As I was typing I felt numbness and tingling in my fingers as if my finger fell asleep. I knew that my heart wasnt pumping enough blood to my finger so I got up and tried moving around alil to get my blood flowing. I also made a sandwich and drank alot of water hoping to flush out some of it.</p><p>That did work slightly so I just continued work hoping itll go away on its own. My fingers got really cold and it became difficult for me to type because my fingers were so numb. They felt like if I had put them in ice water for an hour. The rest of the night I was just focused on checking my heart and breathing and trying not to pass out or anything. It was a very scary experience. I did not sleep at all. In the morning those negative affects wore off but, I felt hyper and exhausted at the same time. My mind was hyper but my body was tired.</p><p>This experience I had was actually two days ago. Last night I finally got a full night of sleep but, I still dont feel totally normal. It was a lot more powerful than I thought. I have experimented with drugs in the past. Id compare my feelings as similar to E without the emotional part. All in all I had a bad experience but I wrote a pretty good paper.</p>"
