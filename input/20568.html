I have searched the net far and wide for more information on the Henbane plant, especially dosage information. I have found very little data on the subject.<br><br>
Some time ago, a friend of mine purchased some henbane seeds from an online vendor. I agreed to be a sitter while Tim tried smoking the seeds. I convinced him to start with a very low dose, about 3 seeds. I figured try smoking a few, wait an hour or so, then possibly smoke 3 more. The seeds are very small, and Tim was not certain that he got a hit. After an hour went by, there were no noticable effects, so he smoked 3 more seeds. Again, nothing of note. This concluded the experiment for the evening. <br><br>
On the next attempt, Tim smoked about 6 seeds at once. After about 45 minutes, he smoked about 8 more. He said there was a very slight 'woozy' effect, but nothing substantial. He quit for the evening. <br><br>
The last experiment was quite a bit more aggressive. He smoked about a dozen seeds at once. After about a half hour, he smoked roughly 20 more seeds. He claimed that the 'woozy' effect had returned, but he was nothing even close to a 'trip'. He ended up smoking well over 100 seeds that evening. In fact, he smoked all that was left. He did not have any significant reaction to the seeds. <br><br>
After reading up on Henbane, I am very surprised that this was not a sufficient dose. The seeds apparently are higher in alkaloid content than the leaves. <br><br>
I AM NOT SUBMITTING THIS REPORT TO SUGGEST THAT YOU START OFF WITH OVER 100 SEEDS. BEING THAT TROPANE ALKALOIDS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS, I SUGGEST THAT YOU USE THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH THAT WE DID TO FIND THE PROPER DOSAGE. I am hoping that there will be more information about this plant available in the future.<!-- End Body -->
