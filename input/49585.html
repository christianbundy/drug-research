inhaled<br>
waited.<br><br>
how much time had pass?<br><br>
HOLYFUCKINGCHRISTALMGIHTYDONTPULLMETHATFAST!<br>
screaming fury<br>
a roar all around<br><br>
got me a moving; ohhohoho<br>
o man; here we gogogogo go<br><br>
-hold on little one<br>
     lead me sally<br>
-that i will<br><br>
the field of vision; dark<br>
twenty seconds..<br>
errupting color<br>
the emptyness, <br>
sparkeles to life<br>
vibrant fucking life<br><br>
tunnels; tunnels errupting everywhere<br>
intertwining vines;<br>
mirror images; <br>
so many vines?<br>
so many patterns...<br>
they shoot back, back into infinity<br>
   these numbers know no bounderies...<br>
they hold no limits<br>
that i see; which i have sought<br>
   there the bending tree<br>
times; howmany times?  it etched backwards<br>
this bending tree; <br>
fire; ablaze in glory<br>
greens; strange hues; strange sensations...<br><br>
voices all around; whispers of here and there<br>
discussing the anywho's<br>
the what nots of life<br><br>
patterns; decending upon me<br>
at terriable speed and unstopable furry<br>
 the end of the tunnel<br>
    breakthrough..<br><br>
hyperspace.<br><br>
   ITS BREEDING?!<br>
HOLY JESUS im feeding it <br>
     no use stopping<br>
   no one can stop it<br><br>
'you cant stop me you cant stop me you cant stop me'<br>
I dont want to<br>
'follow me follow me follow me'<br>
        down the winding winding path<br><br>
what is this that i see?<br>
strange reality; <br>
purple; colors; entities have come<br>
I float through a field <br>
strange vibes<br>
strange glows<br>
time; its as existant as a one dimentional object<br><br>
ahah ; there we  have it; two sides of the circle; a floating syphony of elves <br>
and throbbing orbs<br><br>
still I ascend to heights<br>
I had no intention of reaching<br>
an all to familiar sensation..<br>
splicing<br><br>
my feet; miles away<br>
me torso; segmented beyond belief<br>
cakleling laughter: YOU CANT STOP IT<br>
  no; your right; I cant stop it<br>
I merely hold on<br>
this hurricane of exotic chemicals<br>
unleashed upon my head;<br><br>
how long has it been?<br>
that concept has merely faded<br><br>
then the true contacct was made;<br>
the one that i was ment to see<br>
the thing i was ment to behold<br>
I had come<br>
the pullsing edge of DMT hyperspace<br>
so near; the vaulting speed of lady ska<br>
so strong.<br>
pushing; pushing<br>
if i was already in hyperspace?<br>
where was this place i was going to?<br><br>
memory fades...<br>
there is no level<br>
no single analogy<br>
that will ever mark; that will ever come close to<br>
retelling this lizard Kingdome<br>
this Kingdome come; <br>
this realm of two worlds<br><br>
fabric; the fabric tears<br>
sickening shudders<br>
violent shakes<br>
tunnels; i continue down more and more<br>
elves; fucking elves<br>
they cant keep their fucking pants on<br>
erotic fucks...<br>
   I love it<br><br>
merging with space<br>
no refriderators...<br>
this is <br>
far more...<br>
galactic proportions<br>
cosmic visions<br><br>
before me stands a temple<br>
infinitely high<br>
infinitely large<br>
climbing up it<br>
lizards; of varying color<br>
I travel around it; warping<br>
pulsating beats<br>
are those drums I hear?<br><br>
   BOOMSHAKLAKA MOTHERFUCKER NO TURNING BACK<br>
conversations<br>
misty conversations; sweep upon me; sweet familiarity<br>
fearful alieniess<br>
is that a word?<br>
what is a word?<br>
logos?<br>
what are those?<br>
Christ; spinning and spinning<br><br>
colors.<br><br>
vibrant colors<br><br>
odd de ja vu<br>
familiarity<br>
I am meeting an old friend; how about some tea?<br>
no tea tonight<br>
no rest for those who test the limits<br>
what are the limits?<br>
the end; ahaha; no concept of an end<br>
circling this ancient structure<br>
I am content on <br>
simply completing my orbit; round<br>
and round the merrygoround<br>
then we all fall down.<br>
down?<br><br>
viscious speed<br><br>
decending into the structure<br>
throbbing masses<br>
entangled patterns<br>
I see Mayan symbols<br>
cosmically huge patterns<br>
they rotate<br>
to my left a smelve (smelve?  aha; he is built of DMT likes; ska personality; freindly; benignly watching me)<br>
he points<br>
I look<br>
the patterns before my field of vision<br>
 begin to extend backwards<br>
and backwards<br>
mirror images<br>
then a kaleidoscope of colors<br>
rotating inwards<br>
jumping glee<br>
euphoria.<br><br>
then it turns.<br>
jesus fuck; how long has it been?!<br>
lady ska departs; slowly; notcibly<br>
familiar DMT patterns<br>
familiar DMT entities<br>
a purple room; I stare through tinted glass<br>
inside are desks with knobs<br>
and things i dont remember<br>
mirror images extend backwards....<br><br>
how long has it been!?!?!?!??!!?<br><br>
blackout<br><br>
why do we throw it all away?<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
I blacked out after 10 minutes according to my sitter.<br>
The Salvia never left; the point where I begin to feel as though its presence is leaving is marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT.  I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.<br><br>
This trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.<br><br>
Unimaginably intense.<br><br>
The trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna.<!-- End Body -->
