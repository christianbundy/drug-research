 "report": "<p>Twas another sad day knowing that all my opiate connects were dry. I've been searching for weeks for a legal alternative to getting that opiate buzz. Even though I was unsuccessful in my quest, I came across some interesting herbs.....</p><p>Previous experiences and doses:</p><p>1-3 grams Wild lettuce - mild sedative, not much</p><p>1-2 gramsDamiana - the opposite sex seems to be very strongly in mind on this stuff.</p><p>1/4 - 1/3 fL. ounce Valerian extract. It came in a one fluid ounce tincture - calming and brain relaxation. Fould it fairly easy to fall asleep.</p><p>Here are the doses</p><p>15 mL or half ounce valerian extract</p><p>7 g wild lettuce</p><p>7 g damiana</p><p>No food or other drugs were taken prior to ingestion.</p><p>valerian was taken orally with a little water</p><p>wild lettuce and damiana prepared in 55 oz of water NO sugar</p><p>12:30  7.5 mL of valerian was taken. If I to compare the taste of this to somthing it would have to be peas. Taste like someone took a bag of green peas and made some kind of liquor out of it. It almost instantly lets me know its there with a tiny little head buzz.</p><p>12:50 Starting to sweat a little bit, I notice a feeling of chill in my brain almost telling me to stop writing and listen to some music. Another 7.5 mL was taken.</p><p>1pm After confirming that the heat was coming from my body and not my house, I sat in my kitchen a smiled a bit.  Nice enjoyable heat though, very odd that im auctually enjoying this heat. The tea is just about ready, looks like a dark cloudy maple syrup. A very bitter and rancid concoction, especially without sugar. Instantly calming like chamomile, however. The kettle says a little over 50 oz, so i got a lot of drinking to do. I'm going to take a break from writing and watch some rocky marathon.</p><p>1:58pm just drank all the tea and only got minor sedative effects.</p>"
