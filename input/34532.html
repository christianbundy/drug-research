I didnt really prepare for the trip in anyway besides skipping dinner. I decided to try my 2ci for the first time at my friends house down the street from my house. There were probably 15 people at her house.<br><br>
8:30 pm: I put approx. 20-25 mg of 2ci into a glass of water and drink it.<br><br>
8:40 pm: I smoke a little bit of weed to pass time until the 2ci sets in.<br><br>
9:40 pm: the effects of 2ci are apparent but im still only feeling a body buzz similar to E.<br><br>
10:10 pm: the walls of the house are starting to breathe but I could probably still pass as sober besides my eyes being dilated<br><br>
10:40 pm: the hallucinations are now fully apparent, im probably a +2.5 or +3<br><br>
11:00 pm: im tripping hard, lots of contorting faces and open eye visuals. I can also understand all the intricate relationships between the people I am hanging out with.<br><br>
11:30 pm: much more cannabis is smoked. I become uncomfortable but decide that there is nothing I can do besides ride it out. I feel as if the first peak of the trip has passed.<br><br>
12:00 am: im feeling better now. If I concentrate on the hallucinations I can manipulate them but if I dont pay attention it feels like a light shroom trip.<br><br>
2:00 am: I smoke more then decide to check out the closed eye visuals. I can fully control where I want to trip to go. If I concentrate on certain things I can cause a rushing of pleasure in my body. After awhile of doing this, my jaw starts to tighten. Some back muscles cramped slightly but these pains stopped after a few minutes. I have a great deal of creative insight. I have a better understanding of the relationships I have with people in my life. This is about the closest Ive ever gotten to a +4 if it wasnt it.<br><br>
4:00 am: I can still control the trip but the intensity is fading. I walk home and lie in my bed until approx 6 am tripping lightly until I finally fall asleep.<br><br>
This was an awesome experience that I will definitely try to imitate.<!-- End Body -->
