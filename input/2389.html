Well, nobody has tried this yet, so...<br><br>
8:50PM<br>
------<br>
        I weigh out 6mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, chop it up into fine powder, and<br>
divide it into two lines of approximately 3mg each. I divide each of these<br>
in 2 again.<br><br>
8:53PM<br>
------<br>
        1.5mg up one nostril, 1.5 up the other! The smell/taste is similar<br>
to DPT - or any other tryptamine for that matter. I'm glad that 5-MeO-DIPT<br>
has a very low dosage range... it would not be pleasant to insufflate<br>
large quantities of this. I have an immediate sense that 'something' is<br>
coming, but the effects are not instantaneous.<br><br>
8:58PM<br>
------<br>
        Yuck! The drip from this stuff tastes very bad, and also is giving<br>
a very uncomfortable burning sensation in the back of my throat. Neither<br>
saline nasal spray nor drinking seems to help. I guess I just need to wait<br>
it out.<br><br>
9:05PM<br>
------<br>
        I am beginning to feel a tryptamine lift, and the bitter burning<br>
taste in my throat is subsiding.<br><br>
9:20PM<br>
------<br>
        The taste in my throat has cleared up, and I'm definately feeling<br>
the effects now. At this point, its still fairly mild, and feels like what<br>
I would expect from the same ammount done orally. I wonder if it will<br>
build any more, or if I should do some more? I decide its best to wait<br>
another 10 minutes or so, just in case.<br><br>
9:30PM<br>
------<br>
        I'm feeling a rather good effect. I seem to have reached a plateau<br>
now. It feels slightly stronger than this dose would orally - but not by<br>
much. I feel warm, trippy, and happy. I have very mild visual enhancement<br>
(bright colors etc), like I would expect from a low oral dose of<br>
5-MeO-DIPT. The time it took from insufflation to peak effect was roughly<br>
25-30 minutes. I think a little more will do nicely. 2 lines of 1.5mg each<br>
are still on the plate, I think one of them is in order - if not both...<br><br>
9:40PM<br>
------<br>
        I insufflate one of the 1.5mg lines.<br><br>
9:50PM<br>
------<br>
        Fuck it. Up with the other 1.5mg!<br><br>
10:02PM<br>
-------<br>
        This route seems to be about co-effective with oral. Same dosage<br>
range (though maybe insufflated is SLIGHTLY more efficient). Similar<br>
subjective effects, although this seems a little more energetic, and it<br>
hit alot faster. The neck tension and jaw clench seems a little less<br>
prominent. There is no trace of stomach discomfort. This is a very clean<br>
experience compared to my oral experiments with 5-MeO-DIPT. This is an<br>
exceedingly comfortable place. This feels like wrapping up in a warm fuzzy<br>
blanket in front of a fire on a winter night.<br><br>
10:32PM<br>
-------<br>
        Ahhh... very nice. The last few lines are fully kicked in. I am at<br>
a very solid +2. Warmth, a nice tryptamine body high, a relaxed and mellow<br>
mindset. Some mild visual enhancements and perhaps even hits of OEVs<br>
scurrying past the corners of my eyes. I feel like going to lay down and<br>
relax and think for a while.<br><br>
11:00PM<br>
-------<br>
        Wow. Laying on my couch and listening to my fan was amazing. A<br>
timeless sense of relaxation and bliss. Thinking contentedly about life.<br>
Everything is good. I feel very introspective, in a warm fuzzy way. Again,<br>
the sensation is similar to the coming down phase of a very good LSD trip.<br>
I do feel that I am lower down now than I was a half hour ago, however. A<br>
few quick tokes of cannabis, then off to lay down for a few more minutes.<br><br>
11:11PM<br>
-------<br>
        I'm unable to return to that warm, floaty place. I seem to be<br>
coming down a good deal now. I am still quite high but the mental effects<br>
are now taking a back seat to the purely physical sensation of<br>
tryptamineness. The bright colors are still very prominent. But the peak<br>
effects are beginning to subside. I feel I've still got a long glide down.<br><br>
11:50PM<br>
-------<br>
        I'm a little lower than I was. Its very hard to judge how far you<br>
have come with this substance. Its very difficult to tell if I'm feeling<br>
less effect than a half hour ago, or to tell what effects have dissipated.<br>
But I know that I am alot further towards baseline than I was a half hour<br>
ago, nevertheless. I did notice a sort of laxative effect just now - an<br>
increase in peristalsis, rather. Perhaps the stomach effects of oral doses<br>
are not just because of chemical irritation of the stomach or intestine,<br>
but also due to some sort of neurological process? Perhaps it is<br>
interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain stem. Its a non-issue<br>
though. There was no discomfort whatsoever. This was a far cleaner<br>
experience than oral... except for the bad tasting drip. I think I will be<br>
using this route more than the oral route, despite my usual aversion to<br>
snorting things. Its just a cleaner trip this way.<br><br>
12:30AM<br>
-------<br>
        I'm pretty far down now. Could probably sleep without too much<br>
effort now. This experiment exceeded my expectations quite a bit.<!-- End Body -->
