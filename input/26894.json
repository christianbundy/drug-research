 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: 65 grams of nutmeg is considered an extremely high dose.] </p><p>I have tried Nutmeg a few times, and have wonderful things to say about it. I have tried many different combinations of many drugs. </p><p>I first drank the Promethazine/Codeine Syrup, one regular prescription bottle. I then ate about 3 or 4 1 ounce cans of the Nutmeg. I find that if I eat the Nutmeg with fresh orange slices, and ice cold water to wash it down, it doesn't taste that bad. After about 20 minutes, the Codeine/Promethazine kicked in full force. Then I started to get the Nutmeg kick. Felt like my eyes were burning, felt ampy and stoned at the same time.</p><p>After about 2 or so hours, the codeine had started to wear off, I think? The Nutmeg was off and running. I felt like I had smoked a pound of buds. I was bombed. I decided to lay down and go to sleep, but it wasn't happening. I was wired for sound. I then smoked about 3 joints of Kine Bud, and was totally smashed.</p><p>I then started to experience the Halucinogenic properties of the nutmeg. I don't remember much about the rest of the night, but the next day, I spent in bed staring at a ladybug on the ceiling. The ceiling dropped down until it was appx 10 inches in front of my face, and the ladybug turned into a wierd bee type creature. I decided that I didn't want to look at it anymore, so I rolled my head over to the side, and had a six hour conversation with the tree that was outside my window.</p><p>For the next 3 days, I felt like I was stoned out of my mind, with a weird spaced out feeling. Like I was 'connected' with everything around me.</p><p>I continue to use nutmeg for spiritual reasons, but I do not mix it or any other drugs. Nutmeg is a wonderful entity. I say 'entity' because I believe that it is more than a plant, it is an awareness of it's own.</p>"
