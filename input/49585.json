I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.\r\nThis trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.\r\nUnimaginably intense.\r\nThe trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna.\n\n\n"
