While at work one day, a friend and co-worker asked if I wanted to try a 'Klonopin'. He Explained what Clonazepan was, and I said sure, I'll try them. I Decided on insufflation as I wanted to experience the effects quicker because I had a long work night ahead of me. I was in fear of a burning sensation, especially after some recent insufflation experiences with cyclobenzaprine. Instead, I was greeted with a pleasant, cooling sensation to my mucus membranes much like the feeling of a menthol cigarette.<br><br>
The effects began within approximately two minutes, and full effects began within five minutes. The effects are much like a recreational use of hydrocodone, but more euphoric and less 'cloudy', as I can say. As I layed down on a pile of bags of flour (I work at a pizza parlor), I concentrated on my euphoric 'drift' and felt in total bliss and pharmecutical happiness. It was, least to say, quite pleasant.<br><br>
The full peak effects subsided fully after approximately four hours and after a good nights sleep, all effects had diminished by morning (an eight hours sleep begun five hours after insufflation). This pharmecutical is quite pleasant.<!-- End Body -->
