I have just come off my first datura(Jimson weed/Devil's weed) 'trip'. I use the word 'trip', due to the lack of a better option. I truly thought that I have seen almost everything that drugs can do a couple of days ago.I was dead-wrong. So many things happened; I'll tell you about 1.<br><br>
I was inside my bathroom for more than half an hour talking to someone. I did not know who he was but I saw him every now and again. I did not like seeing him, because he was a very irritating fellow. Anything I did, he would do; if I rubbed my cheek, he would do the same in a horibly exact replica of my actions.This really pissed me off. I was however too fast for him on certain occasions. This morning I realised that I had been talking to the mirror.<br><br>
This is very dangerous stuff.If you don't feel mentally and spiritually competent and cleansed ,don't go near her, for she will drive you insane permanently, or if you're a bit more lucky, she will kill you.<br><br>
Handle Her with the utmost respect and care, and your life will take on a new dimension.I must emphasize that I did a lot of research and was scared shitless, if not I would probably been Her latest victim (and there have been many!) <br><br>
Take really good care,<!-- End Body -->
