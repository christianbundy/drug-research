Thursday evening<br>
Sitting on someone's front step in baltimore, waiting for 'j' to come back with our next fix.  An hour goes by...he should have been back a long time ago.  Some guy walks by, turns around, and sits down next to me.  He tells me Im too pretty to look so sad.  He asks me what's wrong.  All I tell him is that my boyfriend (now ex) hasn't come back yet, he took my last $20 and Im worried.  He asks me to go with him to get a slice of pizza.  I say no at first...then he offers me $20.  I finally give in.  We go, talk, I tell him my real story, and he gives me his number.  We part ways and I go get my fix.  By the time I get home, j is there.  He had been questioned by the cops.  But he got the shit he went out for.  So we have enough for that night and part of the next day.  <br><br>
Friday<br>
So I do my last shot at noon.  I agonize over calling 'd'.  Finally I do.  He wants me to come to a club with him that evening.  I say ok.  So he and his friend 'k' pick me up around 9 pm.  Remember, I hadn't had any dope since noon...and Im still feeling ok.  So we grab some dinner and head to the club.  No one really there at first...but it's pretty cool...bunch a dj's spinnin jungle.  D gets me a drink and we smoke some kindbud.  At this time Im really worried that Im gonna start feeling like shit pretty soon.  So I decide to get as fucked up as I can.  A couple hours later, I realize I drank too much and puke.  But then I feel much better...d buys each of us an e pill.  Little bit of time goes by and Im feeling great.  Chillin on the couch with k and 'r'.  Hmmmm...r seems pretty cute...sweet too ;)  j calls d's cell.  He's really pissed off at me.  Am I even coming home??  No!  A little while later I end up in the dj booth...just chillin...smokin more kind bud...havin a great time.  Sometime in the early morning hours we head to d's apartment...k gives me a seroquel of unknown but high doseage.  R and I fool around a little...i end up passing out.  Wake up, feel really out of it and go upstairs to the bed.  Pass out for unknown period of time...<br><br>
Saturday<br>
I go back downstairs and r is gone.  K gives me another seroquel and a valium...d gives me another one behind her back.  I remember nothing over the next few hours (i do remember walking into a wall...hitting my nose really hard)  all I know is what k told me later.  <br><br>
K's account<br>
I was up and moving around...mumbling gibberish.  They asked me if I was hungry...so they went to mcdonalds for me.  But they had to actually feed me...i couldn't do anything myself.  K actually had to help me go to the bathroom.  I finally passed out.  They were really worried and wanted to take me to the hospital.  In the end they decided against it...which Im thankful for cos I don't know if I would have gotten clean that way.  <br><br>
Me again<br>
Sometime late saturday k and d took me over to t's place.  I was way too out of it to go to the party with them.  T was left with an arsenal of various pills for me.  Everytime I woke up she'd give me another half of a seroquel.  I slept all night despite all the craziness goin on around me.  <br><br>
Sunday<br>
D wakes me up to go out for indian food.  Wow I feel great!  No pain, no nausea, no chills, no sweating.  I slept off my withdrawal!!  And I could eat.  I had never had indian food before...it is definitely not something I would have considered eating right after coming off of heroin...but it was great.  <br><br>
Conclusion<br>
I had been through a few detox programs...all of which put me through pure hell...trouble sleeping for weeks after, pain, horrible nausea...this time I had no symptoms.  I could even sleep through the night from the start.  I even had no trouble sleeping til noon.  Needless to say, Ive had no urges to do dope again...Ive even had it offered to me for free and I turned it down :)  Ive been clean for over 4 months now and my life is great.  I broke up with my ex (we were together for 4 years but I didn't even miss him after what I went through) that first night...only he didn't find out til a few weeks later cos he ended up in jail a few days later.  After a couple weeks of crashin at randoms houses of new friends, I moved back home to pennsylvania.  Now I have a wonderful new boyfriend (who happens to live in baltimore), a bunch of wonderful new friends...and best of all I have my life back.<!-- End Body -->
