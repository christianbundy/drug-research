We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font> <br><br><br>
In 1998 I stumbled on inhalants as I loved the smell of gas, which eventually lead me to my problems that I have now.  I only huffed for about 1 year on and off experiencing the most bizarre hillucinations.  Now, almost 10 years later, related or not Im not sure but the doctors/ psychiatrists cant say what going through now is related to huffing or not but I have Type 1 Bi Polar disorder and possibly brain damage.<br><br>
I couldnt continue school as I was in a state of euphoria for so long thinking I was the second comming of Christ.  If you take anything out of this I'd say that you really dont know what your getting into, this shi* can kill you not to mention the brain damage and possible long term effects that solvents can lead to.  I remember when I thought, this stuff wont hurt me, perhaps Im paying for it now with the 'chemical' imbalance I have to struggle with daily as well as memory problems, decision making, at the time I was never informed that this is illegal at the age of 13.  You may regret doing this drug.<!-- End Body -->
