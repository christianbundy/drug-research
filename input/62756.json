 "report": "<p>I found a nice little way of producing low grade opium like tar from californian poppies</p><p>note: P used a stainless steel pan but i'm sure you could use pyrex or something.</p><p>1) bring 1 cup water to a boil</p><p>2) put 2.5 tablespoons poppy seeds in a mortar and pestal and grind it up a bunch (add some of the boiling water if it doesnt grind well)</p><p>3) add the poppy junk to the pan</p><p>4) simmer on medium for about 10 - 15 minutes</p><p>5) strain through a mesh strainer then through a coffee filter</p><p>6) throw away the seeds and clean the pan</p><p>7) put the nasty brew back in the pan</p><p>8) evaporate the water off by simmering it till it starts to get nasty and starts to stick to the sides</p><p>9) when that happens put it at an angle so the juice collects in a puddle (if your using a gas stove and a pan with a handle you can just prop it up)</p><p>10) at this point it should be waaaay less that what you started with and you should start to see a orange tar form (could be a different color too) and should smell like burnt sugar sorta</p><p>11) scrap that up and keep it, I recommend kneading it a bit with a spoon to push out the remaining water</p><p>Put that in your pipe and smoke it. It makes me feel nice and warm and floaty =D</p>"
