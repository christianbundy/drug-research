 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI found a nice little way of producing low grade opium like tar from californian poppies<br>note: P used a stainless steel pan but i'm sure you could use pyrex or something.<br>1) bring 1 cup water to a boil<br>2) put 2.5 tablespoons poppy seeds in a mortar and pestal and grind it up a bunch (add some of the boiling water if it doesnt grind well)<br>3) add the poppy junk to the pan<br>4) simmer on medium for about 10 - 15 minutes<br>5) strain through a mesh strainer then through a coffee filter<br>6) throw away the seeds and clean the pan<br>7) put the nasty brew back in the pan<br>8) evaporate the water off by simmering it till it starts to get nasty and starts to stick to the sides<br>9) when that happens put it at an angle so the juice collects in a puddle (if your using a gas stove and a pan with a handle you can just prop it up)<br>10) at this point it should be waaaay less that what you started with and you should start to see a orange tar form (could be a different color too) and should smell like burnt sugar sorta<br>11) scrap that up and keep it, I recommend kneading it a bit with a spoon to push out the remaining water<br>Put that in your pipe and smoke it. It makes me feel nice and warm and floaty =D\n\n\n"
