I recently received a gram of 2C-I. My girlfriend &amp; I were going to try it together, but after it sat in my drawer for a month, I caved in and did it alone.<br><br>
We were going to visit some friends &amp; family that lived far away today, so we got up *very* early. By the time we got to our destination, I could tell I had an emotionally safe temperment and was okay to take it. Ingested the 16mg gelcap at about 2pm.<br><br>
about 3pm: Smoked some MJ, Very small alerts, wondering if I had taken enough, decided to sit it out for another hour before I tried supplements.<br><br>
After 4pm: Waves of energy are rolling in and breaking back. One second I'll feel like i'm pure energy, the next I feel nearly sober (actually, stoned). Still there's doubt whether I took enough, but whenever I'd think to redose, I'd get hit with the energy-i just dropped the redosing thought completely.<br><br>
5pm: Visuals remind me of LSD, carpet is moving, wood paneling on the wall seems to have more dimensions--its like looking into a cave. body load is never overwhelming, feels like MDA but it comes on smoothly and gets whisked away and comes back all day long.<br><br>
the rest of the day was very similiar. i like the substance and will retry at a slightly larger dose. at 11pm still feeling small effects, got to sleep quite nicely in about 20 mins.<br><br>
Next day, woke early, felt great, went to school clear minded and aced my test. Later that day (less than 24 hrs of ingestions still) I had ECG &amp; blood pressure tests done. ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm and my blood pressure was also normal on the low side.<!-- End Body -->
