 "report": "<p>One of the greatest drugs known to man.  They should give it away at the convenience store.  Possibly one of the greatest to snort, too: Valium slides down like a sugary pixie stick with little or no pain to the nostril.</p><p>10mg, blue (snorted)</p><p>Euphoric, purple hues, no pain, lots of love, desire to sleep standing up, funny grin, bugs bunny cartoons playing in reverse slowly in my head.</p><p>5mg, yellow (ingested)</p><p>A tease.  Mild visuals, desire to sleep or lie down to increase its potency.</p><p>Next day: possibly a slight hangover.  Far less so than many other 'modern' painkillers.  This is probably the reason why Valium was so popular: aside from brain damage, there was only a little bit of catalepsy or the shakes.  Truly a classic drug and hard to find.</p>"
