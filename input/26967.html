I waited years to try LSD. It had become such a hard drug to find by the time I was interested in it, so I waited a long time to try the FIRST drug I was really interested in.<br><br>
The place: a wonderful campground in a forest in Ohio. The atmosphere turned out to be better than I could have hoped for.<br><br>
I took a single hit of blotter (it had fractals on the back) at 11pm. It was hard to tell exactly when I started feeling the effects, as I was too excited and jumpy to begin with. I think it was about fifteen to twenty minutes though.<br><br>
Normally I can be pretty paranoid, especially on psychedelics. I would never dream of taking mushrooms in a forest in another country with people I had not met before...but LSD turned out to be much different. I think it was the rather slow and long rise to the peak - it gave me enough time to adjust to the changes.<br><br>
As I neared my peak, a group of us walked down a path to the edge of a lake. The sky was completely full of stars, and the light reflected off the tiny ripples on the water. I watched the light dance around the lake with a life of its own. The stars moved constantly, and each star appeared to be a small cluster of three or four stars. The body buzz was neither unpleasant nor enjoyable. More a tensed-up feeling of anticipation. It didn't bother me though, and even added its own effect to the feel of the trip. There were times when laughter would bubble up from my depths for no reason. Life is funny, amazingly funny!<br><br>
I tried smoking some bud a little after the peak, and as I suspected I promptly got much higher. At this point it was suggested to me that I should go for a journey into the forest. I walked off with another guy (I still have no idea who he was, just that he was tripping too) and was lost within ten steps. The darkness under the trees was thick. It looked like the air itself was inky black. None of this bothered me, though. I'm not sure if I could have been bothered, as I was so utterly confused by this point that I had no room for thought. We stumbled around in a daze, trying to figure out where it was we were going in the first place.<br><br>
I ventured back to the campsite after only a few minutes, when I realized there was no point in going somewhere I didn't know.<br><br>
LSD lasts a long time. I wish it would last a little longer still...but the length is something I have never experienced before. Mushrooms are mostly over with in five hours, sometimes much less. I had taken my hit at 11pm and by the time 6am rolled around I was far too many hours into my trip. Everyone else at the site had fallen asleep by the time the sun peeked over the horizon. I decided to go back down to the edge of the lake, to watch the sunrise.<br><br>
The ten minutes that I watched that sunrise will live with me forever. The feel of the place and time left me in such a state of awe I had no words to describe it. I still don't, really. The sun was rising on the opposite side of the lake, casting its rays directly towards me and across the rippling water. A foot or two of mist covered the entire lake as well. A gentle breeze came up from behind me and began to blow all the mist away from me and towards the rising sun. The top of the mist rippled and rolled like the top of the water below it, except the mist travelled away from me while the light twinkling on the water came towards me. If I experience another moment like that in this life...I will count myself greatly gifted.<br><br>
I hiked back up the hill to the campsite and tried to take a nap. No use...still too much energy.<br><br>
I finished coming down by lunch, with the last visuals subsiding around 10am or so. I left with my ride shortly after lunch and headed straight back to Canada.<br><br>
I have learned much from what I experienced, and I know there is still too much more to learn. LSD is a great teacher, indeed.<!-- End Body -->
