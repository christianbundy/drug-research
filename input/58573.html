I tried cocaine for the first time in college.  To be honest the first time i did it wasn't too great, even though i took a decent sized line.  Then about 3 months later i did it again a second time, which led to a third later on in the week.  I was expecting the cocaine high to be somewhat drastic, however it was subtle but euphoric, as i still felt like myself, not innebriated.  Long story short, occasionally became a weekend thing, and a weekend thing became a tuesday thing, to the point when i had a 'snuff bullet' and was taking little bumps on the way to class (which was rare for me to be attending)  It led to a terrible feeling of depression once my binge was over, a feeling of uneasyness lasted for weeks, and felt as if i couldn't sit still, and was going to jump out of my own skin.  I'm lucky i was smart enough to take the following semester off.  I have overcome my addiction to cocaine, and remember it as a terrible drug that almost destroyed my life.  After a coke binge, you literally feel like the devil is sitting on your shoulder railing lines with you.  The cocaine i was using was also very very potent, as it was uncut, which only furthered my addiction.  Cocaine is a drug that needs to be classified by itself.  The effects of the drug itself are not terrible, and relatively harmless, but its extremely addictive nature, and the after effects of cocaine are really the reason you should never try the yayo.<!-- End Body -->
