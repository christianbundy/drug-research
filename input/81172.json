 "report": "<p>Background: I have had plenty of experience with drugs especially psychedelics though this was the first time I'd tried 2C-C, my MDMA tollerance is very low despite having used it for years, I just never seem to gain much of a tollerance to things, I've also been very sensitive to 2C substances in the past, 10mg 2C-I gives me strong open eye visuals 20mg on it's own renders me a synesthesic egoless mess.</p><p>I had gone out clubbing with friends and started off the night with a pill and a half of known good MDMA at about 10:30PM (approximately 86mg a tablet, the batch had been lab tested in the netherlands) along with 20mg 2C-C, I then followed it up with another half and another 20mg 2C-C an hour later once I started to notice effects, pretty soon I was fairly well intoxicated by both substances. I observed geometric patterns on surfaces, everything seemed brighter and I felt the usual effects from such a dose of mdma, I also had a couple of lines of speed in an attempt to overcome the sedation from the 2C-C, however they proved completely ineffectual so I did not dance as much as I usually would, the only other notable thing at the club was during the peak of the 2C-C's effects I felt very devoid of self for that level of psychedelic intoxication, I was at a good +2 visually but with the disassociation of a strong +3 even though I could think fairly clearly.</p><p>I had another pill at around 4AM and a pill that supposedly contained 15mg 2C-B shortly before leaving the club around 5AM and when we got back I consumed a gel-cap containing 60mg 2C-C and 20mg 2C-I, about half an hour passed before everything started getting a little messy. My memories are somewhat jumbled but I recall all three substances seeming to hit at once, I was with 4 others and only one of them had taken further substances upon returning, we went upstairs to cuddle in bed which people did for a period talking a little and joking and during that time I seemed to melt away, with my eyes closed I seemed to dissolve off the edge of reality itself seeing insanely detailed stunning psychedelia, far more eclectic than what I've experience on lsd, often with strobing intense colours which I can't begin to describe, they seemed entirely outside the usual spectrum so intense they seared through all perception to normal colour.</p><p>I lay there in a state of complete confusion I couldn't say for how long as there weren't any clocks in the room and I had absolutely no concept of time past present or future with my eyes open I seemed to think under the assumption that I was some kind of inanimate object, verbally it seemed like word salad but it all felt like it revolved around being a surface of continually altering type laying between others in bed, eventually I started to come to for periods, able to regain lucidity and use the bathroom a couple of times to relieve the water I'd retained as a result of the MDMA I had consumed, I returned to the bed for a fair while simply because it seemed the thing to do, while I was able to find my way to the bathroom I was still in a very intense psychedelic state, the most notable aspect of the trip for me was the pure insanity of the peak, usually with psychedelics I still retain grammatical sense, I don't know if it was the combination of 2C's or the residual MDMA but I was locked in a cycle of intense almost schizophrenic insanity.</p><p>Eventually I came back enough to wander downstairs to rejoin the friend of mine who had also taken a further dose of 2C-I/2C-C. We chatted very openly for the next couple of hours as we gradually came down together, I was incredibly open which is bizzare for me as usually I tend to only talk if I have explicit reason to, but I found I could open up completely and just talk about fairly deep personal experiences of mine with her. I couldn't say for certain exactly when I came down as I kept hallucinating mildly for the rest of the day but my thought process was pretty much restored to normal by about 5PM, the next day (the same day I'm writing this now in bed) and even now colours are more intense than they should be and my whole visual field is clearly still impacted from the experience, I've had similar experiences after 2C-I trips, it seems to give me residual HPPD like symptoms with much greater intensity than the tryptamines I've taken, I do not however see this as a bad thing as I do not find it a distraction as it usually manifests itself when I mentally relax which is fine by me.</p><p>Overall a sublime experience, the only slight negative feature of it was a slight headache in evening after which is no longer present now.</p>"
