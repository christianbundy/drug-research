Time:  9/13/2002 at 1:07PM<br>
Set:  Good mood, well rested, curious about this high dose.<br>
Setting:  Wearing pajamas, army t-shirt; comfortable.  In my apartment, the shades are closed, there is a nice vibe in the room.<br>
Dose:  7.5mg.  The method of Dose is by 'tincture' method. <br>
Headache: 7/10.  Mildly strong at about 13 hours after dosing.  <br>
Overall Joy:  10/10.  Very happy from the session results.<br>
Shulgin Rating: ++<br><br><br>
Prior to this session, I have dosed 5-MeO-AMT twice.  My first time was a 'beta' test of 2.5mg; this session did indeed produce a psychedelic (mind-manifesting) effect (+ Shulgin rating).  The other session was with 5.0mg; this session did not differ all so much from the 2.5mg session (+ Shulgin rating).<br><br><br>
So there I was, confronting my courage with the aspects of dosing 7.0mg of 5-MeO-AMT.  I was a little nervous, but felt this warm confidence from my prior two sessions.  So, I decided to go for it.<br><br>
In dosing the 7.0mg, I used the liquid measurement technique so as to get an accurate dose.  The 5-MeO-AMT powder was brought into solution with 160 proof vodka.  It was allowed to sit for 2 weeks prior to my 7.0mg dose.<br><br>
So the day comes for the session.  I set aside my weekend (3 days) for both recovering and reflection.  So the day for the session was a Friday.  I woke up at about 9:00 AM, and ate a very small and healthy breakfast.  Then I ran some small errands in my apartment, and got my bed positioned directly in the center of the room.  Plenty of pillows, and plenty of fresh air from the central-air-conditioning system.<br><br>
I then prayed, stretched, and sat in reflection.  <br><br>
So then I was ready...<br><br>
I drew up 7.0mg of the 'tincture' into an oral syringe.  I then dosed, grunting at the sting of the strong vodka in my mouth.  It all went down, and I was happy.  It looked at the clock; it read 1:07 PM.  Then I sat in the quiet apartment and patiently waited for the effects to start.  While I waited I looked at some of my art and just generally sat.<br><br>
At about 30 minutes after dosing, I began to feel the usual stomach 'grumbling.'  Nothing major; it reminds me of when I eat Taco Bell tacos.<br><br>
At about 70-80 minutes after dosing, the psychedelic effects began to be evident.  But for some reason I felt much more comfortable and confidant than from before.  I decided to experience music while in this session.  I fired up my computer and played NIN's 'The Fragile' and Tool's 'Lateralus.'  I listened to them with my headphones.  And wow, was that an amazing experience!  I never experienced music with such understanding, physical absorption, and complete joy before.  I REALLY got into the music.  Every beat I anticipated was like a little explosion, and the voices penetrated my soul.  For some moments I was in complete bliss.<br><br>
So after I listened to both albums, this courageous feeling surfaced again (go figure).  So I decided to put on my Proteus 'Mind Machine.'  I put on a 60 minute program titled 'Mindlab Relax'.  I didn't finish the whole 60 minutes because it became a little bit disturbing.  I had an overwhelming feeling that I may of been contacted, via my mind, by extraterrestrial beings.  I know it sounds odd and crazy, trust me.  I've heard of theories prior to this session of extraterrestrials not physically coming to visit us on earth but visiting us through our minds.  So what I saw under the Proteus may have been hallucinations.  I don't know.  But I know what I saw and felt.  The visuals under the Proteus were nothing out of the normal that I see in a normal state, but there was a difference.  I believe I was able to see more detail in the strobes.  There seemed to be an overlapping pattern to them like they were layered ribbons in random order like a mesh or net, or which I never noticed before (I've had my Proteus for almost 2 years).  In the moments between the strobe light and darkness, there was something else going on which I can't describe.  And what I felt was a presence in the room; soft and kind presence.  Nothing alarming or probing.  <br><br>
I began to get a little scared, but did not want to abandon this moment.  Then, and don't ask me how this happened, I took on this persona of a human/angel with wings of fire.  Huge wings of fire, that can protect me from outside 'mental' or 'temporal' forces.  The wings shrouded my body and intensely heated up all surrounding areas.  Then my eyes cast an image of a burning flame, adding to the visual effects of the persona.  Just to clarify, I did not see this as a hallucination in the room.  This was something that occurred in my mind.<br><br>
After I took off the Proteus, I sat down and composed myself.  I began to think of all the cool possibilities of having such a persona; temperature regulation, 'warm warnings' to threats, fluid movement of the wings, infinite heat, infinite size of the wings.  Then I recalled a dream I had where I went lucid for about 10 seconds.  I attempted to fly during this brief lucid moment but lost control of my flight.  I decided, 'AHA!'  I can use this new angelfire persona to help me maintain my flight in my dream.  <br><br>
Back to the report, I'll mention some physical aspects.  At about 3-4 hours into the session, I defecated.  I mention this because 5-MeO-AMT has become infamous for giving people diarrhea.  Without getting graphic, it was nothing abnormal.  Perhaps a little softer than usual, but nothing that seemed troubling.  Now walking to and from the bathroom was very odd.  I felt like a zombie walking.  I walked slowly, carefully measuring my steps, and with one hand up that seemed to be pushing something in front of me.  As I sat on the bowl I listened to the sounds the house made.  Creaking wood, dripping water, it all took on the vibe of music.  Then walking out, I confronted my image in the mirror.  I took a close look at my eyes and noticed the pupils were very dilated.  I flicked on the mirror light and noticed that my pupils barely closed, and the light was indeed bright to me.  After my musing with the mirror I made my way back to my room, like an elderly man.<br><br>
It was now about 7:00 PM now (T+6), and the sun was setting.  I felt the dark night creeping into my town.  So I decided to 'summon' the angelfire persona to protect me from any scary 'entities' or 'spirits' I may see during my trip at night.<br><br>
Again, I was alone.  So I did, and it served my mind well.   Anytime I felt a little scared, I would flex my fired wings and intensify the flames.  It was sort of macho, but it felt good.<br><br>
Also, I did not vomit, nor ever had the feelings to vomit.  And I never felt nauseous.<br><br>
So I will say that the session lasted about 8-9 hours total, this being from 1:07 PM to about 10:00 PM.<br><br><br>
I went to bed at about 2:00 AM.  I was very restless, and good sleep seemed impossible.  I also had a moderately strong headache.  I kept on rolling around and looking at my clock.  The last time I recalled seeing on the clock was 4:00 AM.  Then I remember waking and the clock said 9:37 AM.  I don't recall a dream during that resting time, and don't recall for the loss of time either.<br><br>
I felt hungry after I woke, and ate at about 10:00 AM.  I had some fruit, peanuts, crackers, water, and chocolate syrup in soy milk.  It all went down fine.  The headache from the prior night was still with me, though a little milder.  I took 1000mg of Acetaminophen (a.k.a Tylenol) and my general mood got back to the normal vibe.  I felt fine, and went for a walk outside, and also to stretch my new wings...<!-- End Body -->
