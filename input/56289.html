I am an experienced Cannabis smoker and have also tried a few 'legal' highs, such as Salvia 10x, shroom pills, etc. My Uni mates had been hitting the legal highs in their local head shop for a couple of months, and so I decided to join them one night. My parents were away, so we decided to go to mine and chill.<br><br>
We all took half a 200mg pill at about eight o'clock and started listening to some tunes. Although I was nervous before I took the pill, my anxiety left me as soon as I had swallowed. We had two bottles of water ready, as my friends told me that dehydration was the only real danger.<br><br>
After an hour or so, my friends started feeling the effects beginning to take hold. I couldn't feel anything, so I decided to take the other half. Then fun began!<br><br>
After about half an hour, I started being really interested in my mates' conversations. It was like we could talk about anything and everything and it was cool. When a song was played, it was like it was a private poem just for me. I started feeling like I wanted to tell people all the bad things I'd ever done and ask them for their forgiveness. An extremely positive experience!<br><br>
The thing that I found most unusual was that I didn't feel in anyway inebriated. Unlike Cannabis, or getting wasted on booze, the BZP didn't add a haze to the proceedings, more it took away any restraints, leaving me totally in control of myself.<br><br>
One thing I will mention is the amount of tobacco we smoked! Every ten minutes or so we would go outside and smoke a rollie each, still chatting about anything and everything.<br><br>
However, at about two o'clock, I made a mistake. My friends had tried similar drugs and said that a bong hit of Cannabis was like 'an orgasm in your brain.' I was eager to try and so when my turn came round I inhaled deeply. It made me the highest I'd been in a long time for about twenty minutes, but then I found the experience most uncomfortable. I started seeing minor visuals, I couldn't focus on anything at all and I started to feel sick.<br><br>
We all decided to go to bed, but I couldn't relax at all. My mind was racing and I started to get 'the fear.' I couldn't shut my eyes, or lie down or anything. I felt like I was losing my mind, like my head was about to burst and I was going to end up on the ground fitting or something. I went downstairs to talk to a mate, who told me he suffered the same and you just have to keep telling yourself it's the drug, you're going to be ok. He had written a message on his phone before the evening began just reading 'You're going to be ok.' After chatting to him for a little while (and vomiting in the toilet) I managed to get to sleep.<br><br>
Next day I felt absolutely ok, just a very minor headache, that was it. <br><br>
Would I do it again? Definitely. The feelings of openness and companionship far outweigh the negatives. However, next time I'll only take 100mg and NO WEED!! That totally messed me up.<br><br>
I would never do it without people who know what they are doing. If my friends hadn't of been there I don't know what I would have done.<!-- End Body -->
