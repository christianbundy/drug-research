 "report": "<p>Decided to give selegiline/deprenyl a try for depression which I've had forever.  One drop = 1 mg from the vendor I used.  Their instructions for depression were 5 drops am and pm.  Fortunately I started w/ one drop per day and added on drop every few days.  Each increase made me feel a bit more 'pushed' and speedy.  No decrease in depression but a marked increase in irritability.  </p><p>Suddenly realized after a day at 5 drops in the am that I was frequently fighting the urge to slap someone or throw something/anything through a window or better still a wall.  Hmmm.  Guess more dopamine isn't what I need.  YMMV</p>"
