A tribute to 4-aces and my cousin.<br>
Before and after a 4-Aco-DET experience and 2 years later. <br><br>
Before my first trip, I was afraid of drugs. I did not know much about them. I knew only what I heard in school and what my parents had told me. I guess I was typical. I was upset over a girl very much so, she drank Robotussin and I looked down on that behavior. What did I know? I know now, that it was not cocaine or heroin or oxycontin that she was doing. With what I know now I would tell her that she could order pure pure DXM +-98.9 %. This was all before I had been awakened from my dogmatic sleep. <br><br>
I was upset. So much so that I was more upset with the drugs than I was with her. But deep down I was curious about what it is like to take DXM or any psychedelic for that matter. I would like to talk to that girl and have he share her experience with me. If only I could do it all over again but this time not to push her away and treat her like she was a drug addict. I had to get away. I went down to Florida with my mother to visit my cousin and aunt. My cousin did all types of chemicals. He just done did it. I was reading stuff all over the Internet about magic mushrooms. Mushrooms because they were natural, I assumed that they were the safest of all the psychedelics and thought LSD was the most dangerous and if you did it you were insane. I figured only people that are insane would want to take this drug. I now know that the people that do are the strongest sanest people around <br><br>
We got to Florida I talked to my cousin after a long disconnect. We smoke weed. I have been smoking weed for a year. I asked him about psychedelics and he told me some great stories about the adventures in his mind. He said you know, I have something in my pocket that can make you trip and it's cleaner than a mushroom trip, unlock your mind.' I was nervous but I wanted to do it, so I did. <br><br>
The trip was mind-blowing, I found myself on a level where I had so much access to my subconscious. Sensory overload. To enplane this type of experience is like trying to explain to a blind person what it is like to see a garden. Or be it as if an unborn twin had to explain to his unborn twin brother after he had briefly came out of the womb only to go back in and then try to explain the experience to his unborn twin brother. Or if someone reading this was to visit some space bearing civilization more advanced than us than we are to the apes. Explaining their math to us would be like us explaining 2+2 to the apes. Do the intelligent beings use psychedelics? Did they unlock the powers of them? Are they required for intelligent life to advance their civilization past technological adolescence and not destroy themselves with the discovery of radioactive isotopes? Would the blind person on a dose of some psychedelic see the light? Would the unborn twin say that is crazy talk? Or would he say you are a god and never did I here anything more divine?<br><br>
After I was re born into the world I was mystified. I found out about the world of research chemicals. Before the operation web trip incident, the Internet was a psychedelic playing field. After the experience I was a changed person. I was not upset about the girl and was finding out I was wrong on my assumptions. I was free. Free from the shackle of the mind but not out of the cage. <br><br>
This is a tribute to 4-Aco-DET and to the fight to end the drug war and the death, violence, and convictions to people who just want a free life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Murders are serving 10 months because 60% of the world prison population in drug users.  <br><br>
