About 2 years ago I had a 6 weeks long hospital stay and 4 intense surgeries. During that time I fell in love with opiates. I had tried every drug except opiates, and always had no real problem in controlling addiction and using them recreationally. Well after the first shot of dilaudid in the ER I realized I was in for a serious ride. 2 years later and I have tried heroin (snorting), Oxycontinx80s (3 a day), smoking fentanyl gel (2-3 25mg patches a day), massive doses of poppy pod tea and pretty much any opiate I could get my grubby little hands on. <br><br>
I have gone through the withdrawals so many times in the past 2 years; I hate them more than anything in the world. Nose running like a faucet, horrible insomnia and horrible nightmares when sleep actually comes, goose skin, shakes, shivers, insane cold sweats, restless leg/arm syndrome, crazy depression, fire cracker ass and all the other hellish things that come after a binge. It is the absolute worst thing to experience and there appeared to be nothing to make them any better other than drinking myself stupid and smoking tons of weed. Well a few months ago I found a new doctor who I wanted to be honest with, he understood my problems and prescribed me Gabapentin to help with my nerve damage. <br><br>
After a month long binge of poppy tea and Oxy 80s it was time to quit once again and get my tolerance back along with my health. The first day I woke up feeling the withdrawals very hard; sweating, freezing (it was 80+ out), running nose, cough and most of all a horrible case of depression. This time seemed different, I wasnt ready, my mind was all messed up and I wanted to curl up and die. I took my normal 300mg dose of Gabapentin and then left for work dreading what the next 3-4 days has in store.<br><br>
After about an hour or so at work I realized my sickness was not as strong as it was when I awoke. I soon had the idea of searching the experience vault for Gabapentin and came across several others who found Gabapentin to ease off the withdrawal symptoms. I immediately popped 1200mg and an hour later realized nearly all the withdrawal symptoms had faded away! It was unbelievable! <br><br>
Feeling fine the rest of the day and falling asleep with no problem I awake again to feel the withdrawal symptoms, this time I popped 1500mg and an hour or so later I was feeling just fine! I took another 1500mg before bed that night and woke up feeling pretty good, so I took another dose and off to work I go being productive and talkative. <br><br>
After the 4th day I stopped the Gabapentin and realized I made it through the withdrawals without feeling like pure hell for 4 days in a row. Not only did it really help with my nerve pain, it almost cured opiate withdrawals.  It stopped the goose skin, the constant cold sweats, the horrible depression and somehow the runny nose and cough. I am so glad to have found this drug.<!-- End Body -->
