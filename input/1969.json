 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIn 1970, I had a back operation. I was 24, in excellent health, both physically and emotionally. I had just completed my first year of law school. After my experience with ketamine, I was advised, and agreed, to take a semester off from school. I was warned that I might experience flashbacks. I did not.\r\nI awoke from the anaesthesia to the the most petrifying, unpleasant experience of my life. I experienced hallucinations that were beyond description. I, also, experienced severe memory loss ... I was unable to recognize family and friends. I was, also, very anxious and restless. I said things that made no sense. According to the attending anaesthesiologist, I was 'insane' for five days. The attending, later, went to NIH to brief the doctors, there, of my reaction.\r\nMy family and I were later told that my reaction was worse than the norm, but certainly not atypical. I have always been surprised that this drug is still available, but I understand it does have positive pediatric and vet. uses.\r\nI am of the belief that a mature individual should be able to do with their body what they want, as long as no one else is injured. As a result of my experience, though, I would would certainly wonder why anyone would wish to experiment with ketamine. That is only one persons opinion, though. \n\n\n"
