I first heard about Coleus while searching for an alternative to Salvia divinorum as it is illegal in my country. <br><br>
I had recently downloaded some Coleus experiences to my PDA to read while I was watching TV. I had been waiting for a Calea zachatechi order I placed a few weeks ago so  when I read that some people had dream experiences after using Coleus I decided tonight I would give it a try. I had my Coleus blumei plant for approx 1yr growing inside near a window that receives the morning sun. My plant doesn't have huge leaves or much color due to it not receiving much light.<br><br>
T:0:00 - First I picked off a leaf approx 1 inch x 1/2 inch and wrapped it around a cigarette and smoked it wet this actually worked really well for smoking wet leaf and I experienced a small amount of euphoria and slightly brighter colors while watching TV.<br><br>
T:0:30 - I decided I would ingest some leaves to see if I could have a stronger experience so I picked off two leaves of the same size and rolled them up and held them under my tongue for approx 15mins and then placed them on my table. <br><br>
T:1:00 - Not much difference besides a small stomach ache, euphoria and brighter colors while watching TV so I decided to swallow the leaves I had placed on my table.<br><br>
T:1:30 - The effects were much the same so I got two bigger leaves this time approx 2inch x 1inch rolled them up and held them in my mouth for a while then chewed them up and swallowed them. I would describe the taste when I chewed the leaves as tasting like raw mushrooms the kind you buy at the supermarket only stronger in taste. Not bitter at all, I have no idea why people say it tastes bitter.<br><br>
T:2:00 - I felt like some of the leaf had stuck to my throat so I ate some chips to try and 'wash' it down. Almost immediately after eating the small stomach ache I had dissappeared. At this point I would describe the effects as euphoria, brighter, sharper/clearer vision and a sense of well-being very similar to codeine.<br><br>
T:2:30 - I decided I would go to bed and see if any dream experiences could be had. I went to the toilet and whilst there I found myself staring at the woodgrain on the door, it seemed interesting for some reason. I fell asleep very easy.<br><br>
T:?:?? - I had a dream that I was walking barefoot in the snow and I woke up and realised my feet were cold because they were not under my blanket. I covered my feet back up and fell back to sleep immediately.<br><br>
T:?:?? - I had another dream where I told a family member something I did not want them to know. I remember thinking why did I do that but then I realised this is just a dream it doesnt matter and I woke up. I was at the house where I grew up and no longer live. I remember thinking I can't be here then I realised I hadn't woken up I was still dreaming and at that moment I woke up for real.<br><br>
T:10:00 - No more dreams for the rest of the night (that I remember) and I awoke at my usual time feeling quite happy for the rest of the day.<br><br>
Conclusion: I never have/remember any dreams so I'm convinced Coleus blumei is a 'Dream Herb'. This was a small dose in my opinion as the leaves I used were small. I will definitely be trying this again with a higher dose/bigger leaves from my plant I have outdoors.<!-- End Body -->
