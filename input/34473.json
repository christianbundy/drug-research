 "report": "<p>Background: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.</p><p>Normally, I have a hard time getting to sleep. It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to get so sleep after going to bed, usually.</p><p>In short, my 'sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.</p><p>So, I decided to try some melatonin for a while to see if it will help me. I've been getting to bed around 5:00 AM for the last 3 nights (it was a weekend), and I have work tomorrow at 1:00 PM.</p><p>These are my notes on 1-day-short-of two weeks of using 1mg melatonin sublingual tablets as a sleep aid.</p><p>May 31 @ 2:50 AM</p><p>1mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>May 31 @ 3:30 AM</p><p>Another 1mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>Fell asleep: ~4:00 AM</p><p>June 1 @ ~3:00 AM</p><p>2mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>Fell asleep: ~4:00 AM</p><p>June 2 @ 2:30 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I'm finally tired @ 2:51 AM</p><p>Fell asleep: ~3:10</p><p>I am very tired upon waking.</p><p>June 2 @ 2:11 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>Fell asleep: ~2:30</p><p>I am extremely tired upon waking.</p><p>June 4th @ 2:20 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>Fell asleep: ~3:00 AM</p><p>I am very tired upon waking.</p><p>June 5th @ around 4: something AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>Fell asleep: around 5:00 - 6:00 AM </p><p>I am very tired upon waking.</p><p>June 6th @ 3:30 AM</p><p>3mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I am suddenly tired at 3:45 AM, went to bed.</p><p>No notes written down.</p><p>June 7th @ 1:00 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I awoke 6 to 7 hours later not 'groggy' or tired.</p><p>June 8th @ 1:50 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I didn't get to sleep for at least 45 minutes.</p><p>I slept 12 hours.</p><p>I am very tired upon awaking.</p><p>June 9th @ 4:09 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I went to bed at 4:14 AM.</p><p>I have to get up at 8:00 AM.</p><p>I slept 4 hours and got up, a little bit (but not very) tired.</p><p>June 10 @ 1:19 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual (after not sleeping all day)</p><p>I have to get up ~7:30 AM.</p><p>I got ~5-6 hours of sleep.</p><p>I was tired most of the day after waking up.</p><p>June 11 @ 3:05 AM</p><p>4mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>June 11 @ 3:20 AM</p><p>1mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I become tired @ 3:41 AM and go to bed. </p><p>I obtained sleep @ 4: something AM.</p><p>I got up @ 1:00 PM, but could have sleep for many hours more.</p><p>I am very tired upon awaking. </p><p>June 12 @ 5:52 AM</p><p>2mg melatonin sublingual</p><p>I'm tired anyway, but I'm taking two.</p><p>Thank God I don't have work tomorrow.</p><p>Basically, this stuff isn't helping, or I'm becoming too tolerant. It would be OK if I wasn't so tired in the mornings.</p><p>I noticed no diffence in the frequency or vividness of my dreams when I was taking it from when I wasn't.</p><p>Once this bottle runs out, I'm not buying another, but I'll use it untill it's all gone.</p>"
