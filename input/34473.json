 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nBackground: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.\r\nNormally, I have a hard time getting to sleep. It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to get so sleep after going to bed, usually.\r\nIn short, my 'sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.\r\nSo, I decided to try some melatonin for a while to see if it will help me. I've been getting to bed around 5:00 AM for the last 3 nights (it was a weekend), and I have work tomorrow at 1:00 PM.\r\nThese are my notes on 1-day-short-of two weeks of using 1mg melatonin sublingual tablets as a sleep aid.\r\nMay 31 @ 2:50 AM\r\n1mg melatonin sublingual\r\nMay 31 @ 3:30 AM\r\nAnother 1mg melatonin sublingual\r\nFell asleep: ~4:00 AM\r\nJune 1 @ ~3:00 AM\r\n2mg melatonin sublingual\r\nFell asleep: ~4:00 AM\r\nJune 2 @ 2:30 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI'm finally tired @ 2:51 AM\r\nFell asleep: ~3:10\r\nI am very tired upon waking.\r\nJune 2 @ 2:11 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nFell asleep: ~2:30\r\nI am extremely tired upon waking.\r\nJune 4th @ 2:20 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nFell asleep: ~3:00 AM\r\nI am very tired upon waking.\r\nJune 5th @ around 4: something AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nFell asleep: around 5:00 - 6:00 AM \r\nI am very tired upon waking.\r\nJune 6th @ 3:30 AM\r\n3mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI am suddenly tired at 3:45 AM, went to bed.\r\nNo notes written down.\r\nJune 7th @ 1:00 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI awoke 6 to 7 hours later not 'groggy' or tired.\r\nJune 8th @ 1:50 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI didn't get to sleep for at least 45 minutes.\r\nI slept 12 hours.\r\nI am very tired upon awaking.\r\nJune 9th @ 4:09 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI went to bed at 4:14 AM.\r\nI have to get up at 8:00 AM.\r\nI slept 4 hours and got up, a little bit (but not very) tired.\r\nJune 10 @ 1:19 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual (after not sleeping all day)\r\nI have to get up ~7:30 AM.\r\nI got ~5-6 hours of sleep.\r\nI was tired most of the day after waking up.\r\nJune 11 @ 3:05 AM\r\n4mg melatonin sublingual\r\nJune 11 @ 3:20 AM\r\n1mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI become tired @ 3:41 AM and go to bed. \r\nI obtained sleep @ 4: something AM.\r\nI got up @ 1:00 PM, but could have sleep for many hours more.\r\nI am very tired upon awaking. \r\nJune 12 @ 5:52 AM\r\n2mg melatonin sublingual\r\nI'm tired anyway, but I'm taking two.\r\nThank God I don't have work tomorrow.\r\nBasically, this stuff isn't helping, or I'm becoming too tolerant. It would be OK if I wasn't so tired in the mornings.\r\nI noticed no diffence in the frequency or vividness of my dreams when I was taking it from when I wasn't.\r\nOnce this bottle runs out, I'm not buying another, but I'll use it untill it's all gone.\n\n\n"
