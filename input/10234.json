 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter my experiences with snorting crushed up morphine sulfate pills, which were quite disappointing, I asked a friend why nothing really had happened. He told me snorting sulfate salts doesn't work well, since sulfates aren't that good water-soluble and I should change the morphine sulfate to morphine hcl, which is suitable for snorting.\r\n[edit: I checked that solubility matter and it turned out that morphine sulfate is even better soluble in water than the hydrochloride... So to be honest, I have no clue why the crushed pills did barely anything good. Lately I tried them again and they worked just as fine as the hcl.]\r\nI did so and ended up with about 300mg of pure morphine hcl powder. I divided the powder in 15 parts, 20mg each and snorted one of those little bumps. First thing I felt was a burning sensation in my nose, worse than that you get from meth. I was waiting for the effects to begin, but nothing really happened and I was getting disappointed, but then suddenly after 10mins the effects started to kick in.\r\nThis gave me a really nice feeling, that typical opiate high. You get relaxed, a little bit euphoric and don't care about nothing. I just sat down, read some magazines, listened to music and watched TV. I snorted the first bump at about 8pm and at 10:30pm I decided to do another little bump to intensify the feelings. I devided one of the 20mg bumps in two and snorted that. This time there were absolutely no pain, I wonder why? :) I continued reading, listening to music and watching TV for a few hours until 3am. Then I went to bed, had that dreamlike state I use to get when trying to sleep on opiates and finally felt asleep at 5am.\r\nThe conclusion is, that when you come across some morphine pills, which all are morphine sf, extract the morphine, change it to the HCl salt and snort it. Eating is a terrible waste (I need 80mg oral, but only 30mg nasal) so if you're not into IV'ing snort it.\r\nExtraction is easy:\r\n1) Dissolve crushed pills in water\r\n2) _Slowly_ add _little_ drops of an NaOH solution until the water reaches pH 9. Be sure not to add too much, because then the extraction fails and nothing happens.\r\n3) At pH 9 crystals should fall off, forming a clowd in the water. Put the glass in the freezer for about 10mins and filter out the crystals after that.\r\nWhat you now have is pure morphine freebase. Changing to HCl salt is easy, too:\r\n1) Dissolve in anhydrous (99%) alcohol.\r\n2) Add 1ml of HCl and shake.\r\n3) Let the alcohol evaporate (do NOT boil!) and you'll have some nice morphine hcl crystals.\r\n4) Have fun.\n\n\n"
