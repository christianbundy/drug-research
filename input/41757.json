 "report": "<p>For reasons I will not relate, I must refrain from all drug use.  I was particularly fond of psychedelics before I stopped using.  </p><p>Anyway, I turned my eyes to the good ole sanctioned three: caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.  Of these, Ive found nicotine to offer the most.  </p><p>They say you shouldnt inhale cigar smoke, which is probably a good idea.  However, there is this cigar in the shape of a cigarette brand.  Its got a filter.  I find it in the cigar sectionnot in the cigarette section as with other cigarettes.  I smoke one of these and I am DONE for a good five minutes.  Im talking drooling high--not the *joke* highs I get from regular cigarettes.  I smoke it like marijuana, taking in deep inhalations and holding the breath in as much as possible.  </p><p>Its dirt cheap too.  Cigarettes cost 25 cents each if I'm lucky.  These cost about 9 cents a pop.  Any way you slice it, its the best deallegal and cheap.  Best reserved for those who cant get any real drugs or especiallyas is my casethose who are weaning themselves off of real drugs.</p>"
