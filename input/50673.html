Well, first off, my mom is a nurse and has access to all those perscription drugs the companys send as samples. I have pretty severe insomnia but my mom won't let me get anything perscribed as she knows the effects of Ambien and Lunesta(which i've also used). I did convince her to give me some of both of those to help me sleep since it was messing with my grades at school, as I would frequently sleep during class. I have a few descriptions of what happens on Ambien in different doses to me. <br><br>
First:<br><br>
I took one 10mg Ambien with a glass of water on an empty stomach. I felt the effects within about 5 minutes. The initial onset was a feeling of relaxation and my body felt tired. Then after about 20 minutes I was really starting to feel it. I felt very sleepy and was relaxed if I was sitting down. After about 45 minutes I was more or less drunk off of it. It's a very intoxicating drug. I get dizzy and a state of euphoria. My mind isn't really there during the whole thing. I just sort of act and don't think about it. I found this out by trying to light up a joint in front of my mom, she didn't like that. After about an hour and half I gave in and went to sleep. I slept very well that night and the pill wears off well and I don't feel very different the next day.<br><br>
Now for a bad story.<br><br>
One time I was bored and decided to do what I thought would be funner than 10mg or 20mg which I had done inbetween these two storys. The 20mg just intensified the effects, it probably tripled the intoxicated feeling. <br><br>
So, I decided that I would take 60mg of Ambien. I spent 15 minutes trying to get the pills out of their little case thing the samples come in. Then popped them with water on an empty stomach again. I really don't remember anything about it but I know a few things.<br><br>
I took them around 12:00 and most likely before 12:30 I was out. Completely passed out. I remember coming to during first hour of school at about 8:30. I was playing baseketball with someone I didn't know. That was about a minute of what I remember. The next thing I remember is around 9:00 I woke up in second hour when a friend smacked my head. <br><br>
Later that day I found out from my girlfriend that I had called her numerous times in the early hours of the morning and left voicemails that sounded very intoxicated with random jabbering. Then I found out that in the morning when my mom had tried to wake me up she had alot of difficulty with me. I don't remember any of it at all. She also said that I was wobbling around the house looking for things I didn't need. <br><br>
I later tried taking 40mg on a night that I wouldn't have school to worry about. I don't remember anything here either. I just went straight to sleep and woke up. <br><br>
I would not reccomend taking more than 20-30mg of this unless your alot bigger than me. <br><br>
Now, it's 11:15 and i'm typing this report up. I'm bored so i'm going to take approximently 15mg of ambien and stay with the report for a few hours to try to explain the effects in more detail. <br><br>
T:11:20 PM - 15mg Ambien down the hatch. I ate some soup at around 10:00-10:30 so i'm not completely empty. I poped in the movie titanic to gimme somethin to do.<br><br>
T:11:30 PM - It's only 10 minutes in and I can already feel that i'm getting tired. I also noticed that sounds seem louder and more clearer for some reason. <br><br>
T:12:40 AM - I have been feeling pretty good and the dizzy feeling is more like when I move my head my vision has a little bit of lag and takes a few seconds to catch up. I felt as though I didn't take enough and don't have anymore to take so I went upstairs and took a few swigs of Arbor Mist to try and up the effects a little. <br><br>
T:1:40 AM - Well, the alcohol made me pretty tired and i've had enough fun for tonight. I'm going to check out and go to sleep. <br><br>
I'm not going to bother to type anything about tomorrow. I'm sure i'll feel as normal as I can. Hope this helps anyone trying Ambien. It's a fun drug but there are better things.<!-- End Body -->
