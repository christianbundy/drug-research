 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThe doctors have had me perscribed to seroquel for the past 2 years. I finally against medical advice stopped taking it for many reasons. \r\n1. I was building a tolerance to it \r\n2. It made my blood pressure go way up and slow it down too \r\n3. I fucking hate the effects. Pretty much the effects I got from it were drowsiness, difficult motor skills (hard to walk), slurred speach, difficulty concentrating, mild hallucinations, and loss of concentration. I would take 25 mgs in the morning for anxiety and 230 at night for sleep. For awhile it worked as an alright sleep aid. But when I took it during the day it made anything really hard to do. The most i took was 2400mgs. Not a very good experience. But didn't overdose. In fact I didn't think I could overdose off it. Its not very fun recreationally and sucks.\n\n\n"
