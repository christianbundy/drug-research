I had heard that dramamine was an interesting and cheap way to hallucinate. After reading all of the stories on the site I decided to also try this over the counter pill. I smoke a lot of pot and drink a couple times a week, but that is the extent of my experience. With this in mind I decided to eat 6 of the pills. I chose the original formula and made sure I was well hydrated and ate a good meal beforehand. My friend and I both took 6 of the pills and since I knew that people tended to sometimes freak out on the dramamine we also had a friend there who was sober. I am not the type of person to take unnecessary risks.<br><br>
Approximately 40 minutes after taking them I felt a strong sensation of tingling in my limbs and my speech was slurred. It was neither pleasant or unpleasant, just weird. I sat down to watch television and that was when the drug became unpleasant. I felt strong waves of the drug come through my body and then suddenly I would feel sober. It was extremly difficult to walk and I managed to drop the one beer I drank all over my lap. After this my skin was very itchy and I had repeated sensations of bugs biting my feet. My scalp and face were also itchy. <br><br>
  Talking was difficult because I felt like I was making sense, but my roommates would just laugh at me. They said I was 'speaking drammamine.' It is also important to note that although my roommate was sitting next to me, I could also hear him in the next room talking. Very strange. <br><br>
  The reason I regretted taking the pills was the next day. I felt as if I had gotten the worst nights sleep ever. I had twitches all day and my scalp still itches. Loud music was unbearable and I felt nauseous and crabby all day. I am just glad I only took 6 pills and can only imagine what the hangover must have been for the people who took anything more than 10.  Just watch out for the fucking godawful hangover.<!-- End Body -->
