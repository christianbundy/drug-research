I forgot all about an old roommate that was coming buy and he was trying to find a car part. He had left here he also brought two of his friends with him witch is not cool the guy was ok and polite but his girlfriend was very  how do I put this  snooty. When she walked in the first thing she did was make a face and stare right into my eyes with the expression, WTF are you on? So I quickly turned away and let them look for the part they tore up my big closet looking for it. I was too incapacitated to look for it but I was still walking around looking for it after they left I was like totally stressed out and wanted not to trip anymore because I was full of bad vibes. I ate two downers and was awaiting them to kick in so I would at least not be feeling so bad.<br>2:50 PM - I decide to take a few nitrous hits and see if I can get ride of nasty feelings it works and brings back melting a bit and trails but I am totally worn out and decide to just chill and listen to music.<br>3:31 PM - Back to a smooth ride no problems.<br>5:50 PM - Coming down decide to go to sleep.<br>10:22 AM (next day) - Awoke from sleep refreshed.\n\n\n"
