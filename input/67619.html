We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous. <br><br>
The author of this report incorrectly refers to the inhalant used as nitrous oxide. It is not nitrous oxide. See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=2706">What is in computer duster?</a>]</font><br><br>
I was inhaling nitrous (sic) from a dust remover can while my friend played Guitar Hero. He was really engrossed in the game, and I kept holding the nitrous (sic) in longer and longer. Finally I dissociated so bad that I went blind, forgot how to breathe, and passed out.<br><br>
When I came to I had a mild concussion and a bump on the back of my head the size of a grapefruit. I had to go to the hospital, couldn't sleep for days... Please learn from this story and be careful when you do shit like this, alright? Especially don't stand up on a concrete floor.<!-- End Body -->
