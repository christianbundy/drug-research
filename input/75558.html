Age 21, 5'10'  <br><br>
So I got tired of waiting around for someone to offer me lsd so I decided to search online for natural plants that contained psychedelics.  So i found many plants that interested me.  One in perticular being Ibogaine in the iboga root bark.  I did some mescaline the other day before I tried the iboga and thought that the iboga would have similar effects than the mescaline.  Wrong.  Iboga is totally different.  More powerful.  <br><br>
At first i ordered 2 grams and grinded it up in coffee grinder and mixed it with a fruit drink to mask the HORRIBLE taste.  After an hour or 2 i feel as if i am roling on ecstasy and I also saw some flashing and then it went away after a few hours.  So  I then ordered 4 grams after and then grinded it up in my grinder and drank it with fruit drink.  I was in my apartment with music playing on my computer while also playing visualizations on winamp.<br><br>
After two hours i threw up and the felt better and started to trip. I should have taken pepto-bismol an hour after i drank the iboga so that I did not have to through up the iboga. <br><br>
I started to feel it.  Started to see things. colorful texture on everything. <br><br>
After about 5 hours a new stage in this drug experience happened.  I began to feel different, the drug was kicking in more!  I can try to describe what was going on with me.  This drug was making the smarter. Opening up my head so that I could think VERY clearly.  Normally my memory is bad because I smoke a lot of marijuana and usually forget what I am saying or thinking and can not recall it ever, but with the iboga I could remember everything with lighting speed.  It has been 2 days since I have done it and my head is still above what it should be.  The drug made me think of different persectives on live that I would have never of thought of with out this drug.    I felt free, I felt smarter and I felt as if a new chapter in life has started for me.<br><br>
The drug lasted about 15 hours and i still had some after effects more than 24 hours later. I am ready for 8 grams.<br><br>
I dont' know why there are no good experience reports about this drug, so I decided to give ya'll some information. I am also planning on extracting dmt from plants and drinking Ayahuasca.  5-meo-dmt looks interesting too.  I love san pedro cactus too!  I want to try shrooms too.  I am growing them now. (fyi)<br><br>
Overall the experience was unforgettable and very theraputic for me.<!-- End Body -->
