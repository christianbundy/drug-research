 "report": "\n\n\n\nMDMA Protocol\r\nNight prior (8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg\r\nMorning on waking: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. (Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or\r\nOyster Shell) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP\r\nIngestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets\r\nBooster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP\r\n4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg\r\nRemarks:\r\nCal-Mg is best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate (Dolomite).\r\nTotal dose is about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also\r\nnote, that the Jaw is the primal expressive organ for all  chordates, and\r\nserotonin very applicable. Full leeches given serotonin then double their\r\nblood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessens jaw problems, part of psych\r\nprep for new users (sez my foaf).\r\nProzac reduces tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies\r\nthe wiped out feeling for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs\r\nsuch as Zoloft.\r\n5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasts longer. Seems to\r\nallow learning to be absorbed better.\r\nNote that side effects curve is steep, try 20mg less and you may have much\r\nless of them.\r\nPS. This protocol is very effective and known to work well.\n\n\n"
