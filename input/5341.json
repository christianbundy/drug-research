 "report": "\n\n\n\nMDMA Protocol<br>Night prior (8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg<br>Morning on waking: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. (Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or<br>Oyster Shell) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP<br>Ingestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets<br>Booster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP<br>4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg<br>Remarks:<br>Cal-Mg is best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate (Dolomite).<br>Total dose is about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also<br>note, that the Jaw is the primal expressive organ for all  chordates, and<br>serotonin very applicable. Full leeches given serotonin then double their<br>blood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessens jaw problems, part of psych<br>prep for new users (sez my foaf).<br>Prozac reduces tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies<br>the wiped out feeling for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs<br>such as Zoloft.<br>5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasts longer. Seems to<br>allow learning to be absorbed better.<br>Note that side effects curve is steep, try 20mg less and you may have much<br>less of them.<br>PS. This protocol is very effective and known to work well.\n\n\n"
