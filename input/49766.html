This whole experience started when I first learned about Speed Balling. I was watching something on TV I think it was called Vice squad or something like that. It was a cop show, not a fictional one but a real one it was sort of a documentary a lot like Cops (the show) but, only dealing with drugs, prostitution and gambling in some area (I forgot) of San Francisco. My curiosity sparked when a cop started talking about Speed Balling, which is traditionally injecting both Heroin and Cocaine. <br><br>
I went on the Internet later to look for information, and found that Speed Balling was also a well know term for injecting Methamphetamine and Heroin. I also learned that Speed Balling was also a term used to describe mixing uppers and downers. I also read of health risks saying that it was bad for the heart and a few other things too. However I still wanted to try it because trying something once or even many times as long as its not consistent or something that I do continually has never really effected my life or my health much. But, before I go into my experience let me tell you a little about my drug history. The first drug I ever tried was Alcohol after that it was: <br><br>
2: Tobacco <br>
3: Weed<br>
4: Amphetamines (Adderall) <br>
5: Dxm<br>
6: Cocaine (powder) <br>
7: Vicodin<br>
8: NutMeg<br><br>
After I had tried these drugs I became a huge Pothead. I was using as much as I possibly could afford and because I am only 17 (16 when I started) I don't really have to support myself, so all the money I made from my job went to buying Weed, pipes and other Weed paraphernalia. The greatest part was that because I lived in California I was getting the best Weed in the country, often times from the Club. That meant I was always guaranteed to get really blasted no matter what kind of weed I was buying.<br><br>
Good things do however go away, as my dealer and my friend that I also got Weed from both basically pooped out on me. My friend simply stopped being reliable and I found myself fronting money to him all the time although sometimes he came though eventually a bunch of stuff happened that got me really frustrated and I vowed never to buy from or smoke with him again. Then much later my dealer quit and stopped selling. Since I moved to a very small private school at this point I no longer had access to a large public high school where I could make connections. At this point I got desperate and started using my prescription Adderall from when I was a kid, to get high much more often then I usually did and tried DXM a few more times as well.<br><br>
Now to my experience, it was around 10:00 AM when I decided I really wanted to get high and try something new, I quickly considered Speed Balling with Adderall and Vicodin and decided that I would do it. The only problem was that my dad who had been prescribed Vicodin for an injury a while ago and had only three pills left because I had taken most of them, knowing that he would never notice as long as a few remained because he doesnt take them anymore.<br><br>
I built up the courage to steal one (plenty enough for me to feel the effects). I then took one of my 20mg Adderall pills and broke it in half so that it would be 10 mgs. This may seem like a low amount but it is enough to get me pretty high and I wanted to feel the Vicodin too. This was at around 10:20. I then took the 10mgs of Adderall and ground it up into powder in a cup using a skin makeup container. The top of the cap had lettering on it that stuck out and had a somewhat thin edge around the top of the cap both of these features made it easy to grind up the pill.<br><br>
At around 10:25 I poured the orange powder from the cup onto a CD case, I then used a playing card to make it into two lines. I quickly snorted the two lines with a straw that was cut at the length of about a rolled up dollar bill, maybe shorter. I then began inhaling sharply in my right nostril to make sure that all of the Adderall was being absorbed. When I was done with that I swallowed a 5mg pill of Adderall. After this I pulled out my Vicodin pill broke it in half and swallowed both parts at the same time, while washing it down with several hearty swigs of water. <br><br>
At this point I am already feeling the woozy, euphoric and speedy feelings of the Adderall and I am given an especially strong rush because I snorted it. Something like an hour later I begin to feel the full effects of the Vicodin although the effects were somewhat muffled by the Adderall, which is dominating the high at this point. As the Vicodin effected me I felt a soothing and euphoric tingly feeling throughout my body, as well as a narcotic effect that was mostly countered from the Adderall. Although the Adderall was dominating, I was feeling both highs at once. It felt fantastic, the combined high almost felt like an orgasm but, a little different. <br><br>
At around 12:00 Pm I got enough balls to steal another pill, leaving one left. I then took a white Pseudoephedrine pill that is the same size as the Vicodin pill. I wiped the label off and made a groove in the middle of the pill so it would look like a Vicodin pill and since I know for a fact that my dad doesnt take them anymore he will never know the difference. I then popped the Vicodin pill and waited for about 30 or 40 minutes for it to take effect. After I waited I snorted another 10mgs of Adderall. This time the Vicodin is dominating and the Tingly euphoria is much stronger then before. I am also feeling more sedated then before. This time I enjoyed the combined high more with the Vicodin dominating it, then I did before. These feelings end about 3 or 4 hours later and I am left with a weak Adderall high, in order to go to sleep that night I had to take sleeping pills.<!-- End Body -->
