 "report": "<p>Smoked 4 pipes of fresh leaf, and one pipe of flowers/seeds. 5+minutes - feeling something, nervous jittery, the curtain is moving upward slowly and doging from side to side ever so slightly. Doubt this is a 'placebo' effect. </p><p>10+minutes - I feel a bit stoned, my fingers have slight, jittery trails as I am typing.</p><p>15+minutes - monitors refresh rate more noticable, appreciable connection to geometric/psychedelic patterns, pupils constricted</p><p>p.s I am going to try some more, intruiging to say the least.</p><p>- 5/30/2004</p>"
