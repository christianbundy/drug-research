I was looking for an alternative to getting back on ritalin after deciding I am the definitive poster child for ADD.  At age 37 I have a business that should be 10x more successful, six half finished movie scripts and countless other brilliant ideas on the 'back burner.'  I am now officially drug free (no weed, coke, alcohol, nictone--nothing) but feel a mild stimulant of some kind will help me gain needed momentum.  Because quite frankly, a daydreaming slacker doesn't have a chance in today's workaholic businessworld.<br><br>
I heard about Modafinil from reading an article on the internet about a guy who described his experience as 'remarkable,all I wanted to do was work, and I was happier than hell while I was plugging away, wanted to work more at end of day', etc. So I ordered some Alertec (no prescription/ consultation required, which seemed strange for a stimulant) from a company labeling them smart drugs (another red flag).  <br><br>
My overall take on Modafinil?  It almost worked.  But not quite.  Kinda of like smoking catnip as opposed to dirt weed.  Modafinil did keep me awake,  so I tried 300 mg thinking my dosage was too low.  Nothing extra, I could not discern the difference.  Don't see the point of trying 400mg.  Modafinil, in my opinion should be used like coffee--only to stay awake.<!-- End Body -->
