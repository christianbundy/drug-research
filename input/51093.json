 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis will be my first experience with cyclobenzaprine.  I acquired a few lately and thought I'd give them a shot.  I'm an opiate lover at heart, and I've heard they are comparable to low-potency opiates.  I have experience with a large range of opiods, benzos, hallucinogens as well as have used amphetamines, soma, marijuana and cocaine in the past.  I smoke about a pack of cigarettes a day and take an expansive vitamin supplement daily, but I should be clear of any other substances that may interfere.\r\nI will be conducting this experiment with a friend that has also never used the substance before. The pills I will be using are small white 10mg tablets with DAN imprinted on one side and 5658 on the other.  My friend apparently has the brand name pills.\r\nT: 11:50pm, +0:00\r\nSo, my friend and I sit down in her dorm room (a single) and decide to test it out.  I start out by powdering half of a 10mg pill.  I have read from other reports insuffulation is not ideal but stubbornly decide to do it anyway.  Of course, it burns intensely and is almost unbearable.  I don't think I've ever snorted anything this miserable.  I decide to eat the rest of the 5mgs left instead.\r\nT: 12:20am +0:30\r\nMy nose still burns but is tapering off.  I'm feeling mildly sedated and relaxed, but it may just be me hoping for something to happen.\r\nT: 12:25am +0:35\r\nNot feeling much so I decide to ingest an additional 10mg pill.\r\nT: 12:35am +0:45\r\nMy friend and I are feeling slightly loopy and off as well as a bit lazy.  We are laying around on the floor not in any mood to move.  Neither of us can describe the feeling exactly, but I'd say there's a tingling body buzz and sedation of the muscles.\r\nT: 12:50am +1:00\r\nEffects setting in, but I wouldn't say entirely euphoric.  We decide to go on a walk to a coffee shop a couple blocks away.  On this walk, we realize severe time distortion.  This is normally a seven or eight minute quick walk, but both of us feel it is taking forever to get there.  At the coffee shop my friend orders a ice cream, and I order a coffee and piece of chocolate cake.  While walking to the table, I stumble and spill coffee everywhere.  Obviously, coordination has been compromised, but I seem to have no conscious knowledge of it.  After about two minutes sitting down, my friend decides she feels uncomfortable in public, and we leave.  The walk back seems to take about two hours.\r\nT: 01:20am +1:30\r\nArrive back at the dorm room.  Both of us have marked coordination loss.  Mental effects are minimal.  I just feel lazy and tired--little euphoria.  We proceed to lay on the floor for a while.\r\nT: 01:55am +2:05\r\nWe have been laying around doing nothing for some time.  Time distortion has become severe.  Five minutes feels like an hour.  I don't really feel like writing this any more but will continue anyway.\r\nT: 02:15am +2:25\r\nWell, in my journal I scribbled a giant question mark and wrote something indistinguishable.\r\nT: 03:10am +3:20\r\nI am completely useless.  My friend and I have not moved in a good hour.  She says it feels 'like I have been shot and can't move my body and am sedated without much euphoria.'\r\nT: 03:45am +4:55\r\nI use up the rest of my energy to go have a cigarette.  For some reason, it tastes surprisingly good.  After this, we basically decided there was nothing to do but make out and roll around on the ground.  We passed out at about 6:30am-ish but easily could have done so sooner.\r\nI woke up the next day at baseline without any noticeable after-effects.  Overall, I am somewhat disappointed.  The sedative effects were definitely present during the entire experience.  There was a slightly loopy period at the beginning but not nearly as nice as the loopy period of an opiate buzz.  Euphoria was minimal.  Time distortion was an definitely a major factor.  Coordination became continually worse throughout the night.  The hand-writing in my journal became progressively worse as well.  I will probably give another chance at a slightly lower dose, but I'd rather stick to opiods.\n\n\n"
