 "report": "<p>I was on percocet 10 for a year when my supply ran out. I went into withdrawal and my anxiety Came back. I was bed ridden and eating My klonopins with no relief. </p><p>I went to my moms House to see what she had and all she had was 4 bottles of samples of 100 mg Neurontin, 100 pills per bottle. She said it was a pain reliever so I took 6 pills and about an hour later I started getting a small buzz and my withdrawals were</p><p>gone. I felt normal and with no anxiety.</p><p>I am 4 days into this with no percocets and I still feel great. I'm taking 6 neurontin 3 times a day. No buzz after last day but I still feel great...it is a life saver.</p>"
