I was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive Type (was ADD back then) when I was 7 years old.  Immediately I was put on Ritlan, then Adderall later on.  I have been having complaints about the side effects of Adderall (not lasting long enough, irritable, depressed, anti-social) so my doctor recommended Vyvanse.  <br><br>
I was started out on a 30mg dose, which didn't really do much after the first couple days.  Just last week my dose was increased to 50mg.  I have to say, I love this medication!  It lasts all day, unlike the Adderall which I had to take a second dose in the late afternoon.  It helps me focus like crazy, the first few times I took it were intense, but now I am starting to get used to it and it is has such a nice, steady, even effect.<br><br>
7:45am Ingest orally after eating a small breakfast.<br><br>
8:00am Starting to feel perky and motivated, appetite decreasing.<br><br>
8:10am Definitely feeling focused and motivated, in a great mood.  Don't want to eat at all, but my mouth is very dry so I drink some water.<br><br>
8:15am Medication is in full effect and I am ready to get some work done.  Cleaning, laundry, planning meals for the kids, playing with the baby.  Still no appetite but dry mouth is still there.<br><br>
12:30pm Vyvanse is still in full effect and I am not hungry at all but I force myself to eat a bowl of cereal.<br><br>
3:30pm Still going strong, I feel great and have accomplished quite a bit.  Spent a couple hours blogging and editing photos, now to help older son with his homework.<br><br>
5:30pm Peppy feeling starting to fade and my appetite is starting to increase.  Still in a great mood.  Making dinner for the family now.<br><br>
8:00pm Effects of Vyvanse are now pretty much all gone, I feel a bit restless, but it is definitely chill time.<br><br>
10:00pm Headed to bed, have to take Ambien most nights in order to fall asleep quickly.  Without the Ambien I will usually toss and turn for 30 min or so.<!-- End Body -->
