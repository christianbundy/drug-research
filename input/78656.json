 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThe Purpose of this report is inform the recreational community on the effects of CP 55,940:\r\nThis being my second report on CP5, it could be the last. I feel I have learned everything about it I need to. I have gone through withdrawal, overcame it, and now use CP5 as an alternative to Cannabis. \r\nI ended use of CP5 for 2 weeks to re-evaluate its use from a sober state. This re-evaluation occurred last night, and the effect was identical to that of vaporizing marijuana. And last night, having lost tolerance, I was ultimately high off of only a few milligrams...rather than the 30mg-a-day I was doing before. \r\nSo responsible use is the best way to enjoy this, so I can achieve that 'perfect' high that is found with both marijuana and CP5 when used after a long sobriety-streak. End of report.\n\n\n"
