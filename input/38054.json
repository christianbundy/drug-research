 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nComponents - 7g Mimosa hostilis Rootbark, and 3.5g of Syrian Rue Seeds\r\nSetting - house, sofa bed, dimmed lights, with continous music playing\r\nIt has been an hour since I drank the syrian rue tea, and pretty soon, I was going to drink the mimosa, The MAOI has taken full effects, and many hallucinogenic effects were already noticed, the cannabis high felt the strongest I had ever felt it, I was seeing long tracers whenever I moved my arms, or saw anything move, auras of light appeared when I moved my fingers, it was very nice already, and no nausea from the syrian rue, I hadn't eaten much in the last 7 hours, and cannabis is a great stomach settler.\r\nIt is now midnight.\r\nChug... 2 gulps is all I get down, YUCK!\r\nThe mimosa tea goes down the throat and I feel like I literally had just drank a tree, my throat grows bark,  and the taste is that of root bark concentrate. I took a bong hit to avoid nausea, but there was nothing I could avoid. \r\nI feel my body trancending immediantly to a weird place, I feel sorta cosmic, I also feel theres tree bark concentrate still inside me, and I feel my own body rejecting it, I feel my stomach rumbling, my whole body buzzing, it was less than ten minute later, and the vomit came strong.\r\nI barfed my ass off, and had a bunch of unpleasant dry heaves, but damn it was nice to get that root bark concentrate out of my stomach, I feel alot better now, and go, and lay on the bed. Four of us had dranken the same dose that night, and we all were through with the nausea, smoked another bowl, and laid down with a playlist of music playing.\r\nMy first reaction when I laid down was to close my eyes, and I didn't open them again for over two hourse. I was feeling warm, and relaxed, something pure feeling, not as chaotic as expected, to me it was wonderful, it was a plane where there were no limits of time, or space, not even a limit of imagination, I was surrounded by artwork, what beatiful paintings, odd looking animals, and plants, indian paintings, awesome designs. Processes of creation, destruction, an rebirth flowed through my consiousness. I was given a nice lesson to the cycle of life. Around the peak of the trip, I was flying over top of a mountain range thousands of feet up, and it was a very euphoric sensation, everything in this realm seemed out of this world.\r\n2 hours had passed, I had traveled space, and time, I remember skipping from one song of a playlist, actually hearing another, then hearing the first one again, these time warps are experienced a few times in my journeys with DMT, and DPT. Eventually I opened my eyes, and we all had a very positive experience, it felt like reborn with another chance to live in harmony again with everything, this wasn't a realistic feeling, but it was the nice afterglow experienced the hours, and days after the ayahuasca adventure. In  the future I hope to take this adventure again.\n\n\n"
