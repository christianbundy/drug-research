T, R, and I decided the day before to do salvia.  I had read a lot about it, have done mushrooms in the past, and described to them what to expect of the experience: that many people dont hallucinate the first time and if my friends did hallucinate, it wouldnt last too long and I assured them it would not result in a bad trip, as long as they believed that it wouldnt.  T had already tried it two days prior and said it felt as if a ton of bricks hit him in the face and that he had to lean back, but he did not hallucinate.  R and I had never tried it before.<br><br>
I told them that they had to hold it in as long as possible so that we could take the fewest hits and feel it to the fullest.  I also asked that we all pass it quickly so as to not waste any.  Since I bought the salvia, they decided I should take the first hit.  Before I started, I got my music ready because I enjoyed music when I was on mushrooms and noticed it intensified and added to the trip while it was playing.  I specifically and carefully chose music  stuff that I really enjoy and songs that have a lot of emotions embedded in them. <br><br>
I packed the bowl, took my hit and passed the piece.  I held the hit for about a minute and then exhaled.  Once I exhaled, I began to feel minor effects.  The way I described the feeling was like being really high on weed.  I also got a pretty warm.<br><br>
I went to pack another bowl because I could tell I wasnt as far as I was going to be able to get during this experience.  My hands were a little unsteady, I was laughing hysterically, and I had difficulty determining how much I had put in the bowl so far, so I just filled it all the way.  I hit it again, having difficulty remembering how to take my finger off the carb, and passed it.  I was listening to Hey You by Pink Floyd.  After I held in the hit as long as I could, I exhaled and felt like I should sit back.  I was at the part in the song about the ear against the wall when the hallucinations began.<br><br>
It felt like it took forever to lean back against the mat behind me.  While I was leaning back, I had to duck a bit as a green half-dome (like a sideways awning) came up over my head in proportion to how far back I leaned.  I thought of it as a sort of shield, but Im not sure why.  Things quickly progressed from there.<br><br>
The left side of the room was normal, but the right was strange.  Just to the right I could see myself floating above and a bit to the left of a stone wall.  Everything beyond the wall was bluish-gray and seemingly snow-covered.  I realized I was choosing to stay to the left because to the right of the wall was insanity, but the left was still sane, and I wanted to remain there to tell the others what I was seeing.  I was also very scared that if I went over the wall I would never come back and that I would possibly be wandering around in some sort of self-created Hell for the rest of my life.  Over the wall, there was no sign of human influence.  It was mostly empty with sparse patches of grass, some bushes, and a few hibernating trees, all still in grayscale and with some snow on the ground.  It was beautiful, pristine, and eerie all at the same time. As much as I wanted to look, I couldnt quite seem to turn my head to look over the wall to, I had to use my peripheral vision.  I came back to reality to but it was only a fantasy.  The wall was too high, as you can see, or right around that part in the song.  During this scene I felt as if Roger Waters, himself, was talking directly to me.<br><br>
After explaining what I had seen to T and R, we all decided that we should do more, mostly because they werent feeling too much and I was really excited that the salvia had worked.  During this time Breathe in the Air by Pink Floyd was playing.  I filled the bowl again and started it up.  <br><br>
This time the hallucinations came on full-force.  The song playing was Opening Mandlebrot by Blue Man Group.  I said, Woah, I gotta sit back  Uh Im f***ed...  You guys continue if you want Go ahead and fill it again if you want.  The transition was seamless and I didnt even realize for a while that I was hallucinating.  I dont remember how it began or what happened for a while.  I finally realized that I was standing on a low, yellow pier or dock of sorts leading to an ocean of the bluest, purest water imaginable.  There were a few people talking at the end of the dock outcrop that led the furthest into the ocean, but I regrettably didnt pay much attention to them*.  Another person or being was next to me.  Although I could not see it, I felt it was there and I believe it was trying to talk to me*.<br><br>
*I had a feeling that these two instances played a larger role in the part of the hallucination that I cant remember.  All I remember is saying, Theyre telling me things, but I dont know what those things were.  R, who was sitting across from me, was the only thing from the room that was I could now see and I proceeded to tell him everything I was seeing in as much detail as I could.  When I came back to the room, Muses Starlight was half over.  I also noticed that T was there and I was a little surprised.  I quickly remembered that he had left on a sailboat for a long journey earlier in my trip.  (Later I discovered that at that time, he was half-hallucinating about the old Mickey Mouse on a steamboat.)<br><br>
I asked them what I had told them about what I was seeing, but they said that I didnt say too much, that I was barely talking.  I was shocked and a very scared about their response, but they clarified their statement by saying that I was whispering and mumbling a bit, but they couldnt really understand what I was saying.  I believe the reason for things happening specifically to the right of me was due to me only putting the right ear bud in.  They still said they didnt feel much, so I decided to fill one last bowl and I let T start it, and when it came back to me, I finished it.  Map of the Problematique by Muse was playing, and this time I absolutely had to lean back  it felt as if some force was pulling me back.<br><br>
The various items on the floor werent really staying in place, they were sort of moving in little circles.  There was also a part on the carpet that seemed fluid with two streams beside each other  the left stream flowing towards me and the right flowing away.  I noticed that there were some slanted lines moving across the wall.  These lines were the imprints of waves on the room.  I suppose I had hallucinated before seeing those lines, but I dont remember it.  I then decided to see what closing my eyes would do for me and I put the other ear bud in.<br><br>
I immediately moved back behind my eyes.  I could see the backside of my face and it was full of action.  The backside of my face had a dark blue color to it and there were all sorts of lighter blue patterns morphing and dancing about.  The air or the rest of what I could see that wasnt my face was red.  I was completely amazed and baffled by this scene and I remember thinking, I never knew this was here!  My vision then started to move back to my eyes, slanting more and more down until I could barely see the backside of my face with its amazing display.  I was thinking, Im not ready [to leave] yet, and I was very sad that I had to leave, for a while I fought to stay.  However, I soon accepted that it was time to leave and I moved back into my eyes and opened them.<br><br>
Most of the time throughout this experience, I forgot that the others couldnt hear my music and I would talk over it so they could hear me or reference it.  The whole experience only lasted about 30-45 minutes from sitting down and starting to getting up and leaving.  That night I also had an insanely detailed dream that was just as amazing as the experience itself.<br><br>
I came out very amazed at all that had happened to me during my first experience with salvia.  I was very excited and fairly pleased with what happened, though I wished I focused more on what the other beings had to say - were they the same beings that other users often talk about?<!-- End Body -->
