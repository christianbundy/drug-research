 "report": "<p>\nThe setting: I am alone in a redwood forest at 2 pm, temperature is 80 degrees, little wind. Vey peaceful and quiet. Put on CD of Standing Stones of Callanish, track 4.</p><p>DMT input: I smoke the DMT from a glass crack pipe, with a 1 inch chamber. I hold the first hit for about 20 seconds, then do the second hit.</p><p>The Experience: I lay on my back and look at the trees against the sky. They come alive, become crystal jewels, very more real looking with great depth perception. I sense the place of each branch in space. The trees sway in a slow breeze. The breeze stops, but a few branches keep gyrating. I feel the unity of the forest. Nothing is out of place, nothing needs to be done. The forest is an ocean of joy and love. I feel the life force of the trees. They are like playful children, touching the air and sun and each other's branches.</p><p>They have awareness. They exist in an ancient, timeless, bliss.</p>"
