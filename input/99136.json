 "report": "\n\n\n\nThis report is short and its purpose is to just outline what I found to be the positives and negatives. The following summarizes the doses and effects that I experienced.<br>Typical Dose:  -Oral = ~ 10  30 mg <br>               -Insufflated = ~ 5  30 mg<br>Note: My doses varied wildly and depended completely on my tolerance.<br>Duration: <br>-Oral: Onset = ~30 minutes<br>       Peak = ~1 Hour<br>       Duration = ~3  4 Hours<br>-Insufflated: Onset = ~ 0  10 minutes<br>              Peak = ~15  25 minutes<br>              Duration = ~1  2 Hours<br>Positive Effects:<br>- Stimulation (Mental and Physical).<br>- Mild euphoria (Less pronounced from oral doses).<br>- Increased concentration.<br>- Increased desire to talk.<br>- Clear headed (No visual or audio distortions noted).<br>Negative Effects:<br>- It was easy to become over stimulated (Jitters, sweating and reduced circulation to extremities).<br>- Anxiety (It was very easy to become anxious).<br>- Agitation (Particularly on the comedown from insufflated doses).<br>- Increased sensitivity to light (Bright screens could be dazzling).<br>- Lethargy (It was hard to have energy to do unwanted/unplanned tasks).<br>- I also found it to be damaging to my mucus membranes (Ethylphenidate is alkaline with pH ~9)<br>- Psychologically addictive (I found it very easy to redose).\n\n\n"
