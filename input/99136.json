The following summarizes the doses and effects that I experienced.\r\nTypical Dose:  -Oral = ~ 10  30 mg \r\n               -Insufflated = ~ 5  30 mg\r\nNote: My doses varied wildly and depended completely on my tolerance.\r\nDuration: \r\n-Oral: Onset = ~30 minutes\r\n       Peak = ~1 Hour\r\n       Duration = ~3  4 Hours\r\n-Insufflated: Onset = ~ 0  10 minutes\r\n              Peak = ~15  25 minutes\r\n              Duration = ~1  2 Hours\r\nPositive Effects:\r\n- Stimulation (Mental and Physical).\r\n- Mild euphoria (Less pronounced from oral doses).\r\n- Increased concentration.\r\n- Increased desire to talk.\r\n- Clear headed (No visual or audio distortions noted).\r\nNegative Effects:\r\n- It was easy to become over stimulated (Jitters, sweating and reduced circulation to extremities).\r\n- Anxiety (It was very easy to become anxious).\r\n- Agitation (Particularly on the comedown from insufflated doses).\r\n- Increased sensitivity to light (Bright screens could be dazzling).\r\n- Lethargy (It was hard to have energy to do unwanted/unplanned tasks).\r\n- I also found it to be damaging to my mucus membranes (Ethylphenidate is alkaline with pH ~9)\r\n- Psychologically addictive (I found it very easy to redose).\n\n\n"
