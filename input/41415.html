A friend working as a student tech in our biological sciences lab gave me a vial of chloroform -- it was about 25 ml. Willing to try anything at least once, I had a free Saturday to try it out. I did some research on the web but found little about it's recreational use. The goal for this first try was to get high but not to the point of unconsciousness. I decided sitting on a beanbag on a carpeted floor might be the best place to start just in case I got too impaired.<br><br>
There's not much in the way of preparing to use chloroform. I simply put the vial close to a nostril and inhaled slowly. I am immediately aware of a sweet taste on the tongue which was more potent if I exhale through my mouth. The mood-altering effect of the liquid is instant. After three shallow inhalations, I could feel my skin warming up. I was very much conscious but had the experience of feeling extracted from the world. I was focusing only on the experience. I decided to breathe in deeply. It was a rush. I was still very much aware but focusing only on what I was doing. It wasn't just light-headed -- I had visual and auditory 'manipulation.' I inhaled twice more deeply then put the cap on the glass vial and set it aside.<br><br>
There was no unpleasantness to the experience. Using chloroform has one side-effect that was the most positive of all. I realized as I was laying back, that I was having the most intense hard-on in my life. I swear to God I thought my dick was growing in width and length. Sex with my girlfriend was great -- she felt her lips (you know which ones) were engorging when she shared the vial. The only down side to the sexual experience is that chloroform wears off fairly quickly.<br><br>
Another down side to chloroform -- and the one that made me stop using it -- was a medical problem. It seems that chloroform has one long-term problem -- it really screws up the liver.<!-- End Body -->
