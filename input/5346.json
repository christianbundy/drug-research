 "report": "<p>\nI had heard that nutmeg could get you intoxicated for a while. I was interested in trying it, particularily after my friend had tried it years before and confirmed that yes, nutmeg gets you high.</p><p>So eventually I decided to try this out for myself. I went to the bulk barn and purchased about 70g of the stuff. I decided I would try to eat it at around lunch so it would kick in at around 2 o'clock. After makeing plans with my friends to go drinking I noticed it was 3:00 and I felt no effects. I thought that this nutmeg thing was all a hoax when 4:00 rolled around and was pissed off at having to eat so much nutmeg, and the taste was still in my mouth. So I decided to go catch a bus and make my way to my friends appartment to go drinking.</p><p>While on the bus I noticed I was feeling fairly restless and slightly paranoid. 'About time', I thought. By the time I got to the appartment, which is about an hour away, I was stoned. It wasn't so different from being really stoned off ganja at first. Soon I found I was really tired, and slightly shakey. By the time it was 10:00 I was dead tired and would have loved nothing more than to be able to sleep, but I had to go home.</p><p>So me and another friend caught a bus and while waiting for the bus I realized I was extremely thirsty. At first my mouth was dry, but soon I could feel my eyes drying up. I wear contacts and I was trying to keep them from falling out. When I got home I drank a ton of water and quickly fell asleep.</p><p>I woke up and went to work the next morning. While serving customers I found I was still mildly stoned off the nutmeg, I felt awkward and still very tired even though I had just had about 9 hours sleep.</p><p>Anyway, I would sum up the experience by describing it like being burnt out for a long long time.</p><p>All in all it was interesting, but I don't think I'll be doing it again anytime soon, consuming about 45g of nutmeg is not something extremely tastey.</p>"
