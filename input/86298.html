Method of extraction: 10g Cebil onto ~500mg Caapi leaves, using bufotenine IPA extraction tek<br><br>
t 00:00  4:00. 4 small cones of Caapi leaves infused with Cebil extract were smoked. Unsure of exact dose strength, but aimed mild.<br><br>
t 3:00  8:00. Feeling of tightness in face and slight nausea, mildly uncomfortable.   Slight 'distancing' from 'normal space', slight balance perceptual alterations when standing up but easy to adjust with very mild concentration.<br><br>
t 4:00. Lay down on bed in dark room.<br><br>
t 5:00. Visuals began to start. Built in perceptual level with active concentration.<br><br>
t 8:00. Nausea and peripheral tightness had subsided almost completely.<br><br>
t 9:00. Visuals present (closed eye only). Subtle but definite.<br><br>
Characteristics  <br>
Rapid cycling/flashing through images (approx 5 per second).<br>
Image style  'real world' visuals (i.e. of common day events), i.e. non-psychedelic.<br>
Head space  normal space clarity, but with a dreamy edge. No ontological distortion or adjustments which seems characteristic with other members of the tryptamine family.<br><br>
t 15:00 (approx). The odd (approx every 30 sec) more characteristic DMT style visual briefly appears overlaying the 5/sec non-psychedelic visuals. Head space  normal space.<br><br>
t 30:00 (guess). Effects slowly ramp off. Enter into more standard dream state / rest.<br><br>
Fell asleep after the experience. Dreams particularly vivid and semi lucid.<br><br>
2 stages of dreams (in both occurrences):<br>
Stage 1  snapshots of images in a surrounding (normal space) with a focus on particular events occurring. Non linear, small snapshot (3-4 second) type sections.<br>
Stage 2  The full dream, but as each dream lead to an event where the stage 1 snap shot was about to happen a realization would occur of awareness of what was about to happen and corresponding lucidness. It was like being aware of the future.<br><br>
No noticeable after effects. Next day hangover and couldn't see the future, even with thinking about it really hard.<br><br>
Worth trying more next time as this apparently passes the visuals past the normal space into psychedelic space.<!-- End Body -->
