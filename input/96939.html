This is a query regarding the effects of ecstacy on a person with epilepsy. I have done some searching in books and on the web, but am yet to find much information on the subject. (I did notice it was mentioned in your book)<br><br>
The reason I am writing to you is that everything I have read says that ecstacy and epilepsy do not mix and it is not something that I should try. Being young and inquisitive I decided to find out for myself, and in a very safe environment I have tried a couple of Es. From my experience the short term outcome was that I had no seizures on any of these occasions and for several days afterwards. This is from someone who rarely goes a day without a seizure. (I have temporal lobal epilepsy, involving complex partial seizures)<br><br>
I acknowledge that I am taking a risk in relation to long term affects, but with such a new drug I think we all are. (It is no more of a risk than the prescription drugs I have to take that are no more than 5 years old.)<br><br>
I do not expect you to have an answer to this question, but would be interested if you had heard of other specific incidences of epilepsy and ecstacy or know of where I may be able to find specific research. I also thought you may be interested in this experience for your own research etc.<br><br>
As an aside I have approval from my neurologist to smoke marijuana to aid with my seizures. It is something that I noticed improved things for me, and I followed this up with similar searches in books and on the net to find that this was not an uncommon experience.<br><br>
