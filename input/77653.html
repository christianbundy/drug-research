I have been experimenting with GBL on a daily basis for almost a week. I found it to be an incredible mood lift, no hangover, that magic 'first-time' ecstasy feeling EVERY time, music sounds great, it seems to get me to REM sleep quicker and I awake very rapidly and straight out of bed (something I never do normally). Plus, boy, does it makes me so horny. I think of the 33ish different drugs I've tried, this has to be one of the most versatile, least comedown, most useful and easily obtainable (and legal) in the UK. <br><br>
I went to work on it, met customers, performed better. I planned to quit next week for at least 2 weeks to test the withdraw, then after that I had no reason not to continue moderate dosage for some time.<br><br>
I also managed to procure some Diazepam recently, which as a seperate issue would help some control some mild anxiety issues I have (very mild, sometimes I get nervous about my job, stress, the usual stuff a man can normally handle but why bother when there is a simple chemical alternative).<br><br>
Yesterday:<br><br>
9am I woke up feeling a little groggy - but still leapt out of bed. I had consumed some GBL the night previously and as usual, missed the euphoric mark by about 0.5ml and fell asleep on my sofa. It is easy to sneak up on me if I want to continue the high because it seems to last longer than I think, so as I feel like I'm coming down, if I take another single ml hit then an hour later I'm bouncing all over the place and then fall asleep. The weird thing is, I awake perfectly normally 2 hours later - I just come out of the sleep, even if its 3am, I just wake up, then find my bed and go to sleep normally.<br><br>
So, this morning, 9am upon awaking I decide to take 2 x 5mg Diazepam to take the edge off and start the day. By 11am I had my first job, so I grabbed a glass of water by the side of my bed and downed it. (My room is a total mess with glasses and plates everywhere) I also grabbed the bottle of GBL as I have been using it for quite a long time as a cleaning product! (Believe it or not, that is its intended purpose and it works wonders for my job servicing parts, it was only recently google led me to its intoxicating effect)<br><br>
12pm I start to feel very strange, but put it down to lack of food, so I purchase a sandwich and go about my day.<br><br>
1pm I decided to go for a short drive to listen to some new music (my usual route, just in a circle around town).<br><br>
4pm - I awake. I have no idea where I am. The last 2-3 hours are blank, missing, nada, nothing.. I am aware I am parked somewhere with the engine running but have no idea where. I cannot focus, I cannot talk and I feel incredibly dizzy. The car door opens and a paramedic asks me if I'm okay. 'Sure,' I reply... then proceed to lean out of the door and vomit for about 2 minutes. Five or so nurses put me on a stretcher, stick needles all over me and cart me off to hospital. I am incoherently jabbering at this point. Apparently I had just stopped my car in the middle of the road, slumped at the wheel.<br><br>
A arrive at the hospital in what seems like 30 seconds, more blood taken. Medical history check. Police *everywhere*. I recovered to a completely normal state in less than an hour and then waiting to be observed for 2 hours. I kept saying everything was totally fine so they dicharged me to the police - 4 hours in the station having fingerprints, mugshots and an interview. They inferred that they did not believe I did not intentionally take GBL, get in a car and drive about. I could only mention something about having it in a glass in my room and must have drunk it before leaving the house. [Approx 2-4ml]<br><br>
I have since discovered benzodiazepam and dehydration have these noted effects - however I do not know where I stand legally after potential prosecution for driving under the influence. I pretty much date raped myself.<br><br>
The driving standards authority rule is that if you have a seizure at the wheel, you aren't legally allowed to drive for a year - which would pretty much ruin my life, job, family.. everything. I have read that myoclonic jerks in GBL overdose are often mistaken for seizure, which might be in my favour. But depending on the blood test result (which the police took 6 hours after the incident - meaning it could be in my favour as I hear these substances are metabolised and expelled quite quickly). I will find out in 2 weeks when I get the results, but I will try to claim accidental adverse reaction to this mixture. It certainly WAS NOT my intent to go driving on GBL!! and obviously not to end up in hospital.<br><br>
One further thing NOT in my favour is the police officer questioned me when I arrived at the hospital, and my story does not match up to what I explained later. But I was totally delirious, and I don't think it's fair that whatever I thought I was saying at the time is relevant.<br><br>
Conclusion: Don't leave it lying around, don't mix it with Benzos and don't go near cars on drugs.<br><br>
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.<br><br>
Though I still use it, I like it, and despite experiences, if I lose my driving license, I'm going to need something to keep me sane. Moderation is the key.<!-- End Body -->
