Background: I have been taking Adderall with a prescription for ADD for 2 years now, although I only take it when necessary (not on weekends, &amp; not during the summer). I am a college student who smokes pot occasionally: once a month or less, excluding summer vacation.<br><br>
Two Thursdays ago my friend invited me to smoke hookah with a group of his friends, on the usual commons spot  a circular bench outside of some of the dorms. I had taken 15 mg at approximately 8am, and another 10mg of adderall at about noon. It was about 10pm and I hadn't anticipated on smoking weed that night but someone brought afgoo with them &amp; was generous enough to share with the whole crowd. After 2 good hits, I immediately felt like something wasn't right. <br><br>
I became very dizzy and as cliché as it sounds, the world literally felt like it was spinning. I was too dizzy to sit up and my head felt indescribably shaken and delirious, so I laid down and closed my eyes. I felt the typical pot symptoms at first, but they were insanely magnified. My sense of perception was way off and it felt like time was moving slowly. For example, I noticed two girls (probably 100 meters away) heading our direction. It made me uneasy so I turned to whoever was nearest to me in the group to let them know about the approaching girls, but by the time I had turned around to take another look at the girls, they had completely disappeared. Freaking out a little, I started shrieking about how the girls were suddenly gone. Much to my surprise, I found they had already walked the entire distance and were actually sitting with us. Im not quite sure what happened in those few minutes it took them to approach us because I was majorly disoriented. I couldnt clearly see anyones face. Rather, my whole world was distorted and blurry like a Monet painting.<br><br>
After about 20 minutes, I started having an out of body experience. I felt as though my soul or spirit had detached itself from my physical body. I was floating above the group of us, about 10 feet in the air and slightly behind my physical self, objectively overlooking the situation. It wasnt frightening. I felt calm and completely normal. My spirit self was very conscious of what was going down below, much more so than my physical self. When I would hear people speak to me directly, I would feel my spirit self become slightly disappointed that I would have to jump back into my body to answer them. When I was finished talking to them, I would slowly detach from my physical self and float off again. It was as if my physical self was solely important as a tool for communicating with the others.<br><br>
I didnt have many thoughts in my out of body state, mostly I just silently observed. However, the one thought I did have was that I considered going to visit my grandfather who passed away last year (&amp; who I was very close to). I felt as though possibly our spirit selves could just meet up somewhere. I ultimately decided against it because I rationalized that hes dead and Im still alive, and it might result in serious consequences for my living, breathing self.<br><br>
I believe this out of body experience lasted for about another 20 minutes, until I mentally fought myself into trying to stay grounded in my body. After trying my hardest to stay conscious and stay in reality, I found myself increasingly confused. I couldnt remember the names of any countries, the letters in the alphabet, or how to spell. I couldnt recognize a bottle of powerade as anything Id seen before.<br><br>
Concerned because I knew out of body experiences are not generally associated with pot, I asked my friend to walk me back to my dorm. Although the walk went well and was relatively uneventful, I accidentally stepped into a massive puddle of disgusting, stagnant water. When I cried out in surprise &amp; began to curse the puddle, my friend gently asked me to point to where the puddle was. When I turned to point it out to him, it had vanished. Other than that, I didnt have any major hallucinations (at least that Im aware of). I couldnt keep my balance long enough to change into pajamas, so I just crawled into bed and went straight to sleep.<br><br>
When I woke up, I initially thought someone had laced the weed. However, nobody else had any unusual experiences so when I looked into it I remembered that Id never smoked pot on a day that I had taken adderall.<br><br>
I wouldnt consider it a bad trip at all, other than the fact that it was so unexpected. I actually wish I could experience it again, prepared for it this time, but Im hesitant to mix drugs &amp; the strangeness of it all has actually turned me off weed.<br><br>
Its hard to explain, but it made me very aware of how indigenous people could have used herbs for spiritual experiences. It was a very personal and spiritual experience in itself, which has led me to wonder if the experience was real or if it was simply all in my head. Though I do remember most of the night with great clarity, its surreal. I remember it in the hazy way you remember a dream.<!-- End Body -->
