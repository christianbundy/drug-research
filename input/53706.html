When you are young and stupid with a lot of free time on your hands you tend to try new things. I have done my fare share of substances in my years, but nothing is like Dramamine. Here is where my story begins<br><br>
It is about ten pm at my moms house. I had done Dramamine before a few times, always with people, never alone. I found a bottle of Dramamine and thought to my self hey, I wouldnt mind getting tripped out, so I took about twenty. I turned the lights off and signed onto AIM and started talking to one of my friends. At about ten-thirty I felt my hands getting really heavy and looked back and saw my bed floating in my room and the closet swaying like the ocean, I knew I was getting hit.<br><br>
I looked down at my crotch region and noticed that my penis was dark blue almost black. I jumped up quickly and turned on the lights and it was gone, back to normal color, but as soon as I shut them off again back to blue it went. I decided that I would shut down my computer and call it quits for the night. I made my way to my bed and started seeing things that looked so real that I didnt even realize that they were not.<br><br>
The first thing that happened to me was that I kept on trying to grab a bottle of ice tea that I thought I saw, every time I would get close it would go flat against the floor. I gave up after several tries and decided since I had cotton mouth I would get a drink of water from the bathroom. At this point I didnt make it past the door. I heard my mom yelling that I didnt shut the outside light off and to go down and shut it off. I thought before the water let me shut her up.<br><br>
I saw the door handle and every time I would reach for it, it would disappear and go flat against the door. I must have tried to open the door for what seemed like an hour, I gave up and started to cry and the door just opened. Wow<br><br>
I made my way to the stairs and just at there for the longest time, to this day I can still not figure out why, so I made my way to the bathroom. I got to the bathroom but never turned on the light for some odd reason, thinking back on it I should have. I took a leak in the trashcan (it looked like the toilet at the time) and flushed the sink. From the time I got from the bathroom back to my room (a distance of no more then 5 feet) I ran into the wall at least three or four times. It was enough to wake my mom up and have me try to explain my stupid self to her. I just said I was sleep-walking and was going to bed. I finally made it back to my room.<br><br>
When I got back my room some how turned into my old job at a camera store. I with no thought at all told the guy that I worked with that I didnt feel good and was going to take a nap in the back room of the store. I laid down on my bed and for some odd reason the back room turned into the whole store and I could now see my fellow associate sitting down reading a news paper. I sort of came to my senses enough to realize it was one am. When I confronted my sales associate all he said was shush, there is someone shopping. I looked to the corner of my room and there was a lady looking at camera bags, plain as day.<br><br>
I paid it no mind till I realized I was at work naked. I quick got under my covers and when I looked up from under them I was in a casino. There was a tall black security guard that looked at me and said, I know youre on drugs. You just be happy that I am not going to tell anyone else. If that isnt enough to scare anyone I dont what is.<br>
Before long my girl friend (I will call her X) came over (not in real life though). She said that she had caught the bus and needed a ride to work. I said ok just let me tell my mom. Just as I said that I looked at my cell phone (in real life my cell was in my car) and it said my mom was calling. I told her I was going to drop off X at work. She said to come and see her. Some how my girlfriend opened the door for me and I ran down the hall way to my moms room whos door I thought was open.<br><br>
SMASH! Face first full force right into her door. I some how opened it and my mom is screaming WHAT ARE YOU DOING all I could say is I have to take X to work. My mom starts screaming she is not here. I look down the hallway at X and she says to me Your moms lying to you and I am going to be late for work. So I listen to my girlfriend and head back to my room and start to get dressed. My mom will later tell me that she found me with pants over my arms and my shirt with my two legs though the arm holes.<br><br>
At this point my mom was scared and threatened to call 911. I some how convinced her that I was sleep walking and I had taken caffeine pills earlier and sleeping pills before I went to bed and they must have counteracted to make me sleep walk. She buys that and tells me that I had to stay in bed. So I do. Before I know it there is some person sitting at my computer and I keep asking them are you real and they said yes, and then they disappear for a little while and come back again. I decided to try to sleep.<br><br>
For some reason I looked up and at the door and saw my whole family in an intervention like way saying that I needed to go to sleep. I somehow managed to finally fall asleep. The next morning my mom had a talk about something along the lines that her idol Elvis had died from taking caffeine pills and sleeping pills so she worried about me and I told her I had learned my lesson and that was the end of it.<br><br>
This was the last time I did Dramamine alone in a dark room by my self. I dont use it anymore because it makes me sick just thinking about it, but I thought I would share my story with the world.<!-- End Body -->
