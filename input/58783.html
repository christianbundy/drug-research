I've always had a very bad memory, and noticed the symptoms of it getting more and more annoying, so I decided to try ginkgo and see if it worked. I began taking one, 150 mg capsule every morning, and pretty much put it out of my conscious thought. <br><br>
After a week or so, I began to notice subtle changes in my ability to recall things that had happened, things I never would have normally remembered. This effect persisted and increased. However, I noticed that I was feeling very down a lot of the time. I was under considerable stress from school and the summer, so I have no desire to attribute such feelings to ginkgo, but I did notice they decreased markedly when I stopped taking it, along with the memory improvement. <br><br>
I have plans to try it again this semester, since my stresses have been relieved and I'm in a much better state of mind. It would be interesting to see if ginkgo has an effect on emotional amplification, but I imagine setting up a scientifically controlled experiment on that would be tough.<!-- End Body -->
