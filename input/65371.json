 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, I was unaware of Adrenochrome or 'Pink Adrenaline'. I acquired 1cc/mL of regular Epinephrine for the use of using it just to stay up and get the blood pumping. I was unable to use the Epinephrine as soon as I got it and was not able to use it for a 5-day period. During this period, the 1cc/mL of Epinephrine was stored in a 1cc/ml syringe with the normal needle cover over it in my sock drawer. After this period of time, I pulled the syringe out of my sock drawer, I had noticed the substance in the syringe had turned a pinkish color. \r\nNot knowing of any chemical changes having occurred, I injected 1cc of the substance in my main arm vein. Within seconds, my heart was racing, I was sweating profusely, and a headache that could of brought down an elephant. The headache consisted of severe, throbbing pain (and when I mean severe, I mean severe, the worst headache imaginable). The headache, sweating, and rapid heartbeat lasted for about 2 hours, then vanished. At this point, I thought I was done with any of the effects. I was wrong. For the next 7 days, I received periodic bouts of the same severe headaches but lasting anywhere from several seconds to several minutes up to 45 minutes. The headaches were incapacitating. After that week, no other symptoms were felt. Well, I definitely got my heart pumping, but due to the severe headache, I would not recommend this. Also, I had absolutely no hallucinations unless I was hallucinating the headaches.\n\n\n"
