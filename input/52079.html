1st time)<br><br>
I was bored and sitting in my garage when I remembered my brother was huffing once when we were working on his lawn mower, when I took off the lid from the gallon of gas. I sat there, huffing for about 5 minutes, when I noticed a girl and her boyfriend were arguing by my cavalier, and then she mugs him and walks off. I looked at my garage door, and I seen it open up, then another garage door open up again right behind it, this pattern continued for about 20 times. I heard some kiddie song being repeated while shadows around me danced and a little green monkey with a mop-style haircut started laughing and ran under my car and disappeared.<br><br>
I looked at my cavalier, and I thought it was a supercar, and some kind of jazz music was playing in the back ground as I ran my hands over the curves of the car. I kept hearing some grandma repeating her name and cackling repeatedly while the wind laughed along with her. I decided my session for right now was over and I went in the house, with a head ache and I couldnt think clearly, so I went straight to sleep.<br><br>
2nd time)<br><br>
The next day, theres some construction going around my house, so I break out the gas canister and sit next to my other car thats outside and start huffing. I hear a high pitched sound and I see myself reflected in the paint, looking like a badass. I then hear some kind of commands given by some soldier in the backyard behind mine. I start walking up to it to check it out, and once the sun hits my eyes, the camera angle changes and I see myself, except Asian, sneaking towards the fence. As I get close to peeking, I see 2 choices in front of me, 1) attack and fight for my country, or 2) leave. I choose 2, and as soon as I turn around, I see a snapshot of me wearing a red shirt, red bandana on my head and right upper arm, and camo pants, while some heavy metal song is playing, and the snapshot has REBEL stamped across it in red. <br><br>
3rd time)<br><br>
9 pm at night, I sit in my garage and huff. I see snoop dogg standing next to me, but with the face of a wolf, telling me that I have the soul of a crook or something like that, while trying to give me a pipe with what seems to be weed. I reach for it, and I see that it is the top of my gas canister. I look to my left, and I see that theres a cop standing there, with the facial features of a pig. As I keep huffing, I see my talon's engine which I pulled out a few days ago, RUNNING! it had fire coming out of the header and was revving up. Out of nowhere some guy comes up and attacks my engine hoist and while the hoist is trying to fight off, his girl appears and they start making out. Next thing I know, they go hunting after these thinks they call 'rabids' which looked a lot like big-ass crazy jackrabbit looking things.<br><br>
As I keep huffing, the same guy and girl leave their 'daughter' with me while they go on a camping trip. It shows a cut scene of a trailer type thing going off the side of a mountain. Me an the girl are holding hands for some reason, she is like 6-7 years old. I go to turn on my radio which plays this song by celly cel called 'scandlezz butchers' and 'remember where you came from.'<br><br>
While scandlezz butchers was playing, celly cel was talking about sexually acquired viruses and kings of Egypt and something about having sex like a coathanger. when 'remember where you came from' came on, it started talking about 'if you starting fighting a motherfucker, remember where you came from,' which I understood as, if you survive the fight, know where to go when you wake back up.<br><br>
Next thing I know, a fight breaks out in my garage, a fight of 4 gangs, each representing the North, West, East, and South. They were all tied to each other, and had to fight to the death in order for the gangs to not exist no more. As theyre about to fight, celly cel explains that I should run away and grab everything valuable as everything will be destroyed in the fight. I see a older guy, looking down at the little girl thats standing next to me, and they both have tears in their eyes. I realize he is her brother, and im begging him not to fight, to stay alive for his sister, but the fight breaks out. I grab her and I run out of the garage while they were destroying my car and everything else inside.<br><br>
15 minutes later I go back in and start huffing some more. This time, the CD player starts telling me a subliminal message, saying that once the track runs out, these little packages the rappers sent to some people were these big inflatable fortresses that will keep them safe. Those fortresses were in the trunk of my Cavalier. As they start counting down, I snatch the little girl and run off as I heard the rappers counting down. I turn around just to see a big bubble followed by an explosion.<br><br>
I go back in again, like an idiot, to huff some more. This is my last time, because it was late and I had to go in the house before my mom got suspicious. So I'm huffing, when I hear loud knocking on my garage door. It was locked, but my hallucination told me it was some kind of freak mutation of a human trying to come in because the world was about to end. Humans have discriminated againsT the mutants too long and the world was ending. I refused to let him in, when my Cavalier started going off like a alarm. I realized it was a bomb, so I kicked my door open and ran out screaming, 'HELP! SOMEONE SAVE ME!' <br><br>
Next thing I know, my mom is trying to pull me to my bros house, and Im trying to fight her off saying, 'I was just playing!' but she smelled that I was reaking of gasoline. My bro had a talk about it with me saying that he was just fucking around and that that shit will make me go insane. I havent touched it since and I dont plan on doing in the future.<!-- End Body -->
