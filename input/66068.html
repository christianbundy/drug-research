I have been smoking marijuana since the age of fifteen. I am twenty years old. I was recently prescribed to Effexor XR for General Anxiety Disorder. I took one pill on a Thursday- my body felt a little laid back but I assumed it was the placebo affect and continued going to school- three towns away- driving every morning and every afternoon. Friday, I smoked a roach that morning on the way to school. <br><br>
Everything was all right until after noon. I had just got back from lunch break when I noticed my pupils were dilated. I knew the risk of increased eye pressure was high so I figured I would be okay. An hour later, my teacher was holding me in the floor, I was completely confused and in and out of consciousness. I heard my best friend say that I had a seizure. The ambulance came and got me and I was still confused about what happened. The doctor at the ER said it was a combination of cannabis and the drug that sent me into the seizure. I stopped taking the meds and I am good so far. It was very scary and I do believe that people should know about this combination.<!-- End Body -->
