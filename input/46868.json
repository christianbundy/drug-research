 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nafter looking at this site, I noticed that at the golf course where I work there are a large number of coleus plants. Interested b ythe possible effects of the plant I picked a few leaves and stuffed them in my pocket. When I arrived home me and my room mate began an ordinary night of binge drinking. To fully understand this experience a little back ground is needed. We regularly drink heavily 3 nights a week, so we have pretty strong alcohol tolerances and know quite well how it effects us. \r\nI'd estimate that we each had between 13 and 16 standard servings of alcohol when I remembered about the coleus. Having experimented with Salvia D. I was excited to try this. Moments after smoking it (in the same fashion one would smoke salvia) we became extremely sedate. For about the next hour, we just sat in my room without television, music, anything. neither of us ot up to get food or move or anyhting. just before smoking it I had made a bowl of mr. noodle which ended up sitting on my desk for the entirety of the experience. The oddest part was that neither of us encouraged the other to drink nor did we get a fresh drink ourselves. This is the oddest part to us cause we never considered it whereas we usually drink each otehr into submission. \r\nA day or two after we decided to try the plant sober. This time I oven dried the leaves and smoked several. very little difference was noticed this time. If anything it might have been a slight placebo effect. I'm going to try further experimenting since I have suggested trying it to a couple people some of which reported similar experiences. I'm interested in researching more and finding out if there is any good potential.\n\n\n"
