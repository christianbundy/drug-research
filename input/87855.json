 "report": "<p>My quest for an MDMA like substance has led me to some truly horrible experiences, this is one of them. One day they will legalise it and Ill not have to put my stomach in danger with a lot of unknowns.</p><p>I took 200mg of MDAI and an hour after experiencing minimal effects took another 200mg. I had heard its slow to come up and it is.</p><p>About two hours into my trip I have slight feelings of euphoria but nothing ground breaking.</p><p>Three hours in and Im feeling dizzy, space out and tripping like mad. Some of it is enjoyable, some not. Its a bit too much so I drink some orange juice and have a cold shower.</p><p>Four hours in and Im feeling incredible sick, I try to vomit but cant. I drink loads of water.</p><p>Five hours in and I wonder if Ive done any permanent damage to my stomach, still trying to vomit but only bile comes up. I also have mega cramps in my feet. It also goes through my mind that this stuff could be lethal at high doses.</p><p>Twelve hours in and Ive been up all night trying to vomit, regretting taking such a high dose and generally feeling like Ive screwed my stomach up. I go to work with difficulty.</p><p>Im shivering all day at work. I try and go for walks. I try and force some food down me. I feel like Ive got unbelievable heartburn.</p><p>Two full days after taking MDAI I feel back to normal except for the feeling of a scarred stomach and constant heartburn.</p><p>Three weeks later and my stomach is back to normal.</p>"
