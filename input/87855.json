 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMy quest for an MDMA like substance has led me to some truly horrible experiences, this is one of them. One day they will legalise it and Ill not have to put my stomach in danger with a lot of unknowns.\r\nI took 200mg of MDAI and an hour after experiencing minimal effects took another 200mg. I had heard its slow to come up and it is.\r\nAbout two hours into my trip I have slight feelings of euphoria but nothing ground breaking.\r\nThree hours in and Im feeling dizzy, space out and tripping like mad. Some of it is enjoyable, some not. Its a bit too much so I drink some orange juice and have a cold shower.\r\nFour hours in and Im feeling incredible sick, I try to vomit but cant. I drink loads of water.\r\nFive hours in and I wonder if Ive done any permanent damage to my stomach, still trying to vomit but only bile comes up. I also have mega cramps in my feet. It also goes through my mind that this stuff could be lethal at high doses.\r\nTwelve hours in and Ive been up all night trying to vomit, regretting taking such a high dose and generally feeling like Ive screwed my stomach up. I go to work with difficulty.\r\nIm shivering all day at work. I try and go for walks. I try and force some food down me. I feel like Ive got unbelievable heartburn.\r\nTwo full days after taking MDAI I feel back to normal except for the feeling of a scarred stomach and constant heartburn.\r\nThree weeks later and my stomach is back to normal.\n\n\n"
