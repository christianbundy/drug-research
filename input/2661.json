This is serious.<br>Isnt it???<br>my friends would be mad if they knew all this.<br>a few say its not gravol cause they never had these situations.<br>Butall the things I looked up, point to gravol<br>I still wouldnt stop though, not now.<br>Especially not now.<br>Its all so easy.<br>I can breathe.<br>Except for that one night when I stopped breathing in my sleep.<br>Mom said it could be stress.<br>Probably.<br>But I dont know<br>I dont know anything anymore,<br>Theres no difference between what was yesterday<br>And what wasnt.<br>i have always heard voices,<br>but now..these are in english<br>and to the left, and OUTSIDE my head.<br>and its just my name, or something i cannot make out,<br>but its loud, so loud. and they dont respond when i ask who is there. my feet dont touch the ground i reach out for someting, but my hands are nowhere near the object. things move in the house, shadows walk around, when people arent even in the room. this has only happened since ive taken gravol. i started a few months ago, and my asthma is gone, i feel more confident, happy..relaxed. its just once in awhile i wonder...what is real anymore.\n\n\n"
