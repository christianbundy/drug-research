 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nYou think, it wont happen to you\r\nAnd you know, everyone says that\r\nAnd they are wrong.\r\nYou still think, Im the exception to that rule\r\nSuperstition and suggestive thoughts.\r\nAnything but denial,\r\nBut then, that is denial.\r\nIm really not falling into the stereotype\r\nBut by swearing Im not,\r\nI also plead, I could be.\r\nI have to be open to that idea.\r\nEven though I think ill get better on my own.\r\nAnd right now, maybe I did dream it all\r\nI even doubt my own mind.\r\nI know what I heard\r\nWhat I saw\r\nWhere Ive been\r\nI just have no way to prove it;\r\nTuck my wings back under my dress\r\nAnd walk under the city lights\r\nLetting the shadows devour me.\r\nAnd the last voice I hear\r\nWill not be my own.\r\nEven if I knew for sure, its gravol\r\nI wouldnt stop\r\nIm scared, yes\r\nButwhat if its not a hallucinogen\r\nAnd im getting closer to the TRUTH.\r\nWhat if this is a real voice\r\nBelonging to something or someone\r\nAnd im only in a state of mind to hear it\r\nWhen im on gravol?\r\nIts not like im imagining\r\nAnd its not like im crazy\r\nI just cant tell the difference\r\nUntil I turn, and no ones there\r\nBut the voice remains clear in my mind\r\nI know I heard it\r\nMostly on the left, but I hear it.\r\nWhats real anymore?\r\nMaybe I perceive things all my life\r\nAnd they were also not true.\r\nI just dont know what to believe,\r\nOr what is true.\r\nBecause I KNOW I heard a voice\r\nBut there was no one to be seen.\r\nThat doesnt necessarily mean the voice was a fabrication.\r\nDoes it???\r\nI dont know if its so much I want to be rid of the voice \r\nI only heard it about 5 times in almost 5 months.\r\nIts more like..i want to understand it.\r\nOr be with it.\r\nIm not sure which though,\r\nIf either.\r\nIm not alone, obviously.\r\nI mean, why would I hear if its non existent?\r\nIm not imagining it, this is on the outside of my head.\r\nAnd its not of the voices I have always heard.\r\nIts in English, says my name\r\nBut wont answer.\r\nI guess I should feel lucky.\r\nThe doctor says to go to another doctor..\r\nBut I think i've all ready said too much.\r\nIf I wasnt so worried and convinced (?),\r\nI never would have said anything at all.\r\nI even told mom,\r\nSo I know. This is serious.\r\nIsnt it???\r\nmy friends would be mad if they knew all this.\r\na few say its not gravol cause they never had these situations.\r\nButall the things I looked up, point to gravol\r\nI still wouldnt stop though, not now.\r\nEspecially not now.\r\nIts all so easy.\r\nI can breathe.\r\nExcept for that one night when I stopped breathing in my sleep.\r\nMom said it could be stress.\r\nProbably.\r\nBut I dont know\r\nI dont know anything anymore,\r\nTheres no difference between what was yesterday\r\nAnd what wasnt.\r\ni have always heard voices,\r\nbut now..these are in english\r\nand to the left, and OUTSIDE my head.\r\nand its just my name, or something i cannot make out,\r\nbut its loud, so loud. and they dont respond when i ask who is there. my feet dont touch the ground i reach out for someting, but my hands are nowhere near the object. things move in the house, shadows walk around, when people arent even in the room. this has only happened since ive taken gravol. i started a few months ago, and my asthma is gone, i feel more confident, happy..relaxed. its just once in awhile i wonder...what is real anymore.\n\n\n"
