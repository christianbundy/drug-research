 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBack from the grave,\r\nReborn again.\r\nDont know how to behave,\r\nDont know how it began.\r\nIn total confusion,\r\nWhere I lay.\r\nLifes an illusion,\r\nA game I play.\r\nDazed and confused,\r\nI look at the ceiling.\r\nMy minds been abused,\r\nBut I just love the feeling.\r\nThe ceiling is twirling,\r\nThe walls only pulse.\r\nThe carpet is curling,\r\nBut I know its all false.\r\nStuck in a world,\r\nParallel to mine.\r\nThe colors all swirled,\r\nA vision benign.\r\nI roam around,\r\nUnable to speak.\r\nFalling off the ground,\r\nAs I reach my peak.\n\n\n"
