I am a teenage male, 6'2', 175 lbs and quite experienced with drugs for my age. My use prior to this experience includes marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, LSD, peyote, mescaline, LSA, a few 2c's (e, I, b, d and c) two 2ct's (1 and 7), MDMA crystals, ecstasy pills (variety of prints containing cocaine, some kind of opiate, ketamine, meth, MDA and LSD), PCP (accidental), oxycodone,  N,N-DMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 4-aco-DiPT, Bromo-Dragonfly, Psilocybin (powder in a capsule, not actual fungus), IT-290 (lucky), DOB, DOM, ayahuasca, kava, salvia 20x 80x 160x and 200x, JWH-018 and some other JWH, and probably a few others that I can't remember at this moment. Now on to the story.<br><br>
Acid is extremely rare in my area, which is unfortunate as it is one of my favorite substances. When it does come around it is likely to be fake or weak. Most acid I've seen in my area is white, unperforated blotter. I was excited when I heard a friend of mine was getting perforated blotters depicting the cartoon versions of the Beatles in the Yellow Submarine movie. It wasn't until a week later that I discovered the blotters actually contained 2C-I-nBOME. Me, my girlfriend and a friend of ours pooled our money and bought 9 tabs for 60 dollars. <br><br>
We planned our trip for the next day, the last day of midterm exams. Having no anxiety over the tests, and having most of the morning and afternoon to laze around and smoke weed, I had no reservations about the upcoming trip. I was happy, excited, curious and hopeful, but there was a small, small feeling of nervousness. The last time I took acid before this, Lucy made me her bitch. She grabbed my brain by the balls and crushed me into oblivion, just because she could. I was determined to win this round, and I had a vision in my head of beating an evil dark force that was contaminating the acid and then become friends with the wonderful chemical after evil had been conquered. Remember, though, that this mindset was based on the fact that I expected to take LSD.<br><br>
I got to my girlfriend's house around 6:30 and we split up the blotters. Each windowpane formed a portrait of one band member. I was to take the top half of John Lennon and the upper right quarter of George Harrison. My girlfriend, H, and our other friend R split up the remaining bits of Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. H and R both took two tabs sublingually, but I decided to wait. We spent the rest of the night until 11 smoking extremely potent weed. I went home with two .5 mg Xanax H gave me in case I had a bad trip or wanted to sleep, and half of R's remaining tab.<br><br>
At 11:45PM I decided it was time. The friend who sold be the tabs said something about a complexion and whatnot and that I shouldn't swallow any saliva for 20 minutes while the tabs are under my tongue. When I put 2.5 blotters into my mouth I noticed a very bitter chemically taste and a strange sensation on my tongue. Had I known anything about 2C-I-nBOME, these two things would've been dead giveaways. My best guess was that the artist of the blotter paper, Zane Kesey, put a bad tasting chemical on the paper in hopes of discouraging the addition of drugs to his art. <br><br>
By the time the 20 minutes was up, my mouth was full of spit and my tongue was completely numb, but had a weird tingling feeling. I was already feeling some effect of the drug. My small bedroom seemed a lot bigger, or I seemed a lot smaller. I got up to hide my remaining half blotter, R's half blotter and the Xanax near my bed where I would spend most of the trip. When I was standing up, I got a rush of blood to my head and that feeling where your vision starts blacking out and you feel pressure in your head. This is normal for me, but when my vision came back after a few seconds everything was breathing. I knew I was in for a ride.<br><br>
I laid down on my bed, excited to start the trip. I started to feel pretty anxious and wondered if I should just take the Xanax now and kill the trip. Thank the Universe I didn't. The anxiety kept getting worse and I started to feel a little nauseous, so I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing to calm down. This helped a lot, and I could hear my breathing echoing through space. I took a deep breath in and held it, and felt, saw, smelled, tasted and heard the Big Bang. It was a tiny speck of light, as small as the head of a pin, but I could feel an immense power to it, like I was being drawn into it. Somehow, I knew everything in the universe besides me was in that one point. As soon as I came in contact with it, there was a tremendous explosion that I know should have killed me right then and there, but instead I was catapulted at speeds faster than light into deep space. As I slowed down some, I floated by the earth. I saw the moon, Saturn, Jupiter, the sun, and a cloud wearing ray bans. 'Ah,' I said to the cloud. 'Totem poles. You are color. 9 squared does make good hot dogs,' the cloud replied. I understood. I knew that this was the Sacred Blessing, and that the cloud was the guardian to the mysteries of the universe. I had been granted access to my choice of one the most important answers mankind could ever learn. I could choose between 3: What is the meaning of life, What forces control the universe, and What happens when you die? <br><br>
Most people would probably choose the first one. I almost did too but I am now glad I didn't. The third one seemed appealing too, but I decided that I could just wait until I die to find that one out. Why waste this chance on something I will learn later on anyway? So I chose the second. I've always wondered about god, the workings of the universe, all that. I gave the cloud my choice, and he said 'Correct.' In an instant, I was shooting down the hallway to infinite knowledge.<br><br>
At this point, the CEV's became very futuristic. I had had my eyes closed this whole part of the trip. I was shooting down a curving, winding tunnel of shapes, colors and sounds. I heard trance music playing in my head corresponding to the colors. The more speed I gained, the faster the music would play and the faster the lights and shapes would blink. It got to the point where the entire tunnel was a strobe light of color and sound. It got to a point where everything was so fast that it almost turned into one continuous sound and one light. Before this happened, the trance turned into fast psychedelic rock song. The tunnel gave way to purple mist. The mist cleared, and I was standing in a dark room in front of a stage. On the stage, I saw a man in a toga with a laurel wreath on his head playing guitar, a victorian woman in a dress playing bass guitar, a black cloaked figure like a Dementor from Harry Potter on the drums, and a skeleton wearing a blue jacket and a Yankee cap (who would become extremely important) playing the keyboard. The song they were playing resembled the faster part of Third Stone from the Sun by Jimi Hendrix. I stood in awe, because I knew these people somehow. I knew their names. The guitarist was Zeus. He was in charge of all natural things and all good things in the universe. The victorian bassist was Mathilda. She represented all the bad and evil that must exist for good to exist.<br><br>
When I opened my eyes, I was thrown into a world of color. From where I was lying, I could see out the window and onto the street. All the clouds took the shape of Alexander Hamilton's face ($5 bill). Some were smiling, some were crying, but they were all funny to me. All the stars connected using beams of pink energy. When I looked around my room, waves of pinks and blues and reds and greens all washed over my vision simultaneously. At this point, I really had to pee. Unfortunately, my mom was awake in her room right across the hall. I cracked my door open and realized I was waaaay too fucked up to leave my room. I stood in the doorway making a life decision, knowing that if my mom were to say anything to me I'd be in deep shit, as I would be unable to respond with any sentence a mortal would understand.<br><br>
After much thought and planning, I left my room and walked the 3 steps next door to the bathroom. I quickly locked the door and turned on the fan so as to cover up any weird noises I might make. When I turned it on, it sounded like all the water in the world was coming crashing down into the bathroom. With a yelp, I turned it off. I continued to urinate while staring at the shower curtain. The curtain is white with a dark blue tribal pattern that was breathing and slithering all over the place. As the vines started to wrap around me, I left the bathroom and returned to my bed. For the rest of the trip, I enjoyed Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix, playing around with the color visuals and exploring strange cities that I could create in my mind. At about 6:45AM, 6 hours after taking the tabs, I decided there was nothing left of the trip worth staying up for. I broke both Xanax's in half and popped all 4 halves. I was asleep within minutes.<br><br>
The next day, I called the guy who sold these tabs to me, and that's when he told me they were 25i, not LSD. Either way, I was extremely pleased with this substance and found it to be almost indistinguishable from real LSD. It is something I will definitely try again in the near future.<!-- End Body -->
