I decide to spice up the night. I walk into the bathroom and grab three of the little white tablets that are 3mg each I take them with an energy drink that says on the label that has 95mg of caffeine in it. I have taken melatonin for sleep purposes only. <br><br>
In the time I decided to try this I was incredibly bored. Trust me living in this town=no fun at all<br><br>
Previous experience being with nitrous oxide, marijuana, caffine, zolipidem, Adderall and nutmeg. I can say gladly that Im an semi-experienced psychonaut and no the ups and downs of some drugs, but this was totally different than all the others.<br><br>
As I said earlier, I ate three pills followed by the 95 milligrams of caffeine the energy drink provides meokay around fifteen minutes later it hits me a body rush like a cold shiver that warms up...kinda like the speedy comedown from nitrous. Then Im submerged in the deepest most intricate thought patterns that Ive ever had.<br><br>
Within the next five minutes my whole mind is just in a unwilled meditative state that I soon submit to now my thoughts are morphing to a awesome soft euphoria the caffeine is doing its job keeping me up and the melatonin instead of tranquilizing me is providing the same subconscious changes it would while sleeping but Im in a full state of awakeness all the come down was very gentle, and all I can say is it is not an unalert high.<!-- End Body -->
