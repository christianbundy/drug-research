 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was initially prescribed Xanax 1 mg for anxiety/panic attacks by my doctor. (My dose has increased since then) 1 mg worked good for quite a while, but one day I was so upset & stressed out I decided to take 2 mg.... and WOW! I was just so relaxed & chilled out. Everything around me was peaceful, and the horrible depression I feel each & every day just lifted for the time being.... \r\nSomedays when I'm so depressed & feel like I can't stand being here for another minute even.. I take my Xanax (which kicks in fairly quickly) & suddenly find myself thinking - 'life.... it aint that bad' It actually helps to be more productive & creative as well. Kinda of weird, but thought I'd throw it in there.\n\n\n"
