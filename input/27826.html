For nearly two years, I have had quite a fascination with solanacious plants. I read every thing I could find on Daturas, Brugmansias, Nightshade, and the like. I had experimented with small doses of Brugmansia, and smaller still of Datura to little effect-a dry throat and tired, dilated pupils.<br><br>
I finally decided to really give it a try, and ate about one hundred seeds, about 20 on the hour and then 40 or so at once. I also smoked about a dozen. I then ate 2 Datura leaves and 2 Brugmansia leaves.<br><br>
I noticed very little until I decided to go to bed at about 11:30. <br><br>
After a while of not sleeping as sometimes I get very bad insomnia, I decided to read a book. I sat up in bed and began to read some readily available story. I can't now recall what it was about, but I found it very interesting. Ironicly, I was reminded of a Datura report here at erowid called The Infinity Book. I then looked away from the book and looked back and there was nothing there except my hands, palms up as if holding a book.<br><br>
'wow' I thought 'that was one nifty hallucination'. I didn't feel at all high at this time, no confusion or delerium. I continued to lay in bed as people I know streamed through my door one at at time. They would either face away from me when I tried to converse with them, or just stare blankly at me and smile or giggle once in a while.<br><br>
A close friend of mine walked in a one point and stared at me coldly while I asked her how she was that night (for some reason I would always try to start small talk with these people even though I sort of knew they werent really there)she then preceded to crawl up ontu my desk and assume a fetal possition for saveral minutes before dissapearing.<br><br>
One thing that happend throughout the experience was my trying to grab things that weren't there. I would be thirsty and reach for a water bottle only to have my hand go right through it. I would try to adjust my pillow or retrieve a blanket but my hand would slide right through them, it became really irritating.<br><br>
Several other strange things happened that night such as seeing what looked like hundreds of large black rodents scurrying around my floor and watching a television that I found to not be on (similar to the book thing). <br><br>
All-in-all it was a very nice experience. Very strange but sort of comforting and not at all scary.<!-- End Body -->
