I typically feel I can fill a novel about every time I try a new substance, but with 500 mcg 25C-NBOMe there's really not much to say.<br><br>
It came on a BIG quarter inch cardboard blotter, and taking it sublingually made my tongue tingle quite a bit. On the top of the tongue it was incredibly bitter. Even after swallowing it this tongue numbness stayed around for a good five or ten minutes.<br><br>
It took about an hour for any effects to start manifesting. This came in the form of an unremarkable brightening of colors and a slight distractibility. Around an hour later the visuals began to peak, and they were very faint multi-colored fractal shapes that were somewhat like a burned afterimage from looking at a light too long. I felt a distinct enhancement in the ability to evaluate things from different perspectives, not unlike a lot of 2Cs. I was baseline by T+7:00. No more than a +2 throughout.<br><br>
My tripping partner described this as a starting point, or 'launchpad' in his words. To me it was like taking a detour into LSD-land and briefly looking at it through the car window before you turn around and leave it. Perhaps at a higher dose this would have been more fulfilling, but I didn't feel the need to investigate any further. The feeling was nice, but not something worth intensifying in my view.<br><br>
At the very least, this chemical interested me as something that might show up on blotters being sold as LSD. I wouldn't be pleased in the slightest if that ever happened.<!-- End Body -->
