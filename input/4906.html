I was at the store picking up some herbal supplements for myself when I noticed a bottle of Robotussin Max Cough and Cold. I've always wanted to try DXM so I picked myself up a bottle. Looking at the ingredients I saw it had both DXM and pseudoephedrine. I didn't think the pseudoephedrine would make much of a difference, so I bought it anyway.<br><br>
Around 11pm I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. Now I'm a pretty level headed person (most of the time) and decided to start out with a relatively low dose, so I took about half the bottle. Half an hour later I wasn't feeling much of anything so I took another few tablespoons. Two I think.<br><br>
What followed was the most frightening experience of my life. The pseudoephedrine kicked in at around 11:45 or so. My heart was racing wildly, I could feel my ribcage move with each beat. And it was going very, very fast. I decided to lie down for a little while and hope that it would pass. So I hit the bed and I'm rolling around because I just can't stay still and my heartbeat is getting really irregular. 'Boom, boom......boombooombooombooomboooomboom....boom' etc. All of a sudden I can't feel it on my chest anymore. So I check my pulse on my neck, nothing is there. I feel a cold, intense numbness spreading through my arms and legs and scalp. I'm thinking to myself 'Oh shit, this is it, I'm gonna die'. So I get up to call the paramedics. When I get out of bed I'm very light headed and about to pass out when the numbness stops and the feeling returns to my body. I feel my chest and my heart is racing again. This happened no less than 9 times that evening. I could feel my heart stop for a few seconds, my arms, legs and scalp would start to tingle and go numb, then it would start up again, race for a few minutes, kinda die down and then stop. This was the most frightening experience of my entire life. I didn't call the paramedics thinking I could just kinda ride it out.  This went on for almost 3 hours. Fortunately a good friend was online and she was able to help me through it. I was so scared. I kept on telling her I was afraid I was going to die. She didn't call the paramedics either, on my request. Finally around 2:30ish my heart kinda calmed itself down. It was still racing a little, but not nearly as bad as it had been before and it wasn't irregular, just a steady fast beat. I thanked my friend for being there for me and decided to sleep the rest of it off, so I went back to bed.<br><br>
This is when it got really interesting, when the DXM set in. <br><br>
I'm laying in bed unable to sleep because I think the pseudoephedrine was still in my system. I start having the weirdest dreams, but they weren't really dreams, it was like a movie that I was a part of. I had just gotten finished reading a few books from my favourite series, and I was one of those characters in the book. It wasn't like a 'Cool, let's pretend' kind of thing, I honestly thought I was a warrior mouse who had to protect the Abbey. Really really strange. Another interesting thing about the drugs dissociative aspects is that my body and mind seemed to become completely different entities. I knew my body was there, but I wasn't bothered by it. It seemed detached, almost. A very interesting, and somewhat crazy experience. Finally, around 4am I got to sleep. Woke up at around 10 that morning, feeling groggy and a little out of it, but the effects were for the most part gone.<br><br>
I walked away from this experience having learned two things:<br>
1) Life is short, and I certainly don't want to lose it to drugs. Especially not Robotussin <br>
2) RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH!!! I knew there were dangers from other active ingredients of Tussin, but this particular one didn't ring a bell so I ignored it and it nearly cost me my life.<br><br>
If you're going to take DXM, I recommend reading the FAQ. Read it and reread it. And be safe, have a babysitter. Because there's nobody who's going to respect you if you kill yourself on an overdose on Robotussin.<!-- End Body -->
