 "report": "<p>me and my friends went to an area in the woods and we took some foil and i put the size of a match head in and torched it. it melted and then, it smoked. i inhaled through a straw. </p><p>everything started to voilently shake. my friend's face and hands melted into the earth. after this...i closed my eyes and saw a serine landscape. i had a quick wave of naseau...but i held back the vomit. boy it was worth it. i then saw a clown, not even joking, dancing around in the right side of my periferal view. i was then put onto a cliff. this was scary. another wave of naseau. </p><p>i then started to panic cause it felt as though i was in the trip for over an hour. in reality, it was only like 7 minutes. after the panic settled, i then saw an ancient mayan temple with these mayans in front of a bond fire. these kids around the fire asked me to play with them. i wanted to say yes, because i felt like this would pull me deeper into the trip. i couldnt answer though. i then came crashing back to baseline there after. i then enjoyed the afterglow.</p>"
