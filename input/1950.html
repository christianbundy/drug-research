We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
I 'heard' in college that inhaling Freon gave a similar buzz to Nitrous. So, I tried it. <br><br>
For about 2 seconds I had a small buzz. Then my vision became very very distorted. My depth perception went wild. A wall about 5 feet from me seemed like it moved from 2 inches from me to 100 miles from me every second. Then my heart started beating like wild. As I collapsed to the floor I managed to gasp out- 'get an ambulance...' This all lasted about as long as a nitrous balloon would- say 15-20 seconds.<br><br>
I tell you it scared the shit out of me. I would sooner drink gasoline than do that again.<br><br>
So, if you ever 'hear' its cool, trust me, its not.<!-- End Body -->
