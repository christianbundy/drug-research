<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body -->
Weight: 75kg<br>
Gender: Male.<br>
Drug habits: CNS-stimulants and psychedelics 5-6 times per month. Nicotine user. <br><br>
Sober alcoholic since one year back.<br>
Other: Diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome &amp; ADHD.<br><br>
Setting: Mental crisis.<br><br>
Set: In my home at night 3 hours after taking 15mg diazepam and 22.5mg Zopiclone and still not being able to sleep. Worried about oversleeping the doctors meeting due 8 hours and I might oversleep it, I figured that trying the 4-FA sample I got lying around might not be a bad idea. If it would keep me energized enough to keep me from falling asleep till the meeting was due was all I cared about, and I had no expectations further.<br><br>
T=02:00 - Substances still active before first 4-fa administration are 2mg reboxetine, 10mg escitalopram, 15mg diazepam, 22.5mg Zopiclone.<br><br>
T+00:00 - 150mg 4-fluoroamphetamine is carefuly measured on a milligram scale, and solved in a tiny amount of boiling water. This is added to a glass of Lemon-lime flavoured soda. The taste is not bad, the lemon eliminates the chemicals taste quite good.<br><br>
T+00:15 I decide I want a slightly higher starting dose considering possible cross-tolerance from other stimulants some days before. Another 50mg of 4-FA is solved directly to some soda in a glass. It dissolves into cold water as well I find out.<br><br>
T+00:30 First sensation of coming up - ever so slight and mellow stimulation in body and head. If I would try to explain the abstract sensation of how the substance feels in the bloodstream, I would say it is like light blue or menthol. I yawn, and actually feel like going to bed again and sleep.<br><br>
T+00:50 Suddenly something. A creative, activating and positive mood is showing itself. I am also noting I am losing inhibitions and becoming slightly more impulsive; I am suggesting a friend come over visit me at 3AM.<br><br>
T+01:10 I do not feel like going to bed anymore. I will stay up until doctors meeting in 7 hours.<br><br>
T+01:50 My friend arrive in good mood with taxi, and I welcome him into my apartment. He has brought a gift for me, a dvd-player and movie - what a pleasant surprise! He sits down on the sofa watching TV, while I am playing an online game.<br><br>
T+02:30 We engage in long discussions and chats about interesting subjects. I am feeling very inspired and creative at the moment; many ideas, emotions, thoughts and insights comes to me and to my friend as well. It is as if he is also being affected though he is not under the influence of the substance.<br><br>
T+04:30 Feeling more alert and in a better mood since the last hours. I feel totally awake quite naturally without any of the side-effects common to other stimulants. There has not been any peak. The overall feeling is that of a very light, almost unnoticable stimulant effect, quiet content mood and social-enhancing speediness of mind with a psychedelic edge. The fact is that if I had not known I taken the drug, I would have thought I were just being my healthy self having a very good day! <br><br>
Sometimes it is difficult to keep to the subject while talking because associations and new ideas comes quickly and must be spoken to keep them being lost from memory. Pulse is same as always, blood preassure same.<br><br>
T+05:00 It is 7am in the morning and we decide to go to the pharmacy for my friends medication which he forgot to bring. The morning is bright and lovely and I long to take a walk!<br><br>
T+11:00 The effects has faded almost completely now, to the point where I don't know if it's the substance at work or placebo. I do not feel like redosing, and I never did during the night.<br><br>
Wrap up:<br>
This is a very nice mood-enhancing substance, very discrete, very quiet, at the dose range I used it felt it is not a recreational drug. An instant antidepressive medicine and a very good social enhancer. The way it enhances my social ability is very useful, because it is discrete and gentle - in no way is there any of the hyperactive and manic inability to stop talking common to other stimulants. I liked it very much, and I hope it will stay legal and even hope it could find its use as a pharmaceutical if it should be proven safe. It could certainly be useful for therapy, creative thoughts, new ideas, at a dinner, date or for solving conflicts in  relationship or family. Use as a temporary cure for social phobia also comes to mind. I will certainly use it again sometime. Also, not knowing how it affects others, or what dose ranges should be, I must point out that firstly I was under the influence of zopiclone and diazepam even before administering the 4-FA, which might have soothed out some of its effects. Thus, I have to try once more to see the true spectrum of effects, and if lower dose ranges would suffice.<br><br>
Afterword:<br>
I have tried 4-FA once more after this experience in a lower dose of 70mg, directly in the morning after a healthy nights sleep. The effect were still good, alerting, mood brightening and social enhancing. But I could not feel the slightly psychedelic and entactogenic effects at this time. Further testing is required. I never felt any negative side effects, only that the long duration (8-10 hours) could be troublesome if taken in the evening.<!-- End Body -->
