 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nUsually, when using opiates, I either take them orally or rectally. Rectally seems to hit faster and harder than orally but tends to not last as long. Today I tried both routes at the same time. The idea was that by using both routes, the rectal route would give a quick onset and the oral would make it last. I took 180mg rectally, followed by 180mg orally 15 mins later.<br>The result was very pleasing, I got the initial rust from the rectal route about 10 minutes after administration, and the oral kicked in about 45 mins after initial administration. My tolerance was low. The night before I crushed 6 Tylenol 3's for a total of 180mg codeine and took them rectally. Before that I was using Oxycodone 40mg rectally about a month in the past.<br>I enjoyed this method.\n\n\n"
