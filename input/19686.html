The prescribed dosage for ambien is normally anywhere from 5-10 mg. at night &amp; I was on 5 mg. when needed for sleep, because I really do have sleeping problems, but knew you could (ab)use this drug to get stoned. <br><br>
I read up on it a little bit &amp; doubled up on my dose one night. I have taken anywhere from 10-25 mg. in one sitting, but I can get stoned from just 10 mg. It kicks in really fast (I can normally start to feel its effects in a few minutes) and when it has registered I feel sort of tingly, everything gets a little fuzzy and I have become very relaxed. A bit later I usually get a big urge to eat and end up bingeing on sweets or whatever but the ambien seems to heighten my sense of taste or something, because whatever I am eating tastes so amazing at the time I am consuming it. I feel like I am in a dream but in reality I am awake, walking around, talking, etc. <br><br>
It can be scary because I will often times wake up in the morning &amp; not have a damned clue what happened the night before. Try as I might the next day, I cannot remember. I've had conversations with people &amp; I can't even recall what was said. I would never take this drug in an unfamiliar setting with people I didn't know well &amp;/or trust, because I know it would be risky and one could get themselves into a lot of trouble doing that, no doubt. It is now very hard for me to sleep without it, and 5 mg. doesn't help like it used to anymore. All in all, it has been more trouble for me than it has been recreational. However, I continue to take it because it is the only sleep aid I have tried that does not make me feel exhausted and 'hung over' the next day. If you have sleeping problems to begin with I would not recommended taking more than has been prescribed for you.<!-- End Body -->
