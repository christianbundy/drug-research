I'm sitting here on the backend of quite a strange experience. Thoughts still moving more fluidlike, faster than usual, but more subdued than before.<br><br>
I've had experience with adderall in the past, but this is by far my best experience to date. I snagged the pills from a friend of mine at around 5:00. At around 5:45 I dosed. Cracking open the little caps, I threw the foul tasting particles down my throat and chugged a great deal of water to increase the effects of the drug. I decided to roll and smoke a joint of some fine marijuana while waiting for the fun to begin. After half an hour I started feeling the inkling of something. A short time after that my vision distorts ever so slightly. Not much, but noticeable.<br><br>
At around 6:30 I'm feeling the comeup. The most fantastic surges of energy possible combined with an overwhelming sense of euphoria is the best way I can describe what happened. It felt like electricity was running through every muscle in my body. And suddenly all was right. I was in some kind of zone. A place that fit. A high specially blended for me. An amazing place.<br><br>
I only made one mistake this entire trip, and that was not having anyone around to talk to during the experience. I had AIM going, and was holding extremely good and flowing conversation with 4-5 people, but it wasn't the same as having someone there. All I could do was talk. No matter how many people I was talking too, not enough. My hands couldn't get the thoughts out fast enough, confusing my fingers on the keyboard and sprawling gibberish across the screen. The energy I get from 30mg of adderall is an excellent thing indeed, but it totally pails in comparison to the euphoria this drug produces. I was sitting there talking with my best friends and my girlfriend, telling them how excited I was by life in general.<br><br>
I've been reading the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test as of late. It's caused a slight conciousness shift. The things Ken Kesey and the Pranksters were doing in the 60s were incredible. Such free thinking. Let everyone have their own trip. Get everything right up front. Live in the now. This is exactly what I had achieved. At that very second I was a king. I was living IN every moment, none before, and none after. What was bothering me however, was the fact that it was 9 o'clock and people were already logging off. I was losing my conversation all in one fell swoop! The doors of perception were open and swaying in the breeze! I was living life as it was supposed to be lived; ecstatic and colorful. Almost every sense being fufilled. Absolutely incredible.<br><br>
It pretty much continued like that until around 1am. The last person I had to talk to had just logged off. All alone. Stoned off another bowl of fine marijuana.<br>
I read my book. 2am rolled around and I was feeling tired enough to sleep, or so I thought. I stripped down and got under my covers. My heart was still racing. <br><br>
'Maybe if I just relax... Breathe...'<br><br>
Suddenly I entered a brand new facet of this high. I wasn't asleep, but I wasn't awake either. I was there. The 60's. The Merry Pranksters. I could feel their energies around me. But who was I? Suddenly I'm someone entirely different. A hippie, totally out of his mind on acid and speed, holding a dirty bundle of cloth that everyone refers to as 'music'. And so I sit, zonked on LSD and holding my music. I shift. I'm this poor bastard under the scratchy blanket again. He moves his legs. I shift back to the LSD and the 'music'. This goes on for 3 hours. I'm sitting on the bus with my music. Just chilling. No need to be doing anything now. The world is right. Just go with it.<br><br>
Back to this poor restless bastard in bed. Unable to sleep, but unable to come fully awake either. And then I snap back. I was staring at my ceiling. I sat there trying to make sense out of the whole experience. Had I sprouted an extra conciousness?<br><br>
This was only about 45 minutes ago. I decided to write this report while things were still fresh in my mind and I had the speed to keep my thoughts fluid. I never realized amphetamines could be so absolutely mind blowing. This trip left me with some meaning. I'm going to take the drive and excitement I had back with me into 'normalacy'. Mind blowing and life changing. I'm always in awe of a few grains of chemical salt.<!-- End Body -->
