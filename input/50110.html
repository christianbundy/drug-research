It was a friday night in my boring town. I had 2 hits of pretty decent blotter paper that I had just consumed. Not even ten minuets after I had eaten the blotter my phone rings and It's my friend who was in the area and had some liquid. He told me if I put a hit in my eye he would give it to me for free. I met up with him and he gave me 2 hits on the tounge and one in the eye. Putting a hit in the eye was one of the stupidest things I've ever done.<br><br>
As soon as the drop hit my eye my eye closed shut and began to burn. I was in such pain I reached in my pocket and put some eye drops in which made it even worse. My eye was red the entire night and it felt like there was dirt stuck in my eye. The next morning just the corner of my eye was still red. Today is the 3rd day since I've done this and my eye is still bothering me. I'm submitting this report to warn everybody not to put LSD in their eye. The effects didn't hit me any faster and my eye still burns. Please don't be stupid and do what I did. I'm just hoping that there is no long term damage.<!-- End Body -->
