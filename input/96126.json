 "report": "<p>I'll open this experience with a thank you to all those who cared to devote their time to perusing the contents of this article, and it is my sincerest wish that the reader will gain some insight into the nature of these chemicals and the respect we would all be wise to possess when dealing with them. </p><p>This experience occured on a mild saturday evening just weeks ago. My closest friends and I had all assembled at one house (HQ), all the group with the exception of myself were doing mushrooms, but I had abstained from this and only picked up MDMA as I had little desire to do hallucinogens that week. </p><p>8:00 P.M.: The group was complete and everyone took their shrooms, the groups anticipation was palpable. I prepared my drugs and insufflated 300 milligrams and we all started walking to one of the local parks, the parties anticipation was almost unbearable, a mixture of impatience and excitement on all faces.  </p><p>8:40 P.M.: We had all made it to the park and assembled in our favourite spot; a small wooded glade containing a very small and pristine looking creek.  Everyone was feeling the preliminary effects of their drugs right about now, a nervous chatter broke out among our first-time friends, I wasn't discouraged however, I had ascended into the full blown effects of MDMA around 15 minutes before, a deep emotional and emphatic connection with nature began to overcome me and I felt the need to have a solitary moment and wandered slightly away from the group to do just that. I found a suitable looking spot and started my selected song, marvelling at the beauty and perfection of nature.</p><p>8:55 P.M.: I sensed that the climax of my song was growing near and I then became very excited. With head down and eyes closed I awaited eagerly, warm waves of pleasure and thrill rolling through my body. 3...2...1 and BOOM! My head whipped vigorously upward, the exuberance from the climax threatening to overwhelm my brain. I began to dance as I would normally but had to stop abruptly, the aforementioned emotional and emphatic bonds overtaking me, forcing me to take in the raw and untamed beauty around me. Head filled with raw emotion and eccentric ideals I set back to my group.</p><p>10:00 P.M.: Our original group formed 3 smaller groups around 45 minutes ago, the mushroom high was up in full force and all members present with the exclusion of me were certainly obeying the whims of this drug. The period in time in which the walk took place was relatively uneventful for me, shadowed by the earlier waves of emotion and empathy.</p><p>10:15 P.M.: I had taken the responsibility of rustling up this tripped out herd and after having completed my task (Not easy, lost one of the guys 3 times, found him shouting curses at some younger kids lol) we set back to HQ...</p><p>11:00 P.M.: Having rounded the last turn en-route to HQ we were greeted with the most tantalizing sight we could imagine at the moment, a nice and warm enviroment where my party could slip off into the shroom induced fatigue in peace. The house excited me for alternative reasons, the main one being the rest of my MDMA was there. I rushed inside and donned my traditional MDMA gear (Not fit for public, green and blue shorts around 4 sizes to small and a tight white shirt) then I rushed downstairs and insuffiated another .3 with reckless and joyful abandon.</p><p>11:10 P.M.: Around 1-2 minutes have elapsed since the aforementioned ingestion of MDMA, the high was instantaneous; I went from tired and burned out to nonsensical and euphoric in the blink of an eye. It was around this time, no more than 5 minutes after my beautiful line that a close friend of mine came downstairs and presented me with a miniature manila envelope. I opened it and my mouth split into an even wider grin than before at the sight of this envelope's contents. I was forward with him and asked straight up if I could take these hits immediately, my desire to do hallucinogens vastly increased due to the MDMA. He smiled and nodded, said 'It's DOI.' and wandered off in a hallucinogenic stupor.</p><p>11:13 P.M.: Exact time of DOI consumption. Before doing this substance I was confronted by another friend, the owner of HQ, who asked me to give him a hit. I agreed wholeheartedly, the MDMA rendering my ability to say no useless even if I cared to use it. Well, here goes...</p><p>11:37 P.M.: First perceptible effect of DOI kicks in. I am seated at the kitchen table watching videos on the laptop. While a reasonable distance from the monitor (6-8 feet or so) I fully feel the effects of the MDMA: Lockjaw, increase in speed of speech and slight loss of sentence coherency, fluidity, etc. I begin to feel an energy that is definetely not MDMA coursing through me and as I lean closer to the laptop I experience a rather unconventional phenomana. When in close proximity to the screen it is as if the two drugs I have done are on a lightswitch. Lean In: DOI takes over and my mouth goes from clenched shut to wide open, my hands climb towards my head and I am baffled by the images on the screen. Lean Out: Most of the videos we were viewing had a song, usually of electronic variety, playing in the background. During the momentary lapse in tripping I would lean away from the pc, my jaw locking again and my body moving involuntarily to the beat.</p><p>11:57 P.M.: Exactly twenty minutes after becoming aware of the DOI I am struck with another unusual effect from the drugs. I am talking to one of the guys, saying that I would like this trip to be introspective and insightful, when I suddenly begin flapping my arms, jumping, and shouting gibberish. The first time lasted around 10 seconds, after which I began to laugh hysterically at the ironic nature of the previous situation. It is now midnight, time to do more MDMA...</p><p>12:00 A.M.: I descend downstairs and begin to prepare my MDMA for consumption. I am overtaken by another of the aforementioned bouts of insane behaviour just as I am about to swoop in on my line, making guttural sounds and chirping which is reminiscent of a chickadee's. The potency of the DOI seems to increase after this outburst, I feel a slight dissociation from my body and my perception of everything is beginning to change subtly, the world seemed to be saturated in a teal glow. These changes that were resulting from the DOI distracted me from my original objective, doing more MDMA for about 5-7 minutes. After this period of time I snapped into reality ( I would describe it as pseudo-reality, one of my last moments basking in the rose-tinted place in my brain that was MDMA) and hastily did my line before I tripped again. It is important to note that the amount of MDMA consumed at this point is unknown, my DOI saturated mind did not think to scale this dose up. We will estimate .2-.3 territory.</p><p>12:25 A.M.: I am now feeling a very strong sense of dissociation with my body and having picked up on this I proceeded to the bathroom to have a cool shower. The shower was not for the purpose of sobering up or any such thing like that, it was merely a cautionary procedure against overheating. The water was refreshing and I had the sensation that I could feel it being absorbed in my body, this sensation produced strong feelings of revitilization and vigour. I emerged from the shower with a large smile and began to dry off, as I did so I was swept up in more insanity, I descended downstairs clad only in boxers and holding a t-shirt to my chest.</p><p>12:40 A.M.: Questions are raised as to why I am only holding my shirt, I respond after several minutes spent finding the answer. ' I'm not sure if I want to wear it or not is all...' My sentence stops there and I retreat under the nearby kitchen table, donning my shirt and explaining that the many pairs of eyes made me feel insecure, everyone had a chuckle and went back into their own minds.</p><p>1:16 A.M.: The vast majority of our crew was by now slipping into the fatigued and sleepy state of shrooms come-down ( I know I described the group like this before as the effects mentioned prior were exuding a grasp on everyone until a friend started handing everyone more mushrooms on the journey back to HQ), only one other friend and myself remained.  1:16 was the first point in time that I became aware of the transition from solid colour (Ie: Teal glow) that had been accentuating my surroundings to the onset of hallucination, bot OEV and CEV. Small spots of what looked to be the afterglow from a light began to become abundant and objects began to distort, very slightly at first. We stayed in the basement for around half an hour longer, during this time my visuals increased ten fold and my perception of time was desintigrating before me. </p><p>I had been staring slightly behind my friends shoulder, focusing on a point two feet below the light above for around ten minutes or so. I was interrupted from this endlessly fascinating revelry from a tap on the shoulder, so I looked over. What I saw set me reeling for about 90 seconds or so, my vision had seemed mostly normal while spacing out, some impairment perhaps but certainly manageable. This was exactly the opposite of that, my friends features distorted and twisted, melting, spinning, bubbling, breathing, his head appearing to be an entity entirely independent from his body. There was in this friend's close proximity a sunflower. Upon noticing the flower it grew a collosal length, rotating and undulating and emitting great waves of light. I became very emotional and tried to take it off my mind with MDMA.</p><p>1:38 A.M.: Complete dissociation. My limbs feel well... they don't. It wasn't the conventional sense of detachment I had experienced with depressants or analgesics, it carried with it the sensation that in a brief moment I would be transcending this reality. I grew very excited at this, finally encountering the insight into myself I lusted for. I figured another line of E would be nice but I hadn't banked on what the mirror the substance resided on had in store for me. As I gazed at it and began to prepare a rather reckless and foolhardy amount of MDMA for consumption a moment of acidic clarity struck me, I reasoned that with all this dissociation I wouldn't feel the drug mentally, but my body certainly would and I had no desire to risk OD'ing or any adverse effects while on DOI. As if that wasn't enough the mirror I broached upon earlier, an oval shape, began to distort at the edges wildly and it seemed to me that my eyes were melting straight out of my head! With a yelp I thrust the drugs at my friend, who lacks self control. ( Had I been in control of my faculties I would have prevented his doing of this, but what's done is done.) He eagerly did what I would estimate was a .5-.6. (I went with 1.5 g's, ended with .05, recall insufflating close to a gram, no less than a .8)</p><p>2:15 A.M.: Some time has passed, my foolhardy friend was feeling cold and nausea, I would assume from his decision to indulge in more MDMA than he could do. I was by now fully immersed within a very deep visual trip with strong introspective qualities. I suprised myself by maintaining composure when confronted with this situation, a friend with potential to OD and me; the caretaker, inhabiting a different realm. Fortunately he recovered fine, no frightening OD symptoms, I just cut him off and put him in bed.</p><p>3:00 A.M.: I have been in my own mind for what feels like a vast amount of time, letting the drugs take me where they wil. It is at this stage in the night when my trip almost could have been filed in the 'Train Wreck' category. The drugs, both varieties, still coursed strongly throughout my veins, instilling within me the desire to be up and moving, to talk to a human, to reach out and connect.</p><p>3:30 A.M.: The feelings mentioned above have plagued me mercilessly for the last half hour so I decide to watch a movie just to allow my mind to drift, relax. Those of you reading this who have read H.S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing, or those who have witnessed the film, will be those who can best empathize now. For those who are ignorant to this piece of art (You're missing out!) a summary of the first scene shall be in order. The protagonists appear flying through the desert in a convertible and ingesting sunshine acid (MMMM sunshine acid :) ). The focus of attention, Duke begins to question whether he speaks aloud or is only thinking, and his trip is a nasty and frightening one. The most memorable part of this viewing was the thought/speaking scene, as I emulated those same worries, fearing that those around me might hear me and grow angry. ( They were all long asleep of course) This scene had shaken me a little, I needed to escape the living room with its frightful film, so I ascended the stairs to the spare bedroom, locating dark side of the moon and headphones as I went...</p><p>4:10 A.M.: Having all that I needed on hand made me feel accomplished and sure of myself. It was with these emotions that I ventured into the most profound and spiritual hallucinogenic journey I've yet to have in my young life. There were occupants in the room, an inevitability that cannot be avoided with a gathering of 11 beshroomed youths. Though still completely dissociated I felt the desire to be intimate, not sexual, with my friend. I layed down with perhaps an inch of space between us, he didn't mind, his dreams seemed to be bright and happy. Feeling perhaps the most safe and confident could have on the trip so far I pressed play and closed my eyes. Having done that I felt as if I was propelled into a different universe, or maybe a limbo, I was the only occupant after all. As the first song came on (Breathe) I grew very aware of my breathing, the only body function I was capable of focusing on right now. Visuals accompanied this strange perception, the type of CEV's that I would picture when describing standard CEv's. I had experienced this before I reflected sadly, simultaneously amazed and dissapointed at the geometric shapes of dazzling colours that floated casually through my void.</p><p>4:20(ish) A.M.: I have had standard visuals throughout the first two songs in Dark Side Of The Moon and am expecting more of the same as Time comes on. My assumption is affirmed immediately, a concentration of neon triangles drift by, a sense of vast distance between the shapes. As the song begins to build there is to be heard voices and clocks. Once I had registered these things something... changed.</p><p>Somewhere In Time: Though not a standardized measurement of time lapsed I feel that such a description is the only one that can accurately purvey my perception of time. My void was filled with great clocks and a plethora of wisps in bright colours, all babbling. I naturally presumed it was just the babble of voices from the song but these voices had... personality, they were undisputedly alive, and the reverberations they caused made my void shake and filled me with a profound sense of... something. Though my body remained immobile on the bed my very being went on journey through what was in my best words an immeasurable and purely incomprehensible amount of time. Perhaps only 7-8 minutes in reality, but as I have previously stated I was no longer subject to the rules and regulations of this reality. The wisps I mentioned became tangible figures, not one of them was a person I recognized in history but I felt that I had a very deep emotional bond with these entities, almost as if they were a part of me.</p><p>5:13 A.M.: I emerge from the spare room disoriented, no longer possesing a concept of time. I was definetely feeling exhausted now, waves of fatigue building and cresting in my frontal lobe. I felt that perhaps eating would assist in grounding my being to 'normal' reality, so I promptly made myself some toast. This was a bad idea as I'd soon discover, for eating gave me the sensation that my head was non-existent, though I still had all sensory functions. It was as if there was a void where my head would be usually, not a black void like the one in my mind, rather just an area in which nothing can exist. My brain was already vastly overstimulated from before, rational thought development like wading through corn syrup. What saved me from a potential 'Headless Loop' (I'd describe it like that, sorry if I'm talking out of my ass) was the fact that I was still aware of my mouth and the food nestled inside it. I hastily moved to the garbage can and spat out the pulped bread, waves of relief rendering my dissociated extremities immobile for a moment.</p><p>5:45 A.M.: It is to my experience on other hallucinogenic compounds that sleep is a cruel and fickle mistress, this was not the case on DOI. Perhaps it is the nature of the compound itself, though I feel the likely reason is pure exhaustion and overstimulation. Regardless of why, I drifted off into something distantly related to sleep, and woke up from this state with an almost full recollection of the previous nights events as well as a sense of profound events occuring in my 'sleep'. The day after my brain felt like, for lack of a better term, a huge pile of dog shit, but it was all worth it...</p><p>It is with paragraph that I leave you. Though I didn't OD or go to insane I have to admit to myself that I came a mere line of MDMA away from putting myself over the edge. Though I regret my friend had to suffer a little (MDMA guy) I am very happy he did my drugs, and I may come across as selfish here but I would much rather see him get mildly ill and learn a lesson about self control than to have had myself carted to the hospital and shot with Thorazine. Take the story with a grain of salt if you so desire, who could fault another for skepticism on the web? As for changes I experienced, there were a few I brought with me: I gained a better undertanding of bonding emotionally as well as increased proficiency in ability to empathize. I have a much closer association with nature, my work ethic (Academic and labour) increased. The only regret is that now whenever I attempt to listen to Time I become very deeply emotional, that's give and take for ya. I had hoped that perhaps telling others of my experience would bring to light that mysterious feeling of profundity but alas, enlightenment is fleeting. I hope you enjoyed the read in any sense of that term, apologies in advance if someone grows confused while reading, even after completion I still feel there is no adequate way to relay my experience in words, it spoke to something much more primal and mysterious than that.</p>"
