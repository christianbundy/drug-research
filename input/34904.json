 "report": "<p>The other day I acquired a 100 u/g patch of fentanyl duragesic. I have put them on before in the past and had nothing but extreme nausea, and I found it to be upsetting.</p><p>This time I cut open the patch and squeezed most of the gel out into a little ball, and smoked a large portion of it, ignoring all the rumors of how dangerous and lethal that could be. It turned out that the high was that of oxycontin, but without the euphoric mental effects. </p><p>Fentanyl in my opinion is not a recreational drug at all, but is great with killing what ever pain a person might have. Oxycontin rocks it over any time.</p>"
