 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHello all, <br>Just wanted to express my disappointment when I heard that this substance was starting to be banned across the globe. <br>I have used Methoxetamine in a controlled environment and would like to confirm, that with the right dosage, it can do wonders for my mental illness. <br>I am Manic-Depressive ('Bi-Polar Disorder'), and with this illness I became anxious around people, couldn't concentrate in school, depressed and couldn't get out of bed... The list goes on.<br>I was on Cymbalta, but still, things were hard. When Methoxeatamine, or MXE, came into my life - I began to soar!<br>My brain felt clear, I could read, write, draw, play, the way I used to as a child. <br>Honestly, this chemical needs to be brought into research. It's been a blessing on my life, and got me right where I've always wanted to be, happy, strong, confident, attentive, calm, and productive. <br>This chemical needs the right attention. <br>It needs the right respect as well. <br>I think it's becoming illegal because of the individuals that misused it, not because it's a dangerous thing, and I believe Methoxetamine has the power to change the medical world, and it could be used for very good purposes. I hope, so deeply, that the Government doesn't just 'shut it out'.\n\n\n"
