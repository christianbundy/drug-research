Over the course of about a 8 months, a good friend and I consumed acid in the masses.  On average we would trip about 4 times a week, initially only doing one of two hits at a time.  But I was always pushing my limits. eventually I was dropping up to 8 hits at a time.<br><br>
I began to notice that I was 'perma-fried' as I call it,  and that I was occasionally getting flashbacks that were intense enough to make me decide against continuing my use of lsd.  My memory had also been damaged.  eg. if I was to look at a page number in a magazine, close it, and then try and return to that page a few minutes later, I would have almost always forgotten it. Also my arithmatic ability, which has always been rather good has plummeted.  I lose track of where i am in an equation.<br><br>
It is now over a year later and I still get flashbacks, although they seem to be decreasing in freqeuency.  I'm still perma-fried but my ability to remember things such as numbers and peoples names is begining to get better.  Also i'm getting better at math again. <br><br>
I don't regret doing acid as I feel I learned a lot about the way the world is while under the influence.  However I don't think that i'll do it again as i'm 18 and will need all the memory and math skills I can get to be able to get thru my education that I plan on resuming soon.<br><br>
To those in the same predicament as me,  bear with it and things will gradually return to normal, if not close to.<!-- End Body -->
