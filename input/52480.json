 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter about 5 months of experimentation with yohimbe extract (in conjunction with piracetam and not), I have found it to have several main effects:\r\n1) Extreme vasodilation\r\n2) Strong mental stimulation\r\n3) Mild physical stimulation\r\n4) Very mild visual and aural distortions\r\n5) That Wonderful Psychedelic Mindset\r\nWith piracetam (dosage doesn't seem to matter so much, I vary between 800mg and 2400mg), I get these effects at these doses:\r\n~30 drops Yohimbe\r\nOrgasms are prolonged and more intense\r\nMind races at a ridiculous pace\r\nHand tremors when sitting still\r\nHot flashes\r\nSlight Euporia\r\n~30 to ~50 drops Yohimbe\r\nNonlinear thought patterns\r\nMind races even faster, and thoughts get trippy\r\nIncreased creativity within the mind, coupled with a bit of difficulty explaining these ideas to others\r\nOral stuttering when trying to speak at a speed which others can understand\r\nEuphoria!\r\n~50+ drops Yohimbe\r\nAural phasing and distortions\r\nCardboard-cutout, puppet-box vision\r\nNystagmus... in many directions\r\nDefinite Psychedelic Mindset\r\nExtreme Euphoria and a sick case of the laughs\r\nWithout piracetam, I can't seem to take enough to get the effects noted in the 50+ drops category. In addition, piracetam seems to affect the mental, more trippy aspects of yohimbe far more than the physical stimulation. High doses of yohimbe even without piracetam result in intense hot flashes and a tweaked feeling, though it exceptionally clean - not like amphetamine or cocaine tweaked out glitching. \r\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n"
