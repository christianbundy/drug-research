Suffer no more!<br><br>
After a particularly serious car accident I began to develop some very disturbing symptoms. I sincerely began to experience symptoms that made me very afraid that I was dying or losing my mind. As a counselor I have researched the effects of stress and anxiety on the body and mind, but I had not realized how truly awful it could become until after the accident. The symptoms became so severe that a family member rushed me into the emergency room at a local hospital. After quite a few tests, blood work, blood pressure test and examination I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and hypertension which the doctor said was likely attributed to the anxiety. <br><br>
He immediately administered a dose of Atavan, an anti-anxiety medication via IV. Within just a few minutes I began to feel very noticeable relief of my vexing anxiety symptoms. The doctor sent me home with a prescription for Alprazolam, a.k.a. Xanax. The Alprazolam felt like a gift from heaven at first. Fortunately or unfortunately I am a person who researches everything. I read some very disheartening information regarding the prolonged use of Benzodiazepines. Also, I have always experienced vivid dreams and on Alprazolam my dreams started to become extremely vivid, realistic and terrifying. I also began to experience audio-hallucinations late at night or early in the morning. It is challenging to describe. I felt better but very 'strange'. <br><br>
Furthermore, I began after just a few weeks of using the drug to notice the need to use more of the drug at increasingly shorter intervals. I was not addicted but I could see how it could develop. I was worried about running out of the drug and very afraid to lose access to it for any reason. I never intend to be addicted to anything other than chocolate, so this disturbed me. Still, the Alprazolam was the only thing that had helped to diminish my anxiety symptoms and every time I attempted to lower my dose in order to get off of this medication, I experienced more of my old symptoms and increased anxiety around what I saw as my vulnerability to developing a psychological and or physical dependence on the drug. All of this just caused me more stress, which caused me to need to use more of the drug, which caused me more stress.<br><br>
Recently I began researching herbal remedies for anxiety and stress. I had already tried Valerian which helped me to relax a bit in the evening but did not greatly reduce the awful stress and anxiety related symptoms. Then I came upon an herb called Kava Kava, Piper methysticum. I thank God and the Universe for allowing me to discover this amazing herbal substance. I have not taken one Alprazolam pill since I began taking Kava Kava! You'd have to know the hell that I was in to fully appreciate what to am attempting to share with you here.<br><br>
I think that it is a sin and a shame that more doctors do not tell patients about the possible benefits of herbal remedies. I just took 3 Kava Kava capsules (250 mgs, 30% kavalactones) right before beginning to write this little report. I feel relaxed and alert. I could go to sleep quite peaceably right now if I chose to, or I could turn on come music perhaps take another capsule or two and enjoy a very lovely Kava inspired musical interlude. Music is a great experience and Kava Kava makes it even sweeter in much the same way that Xanax does without the side effects and risks. <br><br>
Kava Kava does not cause me to feel any huge 'high'. I guess it could if I took enough of it for that purpose. I do not plan to though. But it does allow me to feel relaxed and at peace with myself and the world. It feels good. Again I have found it to be a Godsend and plan to continue using it while be very careful not to overuse it and put the health of my liver at risk. The Xanax helped me over the initial hump and this herbal remedy, exercise and meditation has greatly improved my experience of the most addictive experience on Earth, LIFE!<!-- End Body -->
