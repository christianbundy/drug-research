After first discovering nitrous I thought it was the best drug and told all my friends about it. But after my last experience I am no longer sure. I had always taken single whippet ballons and found the effects very good. I naturally thought the next step should be double whippet ballons. The fealings were very intense and overwhelming. Everyone who tried the doubles agreed that it was the way to do nitrous. The more the better, right? However after exhaling and inhaling repeatedly on a ballon I found that I enterd an unpleasent state. My hearing became metallic sounding and echoing. The lights became bright and I found myself laughing out of control in a mad sort of way. It wasn't the fun sort of laughing that I always had before. The nitous had put me into a bad trip and I was very glad when I returned to a more normal state.<br><br>
This has left me fealing disappointed since I always loved sucking up a ballon while listening to cool music. The double dose has robbed the fun that I used have on nitrous and I will have second thoughts before using it again.<!-- End Body -->
