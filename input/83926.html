My family and I take an annual vacation to Florida every year. It has caused me to fall in love with airplanes and flying. Not in a way that I want to be a pilot or anything, but I just associate great things with airplanes and I love being near airports and airplanes. Last year whilst going on vacation, I was not a smoker. I smoked semi-habitually about two weeks after my families trip last year, and have grown over a year into an educated smoker, smoking 1-5 times per week! I thought to myself how cool it would be if I could bring some down to Florida, maybe take a walk at night or on the beach and smoke a joint or something peacefully in the sun, away from the freezing north where we came from. I quickly dismissed the idea, though, for fear of the weed being found while going through airport security (which I discovered would be kinda easy to get through, but I didnt wanna take a chance and get fucked) So I thought, I need a final time to get stoned, soon before I leave. I couldnt do it that morning before we left; since it was a 6:00 flight it was basically out of bed and go. Suddenly the thought popped into my head to EAT it that morning before my flight! I felt like a genius. High on an airplane? Imagine how amazing that is. <br><br>
So, I did some research. I knew I wouldnt work to make brownies or something, as you need to make those in larger quantities. This is when I discovered firecrackers, which if you dont know, are basically the same thing, but its like a little cracker sandwich with organic PB in the middle, and you bake it so the oil absorbs the THC. I made them without a problem the night prior to my flight, and put them in my jacket inner pocket that I would wear the next morning. <br><br>
About 50 minutes before my flight, on an empty stomach, I went into the bathroom. This was about 20 minutes before we got to security, I am very glad it worked out that way. I went to the bathroom cause its not like me to randomly pull a nutella-club cracker sandwich out of my pocket at 6 AM in an airport. They tasted like SHIT. With an already dry mouth, it took me like 5 minutes to ingest the three dry sandwiches. I got on my plane, feeling a little different. Floaty would be the word. I had set up an awesome playlist, with some Boards of Canada, Mogwai, Beatles, and a ton of stuff I found to be perfect on a plane ride. I timed it pretty perfectly so as we took off, the Violence/Stockholm Syndrome song from Blink-182s self titled album switched from the speech into Stockholm Syndrome right on take off. It was intense, but so exciting. I smiled. I felt so powerful, but also so light. I looked out the window at all the cars, the snow, buildings... it was incredible. I felt like a bird, and just got tingles throughout my body. I closed my eyes for a bit, and had really cool thoughts, along with mild closed eye visuals relating to space, flying, and things of that matter. I wrote some music with my laptop and Logic Pro, which turned out really cool in the end. <br><br>
The airplane food also tasted incredible. We took off during sunrise, and it was very cool being able to see the sun rise while in the air. There were occasional layers of clouds that looked so beautiful and soft, and when we got high up enough, I could see a really dark sky as if it was outer space. I watched The Matrix for a while on my laptop. The first 30 minutes really blew me away, and the rest was also very entertaining. I did some picture editing which also turned out cool; made a cool profile picture for my Facebook. I just basically spent the whole plane ride spacing out and feeling weightless. Might I add that I consumed a mixture of White Russian and Sour Dieselthe latter being my favorite strain. My friend happened to be going to North Carolina a few days later, and he did the same thing, also falling in love. If youre ever going on a flight, especially during nice weather, I highly recommend you try this. It was a very peaceful and enlightening experience.<!-- End Body -->
