This is kinda on the same thread as jaylee's experience. I started smoking up in 1999, at age 15. I liked weed from the first high I got. I had fun with my friends, sneaking out at night and going off to smoke under the stars and moon. But then, one night, I started haveing a weird trouble with my heart.<br><br>
4 friends and I had been smoking, around 10:30 or so at night. I had about 2 joints or so, and I just didnt feel it. We were  outside, as usual, and the weather was nice and cool for a change (I live in north louisiana). Well, after a while outside, everyone else seemed to feel it but me. We went back inside to watch t.v. And play nintendo and just sorta trip out in our minds. As I sat down in a chair to chill, everything hit me at once. I would turn my head, and it was like a snapshot sequence thing. Time was fucked. And, my heart was racing way too fast and offbeat. My throat seemed closed up. I was scared. I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, and just tried to come down. Of course, I couldnt. I went back to my friends bedroom and wrote on a sheet of paper 'il will never do this again'. The next morning, I knew I had written somthing, but the gibberish on the paper was a mystery. <br><br>
Since then, I could not smoke weed without freaking out. The scariest part for me was definatly my heart. It got to where I could not get off the fucking couch, like stand up, without feeling like I would just fall down or have a stroke or some other heart problem. I mean, my heart felt like I had just run a race, or was still running it, but the beats were off beat. And my throat would close up. <br><br>
I asked my friend, who is like 6foot8 if he ever noticed his heart flipping out like mine, and he said, somtimes it feels a little fast, but nothing about it bothers him, its no big deal. Well, it was a big deal to me. When it got to where I was afraid of what would happen to me if I smoked, I quit. That was in september of 2000. I have not smoked weed since, though all my friends still do. Also, my girlfriend asked me not to. I do believe weed should not be illegal,  but it just is not going to work for me. <br><br>
I have recently been exploring salvia divinorum, and,while I have not reached anywhere past a level 2 or so, I feel it is suited much better to me. It just is calmer on my body, thankfully. And I dont feel like shit the day after smoking. <br><br>
Sorry so long, but if you are going to read bad trips or difficult expiriences, you might want a lot of info. May be I have a preexisting heart problem, but I will not tempt it again with weed. I thought I would be dead. I have never heard of someone dying of marijuana o.d., But who is to say they didnt die of heart complications following a smoking session? Again, I am for the legalization of this plant, but if you choose to use it, educate yourself on it first, and go slow. Don't take too much at once. <br><br>
When it stops being fun and starts being a hassle to do, don't do it.<!-- End Body -->
