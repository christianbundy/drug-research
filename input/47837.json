 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm not a pot smoker, or an alcohol drinker.  Nothing good ever seemed to come from either one, so about a year after quitting the two, I got into alternative drugs.  Remembering a drug my friend had tried before, I went out and bought some salvia.  Later that day when I tried it out for the first time, it automatically became my favorite mind freeing substance.  One large hit on my friends bubbler (I make sure I use a water bong of some sort, dry pieces have never worked with me), sent me on a beautiful trip.  Before exhaling I could feel my body slipping away and the effects beginning.  I didnt remember anything until about 2 minutes after the hit.  What I do remember is standing up, because sitting was incredibly uncomfortable, and wanting to explore this new world.  <br>The only way to describe my view of the world was a wonderland-like-funhouse, which seems to be my general experience in subsequent trips.  It was dusk, but there were still colors to be seen all around.  The ground at one point became a puzzle piece that attached itself to the sky as I tried looking up, without sucess.  One fun thing to do was play a didgeridoo, which became my spirit tunnel. Closing my eyes I could see a tunnel that seemed to be the tunnel to somewhere, but I didnt feel like going.  As time progressed I came to full conciousness and went to eat.  The after effects were pleasurable in themselves, in that I became tired but definetly peaceful and more introspective.  It is really the most pleasurable enthenogenic experience I have ever experienced.\n\n\n"
