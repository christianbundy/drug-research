The past year or so of my life I've been addicted to Amphetamines and just recently got off them (1 week ago). So I had and extra $10 that I would've spent on Adderall but I thought 'I CAN'T START THAT SHIT AGAIN'. So I called up my friend Chris who said he had some Hyrdos to get rid of. I told him 6 of them for $10 and he agreed. So I met him and saw they were 5mg/500mg. I bought them and sped home.<br><br>
SETTING: Parents gone for the weekend so house is empty. Good mood, with nothing to do until 6:30pm tomorrow when I work next. It's a nice not hot but warm summer evening with not a cloud in the sky. I still hope to hang with some friends tonight or hit up some parties.<br><br>
DOSAGE: I get a large cup of water and get my 6 pills. I haven't eaten in at least 3 hours and have had small drinks of OJ throughout the day.<br><br>
Friday Night 8:00PM: I swallow the pills whole in 2 swallows, 3 pills each swallow followed by 3 mouthfuls of water. I should also note that I am not currently on any other drug and am neither taking a supplements or medications etc. Not even any caffeine in me today! ;-)<br><br>
8:15PM: I'm starting to feel warm and 'fuzzy' is the best I can describe this feeling. My favorite part of opiates is the coming up part for the first half hour, almost more than the peak itself. I'm also getting this weird chemical taste/smell thing I get when I take hydrocodone. I do not get this side effect with any other opiates though, weird.<br><br>
8:25PM: Effects really coming on strong now. Intense euphoria, the best feeling of relaxation ever, extreme increase is sense of well being and mood, and positive outlook. I just got a call some from friends who will be stopping out within a hour or so. Perfect time to smoke some weed on the hydro comedown. Even though the comedown on hydrocodone isn't a bad feeling or anything like that it's just a great ending combo.<br><br>
8:36PM: I'm peaking for sure now. I have all the same effects as before except I have a slower field of vision, like everything is moving slower and seems more unreal look to everything. I feel so euphoric, you guys should see my face it's just one big ass ole shit eatin grin. :-)<br><br>
9:00PM: Buzz is slowly starting to grow weaker. The euphoria is whats gone down the most. Everything else is still going strong. A nice bowl of pot in 10 mins or so shall synergize with the buzz giving it an extra hour or two to its duration.<br><br>
9:13PM: Just finished a bowl of mid-grade cannabis. The synergy is always a good one to have. The euphoria is back up and I just feel great. I'm going to sleep very good tonight. But I'm also kind of hungary now, hmmmm I wonder why that is so..lol.<br><br>
10:00PM: Well I'm starting to feel pretty tired so I'm gonna go smoke another bowl then go to bed by 11:00PM. I still feel a mild-strong buzz from the hydrocodone but will be worn off prob before I fall asleep.<br><br>
SUMMARY: Hydrocodone is a great and very relaxing drug. I like to use it best on a night with not alot to do and just being able to chill at home alone or be with few friends.<!-- End Body -->
