Claims to know the chemist responsible for synthesis of substance, and chemist claims it is pure MDMA.\r\n\tPrice: 20 $ per pill. (This is a gross overprice in my opinion, but when it comes to the black market the customer isnt always right.)\r\n\tForm: Salt grain sized clear white crystals in gel caps.\r\n\tMecke Test: Turns orange at first, slowly turns to more of a red-brown color. Lots of bubbles suggest reaction is very fast and substance is very pure.\r\n\tMarquis Test: Turns bright yellow. Lots of bubbles once again.\r\n\tSimons Reagent Test: Turns solid darkish blue.\r\n\tConclusions: Clearly this substance is not MDMA, from the online data I could collect, and from an anecdotal account of a friend who had tried the same substance, I concluded that there is an exceedingly high probability this substance is in fact \r\nbk-MDMA (Methylone, M1, etc.). I suppose the chemist just ordered some on the internet and was ripping off the MDMA dealer. I informed my dealer. I dont think he really cared either way since Im probably the only guy who he sells to who cares to check what theyre putting in their bodies. I own a scale which is accurate to .1 g. It really is meant for marijuana. It usually doesnt respond to anything less than .2 g and when I placed a single pill on the scale it did not respond. This leads me to believe that there is in fact less than 200 mg of substance; however, by eyeballing it I am confident that there are at least 100 mg of substance.\r\nSubstance Report:\r\n\t3:00 PM- Subject 2 and I adjourn to my bedroom; I use a gift card to grind the crystal against a glossy magazine into an extremely fine powder. I cut it into one long line, split the line into two even lines, and then those lines into two even lines, leaving me with four ~25-50 mg lines. I insufflate one into each nostril, and so does Subject 2. Effects are felt almost immediately, within two minutes I feel extremely stimulated with a calm euphoria. Subject 2 reports the same.\r\n\t3:05 PM- We have moved to the basement and effects are in full effect, I feel a stimulated clear-headedness mixed with a euphoric fogginess, I notice a slight analgesia as my recovering foot does not seem to hurt at all. The drip is bitter but I do not mind and almost find it pleasant.\r\n\t3:10 PM- We are feeling each other up on the couch and tactile sense is amazing. I am rolling pretty hard and definitely feel very horny. No problem achieving erection. I feel extremely intimate with my Subject 2 and she feels the same with me.\r\n\t3:15 PM- Peak is hit, and we have intercourse for the next thirty minutes, as we have sex I stop taking note of effects and just have really amazing close sex. It feels great.\r\n\t3:45 PM- Sex is done. Subject 2 reports that effects have faded but I still feel them. She is not nearly as tuned into her state of consciousness as I am so this comes as no surprise to me.\r\n\t5:22 PM- The main effects have tapered into an amphetamine like stimulation with a slight euphoria. \r\nConclusions:\r\n\tI like this substance.\r\n\tInsufflation was nearly painless. Another plus.\r\n\tThe short duration was handy in my opinion.\r\n\tThe high was very similar to MDMA, and I cannot form a real distinction at this point, I dont feel as though I have enough experience under my belt.\r\n\tI hope to try it again, maybe orally so I can form a more informed conclusion.\r\n\tThe openness I felt was very sincere, although I have not had any major breakthroughs or anything like that.\r\n\tI will purchase a mg scale because it is definitely worth the money.\r\n\tExperienced no negative side effects. Very Cool.\n\n\n"
