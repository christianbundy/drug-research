I have been interested in trying nutmeg for a while but have never got round to it as I have been experimenting with other entheogens. Its the start of my Easter holidays tomorrow so I thought it the perfect way to celebrate, a new substance. On the afternoon I was going to do it the only other substance I did was a very light smoked DMT. It wasnt proper DMT just Anadenanthera Colubrina seeds, I smoked a small amount at about 8:00. It has worn off now. To start I crushed a single nutmeg and ground it with a pestle and mortar, I was planning to simmer in milk to extract it but in the end couldnt be bothered. I swallowed it with milk, it wasnt all that bad. Well I am going to record by time now.<br><br>
9:15  One nutmeg swallowed (ground)<br><br>
9:30  Starting to feel slightly stoned but it may just be a placebo effect. An odd feeling of dis-connection with my arms, as if I am just watching them type.<br><br>
9:45  The stoned feeling is kinda wearing off, but I am not too worried because Ive read that this can happen. I am stopping typing now but will continue tomorrow if am in an ok condition.<br><br>
Ok, from here on I am typing 2 days later so the times may be a tad off.<br><br>
10:15  Feeling slightly drunk and keep doing stupid things. My short term memory is shot to shit. When I close my eyes I get pretty vivid daydreams, none were life changing in any way, seemed to be just a reflection of my life at the moment.<br><br>
10:30  Starting to feel as if I am floating slightly, I lie down on the floor and my arms feel as if they are raised above the rest of me and are moving. I sometimes get a ringing/buzzing in my ears. Also feeling quite tired. These effects continue until..<br><br>
11:30  Fall asleep.<br><br>
NEXT DAY<br><br>
9:30am  Woke up feeling stoned and mellow still. I also feel very physically tired as if I have just been running.<br><br>
1:00pm  Stoned and mellowness starting to fade. One good thing I noticed was that I seemed to get higher much more easily. I felt quite stoned after just tobacco, smoking hash nearly knocked me out. I guess it is because I am still above baseline.<br><br>
Overall I am not quite sure whether Nutmeg is worth it. It was interesting to try it once, I think Im gonna try it again in a few weeks with a bigger dosage. The major downside for me was that it took so long to come on, I think I fell asleep before the proper stuff began. I was on quite a downer at first because I thought it hadnt worked which may have interfered with my mindset.<!-- End Body -->
