Setting: In my girlfriend's flat and in a peaceful local churchyard. It is a hot summer's day in the UK. The streets are quiet as it's a Sunday.<br>
Set: Both my girlfriend and I are as mentally healthy as you could hope really. She has suffered depression in the past but has been off SSRIs for the last month and quit with few issues. I do not normally get much body load or nausea from psychedelics. I am absolutely confident in the identity of the material, having examined the analytical data and spoken to the vendor at length. I enjoy trying new substances and having been looking forward to this for a while so perhaps somewhat unwisely squeezed it into a day where the setting could have been better.<br><br>
1000 I drop 150ug. The blotter tastes of nothing but cardboard. I quickly swallow it.<br><br>
1015 I go to the supermarket and think I feel something but it was likely just placebo.<br><br>
1028 Possibly something?<br><br>
1058 Whatever there is, it's still very mild.<br><br>
1125 I put some music on and it sounds great. I notice my vision is crisp. Now there is something!<br><br>
1200 we mess around playing with the cat and listening to music. I'm sad I don't have a subwoofer or any trip toys here. I eat some crisps in the hope it will settle my stomach<br><br>
1215 GF's sister calls in response to our asking when she was back to the flat. After accidentally muting the phone the first time I am able to hold a perfectly normal conversation with her suspecting nothing until I told her.<br><br>
1230 My stomach hasn't gotten better but it's still mild.<br><br>
1256 I finish a ham sandwich without much issue, as much to prevent myself eating nothing but crisps. Still some stomach discomfort but nothing major.<br><br>
1316 I get a fantastic massage which causes some CEVs to come with the music and tactile sensations.<br><br>
1330 Dry mouth? I think it's just quite hot in the flat so I have some water. We lay in bed chatting.<br><br>
1345 Pretty significant OEVs as well now, fractals on the ceiling and mandalas in the sun shining through the window.<br><br>
1354 There is a pleasant body buzz too.<br><br>
1415 We get ready for a walk. I am tripping fairly hard but easily able to keep composure walking down the high street.<br><br>
1430 We walk to some fields nearby but find they are fenced off for development which makes me a bit sad.<br><br>
1445 We settle in a very quiet churchyard just off the route. Some visuals but I think the bright sun overpowers them somewhat.<br><br>
1530 The experience feels less intense now. much time for thought. I flirt with my girlfriend and though I feel I'd be physically able I don't think I could manage intimacy like this.<br><br>
1630 We mess about for a while. though it feels less intense than earlier, it doesn't really seem to be getting less intense.<br><br>
1730 My girlfriend seems mostly to have come down. we get back to the flat and I have no problems chatting with sisters who are aware I am tripping and accordingly respectful.<br><br>
1800 The sisters' boyfriends are here which makes the setting imperfect, still probably tripping at the same level as 1700 really, mild visual distortions but a very easily handled trip.<br><br>
1900 I still have minor tracers and feel emotionally sensitive but I think it's just afterglow and some HPPD. Perhaps an enhancer would bring it back slightly at this point.<br><br>
1930 We go to a nearby shop and bump into some acquaintances I'd certainly rather not have to speak to. I am socially pretty incapable and dislike the experience. It plays quietly on my mind for the rest of the evening.<br><br>
2000 I eat my microwave meal without issue despite not really being hungry.<br><br>
2015 We make love. It's great as might be expected but I don't think the LSZ changed much about it.<br><br>
2130 I travel home on the train.<br><br>
0030 I am tired and fall asleep without issue considering the heat.<br><br>
0730 I wake up the next morning and am fine at work but perhaps a little more sensitive than normal. This is most likely just because I usually need 8h sleep.<br><br>
Summary: The trip was very pleasant without too much in the way of challenging thoughts. It did seem to become a little more introspective towards the latter half but this was not unwelcome. The trip was comparable to 13 mg 2C-E, 700ug 25I NBOMe (nasal), or about 1.3 'hits' of LSD. The subjective effects were certainly most reminiscent of LSD. As a fairly experienced tripper I would certainly go for 200ug next time, especially with a better setting. <br><br>
I would say the comeup was approx 45-60 mins to real alert, 3h to peak and the total duration perhaps 8h plus afterglow, though with a higher dose it may reveal itself to be longer and come up a little faster.<!-- End Body -->
