 "report": "<p>A recent study of the mescal bean and its ritualistic use sparked the desire for a human bio-assay. A first attempt with 100 mg of mescal bean powder was orally ingested with no noticable effects.</p><p>A second attempt with approximately 250mg of powdered mescal bean was insnufflated. One hour later, a very heavy feeling began to occur in the body. At two hours one felt a strong intoxication not too different from the feelings of alcohol. Warm sensations occured throughout the body as a narcotic feeling manifested in the head. All effects ended after four hours.</p>"
