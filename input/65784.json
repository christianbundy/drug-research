 "report": "<p>I have recently put on Paxil due to severe Panic Attacks which are due to me being a severe Hypochondriac. So I am on my third day and symptoms are getting worse. I feel as though I am going crazy. I can not sleep. INSOMNIA is killing me. </p><p>I take the pill around 3pm. By 6pm I feel as though my forehead is going to melt off. My pupils are dilated. My heart is racing. And I'm freezing yet my palms are sweating. Another hour or two goes by and I get the feeling as though I am rolling on E. I have this incredible feeling of happiness that makes me so I can not contain my smile. Then the melting forehead slowly starts to come back. I then find myself checking my pulse and rubbing my head and checking pulse again. I feel as though I'm winding down from a night of mushrooms. This goes on until I fall asleep around 5am and wake up around 630am feeling like I got a full 8 hours sleep. Until I start to get tired around 11am and I take my next pill around 3pm and repeat the whole cycle.</p>"
