I've been suffering from depression for quite a number of years. I'm usually very emotional, I cry a lot, I easily get angry, etc.. <br><br><br>
Anyway, so I was walking around aimlessly in my local pharmacy and I stumbled upon St. John's Wort. I've read that it's used for depression but being OTC, I didn't really think much of it. I was bored so I decided I'd give it a try. <br><br><br>
The recommended dose is 900mg a day. One dose in the morning, afternoon and evening. My first dose was 3 300mg caps. Then for the next few days I was taking maybe 1200mg a day. I wouldn't say I was feeling better, but the sadness wasn't there. I wasn't thinking about anything. <br><br><br>
I Googled the lethal dose, and being that there isn't any documented, I just started taking caps whenever I saw the bottle in front of me. Some days I would take 25 caps a day (7500mg). <br><br><br>
OK, it has been about two weeks now. I feel VERY emotionless. I feel like a zombie. I can't tell if this is good or not. I don't cry anymore, I'm not sad.. but I'm very empty. I find myself in bed for 18 hours a day. I feel extremely extremely bored. My mind is just blank. <br><br><br>
As a side note, I need very little Marijuana to get really high, and when I do, it's almost too much to handle. My heart also tends to race faster when I'm high. <br><br><br>
Overall, I wouldn't really call this a mood enhancer. It doesn't make me happy, it just removes some of the negative feelings, leaving me neutral. Being relatively safe and OTC (in the States anyway), it's probably worth a try. They say this is not for severe depression (which I have) but for moderate/mild depression. I now understand why. YMMV.<!-- End Body -->
