[after cannabis]<br><br>
I'll never find the right words to describe what happened, but here goes. The first thing I remember was a series of 5 objects indescribable yet completely different from each other. For some reason I think of the color tan when I think of them, so maybe it was part of them. But the 5 objects were lined side by side and moved at me quickly, and my thoughts were read aloud and seemed quite foreign, I was able to sub-think or counter my thoughts that were read aloud with completely different thoughts, from seemingly another person, but they were definitely self-generated. <br><br>
Every time I did this counter thinking, one of the objects would be affected by it, I had no idea what caused each object to be affected, but it didnt see to be random. By affected, I mean a notch, like, a replica of the main object would appear right behind it in a row, and I saw it in a sort of ¾ birds eye view. I only faintly remember thinking about something, I believe it was something of the din. Din being the only way I could think to describe the sound. The thought that was being read aloud thought it was Family of the (something sounding like Din) Its quite unclear what happened right after that, but Family of the Din was of great importance. I remember all of a sudden having a strong feeling that I was sitting at a chair at a dining room table, I looked at a father who was to my right, and to my left a mother and the chair opposite me was empty. It is very hard to describe because a lot of things that happened were feelings and not visions, things never otherwise felt or experienced. But visions were definite along with the feelings sometimes. <br><br>
The next thing I remember is feeling like I was sitting on top of the table and I felt ashamed because I knew I shouldnt, but I didnt move. I look to my left and on the edge of the table are 2 fingers, curled from beneath it, pulling the wood making up the table as if it were cloth. A strong feeling of being pulled in the direction of the fingers coincided with the vision. A lot is foggy around this point, hard to remember in detail all of the strange events. But I seem to remember some great importance to the left and right corner of the dining room table, the fingers were on the left, but on the right I cannot recall, I only remember both spoke in separate distinct voices. Not much happened or I cant recall or describe, but not long after that, the intense period had ended and it was smooth sailing to baseline.<!-- End Body -->
