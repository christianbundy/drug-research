I've tripped on mescaline via the San Pedro cactus on several occasions.<br><br>
After a couple of hours of SIGNIFICANT nausea (which could have been diminished by using an extraction procedure rather than eating the whole cactus), the trip is surprisingly similar to LSD yet different in two main ways. First of all, from a 'stimulant' perspective, it is very mellow compared to LSD--almost a drowsy, dreamy feeling rather than the teeth-grinding 'I'm going to lose it' panicky feeling of high-dose LSD. Yet, at the same time, the mescaline trip is significantly more visually powerful than a comparable dose of acid (more powerful quantitatively, but not qualitatively). The mescaline trip also lasts longer for me than LSD, with a very gentle and gradual come-down. Mescaline is definitely a drug with which the hangover comes before the pleasurable effects, but if you can hang in there without puking for a couple of hours, it can be a very worthwhile experience in a safe and supportive environment. However, the cost of the San Pedro cactus (roughly twenty or so bucks for a powerful trip), combined with the hassle of grinding it up, stuffing it into gelatin capsules, and then managing to swallow fifty of these capsules, has made this not worth the trouble for me any more now that I know what the trip is like.............however, it was DEFINITELY worth satisfying my curiosity.<!-- End Body -->
