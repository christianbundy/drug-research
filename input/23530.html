I just tried amanitas for the first time last weekend. The mushrooms made for a good, enjoyable time, but if I had to grade amanitas, I would give them an 'I' for 'Incomplete'.  After researching this type of mushroom, I bought an ounce of Grade A Washington Amanitas from an on-line catalogue.  The mushrooms were dried and had the stems removed, so they were all just big, red caps. Having a sensitive stomach, I'm always looking for psychedelic preparations that are gentler to the gut. I found a recipe for Amanitas and Syrian Rue tea.   <br><br>
DOSAGE:<br>
Before I talk about the preparation and trip, I'll say a few things about myself: I'm a 27 year-old man with pretty broad experience in many drugs, though I've mellowed a bit through the years and now my tastes run mostly to cannabis and alcohol. I take occasional (maybe three times in a year) psychedelic voyages aided by various drugs that grow from the ground, which I prefer to the man-made kind. Also, I'm 6'3' and about 190 lbs, in strong physical condition, I work out regularly and have a quick metabolism, so my dosage will be different from many others. <br><br>
MY PREPARATION:<br>
1) On an empty stomach, take Bong rip and Zantac to combat possible nausea.<br>
2) Bring a small amount of water to a low-boil. I've heard that stainless steel pots are the best for this, but I don't know for sure.<br>
3) Add lemon slices or a crushed vitamin C tablet to the water for acidity. In my experience, taking some vitamin C enhances the effects of a psychedelic preparation.<br>
4) Crumble up the dried mushrooms. I used a medium-sized cap that weighed 4g. Crush Syrian Rue seeds (3.5g) into fine powder with mortar and pestle. Add mushrooms and seed pulp to water.<br>
5) Boil for 15 minutes. In the last 3 minutes, add tea leaves or tea bag to water to mask taste. I also recommend dropping in a couple sugar cubes or some honey for taste.<br>
6) Strain mixture into glass. Discard solid material. Cool liquid and drink. <br><br>
EXPERIENCE:<br>
My amanitas experience came on gently -- it whispered rather than screamed, it embraced rather than grabbed. The effects were soft and subtle, but definitely there. I had an overall feeling of peace and tranquility; a flowing gentleness that seemed to wash over me. There was no nausea, though the weed I smoked during the trip helped. There were no hallucinations, but each of the senses felt altered. The peak came around the third hour and then tapered off. The best part of the trip was just walking in the park and enjoying a beautiful day in May. The after-effects were also mild -- I ate later and slept without any problems and felt normal the next day. <br><br>
CONCLUSIONS:<br>
It was a mild, though pleasant, trip and worth more research. I chose to be cautious and prepare a small dose for my first experience with Amanitas and Syrian Rue. For me, 4g  of mushrooms and 3.5g Syrian Rue made for gentle, mild trip, much like a small dose of psilocybin mushrooms. I think amanitas mushrooms are worth exploring and next time I'll try a higher dosage.<!-- End Body -->
