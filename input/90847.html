<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body --><p>Night Lights are marketed as an XTC like pill. I bought two pills at a local head-shop for $17 dollars apiece. I was skeptical, but I had heard good things. The packaging does not list the ingredients or the place of manufacture. So, I have no idea what was in them. Even now, after researching here on Erowid, I still dont know what they are. So, Im making this post, because I needed this information a month ago and it was not available. All I know is it was one large red pill, filled with a dry, fine white powder inside. I have done lots of Mushrooms and LSD. Ive done ecstasy a few times. So thats my prior experience.</p><br><p>I took the pills nearly one month apart. There was no desire to re-dose, so I do not think these are addictive. Both experiences were the same, even though the environment was different. I felt no sickness or negative feelings at all after taking them. I was afraid they would make my stomach hurt or make me nauseous. They did not. I dont know if they are safe, but my body accepted them happily, compared to say a stomach full of mushrooms. I took the first one on an Empty stomach and the second one (a month later) on a full stomach. This did not make any difference. They began to kick in around 30 minutes both times.</p><br><p>The Positive EFFECTS:</p><br><ol>
<li>Euphoria all over my body. It covered me in pleasure. My skin felt ridiculously good. The wind/sunlight was damn near orgasmic feeling. It is truly one of the best feelings Ive ever experienced. This effect lasted for at least 3 solid hours and slowly tapers off.</li><br><li>Visuals: The were no hallucinations. No light trails, no shifting patterns, nothing. However, colors were magnified by 10. To the point of glory. Everything is so beautiful. I spent both of my trips just looking at things in amazement. Sounds, including natural sounds, voices, and music take on a new dimension too.</li><br><li>Love for Humanity: I am normally an anti-social misanthrope with severe social anxiety. These pills made me just the opposite, which was a completely new experience for me. I loved (not sexually) everyone. I felt I could trust anyone and opened up to complete strangers every chance I could. This is both good and bad. The filter between stranger and friend seems to dissolve.</li><br><li>No Fear: With Mushrooms and LSD, The Fear was always part of the fun to me. I would never take such drugs in public, because Id likely freak the fuck out. Night Lights induced no fear. Instead they eradicated it entirely. Everything was right in the world and I felt peaceful and benevolent.</li>
</ol>
<br><p>The Negative Effects:</p><br><ol>
<li>Jaw clenching and teeth grinding. My jaws ached the day after I did it the first time. The second time I chewed bubble gum which gave my mouth something to do. This seemed to help out a lot.</li><br><li>The Next Day - I needed two days of free time to take one of these. The day after is kind of shitty. I was mentally and physically exhausted. I had a splitting headache. I felt sleepy. The process of going from a world without fear and suspicions and a sense of connection to the human race (and nature) back to normality is jarring. I wish I could hold on to that sense of connection, but alas, it fades away. By the 3rd day, its gone entirely.</li>
</ol>
<br><p>That pretty much sums up my experience. Maybe this will help inform others. I dont know what is in them, and they may be dangerous. But the side-effects seem far milder than most time-tested psychedelics. I would gladly do them again, and would prefer these over LSD or Mushrooms.</p>
