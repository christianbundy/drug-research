I was with my boyfriend and two of his semi-outlaw friends in a motel room when I was told we were going to try jimsonweed.  I had absolutely no idea what to expect, but anticipated we might get a mild buzz from it.<br><br>
One of the friends prepared a tea, using hot tap water and chopped-up stems of the plant, heavily laced with sugar to cut down on the bitterness.  He poured us each a glass, and told us to drink it as fast as possible.  I understood what he was talking about, because after I drank the first swallow, it felt like my throat was clamping shut and didn't  want to let me drink.  I managed to drink about 8 oz. of the tea.<br><br>
The effects came on quick--10 minutes or less.  My memories of what happened are spotty.  The first thing I remember was standing up to make a trip to the bathroom, and finding that my legs seemed rooted to the ground, feet heavy as lead.  I don't know if I was eventually able to walk, or whether I gave up and sat back down.  <br><br>
As another person has reported here, datura is a delusional drug rather than a hallucinatory one.  You don't see patterns, trails, or any cool visual effects; you just actually believe in things that aren't there.  I remember sitting on the bed, playing with a pearl necklace, then suddenly realizing there was no necklace there.  I remember holding a glass for a while--but when I raised it to my mouth to take a drink, my fingers closed around nothingness because there was no glass there.<br><br>
Apparently, eventually my boyfriend and I left the motel, drove to a fast food place to get a snack, then he took me home.  I remember none of that.  My boyfriend said that when he asked me what drink I wanted at the burger place, I argued with him insensibly about it.  <br><br>
I do remember coming home, making it to the living room, then managing to get to the couch to lie down.  My mother was there and apparently I said something incomprehensible to her before I crashed. It's the only time I can remember in my drug-taking career when I wasn't able to fake being straight.  Several hours later I was able to function somewhat normally, at least until bedtime when I could sleep off the rest of the drug.<br><br>
Using datura is the closest I've ever come to death.  I believe it was trying to shut down my nervous system.  Although I was walking around, my mind was unconscious.  There was nothing fun about it--no euphoria, no beauty, no cool rushes, no socializing.  Just leadenness and isolation and unconsciousness.  Of all the drugs I've taken, this is the one that I'd be too scared to ever take again.<!-- End Body -->
