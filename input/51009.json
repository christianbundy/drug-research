 "report": "</p>\nI am currently a seventeen-year-old high school student who had recently traded a quantity of home-extracted salvia to a friend for a number of pills, noticeably XR (extended-release) Adderall and Lexapro. I had done Adderall once before when I had taken three 20-milligram XR pills, an experience which piqued my curiosity in the substance, but nevertheless felt that the extended-release mechanism significantly detracted from the experience, due to the lack of rushing as the amphetamines hit since the active chemicals were released much more slowly. I had been waiting for a few days to try out this combination, keeping a bowl of very good bud to try and combine with Adderall, not only to see the reactions between the two but because cannabis in general makes me tired and lethargic, an effect I wished to offset by dosing with amphetamines beforehand.</p><p>Preparations: The night beforehand, I got a bottle of half ginger ale, half Coke and opened a 20-mg Adderall pill into it. To my dismay, a few of the little pellets fell on the floor, though not a significant quantity, so I prevented any further loss by simply dropping the second pill right in the bottle. I let it sit overnight in my backpack for the next day, hoping to have made a much more quickly absorbed version of the amphetamines than would have been allowed by simply popping the pills.</p><p>Experience: The day was a Friday, and like usual by the end of the week, I was rather jaded and tired of the same old bullshit routine. I was excited to try out this combination, however, due to expectations that the effects of combining of these three drugs may be interesting.</p><p>As a note, I dont take any of these pharmaceuticals myself, so theres no reason for me to have built a tolerance to them. I had never taken Lexapro before, and didnt really think much would happen because of it, due to the fact that I had taken antidepressants before and only gotten a mildly relaxed mindset combined with dilated pupils and (the most noticeable effect) an intensified orgasm.</p><p>It was beginning of the first period of the day, and I was in the gym locker room. I took out the laced bottle of soda and began drinking it, downing about one-third of it in a few seconds. The taste was normal, but nevertheless the XR capsules had not fully dissolved, and I could see little bubbles of actives in the drink. I didnt worry, however, since I do believe I had sped up the absorption of the drug significantly, even if the extended-release mechanism was not completely destroyed. By the end of the period, I began to feel what I thought were threshold effects, with a generally better over-all mood being present. Nevertheless, I couldnt be sure, and at that stage would not have completely discredited the placebo effect.</p><p>Second period passed by, and with the passing of time, my mood in general continued to improve. By this point, the Adderall felt like nothing more than a mild caffeine buzz, so at the beginning of third period, I downed another one-third of the drink.</p><p>Third period was a rather work-intensive honors class, and as the teacher went over the subjects, I could tell the amphetamines were definitely beginning to take hold. My notes were taken quickly and neatly, and my concentration level seemed much higher than normal. My heartbeat seemed quickened, and I never hesitated to ask questions, mainly because I needed to in order to prevent the teacher from calling on me to answer a question on the homework I had not yet done.</p><p>Fourth period, the effects continued to rise, though they were nothing special yet. I talked at a faster pace, an effect that would later be elevated to a ridiculous degree, and felt like I couldve talked my head off about absolutely nothing, another typical effect of amphetamines. My entire body felt light and I had an abundance of energy, almost as if I was ready to take on any task required of me.</p><p>In the few minutes of free time between fourth and fifth period, I thought it would be a good idea to try out the antidepressants. I took two Lexapro pills out the bag of three my friend had given me and popped them in my mouth. They dissolved quickly, leaving a rather disgusting taste behind that I washed down with more of the amphetamine-laced soda. By now I probably only had one-fifth of the bottle left, and was most definitely feeling more than a typical caffeine buzz or feeling of natural energy. My confidence was boosted in myself to a great degree, and not only my actions but also my thoughts worked at a much accelerated rate.</p><p>We had a quiz fifth period, which I completed quickly, remembering information I dont think I wouldve remember without the amphetamines there to improve both my memory and thought. My pace and heartbeat were both increasingly rapid, though not too much above normal; my heart rate seemed nothing more than it would be on a quick walk, not like the ridiculous frenzied pounding my heart had done on other drugs like high doses of DXM. By the end of the period, nausea and regret over taking the antidepressants was setting in. With ten minutes left of class, I could feel an increasing upset flutter in my stomach, and quickly went to the bathroom, where I vomited a minor, almost insignificant, amount. I place these effects entirely on either the antidepressants or their reactions with the amphetamines, since Adderall had never given me any nausea before at much higher doses.</p><p>Next period was lunch, where I finished the last antidepressant pill. I wouldnt finish off the soda until school was over, but the next two periods nevertheless passed by with my thoughts running at a million miles a minute. Adderall makes many users into ideal students, in my experience, possibly why its so highly prescribed.</p><p>At the end of the day, I was talking to a friend of mine, extremely sped up by now from the nearly 40 milligrams of Adderall I had taken, and he asked me what I was eating. The answer was, of course, nothing; my teeth were gnashing each other just like the stereotype of a methamphetamines user. Funny how they fight a War on Drugs against methamphetamines, when the amphetamines doctors prescribe to the youngest of our children every day produce the same effects as the street drug. Id continue to have such habits throughout the day, but the most noticeable were gnashing my teeth and licking my front teeth in a rhythmic pattern over and over.</p><p>After school, I drank the rest of the soda the soda, and popped another 20 milligram pill of Adderall. My confidence was flying by now, and I completely understood why people get addicted to methamphetamines and other stimulants. I could approach anyone, talk about anything, and still feel on top of the world. On the way home, I passed through the local park, where I packed a bowl of cannabis into a simple pipe I had made out of a Coke can. The day was windy, but I felt no cold or discomfort as I sat there, smoking some of the best bud I had sampled in months. It was a light-green color, smelling like a skunk and smoked very smoothly.</p><p>Now there were some interesting effects afterwards I cannot fully describe. I was pretty damn high at this point, having the old surreal thought patterns from smoking cannabis, yet the Adderall and cannabis combination was perfect; the high was the most energetic I had ever felt. There were no munchies, no nodding off, no lethargy- all the good side effects of cannabis without any of the bad ones. I was, however, noticeably tweaking even harder, and repetitively licked my mouth with my tongue over and over.</p><p>As soon as I got home, I sat down and began working on a novel. Pages flew by, and by the time I looked up again, four hours had passed, simply like that. It was amazing how much time simply vaporized into nothingness while working under the influence of amphetamines.</p><p>I took my last 20-milligram Adderall around 7:30 at night, chewing it a bit first. I had been tweaking all day by this point, and, still riding a long and strange plateau of energy, went to walk our dog with my sister, who told me I should go to my room because the effects of the amphetamines were apparent. My voice was frenzied and I spoke at a ridiculously rapid rate, as if I needed to get all of my words out as fast as I could. Nevertheless, I had told her what I was on, and my parents didnt notice, so its possible that she only knew because she was listening for it. I could have acted totally sober and slowed my words to a normal rate if I wanted to.</p><p>As for the antidepressants, I noticed they had taken hold because my pupils were completely dilated, until there was only about a millimeter of iris around the black center.</p><p>The antidepressants seemed to impair my sexual drive, however, as it took me nearly an hour of frenzied activity to get off. The next day, I would find that I literally rubbed my skin raw in my amphetamine-paced activity, yet nevertheless, the finale was really something else. The antidepressants and Adderall combination made it one of the most intense I have ever experienced, lasting at least a few times longer than a normal one and feeling much more insanely good.</p><p>I would stay up until around 6 AM the next morning before drifting off, the effects of the amphetamines gradually tapering off. I got about two hours of sleep before being woken up to my work with my father for the day, and still felt mild feelings of amphetamine rushes throughout the day, though by the next night I was completely exhausted and passed out for around thirteen hours.</p><p>Adderall is an aide whose usefulness extends beyond description for someone who wants to actually get things done, and is a perfect precursor to smoking cannabis if one wants a combination to remember. The Lexapro, however, had only borderline usefulness, and even that seemed only in relation to its functions on the sexual drive of any users.</p>"
