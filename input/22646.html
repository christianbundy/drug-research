I have recently been experimenting with several medicinal herbs.  If you ask me, I think people give herbs a bad rap mostly because they don't obtain quality herbs. People who find herbs useless probably bought some stuff thats been sitting on the shelf forever.  To acquire quality herbs, I would recommend finding a local herb/witch shop or check out ebay for some good deals.  (I found awesome valerian and kava off ebay for dirt-cheap).  The main thing to remember is not to expect too much or overdo it.  <br><br>
A newfound ally of mine is the California poppy.  Due to a lack of CA poppy reports, I thought I'd post my experience with this plant.  Related to the opium poppy, though it contains no opiates, the CA poppy has an analgesic and sedative effect.  I obtained an ounce from a local herb shop and whipped up a cup of tea consisting of 2 tsp. German chamomile and 1 tsp. CA poppy, which I enjoyed.  It gave a spacey and stoned effect, similar to a mixture of marijuana and a little codeine, yet unique.  I then proceeded to make an extract with isopropyl alcohol, resulting in a vegetative matter similar to kif, but darker.  I threw this on a bowl of MJ and the effects were quite pleasant.  It was comparable to the tea, but stronger and it actually didn't taste all that bad.  I had heard some people used CA poppy for easing opiate withdrawlas and I see how it could help.<!-- End Body -->
