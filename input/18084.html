I first tried OxyContin in March of 2002.  A friend of mine introduced me to him - his friend was prescribed sixty 40mg tablets a month, which she sold for $15-$20.  He introduced me with the caveat: 'these are as addictive as heroin'.  Had a nice sound to it, I thought.  I must say this is the best (and worst) drug I have ever tried.  Before I had been something of a speed fiend - I liked the rush from Ritalin, Adderall, and coke (of which I have only done several times), but after sniffing Oxys, I was converted to downers.  Forget being cracked out at the end of a night's partying - I just lie in your bed nodding until sleep overwhelms me.  <br><br>
It is comparable to a good heroin high - I feel euphoric and have almost a sense of nothingness, almost weightlessness.  I feel an incredible warm feeling from within, and as good as that pure physical feeling is, the mental feeling is even better.  Unlike the morphine pills I have tried, which just give me a nice oxy-like body high, oxy's fuck with my head in the most unreal way, almost like a mild mental ecstasy high.  I am in a great mood, social, amiable, completely at ease with those around me. Not much can annoy me in this perfect state. <br>
My girlfriend is the most beautiful person on earth.  Sex can last for hours due to the opiate-induced impotence I get.  The nods are incredible, drifting in and out of the real world and the dream world before snapping out of it and becoming fully alert for awhile...before nodding off again.  There is nothing better than doing nothing on Oxys...smoking cigarettes and watching movies are my favorite pasttimes.  Forget about being productive, though I have managed to get at least a little homework done on the fuckers.  These pills are a taste of heaven, but I'm positive heaven does not include the nasty withdrawals I've had.  <br><br>
One Oxy binge I did was particularly painful...I snorted about 1.5 40mg, or 60 mg a day, daily for about five weeks.  Some days were more - over 100mg in some cases, some were less.  Oxys were my first hard drug I've binged on, and I was not ready for the withdrawals.  Terrible bodyaches, chills, hot flashes, headaches, nausea, difficulty sleeping, overwhelming tiredness (even after a 9 nine hour sleep induced with sleeping pills) and the worst part was the psychological effects: terrible irritability.  I pictured rails of oxy lined in front of me to relieve my pain (the pain of addiction, not some sort of honest-to-god chronic pain the fucking pill is actually prescribed for). I thought nonstop about oxys every hour of every day for about a week until the physical withdrawals subsided.  I got by with sleeping pills and a small amount of pot.  And the worse part was, the only reason I wasn't doing them was because they weren't around.  <br><br>
About two months passed and I could now see myself living without oxy's again, only until they were back circulating again.  I found myself back sniffing them again, and I just finished a 20mg line as I'm writing this.  Christ this costs so much money.  I am thankful I do not have a steady supply - they're around for a week and then they'll be gone for two weeks...so even now I won't have the opportunity to go on a six week binge like I did last April.  But now I'm coming off of a two week binge and I'm having withdrawals, though nowhere near what I had experienced - just some minor body aches and a fucking stupid thought process that goes something like 'I want oxys I want Oxys I want Oxys just one fucking oxy...everything sucks. I want an oxy'.  It's very stupid, really.  I like to have xanax around for when Im withdrawing.  It puts me in a dissociative (though not delightfully high) state where I can forget about them for at least an hour.   <br><br>
I said myself I'd try them once and wouldn't do them anymore.  I'm lucky I do not have an incredibly cheap, constant hookup or I'd be a full-fledged junkie instead of a college student who dabbles too much with pharmies.  I've never shot them and don't intend to, because I know I'll be in an alley instead of in class - my personality is just too addictive.  Oxys are heaven and oxy's are hell.  But it's so fucking good I don't know how anybody can resist.  God I love this feeling.  But I'm going to feel like shit tomorrow cause they're gone for at least two weeks.  Who cares, though?  I spent all the money I have on them and now I don't have any gas money, so I couldn't even get to my dealer's house if I wanted, much less hand the greedy girl $100 bucks for five lousy pieces of heaven.<!-- End Body -->
