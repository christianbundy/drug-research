 "report": "<p>Let's skip my history because its a long one. I have tried most everything in most every form, except IV, more than once and would call myself a very experienced user.</p><p>Now for the fun. </p><p>I procured 1000mg MDAI and a small 100mg 5-APB, of which actually contained 120mg :) Any way me and my girl decided a little experiment was in order. I quickly weighed out two capsules containing 100mg MDAI and 60mg 5-APB.</p><p>0:00- Swallowed our goodies while just hang at my house. I got them and told her what it was and she was just as interested to try. So with that, down our hatches.</p><p>0:15- Both us can feel a little heat in our bodies not like being hot but warm with joy. We talked listened to music and chilled.</p><p>0:50- Before I knew it the most wonderful sensation knocked me on my bed. Laying there with my girl I could feel me body high go from 0 to 10000. The most amazing rush crept over me. </p><p>1:20- Floored.  Total euphoria and ego softening. Touch was not as amazing as mdma but the emotion was so strong, just rolling around in pillows created a total body orgasm but in my mind. No tingles in my extremities but total euphoria. At this point time goes out the window. All I know is we dropped at 5pm and were on the best one till 3am.</p><p>?:??- Everything is great feels like my first ever roll but so clean. Me and my girl talk for hours. We laughed, we cried, made love, and we explored each other.  I feel with this substance there is no ego. Only truth. I had a secret addiction to heroin, told her and she helped me get over it. Not only did it actually help me but was wonderful.</p><p>I have to say this is a great one, not too harsh but so good. Only problem I had was sleeping but that only lasted like two hours. All in all I LOVED IT. Highly recommended for taking with a loved one.</p>"
