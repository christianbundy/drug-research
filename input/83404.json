 "report": "</p>\nOver the past couple of months a few good friends of mine have been hospitalized due to panic attacks while on Third Plateau doses of DXM. There were 3 incidents of this, with 2 individuals. Every time they went to the hospital, they were drug tested, results being positive for both PCP and Opiates. I thought I would share this to add more information on the theory that high levels of DXM will cause false positives.</p><p>*Note that cannabis was also present in both users systems and drug test.</p>"
