 "report": "<p>After three weeks of Calea Zacatechichi use I must say that I'm quite satisfied. I started out using a blunt or a piece to smoke the stuff, and although the taste of the herb is something less than desirable, the effects were pleasant and what I had expected. Since I found the taste of smoking it disgusting though, I went out and purchased some large empty pill capsules, and stuffed them with ground up leaves, stems, and flowers (three of these is generally a good dose). One unique aspect of my experience however is that every time I've used Calea Z., right as I'm going to sleep, just as I close my eyes, I see what looks to be a very discernable eyeball. I know it might sound ridiculous, but I have reason to believe that this is my brains closed eyed visual representation of my 'third eye.' </p><p>Anyway, sleeping after the ingestion of Calea Z. can be described as some of the best sleep I've ever had. My dreams are longer, with much more clarity and continuity than usual. They seem to be much more introspective and easier to remember as well.  The ability to now remember my dreams more often and more vividly has led to my dreams being more meaningful and easier to gain insight from.</p>"
