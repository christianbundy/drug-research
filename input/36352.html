This is my first experience with Salvia so I put in quite a lot of research before I fired the bowl. This is recommended.<br><br>
I informed my girlfriend of my plans to experiment while she slept. We are both rather experienced trippers, so I didn't feel the need to use her as a direct sitter, but she was just a room away and ready should she be awoke.<br><br>
In my water pipe, I smoked a small bowl (half) of 5x Salvia to get a feel for the smoke. Then about 10 minutes later, I smoked another small bowl to try and find a slight feeling of the plant's effect. The smoke is pleasant. The feeling after two small bowls was slightly sleepy but not reflective of the true nature of the later trip.  <br><br>
After an half hour, I darkened my office and relaxed back into a big, reclining leather chair and smoked a large bowl. The dry material ignites easily and burns fast.<br>
I concentrated on putting the water pipe down before exhaling and accomplished that. Then I exhaled, blacked out, and here is what I wrote an hour after:<br><br>
'Salvia is like falling through myself and ending up on the other side of everything, naked, strapped to the nose of a rocket, confused and half-heart-filled.  And then I was someone else's body, in pain and slowly peeling myself off of that dimension felt like my flesh was ripped off. Excruciating. Yellow. The whole while, I remembered something, someone. Her, asleep. SHE is there. Where am I? Who am I/are we? Who is she? She is. She is asleep. Okay. She is. I am okay. I need her. Positive &amp; negative &amp; in the middle where the thing is played out--life is but one of these swirrling concessions. Love is another.'<br><br>
The first rush is similar to 5-Me0-DMT, where God's screaming everything at once and I can't remember any questions to ask. Or as another person put it, 'Like an elephant sitting on your head.' But 5-Me0-DMT doesn't seem to take you to the same place that Salvia does, which is a full, complete and new appreciation of being within the consiousness of some other thing, without a speck of residual personality left of you to figure it out until retrospect illuminates.<br><br>
In the experience, I believe I was, for a time, the space between someone's leg and a yellow laquered loveseat. There was a whole history to it, too. A story in there, a lifetime that I was aware of, but not impressed by. Mostly, I wanted out. Despirately. I started to remember another half of what would be me, and ached with the incompleteness, so I started peeling myself out of the dimension. Meanwhile in the real world, I had leaned forward to dump myself onto the floor. And by 'myself' I mean the simple core of me that could feel: confused, frightened and in a great deal of pain. <br><br>
THE PAIN<br><br>
I experienced excruciating pain throughout my body throughout the trip. It is perhaps the most complete pain I have ever felt, made of dull pain mixed with sharp pain, both pulsing and remaining constant. Sterio pain surging throughout my body lasting 5-10 minutes. I think that the pain may have manifested from fighting my way out of the surreal environment in search of a touchstone. My other half. But the pain was real. Like I'd been burned.<br><br>
I began to recognize the small computer lights in the office and shadows and shapes haunted until they became objects. I remembered what I had smoked and hoped that I would not suffer anymore strangeness as I was still raw. So I stayed and calmed myself on the floor until I could climb in bed with my girlfriend. Her sleeping presense helped bring me back around. After my soul returned, I got back up and thought about what had happened.<br><br>
Salvia is special, enlightening and natural, but it's heavy. I'm happy that I'd been crushed by 5-Me0-DMT many times, as that prepared me for this most intense 5-10 minutes of my brain's existence. Unfamiliar travellers be warned: riding on the nose of a rocketship can make you want to stop, and once youve gotten going, it's hard to get off.<br><br>
In spite of the pain, I will experiment with Salvia again. There is something real there.<!-- End Body -->
