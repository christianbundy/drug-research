Last night was my first shroom trip...hectic. It was late at night, I asked a friend for some weed, he didn't have any, so he offered me some shrooms instead. I didn't think much of it, brown leathery things in a ziplock bag that smelled like cowshit...my friend left after a while and I decided to dig in. I forgot to ask him how much to munch, so just to be safe,I ate it all!  <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Please be aware of taking doses that are unknown, research first to be safe, to know ones self limits is beneficial, please be aware!] </font><br><br>
30 mins later...<br><br>
I had no idea... I started to feel confused and at the same time I started laughing like a mad man! I decided to lie down and  sunk into my pillow. Energy waves surged through my skull and my mind dissipated into wonderland... I couldnt feel my heart, nor my pulses, I couldn't or didn't want to move, I accepted my fate and prepared for death...<br><br>
It was a wondeful feeling.. just before i left earth, some kind of electrical surge went up my spine and all around my brain tissue, i could distinctly feel excactly where it was.. amazing..<br><br>
My body contracted and and my lungs expanded,a burst of air entered my body, and an array of colours clouded my vision, this is when i realised I had forgotten to breath...<br><br>
Never again.....<!-- End Body -->
