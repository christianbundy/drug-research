 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWeight: 125kg (Obese)\r\nGender: Female\r\nDrug experience: \r\n- Regular recreational use of codeine (~85-100mg each evening) \r\n- Used cannabis a couple of times, with little/no effect.\r\n- Tried DOI recently, with no effect (probably due to being on SSRI)\r\n- Non-smoker\r\n- Alcohol maybe one-two drinks per week, binge maybe once or twice a year\r\n- Never tried MDMA, Cocaine, or Speed, so won't be able to compare experience :(\r\nHealth history:\r\n- Depression, no current symptoms, currently tapering paroxetine (have been on 10mg for 2 weeks coming down from max of 20mg)\r\n- Psychosis, no current symptoms or antipsychotic medication.\r\n- Schizoid, personality disorder\r\n- Mild Asthma, occasional ventolin use\r\n- Obesity, no medication\r\n- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), amenorrhea, no medication.\r\n- Chronic sciatic pain (prolapsed lumbar discs), analgesia(usually codeine) as necessary.\r\n- Ear/Throat infection 6+weeks, on antibiotics (Cephalexin 500mg/TDS).\r\nExpectations: Some nice feelings (probably dimished 'euphoric' and entactogenic effects due to SSRI use). Hopefully improved attention, reduced apetite, and lowered inhibitions. I'm hoping drug will be suitable for regular use in small doses to counteract constant feelings of lethargy, apathy, and social discomfort.\r\nSet: Had a nice day, and am excited to try the 4-FA. Feeling quite tired, but keen to stay up very late because I'm working night shift tomorrow night. No particular stresses, but feeling unwell due to ear/throat infection.\r\nSeting: In my bed at night with my laptop. Am watching YouTube videos of Minecraft (video game). Am hoping to feel motivated to get some Uni work done. I'm confined to my room as there are people sleeping in the house.\r\nT= Five past midnight (Friday morning)\r\nT-16:00 10mg Paroxetine (regular SSRI antidepressant medication)\r\nT-06:00 Cephalexin 500mg\r\nT-04:30 Moderate serving of pasta and white sauce\r\nT-04:00 Ibuprofec 600mg/Codeine 38.4mg (Due to tolerance, this is not enough for recreational feelings, just genuine pain relief)\r\nT+00:00 125mg in Gel capsule taken with lemonade. 375mL of same drunk over next 1/2 hour. My research indicates this is a large-ish dose to take first time, but dose ranges seem to vary a great deal, and I'm expecting to have to take more due to SSRI interaction and high body weight.\r\nT+00:35 Slight feeling of warmth and nausea, I eat a cookie.\r\nT+00:55 Nausea has subsided. Pulse slightly elevated. I have finished measuring the rest of my gram of 4-FA powder into capsules. No special feelings yet\r\nT+01:20 Have been watching YouTube videos and writing trip report. Still not noticing any different feelings\r\nT+01:30 Take final dose of antibiotic for day (Cephalexin 500mg). Take some painkillers for v. sore ear/throat: Ibuprofen 600mg/Codeine 68.4mg/Paracetamol 1g (only small recreational dose for my tolerance level). Am worried that painkillers will dull the 4-FA effects. I was hoping not to take any, but my ear is REALLY sore. Perhaps the pain is enhanced because of the 4-FA?? (EDIT: looking back the next day, I don't think the pain was enhanced, as it feels just as bad now)\r\nT+01:40 Take another 62.5mg 4-FA orally (in gel capsule). Eat another cookie.\r\nT+01:50 The cookie I'm slowly eating seems to somehow taste more delicious than usual. Much sweeter and more 'tasteful'.\r\nT+02:10 I've just realised I'm kind of obsessed with perfecting this trip report. I've been working on it for about an hour, and am now worrying that I'm making it too long/detailed. Perhaps this is increased concentration effect of 4-FA?\r\nT+02:30 The pain in my ear and throad has receeded tolerably, but I am feeling none of the relaxing warm glow I usually get from this dose of codeine. The 4-FA is definitely cancelling out some of that effect. So does it also follow that the codeine is cancelling out some of the stimulating and/or euphoric effect of the 4-FA?\r\nT+02:45 I'm starting to notice I feel a little tingly or buzzy. Not in my body, just in my head. I also notice that although I was tired when I started (woke early, had a busy day), I now don't feel particularly tired at all. I'm contemplating taking another 62.5mg. Maybe I'll see how I go studying for a while first.\r\nT+03:40 Not doing schoolwork, but am happily browsing the web. Don't feel especially energized or stimulated. Infact, I'm feeling quite tired again. I'm hesitant to take more 4-FA because I think it will be wasted after taking so much codeine, as I feel that's having an effect on my experience.\r\nT+04:10 Dry mouth. I've noticed that I have no hunger, which is unusual this long after tea (especially after codeine which usually makes me ravenous)\r\nT+06:15 I think it's over. Not that there was much 'IT' to get over. Feeling tired.\r\nT+07:45 Go to sleep\r\nT+12:10 Wake up after a bad few hours of sleep. I didn't sleep well, woke up many times, and only slept for about 4 hours.\r\nConclusion:\r\nI took a total of 250mg, which is 2-3 times as much as is usually required for effects to be felt, according to my research.\r\nTotal wash out. I basically got nothing :( The only thing I can say is that it did keep me awake all night, which is what I wanted, and my appetite was decreased. But had none of the euphoria, energy, focus, or social feelings.\r\nI think the effects of the 4-FA were completely taken away by either the SSRI or the codeine, or both.\r\nI will try this drug again in a few months when I have been off SSRIs for a while, and I don't have a sore throat. But for now, I find it useless.\n\n\n"
