I had taken ecstasy (along with a whole load of others, heavily, for around 12 years so have quite some experience of these things. I had left london 3 years ago and not taken anything since then, being in a new job which I enjoy. I had read lots of positive things about this substance (not counting compulsion, which I ignored) and thought it would be a 'Christmas treat' after my abstinence.<br><br>
I ordered 4g in total, and finally, 48 hours later in a brief interlude of clarity, I threw the remainder down the toilet. I would otherwise have continued doing one line after another, completely driven by this chemical. My nose was bleeding, my throat was dry and sore, I had a pounding headache right at the base of my skull, but I was still being driven to 'have just another line'. There is a persistant sensation that I have not quite reached the peak of the experience and 'just one more line' will do it. IT WON'T!<br><br>
This substance is all mink coat and no knickers, all promise and no delivery, leaving ME wanting more and more. Its like I am starting to come up on some of the best 'E', but then it stalls as though I have not quite had enough to reach that peak. I NEVER WILL HAVE ENOUGH!<br><br>
I'm not saying it is addictive, I certainly have no desire to ever touch the stuff again. But it is compulsive in the extreme, and once I start taking it, I am not going to stop until its all gone, and I will still not have been 'really' high. I had a nose bleed and headache for three days and a depressive comedown of 5 days. The toxicity of this substance builds and builds as I chase the high I will never achieve. It is just a big letdown. My advice is stay clear of it.<!-- End Body -->
