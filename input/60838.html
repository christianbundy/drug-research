Around two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the 'green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc... I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a 'thujone' high.<br><br>
(first time) <br>
I did the 'thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.<br>
- didn't really feel anything.<br><br>
(second time)<br>
I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.<br>
- no effect whatsoever<br><br>
(third time)<br>
This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.<br>
I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.<br><br>
T+0:00<br>
I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable<br><br>
T+0:05<br>
stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.<br><br>
T+0:07<br>
I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.<br><br>
T+0:15<br>
I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.<br><br>
T+0:25<br>
I feel normal again.<br><br>
My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled.<!-- End Body -->
