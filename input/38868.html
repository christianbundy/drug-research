9:35- 10-20 mgs. Probably under 20, but I was not able to measure it accurately.<br><br>
10:15- Feeling some awareness of having taken a substance. Difficult at this point to determine what the feelings actually are. Noticed slight trails, however, this could also be due to having taken 4-HO-DiPT several days ago.<br><br>
10:40- Well, something is different, however, I really cannot tell what. It is apparent to me though that I have more energy than earlier I have been having fun moving around the apartment and dancing. There seems to be some subtle energy permeating through the air around me. It is in this ether that Im also noticing slight trails and after-images. Again, ever since I took the Iprocin, Ive been seeing a lot of after-images, so it could be attributed to that. Music may be sounding better somehow too. Or Im just more into it. Physically I feel nothing except for slightly being warm. Mentally, nothing astounding other than a slight alertness. Emotionally, I am noticing a slightly elevated mood.<br><br>
12:00- Well, I feel like Im basically back down. Im still having some trails, but my energy is not apparent anymore. My roommate says he feels a little like hes drunk. I think were both gonna get ready to call it a night. This was a good first experience, but Ill want to up the dosage next time (I wanted to start on a low dose first though, to avoid any unwanted reactions.) I think this drug has a lot of potential, although I doubt it gets very visual.<!-- End Body -->
