My first experience with Salvia Divinorum 10x extract came a few months ago when I learned of it's online availability through various suppliers.  I had tried a 'salvia leave blend legal high deal' a long time ago and noticed no noticeable effects.  I assumed this was how all 'legal highs' were and didn't pursue it any further. <br><br>
The salvia had arrived in the mail and I was anxious to try it out right when it got there, but something came up and I had to postpone till later.  <br><br>
A note to first time trippers, don't do this by yourself.  Don't have anything laying around that could hurt you and make sure someone keeps an eye on you.  I sprinkled a small amount of the odorless, dark green salvia into my bowl and took a small hit.  I felt as if a heavy object was pushing me from wherever I looked and nothing more.  I got up and the effects went away almost instantly.  At this point I was disappointed with the results and figured it was all I was going to get off this.  About 5 minutes later, my curiosity got the best of me as I filled my bowl almost full with the salvia extract and took the biggest hit I could get (much like you would with reefer).  I held it in as long as I could and put down the pipe and sat back on the couch as the music played.  <br><br>
The trip began instantly, as I do not even rememeber exhaling the smoke.  I felt a woman's presence, much like that of my Mom and she told me something to the effect of 'drugs are good'.  Quickly the trip changed within seconds as I saw pure and brilliant colors in slow swirling patterns.  My vision was a total painting and the colors were dark and solid reds and yellows.  I saw nothing but the swirling patterns for sometime as I thought the world was ending.<br><br>
Huge 'machines of the universe' were cycling across the land much like giant tractors would till land.  Except the whole universe and world was visible from my point and I was next in these giant machines path.  I had to do something to escape their path of desctruction and the void they left behind.  I then broke out of this period of uncounscious, dream-like state as I almost fell out of the couch onto the floor.  I suddenly jumped to my feet, baffled and confused.  I did not know what was going on and I had little or no clue what I was doing or where I was even at.  The music was playing still, but I had not even heard it when I was 'cut-off from reality'.<br><br>
The music instructed me to 'Get out and leave'.  I had to get out of the place, I had no idea why.  I quickly tried to put on my belt, fumbling around, all the while the music was instructing me I had to go.  I flung my belt off and I started to run out of the house into the snow outside with no shoes or socks on and a t-shirt.  When I got to the door, I saw my first glimpse of consciousness.  <br><br>
I stopped dead in my tracks and looked over at the coffee table next to my couch, I saw my drug box sitting there open and I just then realized I had smoked salvia.  The entire time I didn't even know what I had just done.  I began to come to my senses soon and I sat down and brilliant rivers were flowing through my woodgrain walls and patterns of spirits and eyes appeared all over my vision.  I was trying to seperate objects from each other.  Morphinh of objects was controllable as I could make the TV morph into half of the wall, making entire walls disappear, etc.  <br><br>
At this point, I had had enough of this trip and got up and tried to shake it off and the comedown felt itchy/hot and dirty.  I ripped off all my clothes and got into shorts and they felt all prickly and spiny when I put them on.<br><br>
The entire experience lasted 30 minutes with comedown.  The peak was 0 seconds - 5 minutes with a 5-10 minute following period of a messed state of mind.<!-- End Body -->
