 "report": "<p>Most of the experiences reported of using GHB seems to be very negative, none I have read which says that it has been a glowing or that is has contributed anything to their lives. </p><p>First, I think it is important for you to know some background information. I live in Sweden (Icelandic in birth and I have also lived in the US - N.Y and Greensboro N.C). I see two very different cultures here in all ways drugs, social, family etc.. I am 173 cm's and very fit bodybuilding for 10 years 90 kg rock hard.</p><p>Lets focus on the drugs. I consider myself as a very experienced user of narcotics. Coke, smack, MDMA, speed, acid, shrooms, pot, foxy, methamphetamine, 2ct7, 10 different types barbs., steroids, you name it and I have probably tried it. Many of the substances I have abused very hard, not to mention alcohol!</p><p>Here in the Nordic countries we abuse depressant drugs much harder than people in the US, alcohol, barbiturates, GHB even heroin I think.</p><p>People tend to enjoy getting completely train wrecked. </p><p>This culture has been inherited from before the Viking age (1000 years ago) of drinking alcohol and getting totally pissed and eating shrooms and going berserk.</p><p>I am now 26 years old and have a masters in business from the University of Reykjavik, Iceland. I am happy being able to say that I have come to a point in life (matured - can you say that?) where I have realized that using drugs on a daily basis is not possible if you want to stay focused on something, for most people that is true especially in my job as a stock broker.</p><p>I don't consider any of my previous drug use as cool - which I want you to understand very clearly. I can just say to people who have not used drugs or have very little experience that I know some things that you don't have the slightest idea about and probably won't find out in this lifetime. I have seen things that you can't imagine. </p><p>Today use cocaine recreationally when being out drinking and socializing with people at pubs or parties.</p><p>I have a problem since my teens, SLEEPING, that is where GHB comes into the picture. I was first introduced to GHB approx three years ago. At that time I was heavily using barbs Valium (diazepam, doses at around 50-100mg) and roofies (flunitrazepam 5-10mg which is very available here in the Nordic countries). Problem was that when I was using barbs on a daily basis you can get really fucked after some time. Coordination, trouble talking, fatigue when not high (often for days), just to mention few side effects I felt. </p><p>GHB, wow, it has helped me so much. I use it 2-3 times a week 2 - 4 grams dosage (powder). For me 3 times a week is maximum as tolerance my tolerance builds up very fast. Using GHB two days in a row for me is waste, maximum 30% of effect is retained.</p><p>GHB makes me sleep so good I always wake up feeling rested and energized. </p><p>I ingest two grams listening to some good music and after the 30 minutes when the effects are fully on I take another two. Now one hour after the first hit I get very, very relaxed and if I close my eyes lying on the bed relaxing listening to some good soft music I fall in sleep in matter of 15 - 20 minutes feeling like a baby getting caressed by mom.</p><p>GHB has almost always been good for me when taken with ladies. Sex and touch gets so good. I think that the aphrodisiac effects that GHB has is truly amazing. </p><p>I get rohypnol on prescription. I use it the days I don't do GHB. </p><p>I don't glorify GHB in anyway to be a miracle medicine. The statement I want to make is that it has been a wonder cure for my insomnia, and I think it probably is very beneficiary for others that have similar problems as me.</p><p>Be careful with all drugs everyone reacts differently.</p><p>I know that you find this very boring, I have never been such a good writer. Thanks for reading.</p><p>Cheers from Sweden!</p><p>Gunnar</p>"
