This is written out of love and the hope of reducing suffering. <br><br>
A dear friend decided he would stop smoking weed and cigarettes and drinkin to appease his girlfriend.  In everyones eyes he had given up all his vices for his love. Roughly 4 into his hiatus my friend was found dead with a plastic bag and aresol can. The fact of the matter is my buddy was not a stupid person ignorant of the dangers of inhalants, he was well versed in using inhalants, growing up playing around with this gaseous death.  <br><br>
I am no saint I have huffed my fair share. I have even talked about the dangers of inhalants and my own misadventures. I figured he also had given up on doin this like I had. But, he had not, instead he stayed secreted away killing himself.<br><br>
There are two lessons to learn, 1 don't ever do inhalants they are a waste, there is no counter argument. 2, be honest with yourself and others no matter the cost, if they really love you they will continue loving you.<br><br>
This is for A who was like a brother and just cool and with the flow. Don't let your friends kill themselves if you know they are huffin put a foot in there ass its better to have an angry friend than a dead friend.<!-- End Body -->
