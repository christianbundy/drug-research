I saw this plant at a local garden shop &amp; took it home &amp; planted it.  It was quite happy here in S. California &amp; grew fairly large in a relatively short time.  I only water it about 2X/weekly at most.  Well it finally flowered - beautiful, big clumps of orange flowers - and when they started falling off I was there to gather them up.  I dried them out in the sun &amp; a couple of days later packed a small bowl of about 3 or 4 flowers &amp; hit it with a lighter.  The smoke is mildly harsh and the taste is OK but not great.  I immediately felt a bit relaxed &amp; somewhat horny.  This lasted a few minutes, then tapered off, &amp; I was back to normal within 1/2 hour or so.  I've used it a few more times since then, and for me it feels like marijuana without the THC.  It is strongly reminiscent of marijuana, but I never get very high or get any typical marijuana side effects like the munchies.  I've never tried to get really ripped off of it by smoking a lot, mainly because it isn't that fun to smoke (it burns pretty hot).  I rolled 8 or 9 flowers into a joint once, but it was mostly a waste of time - bong is the way to go.  This stuff is good to have around to chill if I'm feeling stressed, and the flowers are nice to put in a vase or just look at in the garden, but don't expect too much out of it.  I think I had more fun growing it than smoking it!<!-- End Body -->
