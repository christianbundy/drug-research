I tried writing a 4 page trip report detailing my exact trip down to every detail, but then I realized that the only way attept to capture an event so profoundly bizarre is to write a poem while 1/15th at the edge of reality.<br><br>
I realize that is this website is designed to display catagorical data about drug use, but what I experienced can't be explained with normal language, in the same way that emotions cannot be expressed in normal language.<br><br>
The details of my set and setting are unimportant as I had no connection my earth bound exist for the 10 or so minutes that I was in the hard trip. But just for refrence, I was in a room with friends.<br><br><br><br><br>
Your mist tasted of strangeness<br>
the people said goodbye <br>
I was gripped into your depths<br>
 at an alarming rate.<br>
My limbs were ripped off and I ceased to exist along with my friend, time.<br>
we saw god who was revealed as everybody in the room being ripped apart.<br>
tearing. everywhere.<br>
the true state of reality was chaos.<br>
I was being pulled and cracked -- god  was  breaking.<br>
I could not exist for much longer in this universe. The dark energy was too strong for me.<br>
Sudden I saw the puzzle pieces reforming.<br>
I wasn't ready to see into infinity so I was sent back.<br>
	Maybe reality can be handled one frame at a time. but perhaps not all at once.<!-- End Body -->
