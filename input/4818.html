You drink some of the 'Lucky 7' dissolved in water and wait... and wait... your body begins to tell you that you have been exposed to something you should not have been, but you ignore it, waiting for what is to come.  You wait...<br><br>
The room begins to become a liquid, flowing and swirling and shifting.  You begin to flow as well.  Your mind is racing, thinking about the beauty of it all.  You move your arm to light a cigarette, and another arm follows seconds later out of nowhere, performing the same actions.  Lights begin to split into the full spectrum, red on one side, violet on the other.  <br><br>
The liquid surfaces begin to shift into patterns.  Vast repeating kaleidoscopic swirls covering and twisting everything to the point of being almost unrecognizable, but it is still familiar to you somehow.  You begin to feel the patterns, their sheer energy coursing through your body.<br><br>
Soon, the patterns gradually begin to rise from the surfaces and form a sheet in front of your eyes.  It is faint at first, but it grows in intensity.  These patterns begin to fractalize.  You look around at what you used to think is reality, but the patterns dominate it.  You ask yourself, 'Am I seeing through the patterns to reality or seeing through reality to the patterns?'.  You wonder how many hours it has been since you ingested the substance that is doing this to you.  Your watch says around two, but your hardly trust it or your eyesight enough to believe.  Sounds shift up and down in pitch at extreme levels, echoing and repeating and changing until they are no longer recognizable either.  You cannot feel anything but tingling...  your body has lost all weight and substance, but you still control it.<br><br>
You look through the patterns to your home, the normal three dimensional world, and see it drip away and twist beyond recognition.  You walk into the dark, no longer really knowing or caring where you go, simply following another.  The fractals are all that remains.  Your body has become the fractals, and so have your thoughts.  Sound has repeated and changed so much that it is only a buzz.  You see, no you know, that all you have lived in all of these years was some joke, a nonexistant place designed to keep your brain busy.  <br><br>
The fractals are the true reality, they are you, they are everyone.  You see what you used to consider yourself repeated a million times over in them, splitting and recombining and finally dissolving into the sea of infinity.  Time has no meaning here, you are but one result of an equation that has uncountable results.  You float here as part of it for days, years, pondering the joke.  What is your name?  What is xxx object?  You couldn't remember if you tried, but you don't really want to anyway.  It doesn't matter at all, it was all a cosmic prank.  You are nothing and everything.<br><br>
Suddenly you hear something through the buzz very faintly... a voice, calling a word.  You remember the word for some reason, but cannot place it.  The fractals do not take kindly to your remaining grasp on your long forgotten reality.  They decide to punish you, to tell you that you aren't ready for them.  You are no longer the pattern, but it is forcing it's way into the space you occupy.  Pain, suffering.  You begin to think that the fractals are the joke and that they will keep you here forever as punishment for wanting to leave them.  The voice again.  You remember more now.  It is what you used to call yourself.  Someone who isn't seeing the underlying code is trying to call you back to be with them.<br><br>
You get scared.  You remember that you do have a body in your old world and it has been neglected for years.  You need to get back to it before it dies and you are left here with the fractals forcing themselves at you.  More pain.  The voice again, repeating less this time.  You frantically think of everything you could try to do to escape, but nothing works.  You could move your old body now, but you don't know where it is and you don't want it being hurt.  You try to think of something, anything to do, when you hear the voices telling you to sit.  The concept of sitting was made useless to you years ago when you entered infinity, but you slowly remember this as well.  You still know nothing of the location of your body.  You can still see the fractal world, but are no longer a part of it.  It does not hurt anymore, you have escaped everything but the visual and tactile connection to it.  They tell you to sit down again.  <br><br>
You finally sit, and suddenly you remember everything about your old world.  How long were you gone?  'Couldn't have been more than around 6-8 hours', you think.  Now that you remember the duration of the 2C-T-7 again.  Your old world starts slowly returning.  The patterns are still there, but you can see through them enough to function somewhat.  You check your watch...  3 hours since ingestion.  <br><br>
The patterns fade over the next few hours until they are almost nonexistant.  The patterns are only on the real objects now, but you think you understand them more.  You try to think about other things, but all you can do is wonder what is real and what is not.  It all looks like you remember it, but this is only a temporary place, with time and laws and rules.  It looks less complicated, easier to handle than the fractals did, but is it only another result of the equation being fed to your brain?  You never do discover the answer, but hope to someday in the future.<!-- End Body -->
