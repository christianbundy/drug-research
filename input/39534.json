 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've been taking MDMA (and LSD, ketamine, mushrooms, weed, cocaine) for about 5 years now.  I took 800mg in 8 hours and I had no problem. For the past (about) 9 months I've been having serious visual distortions (I cant focus right, I'm seeing weird things, many times I see everything moving slow etc.).  <br>I havent continued taking any drug since then but my vision is totally wrong. I went to a doctor (one of the best ones in my country) to see my eyes and he said i was ok. But sure thing is that I'm no ok. It's been six months and I cant see anything right.\n\n\n"
