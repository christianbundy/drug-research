 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI had just finished an extremely exhausting day at work and was in search for something that might bring me down from the immense frustration I had had at work that day. My choices were alcohol, ganja or rhovane/zopiclone. Since I had been doing a fair amount of the first 2 options in the last few week, I decided to take a couple pills of zopiclone, which is prescribed for sleeping problems like insomnia.\r\nI took the pills at approximately 11 o'clock, and by 11:30 I could feeling the first effects kicking in. It wasn't strong, but it was almost like a mild alcohol buzz. By about 12 I reached the peak of the experience. I felt a little drunk, my muscles felt quite relaxed, which was nice, there was very mild euphoria. I felt a little drowsy, but not so much that I had to go to bed right away. Walking was interesting and rather difficult; I had lost a certain degree of coordination and it was difficult for me to avoid bumping in to walls  :)   My muscles just felt quite heavy. Mentally, not much went on, I just felt sort of serene, yet calm and relaxed. Not as much thinking and worrying was going on in my mind as it usulay does.\r\nAll in all I'd say it was a decent night, nothing I'd want to start doing habitually, but it was a nice relaxing drug which I was in great need of. Just don't take more than 2 pills because you could suffer severe discoordination and a bit of amnesthia as well. Thanks for listening and peace.\r\nPrimo\n\n\n"
