 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell, I did this when I was very young. I was simply interested.\r\nThis is beyond dangerous, aparently this is bordering on the fatal dose of nicotine! It was certainly very unpleasant.\r\nAnyway, three 'regal' cigarettes were put in a tea-pot with some boilling water and left to brew for about 3 minutes.\r\nThe resulting tea was then drunk, it tasted very nice.\r\nThen, for about 3 hours I experinced a form of agony. I had a powerfull aversion to light, I had to cover my eyes in a darkened room, there was also a horrible full body buzzing sensation and a mild headache.\r\nFinally it all went away, and I have smoked ever since.\r\nRegal makes me feel sick however.\n\n\n"
