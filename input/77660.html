So one day when I was out of weed, I decided to look up some home herbal highs and Sage came up. So I looked in the kitchen and found a tub of sage leaves. I loaded up a bowl and took a large hit, and I did this about 5 times. Sage smokes like no other when lit so I may have lost a bit of the hit. About 30 minutes later I was feeling very head buzzed, and this lasted for about 2 hours. It did not give me a body high like weed, and the effects were minimal but there. <br><br>
Overall, it was an O.K. experience. I would probably only do it again if I was very bored or was out of weed. I did not hallucinate or anything like that, but I would occasionally have blurred visions or had to focus my eyes for about ten seconds to see something.<!-- End Body -->
