I have had a number of experiences with this substance, all using a pyrex glass ´bubble´ vaporizer (looks like a lightbulb with a tube sticking out of it). A ´blue flame´ lighter was always used to gently heat the bubble in order for the substance to turn into vapor.<br><br>
On a couple of occasions slightly too much heat was applied, which caused the production of something more akin to smoke than actual vapor.  What both myself and a friend noticed when this happened was that this caused a markedly different experience from when the material was allowed to slowly turn into a vapor. The experience was a lot more intense and came on stronger and faster.<br><br>
Maybe the reason many people find this compound so overly-intense is because they allow the material to burn before inhaling. From reading trip reports it seems many people use a standard pipe or bong which I guess would usually ignite this material. Although this has advantages I suggest trying a method where the substance turns to vapor slowly at a lower temperature than would be used to burn material, if anything simply for the comparison between the two.<br><br>
