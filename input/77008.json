 "report": "\n\n\n\nCitation: Anonymous, OR. 'Tryptamines' Purpose'. The Entheogen Review. Autumnal Equinox 1998;7(3):59.\r\nBufotenine, 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT are endogenous cerebral compounds. My view, regarding the purpose of these, follows. DMT is a main compound--perhaps the main compound--involved in imagination and dreams. 5-MeO-DMT is involved in maintaining fear in the face of danger. Certainly, when faced with danger, one needs fear. Not 'pure' fear, but a design-filled fear in which one can plan a way out of the dangerous situation. Bufotenine is involved in the feeling we experience called 'stunned.' Bufotenine causes no big stimulation--actually it causes tranquilization. And it causes no visuals--only minor optical disturbances. It causes a 'zapped out' feeling. A feeling of being 'neither here, nor there.' Being as how you ask for opinions and experiential revelations, I thought I would put in my small piece. Even though the effects of bufotenine wear off in about 30 minutes, I find that continued use over a two to four day period causes a buildup of effects. Good luck on your further adventures. I am pleased to see ER survive a fall and still carry on. --  Anonymous, OR\n\n\n"
