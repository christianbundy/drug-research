 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nAfter first week taking moclobemide (Aurorix), I notice quick improvement in mood, sleep, and interest of things.\r\nAurorix practically has no anticholinergic effect, no sedative effect, virtually non toxic to the liver.\r\nAs it is a RIMA, with the therapeutic dose, there is no need for food restriction.\r\nI tried most antidepressants, but found this one works well for me.\r\nIt relieves my dysphoric feeling.\n\n\n"
