Winter 2004: I was fully prepared for my first trip ever of any kind. Morning Glory was my drug of choice because its legal and convenient. I had read about all the different methods of preparation and had decided that chewing the seeds whole was the best option. So, I cleaned the seeds using some Joy Ultra dish soap, started the long drive out to a remote beach and ate the seeds on the drive over. It took about 10 minutes  to chew all of the seeds, and another 30 to reach my destination. I was expecting the onset to take about an hour (not even close). <br><br>
Once at the beach I waited two hours to feel the effects. I was checking my pupil dilation regularly, but my eyes looked normal. At about that time, I noticed that the street lights in the distance looked brighter than before, but I assumed that it was because the fog had lighted up, but these were the first effects. I was convinced that the Morning Glory just wasnt going to work, so I headed back home. About 20 minutes into the drive home everything started smelling funny, and not in a good way, everything stunk horribly. I rolled the windows down to get rid of the smell, but it didnt go away. I thought nothing of it.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> <br><br>
Roughly 5 minutes from home, an intense rush of energy flows through both of my arms and a huge uncontrollable grin sweeps across my face. Then the giggles started (keep in mind Im driving). I couldnt stop laughing, I felt great, pure euphoria. The best part of it all, I didnt loose any motor skills until I made it home safely. Once home I decided that I should do something fun, but it was late and everyone was asleep. Then it hit me, masturbation. Masturbation is always more fun high or drunk, so I decided to give it a try. This was an unforgettable experience. It took 2 hours to reach climax and it was the best climax of my life.<br><br>
Once through with all that mess, I decided to take a shower. This is when I peaked. For some reason I thought itd be cool to turn the lights off and make my way around the bathroom in pitch black pure darkness, so dark that I could not see my hand AT ALL from 1 inch away. Perception was strange, the shower seemed huge, tens of times larger than normal. The water felt great and it felt great to be clean. Upon leaving the shower I noticed my eyes in the mirror. My eyes were all pupils and they looked amazing. For the first time in my life I saw my self in the mirror and saw my own beauty. It was like seeing myself from someone elses eyes. Amazing.<br><br>
I went back to my room and laid down. The ceiling was breathing with me which was quite pleasant. The ceiling fan almost morphed into a full blown hallucination but then abruptly stopped and for a good reason. I was now very nauseous and had just become aware of it. I began to feel very, very sick. Every nerve ending in my body was tingling in pain and chilled ran up my spine. I felt as if I could control the nausea with my mind, which was actually true for a good while. I began to sweat and it felt as if poison was seeping out of every pore in my skin. This was pretty rough, but I was able to keep the pain in perspective. I was able to see my own suffering as a temporary problem which would soon pass. After 2 hours of holding my stomach at bay I finally threw up. The worst part is that I didnt feel it coming, so I threw up on my bed and all over myself, very disgusting.<br><br>
By this time the pain was unbelievable, and thats when it hit me. The one important realization I made that night Pain is just another thing. It was that sentence repeated over and over in my head that got me through all of this. Then the fever set in, turns out I was catching a pretty nasty cold too, and this actually lasted for 5 days. I managed to crawl to the bathroom covered in filth. I turned the shower on and laid down under the falling water. I laid there and let the shower clean me off. I could barely move at this point. I was now shaking uncontrollably and running a very high fever.<br><br>
I laid in the shower for almost an hour and forced myself up when the hot water ran out. By this time things had settled down and I mustered up the energy to clean up my mess and wrap myself in a blanket on the couch. <br><br>
I think most people would consider this a bad trip, but I learned something from it and I never let my mind go. Even the profound pain was positive experience while it was happening. It was all at once the most fun, interesting, and painful night of my entire life.simply amazing. You only live once and Im glad that I have that night to remember.<!-- End Body -->
