Well lets see, being sent to Africa was a trip in its self but me being the addict I am I saw a crucial downside. How was I going to get high? I lasted about five months without getting lit till one night I jumped in a cab in downtown Djibouti (the country between Ethiopia and Somalia), I noticed the cab driver had cheek packed full of some green stuff. Me being the friendly person I am, I quickly broke the language barrier and asked him if I could have some. I put about 6 leaves in my mouth and started to chew them. They tasted like green beans and were difficult to chew but I had to see what the hype was all about.<br><br>
About a half-hour into my cab ride I still felt nothing, I asked if I could have some more, and amazingly again he gave me a generous amount. I thought to myself wow this guy must be high I stuck about 4 more leaves in my mouth and chewed them vigorously, and gave my friend the rest. <br><br>
Upon arriving home I went to get out of the cab but I couldnt stop laughing, I thought it was so funny I had green drool on my pants, after my friend Ed collected me from the cab, we slowly walked to a nearby bar called the Mantina. While inside I remember seeing an array of color and I couldnt help but think peoples voices sounded weird, soon after our arrival Lizzy (my friend who was also high) and I decided to go for a quick walk around our neighborhood. I sat down on a bench to smoke a cig and all of the sudden there was a dinosaur sitting not even ten yards away, this wasnt such a bad thing at the time, in fact we found it to be hilarious. <br><br>
My body started to feel light and relaxed, it felt like I had just had a deep tissue massage. The body high from khat was amazing. No matter what I was doing it felt great, even when I was doing nothing at all.<br><br>
A lot of the night is a blur but I remember hearing music and asking Lizzy who was throwing a rave in Africa? The music would change beats and volume and surprisingly none of this was scaring the two of us. We had a blast it was like the best shroom trip mixed with line or two of coke. Honestly I would definitely recommend this drug to people who want to do a hallucinogen but are scared of a bad trip. To this day I have done it about 5 times and have never had a bad experience. Have fun. Play hard. Enjoy.<!-- End Body -->
