The last time I took LSD (which was about 3 years ago), I took a 'token' mushroom cap I had been saving, crushed it up and smoked it for symbolic purposes. It was a gesture. I thought it would simply do nothing. Although I wasn't fully 'up' on the LSD, the smoked shroom kicked in in about 3 minutes and *rocked* me. There were all kinds of silken mists swirling about my head and face, I was very disoriented, and I was sure that the radio was speaking to me in tounges. Very bizarre perceptual shift - I had spent most of the morning painting and happily meditating. This was off into Toon Town. It actually freaked me out quite a bit. It passed in about 10 minutes, leaving me still buzzing on LSD, but confused as to what had actually happened.<!-- End Body -->
