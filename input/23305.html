I started taking tramadol about a year ago. Snitching then from my step-father. Prior to my pill pop'en days all I had tried was pot, but I had been smoking just about every night for a year and a half so I was at the point where if I really wanted to get messed up, I'd have to try something else. I don't remember exactly why I started taking them, but god where they fantastic.<br><br>
At first I tried one, which didn't do much. Then two, which produced a small buzz; finally I tried four. (which was only the 4th or so time I had taken them) I remember about half an hour in I was starting to feel a little annoyed as not much was happening. Another thirty minutes goes by and I'm starting to feel better. It takes about two, to two and a half hours to start feeling the full affects, and an additional six to seven hours until its over. Even then I can still feel them, but not much unless I relax.<br><br>
The feeling is great. Very dreamy and relaxed. I remember just laying in my bed feeling numb for several hours, but when I had to, conversing with people wasn't a problem. Every hour or so I would set my alarm clock to go off in about an hour because tramabol has a tendency to put me to sleep for an hour or so at a time. I can't really compare it to anything else, as I think I have a naturally high tolerance to codeine, and thus, most other pain killers.<br><br>
 I started taking them about once a month, then a few more times a month, and every once in a while, every couple of days. I felt as if I took them any more than every three days, the high was severely reduced. It wasn't an addiction, Tramadol is a very non-addictive drug, it was just me over indulging myself. This continued for seven or eight months, but soon it would catch up to me. <br><br>
At this point I had started taking five fifty mg trams. One day I went to school after a fairly regular night of smoking pot and eating trams. I drove to school just like any other morning feeling fine, and continued to go about my day until about 11:00 am when my stomach started to hurt. I didn't think much about it at first but by 11:30 it really started to hurt. In about fifteen minutes I left school and headed toward work. (I'm in a program at school where we leave early to go to work) Work is about twenty minutes away and by the time I got there I was feeling pretty horrible, but decided I'd try to stick around an wait it out.<br><br>
I stayed for another fifteen minutes before I had to leave, the pain was really getting to me. After another fifteen minute trip I was at home, and I could barley make it through the door. I had an excruciating head ache, my stomach was turning in place, and my lower back ached so bad I couldn't stand up straight. This lasted for four days. Four days of pain, projectile vomiting and explosive diarrhea. It was really hell.<br><br>
I'm still taking tramadol from time to time, but allot less frequently. Usually about twice a month. And from time to time they still get me sick, but not nearly as much, and usually only when I over do it.<!-- End Body -->
