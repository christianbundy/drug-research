After reading various accounts of BZP + TFMPP (combo/frenzy/ice diamonds etc), and having done my own experimenting with both individually and various combinations (and currently T+2:30 into the above dosage), I feel I can offer something new here to people who are interested in trying or re-visiting this. Many have concluded through their experience that the negative aspects of the comedown make BZP not worth it. However, these negative aspects can be greatly reduced.<br><br>
Hype: Firstly, BZP is often marketed as an MDMA substitute. In my opinion, BZP is no more a substitute for ecstasy than a blueberry muffin is for LSD. However, its definitely not without its merit, and personally I find if I follow my own set of tips and tricks I can have a consistently great buzz every time.<br><br>
Acceptable? Im lucky enough to live in New Zealand, so its legal which eliminates the acquisition and procession paranoia that you might experience otherwise. NZ has a comparatively lax controlled substances list, but youll get really busted up for something thats on it. BZP will dilate your pupils, although with TFMPP mixed in it does not seem to nearly as much. <br><br>
Combo? Taking a combination of BZP and TFMPP is much better. In my experience BZP on its own is way more edgy and chemically feeling with a more torturously slow burn off of euphoric effects. Having the TFMPP mixed in makes the experience more trippy, have greater feelings of wellbeing and empathy, a bit speedier and generally friendlier'.<br><br>
When? I like taking it in the middle of the day on a Saturday for the following reasons: I dont have to be at work, I might be socialising/relaxing/listening to music (all of which are enhanced and more stimulating than usual), and Im not expecting it to provide me some unforgettable night out dancing with unlimited energy (because I know its not going to). I found taking after eating caused mild nausea and reduced effect, so I have it instead of lunch.<br><br>
Why? In line with other accounts, I experience a little bit of trippyness, quite a bit of euphoria, a fair amount of mood elevation and a mild increase in feelings of empathy. I also experience increased vigilance and concentration on any task at hand. I dont drink alcohol with it. I find I can drink an unlimited amount but it just makes me feel like utter crap. I also drink plenty of water  its diuretic. My mouth is too dry for gum.<br><br>
Afterwards? The manufacturer of the Party Pill containing the chemicals in the above doses include a couple of comedown pills containing 50mg of 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan). I was initially sceptical as to whether this would actually help, but it really does. 5-HTP is a serotonin precursor that can increase a cells output of serotonin. Most reading this will know that a small percentage of the serotonin in a human body resides as a brain amide helping process mood, decision making and sleep patterns (amongst other things). Basically, when I take BZP without taking anything to recover I feel like crap and have a really bad headache for 24 hours afterwards. When I take the BZP + TFMPP combination and take the 50mg of 5-HTP at T+8hours I can get to sleep fine, feel much better the next day and do not get any headache.<br><br>
So, if I judge it on its own merits, dont combine with alcohol, drink plenty of water and take 5-HTP when I'm done, I find this stuff provides a nice physical buzz thats definitely worth doing occasionally.<!-- End Body -->
