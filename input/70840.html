I have recently experimented with Modafinil to enhance my ability to study for longer periods. Although I love the effects that it has, I am extremely concerned upon the long-term impact it could have on my health. There have been several occasions that it produces strong palpitations in my heart, causing irregular heart beats, a throbbing pulse, and an unnatural awareness of my heart beat. On one occasion, I have found that my heart beat, felt through my chest, was moving at a much rapid pace than my pulse! <br><br>
Sometimes, when I am trying to sleep (which could be up to 20 hours after taking the dose), the pulse in my neck or on the side of my head begins bounding. I have read on many occasions that it could be linked to Tachycardia, or high blood pressure. I am extremely concerned that the changes I am noticing in my heart could trigger problems later in life, or that they will not stop once I cease taking this drug. Despite these concerns, I find that I am unwilling to stop modafinil because of the benefits it brings to me. I wonder if other people have had these experiences.<!-- End Body -->
