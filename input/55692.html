First off, I want to say that Kratom is a miracle plant. <br><br>
I have been using kratom very regularly for nearly two years now.  Sometimes I use Kratom every day.<br><br>
I have experimented by taking 20 grams crushed leaf EVERY DAY for one month and then quit abruptly.  I stayed off the Kratom for one week and found that I had NO physical withdrawal symptoms.<br><br>
I did have an urge to take Kratom though.  The reason for this, I believe, is due to its medicinal qualities, not any addictive properties.<br><br>
I have suffered with a medium level of depression my whole adult life.  Kratom has cured me of my depression and I therefore do not want to discontinue taking my medicine.  <br><br>
Here is a list of the great things that Kratom has done for me:<br><br>
1)	Kratom makes me more social and thus reduces my use of alcohol to make me more comfortable in social situations.<br><br>
2)	Kratom eliminates my depression.  I only take one dose in the evening and the elimination of my depression lasts 24 hours.<br><br>
3)	I often suffer from very annoying allergies (hay fever) and Kratom completely eliminates my hay fever.  It works much, much better than OTC antihistamines.<br><br>
4)	Kratom gives me physical energy which often comes in very handy as I am a musician and often have to stay out late and lug around lots of equipment.<br><br>
The only negative side effect that I have found is that I very occasionally get nausea when I eat while under the influence of Kratom.  On the off chance that I do vomit, this act immediately makes me feel 100% better (It is not like alcohol where I keep puking until I dry heave and I still feel sick)<!-- End Body -->
