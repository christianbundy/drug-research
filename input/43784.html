The day started normal. I rolled out of bed and popped my SSRI(10MG's of Lexapro). I took this medicine for one reason, that my drug of choice, DXM had nearly a reverse reaction while on it. <br><br>
But soon I found myself wanting to take it even with this in mind, I went up to the store and stole a 4oz Bottle of Maximum Strength Cough(CVS generic to robotussin which contains 360mg DXM). I also stole a 100 bottle of benadryl as well as a bottle of Robotussin Cough gels. <br><br>
My location: a strip mall located inside of a residential area. I downed the bottle of cough syrup as well as 3 cough gels(405mg's DXM). I waited about a half hour and took 300mg of benadryl. After about an hour I decided to smoke some weed. I went behind the parking structure and blazed a couple bowls. It is about 12:00pm on a sunny day. About half way through the second bowl I suddenly lost complete muscle control and dropped my beautiful glass bowl on the ground, and I too fell to the ground. I was not really feeling the DXM but the benadryl and weed were there.<br><br>
I started walking, scared as could be. Suddenly it happened, time and time again. In the middle of walking I would just feel totally weak and fall over; brief periods of complete loss of muscle control. Finally I just curled up in a ball and kept falling over. Then I completely lost control. I could not move. Let me state I was not very high. I was just sprawled out, motionless, helpless. A few minutes went by like this when my body suddenly began spazzming. About two hours went by like this, I could not move although I would have a siezure every few minutes. <br><br>
I have since tried many drugs while on my SSRI, and let me tell you bad things ALWAYS HAPPEN. I drank a fifth of vodka and had alcohol poisening for over 3 days. I took 4 barbituates and was totally uncordinated for 2 days, yet never felt high or relaxed.<!-- End Body -->
