 "report": "<p>I've been smoking bud for about 3 or 4 years now. Within the last year, Ive been smoking pretty much daily. I also love to trip. Besides bud, I've done mushrooms, acid, DXM, ecstasy, speed, tranqs, pain killers, nitrous, LSA, salvia, and plenty of prescription pills. So it's safe to say Im something of a vet with these sort of things. Whenever I smoke pot, however, I get this kind of vision that my friends and I have dubbed 'pixel vision'. It's kind of like what I see when I look extremely close to a television screen, but on everything. Everything has pixels like walls (especially white), ceilings, floors, everything. I love it. When I do other drugs with bud, it magnifies the pixels. </p><p>Somewhere over a year ago, I began to notice that I didn't need pot to see these pixels anymore. I can see them on most things even when Im not stoned. I have permanent pixel vision and I think it's one of the funnest things ever. It doesn't distract or harm me in any way, except when Im bored I can look at a wall or carpet design and it looks like it would when Im stoned. Smoking pot makes it more prominent, but Ive noticed that if I've smoked pot the night before (which is most of the time), the pixel vision the next day is more prominent than if I hadn't.</p><p>Is this because of all of the drugs Ive taken over the last 4 years? Maybe. I'd mostly attribute this to pot, though. Have I permanently fried my vision? Not necessarily. I still have better eye sight than a lot of my non-drug friends (I can read farther away signs and stuff). But there's definitely something not normal about my vision.</p><p>The main reason Im writing this is because Ive never come across anyone else with this. Even my drug buddies don't really know what Im talkin about. The only reason they understand is because they see it when they're stoned, but not sober like me. So, if anyone else has this condition, youre not alone. I say enjoy it!</p><p>Just be safe and happy trails!</p><p>p.s. For anyone wondering, my short term memory is pretty much shot. But i think that's funny... :)</p>"
