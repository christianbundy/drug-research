I have suffered with insomnia off and on for years.<br><br>
I was given a 5 mg Ambien to try- to see if I liked it in order to ask my doctor for a prescription.<br><br>
I took one pill at approx. 10 pm.<br><br>
At 10:30, things in the bedroom started to look funny.<br>
Every surface that had a straight line (such as a piece of paper, the tv, a table) was starting to move. It was as if the lines were moving, very hard to describe.<br><br>
Inanimate objects were suddenly shifting and moving. <br><br>
The visual disturbances were so extreme that I would have been a danger to others and myself if I was alone or if I had gotten up.<br><br>
I did not feel sleepy or tired at all, just very weird.<br><br>
I don't drink very much and I have never done any recreational drugs so this was a scary event.<br><br>
I would not recommend it to anyone, especially if you are alone.<br><br>
I did go right to sleep as soon as I closed my eyes.<!-- End Body -->
