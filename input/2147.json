Gibson'\r\nTo: Multiple recipients of list SCODAE \r\nSubject: Poppy Seed Info Needed....\r\nHello Everyone,\r\nI'm new to this LISTSERV, but I have an extremely urgent request that perhaps only YOU in the Internet community can help with now....\r\nMy wife recently moved to Arizona to start her 'Dream Job' (offered in July) and was given the standard pre-employment physical at a local hospital.  She was given no warnings of what NOT to eat, and I believe was not even asked what she had recently eaten.  She ate two poppy seed muffins that morning and registered a positive morphine level on their drug test that afternoon.  She was fired because she was a 'drug abuser'.\r\nThere are a few other circumstances that seem to have complicated this situation.  We've found out that the NIDA suggested limit is 300; she scored about 1,000 and we are trying to figure out 'why'.  The nurse said she was extremely dehydrated (after working in 100-degree temperatures) and that her keytones (?) were high (she had eaten very little the last few days).  She is also vegetarian.  We've heard that these other factors may have been the reason for her score, but we have no solid medical research to back this up....\r\nDoes anyone out there know of any research or other cases that can help us prove the truth?  Is there another LISTSERV with someone who could provide this information?  Are there any experts out there we could talk to?  Any suggestions you have would be appreciated!\r\nWe are trying to get the actual lab results (and will ask for a re-test of\r\nthe same samples), but the hospital has been very slow in giving us a\r\ncopy.  She also had a surprise test which proved clear, but they discounted\r\nthese results because a 'drug-abuser would have expected a second test'.\r\nWe are now trying to prove the truth so my wife can keep her Nursing\r\nlicense and her livelihood.  Previous to this test, we thought these drug\r\ntests were a good idea; as you can imagine, this experience has shaken that\r\nbelief somewhat.  In fact, it has almost devastated our lives.  Not only\r\ndid we move all our belongings there (at our own expense), established a\r\nresidence, etc., but the hospital reported her to the State Nursing Board\r\nand nobody will hire her now that she has this 'record'.  After 20 years of\r\nexperience and higher education (with absolutely NO drug abuse), she gets\r\nthis for eating two supermarket muffins for breakfast.  The scary thig is\r\nthat this could happen to anyone....\r\nThanks VERY MUCH in advance for all your help!\r\n****************************************\r\nJohn J.

Gibson' \r\nSubject: Poppy Seed Update #1\r\nSender: Drug Abuse Education Information and Research \r\nHello Everyone,\r\nI'm the source of last week's poppy seed disaster story - and I'm\r\nfinally back for the long haul.  Being somewhat concerned that our\r\nsituation might be viewed as cluttering up your LISTSERV discussions, I was\r\nhappily surprised to see your many wonderful responses from the last week\r\nor so.  Thank you very much for all your help and the offers of continuing\r\ninterest and support.  As a number of you have said, this situation is an\r\neducation for all of us - and an opportunity to somehow prevent others from\r\nencountering a similar fate.  I can assure you that we are committed to\r\nseeing this thing through, not only to clear Laurie's name, but to change\r\nthe laws or at least to educate everyone as best we can.  This is my first\r\nupdate of what we've found out so far, in case it can be helpful to anyone\r\nelse.  If this isn't appropriate for the whole LIST, please let me know and\r\nI will mail these updates only to those who express an interest....\r\nFirst, my apologies for the delay at getting back to all of you, but\r\nLaurie's sister got married this past weekend and we were back East to\r\nattend the wedding, make plans, etc.  She is holding up pretty well, but\r\nyou can tell she still feels quite devastated by the entire unbelievable\r\nsituation.  Laurie wanted me to thank you and she is following up on\r\nmuch of the information and suggestions that you've sent me so far.  She\r\ndoesn't have an Internet connection, but we are working on getting her one\r\nso she can listen in and reply to you directly.  The latest situation is\r\nthis, as best as we can understand it:\r\nThe hospital that 'fired' her because of this one test result is a private\r\nbusiness; the lawyers tell us that there is not much we can do through the\r\ncourts because, as a private concern, the hospital can do what they want as\r\nlong as they don't discriminate on the basis of sex, race, religion, etc.\r\nIf it was a public institution, she would have different rights.  That's\r\nlesson number one for anyone looking for employment or anyone in Congress\r\nwho really wants to make a difference.  As an aside, we were pretty\r\ndiscouraged at first because almost every major law firm in the city seemed\r\nto be on retainer for this place; they quickly stated a 'conflict of\r\ninterest' to our inquiries and nervously hung up.  It made us feel pretty\r\nsmall and helpless....\r\nThe State Nursing Board is public, and so far they have returned some phone\r\ncalls, but have not given us much information about how long it will take\r\nfor them to give Laurie a chance to state her case (and the TRUTH).  So the\r\nlawyer has dispatched a letter to hasten this process, since nobody will\r\nhire her while she is being 'investigated'.  Meanwhile, we are hoping that\r\nthe hospital will give us the full lab test results, since they may help\r\nshow the truth; the hospital only reported the morphine levels to the\r\nNursing Board, not the other data needed to put them in perspective.  We\r\nwould like to get Laurie's specimens sent to a lab whose analysis\r\ncarries some weight, if we can just get them to talk to us (its now been\r\nalmost three weeks).  DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW OF A LAB WHICH HAS AN\r\nUNDISPUTED REPUTATION IN DRUG TESTING ANALYSIS AND ALSO HAS AN EXPERTISE IN\r\nDIFFERENTIATING POPPY SEEDS FROM REAL MORPHINE ABUSE???  That would be a\r\nperfect solution to this mess, if such a thing exists....\r\nA number of you have suggested the ACLU, the press, etc.  We are developing\r\na letter to the ACLU (they must be overwhelmed since we always get the\r\nanswering machine and they haven't return our calls).  Whatever happens\r\nwith the legal system, we may eventually talk to anyone in the press\r\nwho will listen; people have to be educated about the dangers of drug\r\ntesting, especially if the government is unwilling to help protect innocent\r\npeople.  We are gathering suggestions here, but we are not going to push it\r\nuntil we've done our best to gather the facts and the support of any\r\nexperts who will help out.\r\nOne Nursing Association has asked Laurie for her suggestions of what the\r\nproper drug testing procedure should be.  Its a start; any professional\r\norganization willing to listen (and perhaps eventually lend their support)\r\nis very welcome indeed!  ANY SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE ON PROPER PROCEDURES?\r\nLaurie has confirmed that the hospital did NOT warn her of the foods not to\r\ntake (in advance of the test) and they did NOT even ask her what foods she\r\nhad taken the past 48 hours (when she took the test).  Many organizations\r\nseem to do this as standard procedure.  A number of doctors have said the\r\nrecommended procedure on a positive morphine reading is to confirm the\r\nfindings only after a positive check for needle marks, eye color, etc.; the\r\nhospital didn't do that either.  What can one person do when an\r\norganization uses these drug tests as THE ONLY proof, and doesn't follow\r\nall the other recommended procedures?  I guess you take your lumps like\r\nLaurie and so many others have.  (Lesson numer two for those seeking\r\nemployment).\r\nA number of you have also asked if they did a GC/MS test once the EMIT gave\r\na positive reading, and you've asked what procedures were used.  We have no\r\nidea since nobody's talking at the hospital; we can't even find out which\r\nlabs did the testing.  Its tough to prove the truth when the data is\r\nunavailable....  (Lesson number three for anyone who has the power to\r\nchange the current status-quo).\r\nYes, the DOD did raise their morphine limit to 4000 from the suggested NIDA\r\nlevels because of their research on poppy seeds (that was published).\r\nLaurie just talked to them and they've brought it down to 300 again\r\n(we don't know exactly why; they may think they are missing some legitimate\r\ndrug abusers).  Someone at the DOT said that they don't even ask questions\r\nuntil you hit 2,000 (has this changed?).  They said something like 'we\r\ndon't want to catch bagel-eaters; we want to catch drug abusers'.  If this\r\nis true, it appears we may have working pilots with readings near 2,000\r\nwhile other people have lost their jobs over limits far below that level.\r\nThis is NOT a complaint, just an observation.  But if this is true, the DOT\r\nshould be commended for a much more intelligent approach to drug testing\r\nthan other offices in the same federal government.  CAN ANYONE DIRECT ME TO\r\nINFORMATION ON JUST HOW NIDA ARRIVED AT ITS LEVEL OF 300 AS A LEGITIMATE\r\nINDICATOR OF MORPHINE DRUG ABUSE???  We've also learned that American poppy\r\nseeds are much LESS potent that pacific-variety poppy seeds.  You\r\nguessed it - the stores have confirmed that Laurie's muffins had poppy\r\nseeds from Australia.  Did these contain much higher levels of opiates than\r\nthe variety that NIDA used to arrive at their levels?  We don't know.  CAN\r\nANYONE AT NIDA HELP US OUT ON THIS?\r\nWe've learned that several legislators may be pursuing a solution to these\r\nproblems.  Dingle from Michigan has done something, but his office doesn't\r\nreturn Laurie's phone calls.  We've just found out that Hatch from Utah and\r\nBoren from Oklahoma are working on something, but we don't know exactly\r\nwhat.  A state legislator from Arizona actually personally called Laurie\r\nand wanted all the facts we could give them.  We were really impressed by\r\nthat.  It is another reason why we are honestly trying to pursue the REAL\r\ntruth and find all the facts we can BEFORE we go public.  We are not\r\ninterested in being trouble-makers; we just want all people to be treated\r\nfairly.  So we'll take any suggestions, off-the-record, from anyone who\r\nfeels in any kind of danger helping us out.\r\nFinally, we don't really know yet, because we lack so many 'facts', WHAT or\r\nWHO is responsible for Laurie's misfortune.  It could be the Feds, the\r\nState of Arizona, the Board of Nursing, the hospital, their insurance\r\ncompany, their employee health doctor, the Director of Nursing, the human\r\nresources department, all of them, and/or all of us.  Its interesting\r\nthat the doctor refused to acknowledge that poppy seeds could have ANY\r\neffect until Laurie gave him some articles.  But that 300 is an absolute to\r\nhim; that's as much as he will consider, no matter what.  His mind is like\r\na brick wall.  The Director of Nursing has recently been devastated by a\r\nclose friend and associate whose life suffered greatly because of her\r\nhidden drug abuse; in the Director's eyes, that 300 is also quite\r\nabsolute - Laurie may always be guilty no matter what we finally prove to\r\nbe true (God himself would have trouble convincing her).\r\nYou would also think a nurse would know about the foods which give positive\r\ndrug readings, and I was very surprised Laurie did NOT know.  We've since\r\nfound (unofficially, by an informal poll) that MOST nurses don't know.\r\nLaurie specializes in critical care, and has seen her share of overdoses,\r\nbut never one from poppy seeds.  And I would wager that is true for an even\r\ngreater percent of the general population.  We do watch some news and read\r\nthe paper, but we can't remember ever coming across a similar story.\r\nNeither one of us has ever taken a drug test in our lives and never gave\r\nthis one a second thought because we've been 'good'.  Now we feel like the\r\ninnocent people who are given these tests are like cattle being led to\r\nslaughter - without intelligent laws, reasonable guidelines, or some type\r\nof education, improper (or misinterpreted) procedures have the potential of\r\nruining lives everywhere.  But you folks already know that; I've learned\r\nfrom your email that you've been at this awhile.  I hope that one or two\r\nitems from this looonnggg note might be helpful to someone and/or the whole\r\nfield of study.  I promise a much shorter note next time....\r\nBest wishes,\r\nJohn\r\n****************************************\r\nJohn J. Gibson\r\nDirector of Computing\r\nDean's Office\r\nCollege of Business Administration\r\nUniversity of Northern Colorado\r\nGreeley, CO 80639\r\nInternet: jgibson@asu.edu\r\n****************************************\r\n=========================================================================\r\nDate: Dec 1993\r\nFrom: 'John J. Gibson' \r\nSubject: Poppy Seed Update #2\r\nSender: Drug Abuse Education Information and Research \r\nHello Everyone,\r\nMany of you asked us to keep you informed after the 'poppy seed\r\ndisaster story' several months ago; its time for the next\r\ninstallment, and we have finally have some good news to report.  In\r\na nutshell, an incredible series of events has culminated in the\r\nState Nursing Board COMPLETELY dismissing the charges on Laura's\r\nrecord.  They have acknowledged that there was absolutely no proof\r\nthat she was a morphine abuser and that the test readings were\r\nindeed possibly due to those poppy seed muffins bought at the local\r\nsupermarket....\r\nWe would like to thank all of you again for the many leads,\r\narticles, referrals, suggestions, good wishes, opinions, etc.  The\r\nInternet community came through, and your feedback helped more than\r\nyou can know.  Laura now has a huge stack of research and other\r\ninformation which most definitely helped to speed her case, and may\r\nsomeday help to advance appropriate legislation, educate the\r\npublic, and/or save someone else in a similar career-threatening\r\nsituation.\r\nIn case any of you run across a similar situation again, Laura's\r\nexperiences may prove helpful (and from what we've heard, she might\r\nbe one of the lucky ones).  In the end, it was an interview with a\r\npsychiatrist that eventually helped to break the case; as you will\r\nsee, it was necessary for Laura to carefully check several of these\r\ndoctors - a good one was not so easily found.  The Board had told\r\nLaura that it would be 6 to 8 months before they would get to her\r\ncase, due to the massive backlog of other cases.  They also\r\nmentioned that they could require a 'psychological assessment' when\r\nthey finally considered her story.  However, after hearing this\r\nstory over the phone, a doctor at the recommended hospital insisted\r\non enrolling Laura in a $4,500 program (three days long) and made\r\na number of disturbing statements like 'you'd better not lie or I\r\nwill have to punish you.'  Thinking that this might be the only\r\ntype of recourse to get her license back, Laura was devastated by\r\nthe conversation; she was obviously already being considered by the\r\nmedical community as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  A neighbor\r\nsuggested that she call other psychiatrists, and she eventually\r\nscheduled an interview and random drug testing with one whom (she\r\nlater found out) just happened to have a good reputation with the\r\nBoard.  She really knew very little about this psychiatrist (there\r\nwere no referrals); but he recognized the truth and called the\r\nBoard after the initial session.  The Board immediately made\r\nLaura's case a high priority and an investigator met her two days\r\nlater; Laura's stack of research and contacts was by that time\r\ncomplete enough to help establish her innocence, and the rest is\r\nhistory....\r\nThere are many other interesting side-stories to this case.  For\r\nexample, the Board had also called a toxicologist whom they\r\nfrequently used on such cases, and he just happened to have\r\nattended a meeting where a number of these toxicologists\r\nexperimented on themselves by eating poppy seed bagels; most of the\r\ngroup then tested over the 2,000 level for morphine (remember that\r\nLaura's reported level was 1,017).  Also, after much prodding, the\r\nhospital finally gave Laura the results of the EMIT (which shows\r\nonly an approximate positive/negative reading).  They said they had\r\nto order the GC/MS report from the lab again because they 'only had\r\na phone report.'  After much more prodding, we finally got a copy\r\nof this report in mid-November; it turns out that the 1017 level\r\nreported to State Boards was not accurate, since this second report\r\nwas over 1,400.  We still wonder if this second test was really\r\ndone in August or if it was really completed more recently to\r\nsatisfy our requests.  In the final analysis, however, this didn't\r\nmatter.  Experts all over the country confirmed that levels over\r\n1,000 could come from poppy seeds alone, especially Australian and\r\nseveral other varieties (it is interesting to note here that the\r\nsupermarket acknowledged these particular poppy seeds came from\r\nAustralia; we've also learned that these potent seeds may have\r\noriginally been genetically bred for morphine production).  The\r\nhospital also refuses to give us the history of handling, and they\r\nhad not recorded any of the data taken on Laura's level of\r\ndehydration at the time of the test.\r\nNext, as far as we can tell, the hospital's Occupational Health\r\ndoctor (whose analysis everyone respected) did not follow official\r\nfederal government guidelines when considering the test data.  In\r\nfact, the AMA, ASAM, and AAMRO all recommend following these\r\nguidelines, but private organizations are NOT required to do so.\r\nThis doctor did not try to find out if Laura's 1,000+ level was\r\npossible from poppy seeds; the 300 level used by the EMIT was all\r\nthat mattered to him - IT was the final word.  Official guidelines\r\nsay that the initial test results should be recognized as just one\r\nindicator in many, that one must consider the whole picture: a\r\nphysical, second lab tests, and other clinical signs of abuse\r\nshould also be used in the analysis.  We're not even sure if this\r\ndoctor had the education to know what guidelines exist to make\r\n'accurate' judgements.  We just know that his abrupt judgement in\r\nthis case caused the loss of a job and almost destroyed an entire\r\ncareer.  And we are told that private institutions, such as this\r\nhospital, can continue to do these tests in whatever manner they\r\nplease; there are no laws to protect the innocent in drug testing.\r\nMore on guidelines: The Reagan Administration first required that\r\nfederal agencies establish drug detection programs - and that they\r\nfollow federal guidelines on the analysis of the results.  The\r\nadministration also suggested that private organizations establish\r\nsimilar programs because of potential losses due to drug abuse.\r\nUnfortunately, for some reason, these private organizations were\r\nNOT required to also follow the accompanying guidelines.  We've\r\nreceived a broad range of opinions on the pros and cons of drug\r\ntesting itself.  Whatever you believe, it seems obvious to us that\r\nif drug testing is going to be with us for a while, EVERY\r\norganization should be REQUIRED to follow some type of intelligent\r\nset of guidelines or regulations if they use drug testing\r\nprocedures.  In fact, urinalysis might better be utilized as\r\nconfirmation of a positive reading in 'impairment testing,' since\r\nurine drug tests do not necessarily reveal the level of a person's\r\nimpairment on the job, etc.  You may be interested in a recent\r\n'Viewpoint' guest editorial on impairment testing published in the\r\nNew York Times, Sunday, November 28, section F-11.  As an aside,\r\nwe've heard that many of the same organizations who have stiff drug\r\ntesting programs do not test for perhaps the largest abuse problem\r\nof all - alcohol; is this true?\r\nNow that Laura has her Nursing License back, a few of you are bound\r\nto ask 'what happened with the hospital?'  We called the hospital\r\nshortly after the Nursing Board's decision and found that the Board\r\nhad already informed them that Laura's record was cleared of all\r\ncharges.  When asked what they thought about this, the hospital\r\nreplied 'this just proves that the system works.'  Amazing.  There\r\ndoesn't seem to be any recognition of what this event has done to\r\nour lives and that it could easily have been prevented (one way the\r\nsystem SHOULD work).  In fact, the hospital also mentioned that\r\nthey feel they did most everything right.  Their view now is that\r\npoppy seeds may have indeed been the cause of Laura's positive test\r\nresults, but that nothing can really prove that morphine wasn't the\r\ntrue cause.  Laura will always be 'guilty until proven innocent' at\r\nthis hospital.  And what about her job?  Since early September,\r\nthey have advertised that position in the newspapers - and even on\r\nthe Internet.  However, it has recently been canceled as a cost-\r\nsaving measure.  After all the hospital's time and expense of\r\nnationally recruiting for this position over the past year, we\r\ncan't help but wonder if there is another story we don't yet know\r\nabout....\r\nThere is another side to this situation, and in all fairness to the\r\nhospital, they may be correct about inconclusive lab testing in\r\npoppy seed cases.  Unlike food combinations that cause positive\r\nresults on the EMIT (which can later be proven false by the GC/MS),\r\nthere is much disagreement about the ability of any test to show\r\nthe difference between eating poppy seeds and using morphine.  The\r\nBEST policy may be to just WARN people, well in advance, to steer\r\nclear of poppy seeds before drug testing.  We've heard that WalMart\r\ngives their people a list of substances to avoid before such drug\r\ntests are taken.  If only the hospital had done that too!  And as\r\nfar as we can tell, none of the other hospitals in the area do this\r\neither.  The hospital says a committee is now studying changing\r\ntheir policy to warn people about poppy seeds before testing.  They\r\nalso say they may require testing to be done before a job offer is\r\nextended and families move their entire household to town (as in\r\nour case).  Great idea, folks!  Its interesting to note that the\r\nhospital said it can't understand why this same misfortune happens\r\nto such a high percentage of out-of-state nurses.  Perhaps they are\r\nfinally seeing the light.  We wonder, however, if they really care\r\nenough to follow through with their plans - to do so would\r\ncertainly be a step in the right direction.\r\nMany people have encouraged us to initiate lawsuits against the\r\ndoctor, the hospital, the state, etc.  The logic goes something\r\nlike 'not only could a lawsuit reimburse you for damages, but it\r\ncould initiate changes in the law to protect others from the same\r\nfate.'  This sounds great to us and we would love to proceed.  It\r\nis easy to see the doctor/hospital rationale; the reason for suing\r\nthe state would be to encourage an early initial hearing (e.g. a\r\nfew days) for those who are forced to put their livelihoods 'on\r\nhold' while the Nursing Board sifts through 6 to 8 months of other\r\ncases (in Colorado, for example, you have that right if your\r\ndriver's license is suspended and you have to wait a long time\r\nbefore your case goes to court).  Unfortunately, we've discovered\r\na number of problems in proceeding with a lawsuit.  Laura has\r\ntalked to dozens of lawyers; most refuse to touch the case and the\r\nfew others recommend against it.  Many of the major law firms are\r\nalready on retainer for the hospital; that's conflict of interest.\r\nThe other firms say that it will be a long, slow, expensive,\r\npainful, and eventually fruitless process.  Since drug-testing\r\nsentiment is running high in Arizona (so close to the border),\r\nalmost any jury would agree with the view that 'the chance of\r\nlosing a few innocent people is much better for the public good\r\nthan the risk of hiring a drug abuser into the hospital\r\nenvironment.'  In the end, we would damage the cause and help prove\r\nthe hospital acted in the correct manner.  Again, 'this just proves\r\nthat the system works.'\r\nWe've also been told that its too risky a case for lawyers with\r\npolitical ambitions because it makes them extremely nervous to\r\nhandle a cause so contrary to public opinion.  This might also\r\nexplain why the drug testing bills before Congress (which would\r\ncorrect some of the loopholes) haven't been passed.  Furthermore,\r\nmost of the real damage can't be measured.  And the legal folks say\r\nthat Laura did too good a job of mitigating our damages for the\r\nthings that CAN be measured.  Since our financial losses will\r\nprobably 'only' be $15,000 or so, no competent lawyer would look at\r\nthis volatile case for such a 'small sum of money' (we couldn't\r\nafford to pay them anyway - that was all our savings and the down\r\npayment for a house).  Its been suggested that we find someone on\r\nthe national scene who is outraged by this situation, who has the\r\nfinancial resources to proceed, and who does not have political\r\nambitions.  As of yet, we have not found anyone like this with the\r\nappropriate expertise.  We've also tried a number of 'cause-based'\r\norganizations with no success; however, they do wish us luck.  The\r\nstate ACLU has not returned our calls (and is rumored to be almost\r\nbankrupt); the national ACLU told us to talk to the state.  So we\r\nwill probably send the state ACLU a report through the mail before\r\nwe finally give up on them.  IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS - OR NAMES -\r\nTHAT COULD HELP HERE, PLEASE LET US KNOW.  We still hope that\r\njustice will somehow be served - for everyone's sake.\r\nSo what's next, you say?  Laura is now writing a number of articles\r\nfor submission to journals in the hope that she can educate\r\nprofessionals that her situation IS indeed possible.  Once this\r\nresearch is completed, we may also try popular media like NPR, 60\r\nminutes, the Wall Street Journal, etc. hoping to educate the\r\nworking public that this could also happen to them.  Since private\r\norganizations aren't required to protect people from these types of\r\nerrors, people will probably have to look out for themselves.  If\r\nwe do take this approach, a lawyer friend has warned us to 'report\r\nonly the facts, not your opinions' and to use a quality program so\r\nwe don't get sued over the report.  Its a frustrating situation; we\r\ndon't have much left.  But our friend has also made another\r\nobservation - we were really lucky when you think about it.\r\nSomehow we were fortunate to connect with the right advice, sources\r\nof information, expertise, etc., and Laura was skilled (from her\r\nrecent Master's program) in doing the needed research.  We also had\r\na supportive network of friends whose spirit helped us to continue.\r\nAnd we are now somewhat free to seek a new dream.  Others may not\r\nbe so fortunate in a similar situation.  So the challenge remains\r\nto somehow correct the system....\r\nAnd that's about it for now.  We promised last time not to make\r\nthis next update too long, but we've done it again.  We hope it\r\nwill be valuable to someone out there.  Until the next update, we\r\nwill be trying to put our lives back together again - Laura is\r\nstill in Arizona but is looking nationwide for a job, John\r\n(fortunately) is still making a living in Colorado, and we will\r\nhave to see where we end up.  As promised, we aren't done yet; we\r\nwill share our story with almost anyone who will listen.  You'll\r\nhear from us again, if you would like to.  As always, if you have\r\nany other ideas or thoughts, please let us know; we would love to\r\nhear from you.  And thanks VERY MUCH again for everything!\r\nBest Wishes,\r\nJohn & Laura\r\n****************************************\r\nJohn J.
