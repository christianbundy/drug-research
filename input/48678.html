The other night, I decided to try out a Red Heart pill that I ordered from New Zealand. I wasnt sure what to expect, but the pamphlet said a safe alternative to extacy, so I went in to it hoping that I would have a great experience.<br><br>
Well, I certainly didnt expect as much as I received! My Mum and I took 1 pill each at 7.45 pm. The pills were slow to act; about 1 hour, as apposed to about half an hour for an E. The Red Heart also came on less dramatically. I didnt get a rush of the drug entering my system. Rather, it was a slow gradual increase in the intensity.<br><br>
About an hour after we took the pill, Mum suggested we have a few cones. It was Mums gear and I hadnt tried it before. So, I had a couple of cones and passed the bong on to Mum. I stepped back and looked at her and said wow, thats good pot Mum. It really good pot! Thats when Mum said are you sure its the pot, and not the pill? I realised at that point that these Red Hearts were really awesome!<br><br>
The sensations that I felt were similar to extacy, but a bit different. The Red Hearts seemed to connect me with my intuition and subconscious on an unbelievable level. Every moment was filled with life-changing realisations about life, and everything in between that you could ever imagine. I understood things so deeply, it was amazing! <br><br>
Time stood still. These Red Hearts had me pumping, I had limitless energy, motivation and interest in everything. I felt like I didnt have a single need for anything. Being thirsty wasnt unpleasant; my 3 inch heels didnt hurt my feet, even after wearing them for hours and hours. <br><br>
I felt loving and warm and comfortable within my self, my surroundings and in other people. I had to stop and remind myself that it wasnt extacy that I took, it was a red heart. As with extacy, I had an intensification of my senses, and WOW could I dance!!!<br><br>
My internal dialogue was (in hindsight) hilarious! If anyone knew what I was thinking, they would have thought I was so up myself. I had an intense feeling of purpose and ability. I became intensely interested in being the best person I could be; intelligent, attractive and an all round nice person. I realised that the character of Reece Witherspoon in Legally Blonde 1 and 2 was my idol. I wanted to be just like Eve! <br><br>
I had a dramatically heightened sense of appreciation in every sense of the word. In fact, a lot of things that I said started with I have a heightened sense of understanding other peoples needs or I have a heightened sense of acceptance or I have a heightened sense of self-awareness. Every perception was heightened, and I couldnt stop saying it!!!!<br><br>
And the best thing is that Mum was in the same frame of mind, and everything I said to her was so interesting, so we never had a dull moment. The worst thing was that I had to get up early because it was my sons 6th birthday the next morning, and I had to do the present thing and put on a little party. At 3.30 am, I was still pumped, and wanting to party. But, I just couldnt sleep (even when I thought I was sleeping, my thoughts didnt stop, so I dont know if I actually slept at all, or if it was a case of having intense thoughts during my sleep), I was majorly bummed out energy wise all day.<br><br>
On the subject of negative side effects: I had way less adverse reactions from the Red Hearts, except I still clenched my jaw terribly (although grinding wasnt a problem). I didnt have the emotional low that I have had after taking an E, and Im sure if I was able to sleep the next day, that I would have bounced back faster.<br><br>
Overall, I think that Red Hearts are definitely worth the money. For me, they are a suitable substitute for extacy. They are not exactly the same as extacy, but I feel that if my body copes better with the side effects of the red hearts, that the extra bit of edge you get from extacy isnt worth it, if I suffer so much more with the comedown.<br><br>
By the way, Ive already ordered more. NEW YEARS EVE here I come!!!!!<!-- End Body -->
