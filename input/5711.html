I'm writting this for two reasons 1) There's no tobacco experiences on here 2) I think that there are some misconceptions about smoking.<br><br>
The first time I tried smoking I was 15.  I had heard stories from parents and teachers about how if i tried smoking i would get sick, throw up and hate it.  I always figured this seemed reasonable, considering you're inhaling smoke and chemicals into your lungs. But one day I decided i had to see for myself. I stole a cigarette from my father who smokes about two packs a day.  <br><br>
One day when my parents were out I went outside and light up.  I took a few puffs in my mouth to ease into it.  Then I inhaled.  As i felt the smoke go down into my chest I thought all the warnings about how smoking would get me sick should have been heeded but i didnt get sick.  I inhaled again and felt the smoke creep into my lungs but it wasn't a bad feeling, so I smoked the rest of the cigarette.  Afterward I felt good.  Not high or anything, just a good mood.<br><br>
I have smoked many times since then but I remain unaddicted.  And I think thats the correct application of nicotine and tabacco products.  Use them in moderation when you want to relaxe or ease up and it can be a rewarding, relatively harmless experience.<br><br>
I hope this can help anyone who plans on trying smoking and would like to know what to expect.<!-- End Body -->
