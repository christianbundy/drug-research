 "report": "<p>This is my experience with the research chemical 25I-NBOMe. I did not know the exact dosage for each tab unfortunately, but between me and three others, we took 5 tabs total (1 1/4 tab each). </p><p>I had just played a show with my band and we ended up going to our bassists house to hang out. An old friend stopped by and handed me 7 blotters of the 25I-NBOMe. We had been drinking and decided to dose at around 1:30 AM. I know this was not the best idea, and do not condone this! Within minutes, all of our tongues were numb, and the taste of chemicals lingered. We each decided to drink water, which tasted pretty unpleasant. At about 20-30 minutes in, we all began to start feeling anxious, excited, and a tad paranoid, as none of us had tried this substance before. I started to notice a very slightly uneasy, frantic vibe from the group, as nausea started to set in. All of us were very talkative and my headspace started to increase. About 40 minutes after dosage, 3 of us started to vomit. It wasn't terrible and we all felt much better after. Very soon small visuals began to settle in and our group morale and excitement greatly improved.</p><p>By the time we started to realize we were feeling the onset of the drug, the group decided we wanted to walk about and be outside. It took what seemed like and hour, but was probably around 15 - 20 minutes to actually start walking because of our confusion. We were walking in and out of the house, looking for things we didn't need, and checking on things for no apparent reason. It was the first wave and a precursor to how the night would play out. Once we all were 'back to reality', we set out to our friends pumpkin patch. On the way here, visuals started to get very apparent, with a general theme of everything melting, meshing, and melding into each other, and a sense of everything being interconnected. I was feeling the plants we passed by and felt a very strong emotional connection and understanding of the individual plants. Each piece of nature had its own identity, yet, was all part of the same thing. My visuals flowed and it seemed that the whole group was feeling very good about this experience thus far. The emotions on my friends faces were priceless, as if they had seen God. I remember than commenting on the indescribable beauty of nature and the connection that we were all aware of.</p><p>We arrived at the pumpkin patch, all very ecstatic, euphoric, and feeling a great sense of empathy. We all were talking about what we saw and felt in a third person perspective. The visuals were very intense and the euphoria was incredible. I could literally sense and feel the life in the pumpkins and the patch was nearly glowing. Fluttering lights and sounds clouded my head. We all laid in the grass and looked at the sky. I closed my eyes and heard very loud auditory hallucinations, as well as intense close eye visual patterns.</p><p>We decided to walk back as we hit the bottom of a wave, a sort of brief break back to reality. We all tried to explain our experiences that happened while we still had the use of our words. About 3 hours passed by this time, give or take. As we got back there were a few moments that reminded me of my LSD trips I've had, as well as very shroomsy (questioning existence) moments. Everything that happened up to this point seemed to loop, as the same feeling would come up that we had had in the last cycle. This wasn't negative in anyway and the sense of familiarity was comforting, accept each cycle got more intense up until about the 4 hour mark.</p><p>We listened to music that we had been working on, and that's when I nearly cried. The connection that I had to my art was absolutely beautiful. Literally, more than words could describe. It was my brainchild with my musical friends, and I found that to be mind-blowingly euphoric. We were all screaming about how crazy and awesome it was to hear our own stuff, and again, I felt a true emotional connection with my music, and my bandmates. We literally felt, and were the music.</p><p>After this, the comedown started to kick in. The waves to less and less intense, and reality began to make more sense again. I did have a moment outside with a pot of flowers. I stared at it, speaking to it with my mind. The way the flower moved made it seem like it had a body language, and was responding to my thoughts. It was curious flower and I felt an extreme bond with it and all nature. I loved this flower as I would have loved a family member and it seemed to express love back to me. This feeling was unmatchable. I felt love and loved back from the universe and nature. I wanted a physical explanation or some sort of expression of love. I wanted a way to at least just give it a hug or something, but was under the impression that I didn't need to express it for the universe to feel my love and respect.</p><p>I decided to go home at about 7 hours and fell asleep 30 minutes after I got in bed. The past 2 days I've felt drained, but enlightened, less depressed, and more centered and empathetic. Overall, we all agreed it was a very positive experience. We all felt the one-ness with everything. The connections were very meaningful. I came out of this experience with a new perspective on life, love, nature, empathy, and the universe.</p>"
