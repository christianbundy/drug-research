My background:<br>
I'm a 45 y.o. who's had much experience with most drugs, etc.  I was a poly drug abuser as an 18-20 y.o. &amp; went through a 4 month drug rehab in 1977.  I then became a certified substance abuse counselor in 1988 &amp; was a counselor for 10 yrs... I wanted to give something back for my years of abuse, etc. <br><br>
I stopped using drugs in 1983 having had a 2 day/night spiritual experience... no need for details as GOD (Geometry Of your Divinity) makes these experiences unique for the individual &amp; quite unexplainable in human terms, etc.! I can say that I came into direct contact with GOD's love for us &amp; it is too powerfully amazing &amp; overwhelming, loving, &amp; compassionate to even try &amp; put into human terms.<br><br>
My quest for spiritual truth has been ongoing throughout my life.  I have beliefs in Western &amp; Eastern teachings/philosophies reincarnation, karma, twin flames, charkas, etc., etc.!  I have been speaking to GOD on a daily basis for the past (almost) 20 yrs I talk to GOD just as Im talking to a friend &amp; GOD has spoken back in so many amazing ways!  Ive had many, many spiritual experiences Ive experienced both good &amp; evil (energy veil).  But there is no force out there that is more omniscient, omnipotent, or omnipresent than GOD (our real Father/Mother).<br><br>
In the past 20 yrs. Ive smoked aprox. 10 joints of marijuana, along with a few beers/mixed drinks here &amp; there.  Im not much of a drinker.<br><br>
I came across some reference to Salvia on a message board &amp; started researching it.  I spent hours &amp; hours &amp; hours researching Salvia with no interest in mushrooms, DMT, MDMA, MDA, cocaine, marijuana, or other psychedelics, (done that, been there) etc.  For mine is a spiritual journey of introspection only &amp; I intuitively felt that all these other substances would not give me what I was looking for &amp; when I follow my intuition Im always right!  I have since spent many nights up until 4:30am researching Salvia.  I was very intrigued due to the spiritual introspection aspect of Salvia.  <br><br>
I purchased 3 grams each 1 gr. 10x extract (if Im going to do this, then Im going all the way with a 10xer) from a popular vendor &amp; 2 gr. 10x extract &amp; a pipe from another that claims theirs is organic. I will say that both are very powerful, but I think the organic (a darker green) is just a little stronger.<br><br>
My reason for using:  After all my research I felt I could come into direct contact with the Heartof our Father/Mother GOD &amp; commune directly with GOD!  My only purpose was in s<br><br>
piritual introspection, with no intent of using this divine substance to get high, etc.  Little did I know how divine this experience would be (all 7 to date)!  All 7 experiences were variations on the same theme but intensified with each subsequent one while still using the same dosage each time!<br><br>
My Experience:  I took 1 gram &amp; divided it into 14 sections &amp; then gel capped them.  I then took 1 gel cap &amp; dumped it out &amp; then divided it into 2 equal sections.  I prayed extensively to GOD as to why I was doing this &amp; called for protection, etc.  The room I used it in was my bedroom my bedroom is a very spiritual place for me I have an altar, many spiritual focuses Jesus, St. Germain, I Am Presence, Mother Mary, Sanat Kumara, Lady Master Venus, El Morya, Arch Angel Gabriel (and others), a huge amethyst stone, etc.  I was very comfortable &amp; felt safe.  Since I was doing this by myself I also prayed/called for safe protection in that I would not leave my office chair (because I was doing this by myself), etc. (which I never did in my 7 experiences to date).  I played mellow spiritual music with cordless headphones &amp; had the lights only slightly dimmed.  I put the dose of half a cap (1 fourteenth of a gram of 10x extract) into my pipe, lit it &amp; inhaled deeply &amp; held it for probably 30 seconds.  I was using a stopwatch &amp; at aprox. 20-25 seconds I could feel a melting into my chair feeling then nothingness for 7 to 8 minutes as Im coming into a conscious state of awareness I feel the presence of GOD I dont think its GOD; I know within all my being that it is GOD.  I feel &amp; see the room wrapping/rolling over upon itself as if this reality (as we know it) is going to disappear as a speck of dust and Im going to enter into the being of GOD but I kept pulling back saying not yet, not yet!  WOW exactly 10 minutes of an unparalleled experience nothing, nothing, nothing can compare!  After 10 minutes everything was fairly normal; no hang over, heavy head, etc. feeling, I felt fine, but boy did I have questions! <br><br>
One question I had was Why did it take until the end of the experience for me to become consciously aware?  Well, I thought that the next time I use Salvia I will tape record myself and thats where it all begins! <br><br>
2cnd through 7th experiences Well I used 1/14 (thats all, one fourteenth) of a gram each time &amp; the same bedroom scenario was the same, only on the 3rd time I did not use any music at all.  Each experience lasted exactly 10 min., and each time it felt as if I was becoming consciously aware at the 7-8 min. mark.  I could sense that I was almost touching the very being of GOD &amp; again I didnt want to go all the way because I didnt feel that I would come back to my body, that I would remain in the spiritual, etheric realm.  <br><br>
I then listened to the tape recording of my experience &amp; thats where I was hearing myself talking out loud to beings I couldnt remember seeing.  I was asking why was all this (the universe) created they were telling me that they were waiting for me and I would tell them that they couldnt start without me (start what? I dont know).  I felt like I was at the hem of the garment of GODs being &amp; that I was reaching up to touch the very being of GOD, but if I did I wouldnt be coming back to my physical body, but that I would remain there with GOD!<br><br>
Whew!  You talk about something like this and no one can understand unless theyve been there!  Well I can say this much the beauty, wonder, power &amp; most of all a warm, warm gentle, but so powerfully compassionate love that our creator has for us is AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME I was feeling like I was just ready to enter in to GODs heart when all of a sudden I became aware of my physical self &amp; was feeling bad because my loved ones wouldnt know what happened to me if they were to find my body dead in my chair, even though I knew I wouldnt be dead!  I felt that I needed to really think about what has happened to me through these experiences.  <br><br>
Ive had many, many spiritual experiences, but nothing this phenomenal, etc.  Since using Salvia I have had a new, conscious awareness of GOD as never before as Ive said earlier I had a very powerful spiritual experience in 1983 &amp; since then Ive developed an almost daily communion with GOD that has been very loving &amp; enlightening!<br><br>
There were many other statements, comments that I had made to my unknown/unseen friends-brothers/sisters (that is what they seemed like) while under the influence of Salvia.  My 1st use of the Salvia was on July 17, 02 &amp; my last use was on Aug., 4, 02 and I intend to use again sometime on Sunday 8-11-02 or during that week.  Ill keep in touch. <br><br>
A Brother on the Path that only leads back to the Heart of our Father/Mother GOD! <br><br>
Father/Mother GOD I am grateful for the DEEPER understanding/contact Im having with your presence and I will only use Salvia for my own spiritual introspection.  I am yours and I am also grateful to begin to know what it means to be  LOVE.  For we are hear on this earth to learn how to love and to be that love in action forevermore!<br><br>
Your child becoming your Son.<br>
Thank You Father/Mother GOD!<!-- End Body -->
