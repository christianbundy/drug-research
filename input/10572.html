I have horrible insomnia, and I hadn't slept in four days. <br><br>
That in itself was painful. On top of that, I was getting pretty damn stressed. I kept passing out at the wrong times during the day. <br><br>
I came home and tried to sleep for about an hour, but it was all in vain. Over the summer, I used to pop a few pills to 'knock me out' so I could sleep. I thought of it more as pills easing me into sleep. <br><br>
I usually think about things before I swallow them, but I was horribly desperate and most definitely wasn't thinking when I popped 6 350mg Somas--at once. Now, I'm pretty tiny physically, and even though I did pills frequently, I still had a pretty low tolerance.<br><br>
They kicked in 10 minutes after I took them. I was on the phone with my friend, and he said that he had to go, and hung up--when in all actuality, he hung up and took a cab to my house!<br><br>
I was seeing double by then. I went outside to greet him, but couldn't really see him enough to hug him. He went inside and called the ambulance.<br><br>
I spent six hours in the hospital. I had to DRINK charcoal. I threw up a lot of it. It was a horrible, miserable, disgusting experience. Somas are fun, but take them in stride. Taking a lot of Somas is VERY DANGEROUS, especially if you are a lightweight, like me.<!-- End Body -->
