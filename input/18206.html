We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
I started huffing in my H.S. art class...of course rubber cement.<br>
As I huffed with rubber cement I started to have auditory distortions like the sounds(voices,T.V. whatever)around me were pulsing and echoing at the same time. Then I got lightheaded,dizzy and almost like I was drunk. There is a little nasua and I could taste the chemical in my mouth. My mouth also POURS watery saliva. The high lasts about 5 min. then fades quickly.<br><br>
I did this chemical for about 2 weeks 2-3 times a day.<br><br>
Then I got a job at a wharehouse place. One night I noticed a can of areosol engine starter (you spray in in the carb aka ether). I read he can and it warned against inhaling the fumes(huffing). So I had to try it...VERY stupid. <br><br>
I went to the bathroom and folded up one end of an empty toilet paper roll and put some t.p. in the bottom of it. As I sat on the toilet I sprayed the aerosol into the tube onto the toilet paper and started huffing. It was INTENSE,the auditory distortion of the MUZAC and the ceiling vent was very trippy. I was huffing for about 1.5 minutes with slow steady breaths through my nose. I remember saliva pouring out my mouth onto the floor between my feet. I was so out of it I almost fell of the pot...the next thing I remember my boss was beating on the bathrooom door.<br><br>
I woke up on the floor with the tube about a foot from my nose.<br>
I stood up very woozy with a slight headache. My boss said I had been missing for 4 hours...I had no explanation and was fired.<br>
The memory of the whole episode with my boss is a blur but I can remember pieces.<br><br>
I still think about what would have happened if the tube had landed closer to my nose after I had passed out.(DEATH) For the next couple of weeks(especially the next day)I felt dumbed down and not as sharp or 'smart' as I was before this experience. Eventually my memory of my level of brain 'sharpness' faded and the mind I have now is all I know...but I do know that my mind was once different.<br><br>
I did not know HOW serious huffing was until that experience. I NEVER have huffed and never will again. I know I killed many brain cells. It's NOT worth it,smoke a joint or have couple of beers.<br><br>
Huffing is SERIOUS. PLEASE don't ever try it.<!-- End Body -->
