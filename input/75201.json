 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had never had the pleasure of attending one before, but I never\r\nexpected drugs to be sold so openly at music festivals. My journey to\r\nSpookstock 7 was long an uneventful, and mostly was spent mentally\r\npreparing for whatever psychedelic experiences I might have. I was\r\nactually doubtful that I would be able to find any doses at all, as\r\nit's fairly uncommon in my home state. I was not to be disappointed.\r\nI awoke to the rising sun at about seven o'clock, on the second day of\r\nthe festival. I had arrived at the campground at midnight the night\r\nbefore, to something like an all-night music and drug party, and\r\nhadn't slept much in the intervening time. I was feeling strangely\r\nrefreshed anyway, for some reason. I think it was something about the\r\natmosphere of this place; everyone I met seemed to non-verbally\r\nacknowledge the strange, subtle connectedness that the psychedelic\r\nstate awakens me to. It was, perhaps, the change that was refreshing.\r\nNot many people I normally interact with have been awakened in this\r\nway.\r\nAs I climbed out of my friend R's car, stretched, and stumbled around,\r\nI encountered three new arrivals, camped out in the space next to\r\nus. were yelling at passerby, 'Molly!  Mescaline!'. (T-1:00)\r\n'Mescaline', I thought. That was definitely on my long, but\r\nshortening, list of 'Substances To Experience Before I Die'.\r\nIn addition to the connectedness, everyone here is just extremely\r\nfriendly, too. Maybe it's all the good pot and beautiful scenery. I\r\ndon't know. Anyway, I talked to this 'mescaline' guy for a while, and\r\nhe invited me over to his campsite, and offered me some hot chocolate.\r\nHe told me that what he actually had was MDMA, Peyote extract, and\r\n2C-B, which he explained was like synthetic mescaline.\r\nHowever, I already knew 2C-B well from my research. I had never\r\nexperienced it, though. It is indeed chemically similar to mescaline,\r\nbut it has its own unique and interesting effects, also. I knew that\r\nit's effects are described as 'Somewhere between MDMA and LSD, but\r\ncompletely unlike a combination of the two.' He agreed to sell me one\r\nof his few doses. I took it on the spot, and proceeded up the hill to\r\nthe site where people had been gathered around the bonfire the night\r\nbefore. I knew there would be a good aura up there. (T0:00)\r\nAs a bit of background information, I've been having a mild identity\r\ncrisis over the past few months. A lot of my friendships had changed\r\nsuddenly, and I found myself more alone than I'd ever been. I realized\r\nat this point that I had been defining myself too much by the people I\r\nwas associating with, and, in the absence of them, I wasn't entirely\r\nsure who I was, where I was, or even why I was alive. It was very\r\ndisconcerting, to say the least. \r\nThe embers of the bonfire of the night before were still smoldering\r\nwhen I arrived, and about ten of my fellow early morning trippers had\r\nbeen drawn up here as well. They were all sitting around it, smiling,\r\nsometimes talking sporadically, but mostly just relaxing and being\r\ngenerally amicable towards the world. I'd never met any of these\r\npeople before, but the seemed friendly enough.\r\nA kid in glasses and an all-over print t-shirt welcomed me over. This\r\nwas the first time I'd seen the camp in the daytime, and I must say,\r\nit is beautiful beyond description. It was a perfect day. Clear, blue\r\nsky with a warm sun beating down its pure energy onto us. The\r\ngreenest, softest grass I'd ever seen encircled the fire like a\r\ncarpet, stretching away into the woods at the bottom of the\r\nhill. Birds were flying in an unbelievable dance of life far above us,\r\nas the fire crackled in what I thought was a wise and especially\r\nsoothing manner. I was definitely beginning to feel the effects of the\r\ndrug now. (T+0:30-0:40)\r\nAll of my previous trips have been with tryptamine compounds, and what\r\nI found is that, if 2C-B is any indication, phenethylamines are much\r\nmore pleasant. Much warmer, much friendlier, less 'glitchy', and with\r\nless distracting visual activity. That's not to say the visual\r\nactivity is not there. If anything, it was much more intense than with\r\nother drugs I've tried. However, I was able to ignore it much more\r\neasily. It wasn't as mesmerizing as what I would see on, for\r\nexample, LSD. This was a good thing, as it lets me focus more on my\r\nsoul, which is what I came here to do.\r\nWhen it finally arrived, after maybe 45 minutes, The come-up was fast\r\nand fairly intense; almost overwhelming. I felt the energy of it\r\nwashing over me in waves, and it felt amazing. If I had been in a more\r\nneutral or hostile setting, things probably would have been\r\nfrightening at this point, but I knew that everyone around me\r\nunderstood, and was supportive of my state of mind. This made it much\r\neasier to bare my soul, and slip into a pleasant state of openness and\r\nunity with my surroundings. (T+0:40-1:00)\r\nBefore I had been there thirty minutes, the kid in the glasses and an\r\nold hippie got together with a guitar and a drum, and started playing\r\nmusic. It started off rough, and before long the kid admitted that he\r\nwas 'too fucked up on mushrooms' to be playing guitar well. Everyone\r\nlaughed in that kind of spaced-out way, they switched instruments, and\r\nthen proceeded to play the most beautiful music I've ever heard. The\r\ntrees swayed, the wind blew, the birds swooped and dove in intricate\r\npatterns, and it seemed as though the whole valley was dancing to the\r\nbeat of our collective soul.\r\nColors ... are amazing. Acid never did the colors thing for me, but on\r\nthis ... the grass was the greenest green I have ever seen. I'll never\r\nforget it, as long as I'm alive. The world is a beautiful place, if\r\nonly you can eliminate your bias and stop filtering the beauty through\r\nyour worldview for a moment. I am in love with this place.\r\nThe birds ... its almost as if they act as a single organism, some\r\nkind of a pseudo-hive mind. Every one of them has a soul, but,\r\ntogether, they are something greater. Something ... beyond ... mere\r\nbirds. They are a collective. WE are a collective. We are at peace.\r\nIt was quickly apparent that 2C-B is also much more of an intoxicant\r\nthan LSD is, at least for me. My memory was dramatically affected, and\r\nsomehow in-sync with the waves of energy crashing over my\r\nconsciousness. The rest of the trip was superimposed upon sets of\r\nclearly-defined waves of beauty, awareness, and clarity. It was as if\r\nI was in a movie, and, at points, I would suddenly 'awaken' in a new\r\nplace, as if a cutscene or transition had taken place. I was fully\r\nsane, conscious, and aware in the intervening time, and I remember it\r\nclearly, but it's not nearly as important as when I was on the crest\r\nof a wave of energy. Its as if I was coming to orgasmic revelations,\r\nevery twenty minutes or so.\r\nI remember clearly, at the peak of my come-up, two older clean-shaven\r\nmen came over and sat down around the campfire with us. For some\r\nreason, it was obvious to me that they were undercover cops. Looking\r\nback, I'm not sure if they actually were. However, a man in camoflogue\r\ncame over to the campfire, talking in a walkie-talkie, convincing me\r\nbeyond a doubt that we were surrounded by some kind of undercover SWAT\r\nteam. \r\nHe reached down behind a log where a kid was sitting, and picked up a\r\nbag of weed. 'What's this?'  he said. 'Will you please stand up, sir?'\r\nI was sure that we were getting busted, and was really high at this\r\npoint, so it was kind of starting to freak me out. But, it turns out,\r\nthe guy was just selling weed. 'Crappy weed is what it is. Nugget\r\ndelivery service!' he said. 'Somebody buy some nuggets!' I didn't see\r\nor hear about anyone get arrested during the entire festival. The guys\r\nthat I suspected were cops even smoked some of the pot with us. (T+1:30)\r\nAs I started to come down from the crest of my first wave, I wandered\r\naway from the campfire, and walked down 'Shakedown Street', the place\r\nwhere all the vendors are set up. Everyone's face was severely\r\ndistorted, but not in a menacing way. It was an obvious drug effect,\r\nso it didn't cause me much worry. The people didn't seem to notice\r\nthat I was tripping, or just simply didn't care. I felt a strange\r\nbenevolence towards everyone, tinged with a hint of suspisciousness,\r\nas I still suspected there were more undercover cops around here,\r\nsomewhere. I didn't have anything on me, so it wasn't a fear, but\r\nrather an understandable delusion that I held for twenty minutes or\r\nso. There probably were cops around there, with all the drug\r\ntrafficking going on. However, I recognized it as a drug-induced\r\ndelusion, and brushed it off before I left Shakedown.\r\nEventually, I ended up by the creek that runs through the bottom of\r\nthe valley. It's nothing like the creeks from my home state, all muddy\r\nand brown. No, this one was perfectly, unbelievably clear, like in a\r\ndream. Three more dudes were sitting by the creekside playing drums,\r\nand again, it seemed like they were playing to the beat of the\r\nriver. Through the music, it seemed to me that they had uncovered the\r\nsecret heartbeat of nature. Why hadn't I heard this before? (T+2:00)\r\nI sat there for nearly two hours, in the sun, listening to the drums,\r\nthe river, and watching the golden spiderwebs of the morning sky dance\r\nacross the perfectly clear water. I bathed in the radiance of the\r\nheartbeat, its warm, pulsating waves. The energy of that time was\r\nabsolutely amazing.\r\nI find that, personally, with the exception of Ayahuasca, the 'comeup'\r\nof psychedelics in general is not nearly as useful, in terms of\r\nintrospection, as the 'comedown'. That is, the comeup is more\r\nenjoyable, but, if I take anything away from the experience, I'm going\r\nto learn it while descending back to sobriety. That turned out to be\r\nespecially true with this substance. During the last four hours or so,\r\nI spent a lot of time wandering around, both in the campground, and in\r\nmy mind.\r\nI realized that my identity crisis was more an issue of where I was\r\nderived from. That is, I need to be part of a collective, a culture,\r\nperhaps, or a group of friends, but I cannot be OF that culture. Much\r\nlike the flock of birds on the hill, I need to enter into it,\r\nindependently, as a developed person, and bring something new to\r\nit. Any other way, I would either be defined by cultural norms, or an\r\noutcast. I need to push out my identity to those around me, rather\r\nthan pulling in theirs. This was my problem, and the realization of\r\nthis greatly settled my soul, and still does, as I write this more\r\nthan a month later.\r\nAfter the sun had ascended so far into the sky that I could no longer\r\njustify calling this a 'perfect morning', I ended up back at the\r\ncampsite of the people who had sold me the 2C-B. They were rolling up\r\na blunt. Perfect. Everything had that shiny, plastic sheen of order,\r\nyet identity, about it. They invited me over to smoke. It was a\r\nwonderful, communal experience. I felt close with everything. I had a\r\nvery intense feeling of having arrived home, at long last. (T+4:20)\r\nThere was what seemed to be an extremely long period of intoxication,\r\nafter the main effects had ended. This may or may not have been a\r\nproduct of all the marijuana I had smoked over the course of the day,\r\nthough I suspect it was not. I had the same 'waves of energy' feeling,\r\nbut without any of the visual activity, or really anything other than\r\na mild feeling of drunkenness. It was not unpleasant in the slightest,\r\nbut it did seem to go on well past the peak of the experience. I was\r\njust confused as to how I could still feel like I was tripping hard,\r\nbut without any kind of visuals at all.\r\nI finally was completely sober around 3 or 4 PM. The world retained\r\nits beauty, however, and, strangely, the grass retained its surreal\r\ngreen color. Even today, I will occasionally come across a\r\nparticularly green patch of grass in the morning or evening, with the\r\nsun falling across it just right, and I will again be overwhelmed with\r\nthe beauty of the world.\r\nAll in all, I think this was hands-down the best trip of my life. I\r\ndidn't learn as much from this substance as I did from Ayahuasca, and\r\nit wasn't nearly as intense as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, but,\r\nrather, a soft, warm day spent in paradise. I'm glad I had the\r\nopportunity to experience this. Highly recommended.\n\n\n"
