 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI placed about two tablespoons of Yerba Mate herb that I bought at a local herb store in a coffee press.  I then added near-boiling water and allowed it to steep for about 4 minutes before pressing.  I then added ice and enjoyed it with a cigarette.  It tasted like green tea.\r\nWithin ten minutes I felt stimulation with a very mild caffeine buzz.  The character of the buzz was not much like the buzz that I get from coffee, it was more subtle and did not make me feel 'fucked up.'  It was a mild buzz centered in my forearms and forehead.  I did not feel anxious or jittery.\r\nAbout an forty minutes after this, the effects were about the same.  At that time, I ingested a cup of skullcap tea, and the effects became confused with each other, therefore, I cannot say how long the effects lasted.\r\nI highly recommend Yerba Mate as a coffee alternative, it provides stimulation without excessive anxiety or jitters.\n\n\n"
