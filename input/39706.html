I purchased a pound of damiana from a online health food store, at the time to use as a tea infusion in combination with hibiscus flowers (flor de jamica).  The effect of the dried foliage in tea was quite potent, mild sedation and slight euphoria.  After some consideration, I put a quarter ounce into my coffee grinder and powdered it.<br><br>
The next day, my friends and I were driving back from classes, and I packed a bowl of damiana, letting everyone know what was in it.  Powdered damiana combusts quickly, I cleared the first bowl, about a half gram in one breath.  It was a bit harsh, but only because I wasn't expecting the quantity of smoke.  I had my friend repack it, because I noticed a sudden decrease in motor ability.  At T+5 minutes, streetlights started to blend together.  I had a sudden feeling of euphoria, like everything seemed beautiful.  It took me awhile to realize that we had all stopped talking... I knew that the effect was taking hold for all of us.  Effects became less pronounced after a half hour, and a within 45 minutes that had passed. The following day, I decided to hit a bowl by myself in between classes... when I arrived at my next class, I felt glued to my seat, unable to concentrate, but, unconcerned.  Trying to take notes, I realized my motor function was destroyed.<br><br>
Overall, although it isn't as good as cannabis for relaxation, as the effects lasted no more than an hour, because of its price, I plan on using it more for destressing, and saving my pot for visionary excursions.<!-- End Body -->
