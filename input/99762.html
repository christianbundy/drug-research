Mindset: Wakeful, neutral, overall good mindset<br>
Setting: In my one-bedroom apartment, alone, at around 9 PM<br><br>
Dosage: Unknown, though likely less than 2 or 3 mg.  <br><br>
Prescription drugs: None at the moment, have previously used budeprion 300 mg (though it's been over two months)<br><br>
Previous Experience: I published a previous experience under the same or similar pseudonym.  To sum up without getting specific: very experienced psychonaut, have done heroic doses of shrooms and acid (though no thumbprints), marijuana, MDMA, MDA (reagent tested, m.p.'d, among other tests to identify both were indeed MDMA and MDA), NBOMe experiences, a DOB experience, experiences with dissociatives such as Nitrous and DXM, experiences with cocaine and meth.<br><br>
Preface:<br><br>
I've experienced 2c-e about 7ish times, this being the 7th.  I have only insuffulated or taken it rectally.  The time frame of both are very very similar, I start tripping almost immediately (or if I take another bump), but the climb to the very top probably takes about an hour from my experience.  <br><br>
I would not venture too far above 7-8 mg for a rectal/nasal dose, as when I had my first time with 2c-e, I was tripping very very very hard.  +++ for sure, but definitely not a ++++.  <br><br><br>
Experience:<br><br>
00:00 It's Sunday, and after a long day of studying I figured I deserved a treat.  I decide to masturbate.  I pull out my brand new out-of-the-box anal beads and lube.  I decide also that instead of lubing the outside of the toy, I'll inject some lube into the backdoor to make things easier and cleaner. <br><br>
I decided to use an oral syringe (no needle), which I have used many times for oxycodone, tramadol, and more recently mda/mdma and 2c-e.  Over the previous few weeks I had used a little over 30 mg of 2c-e and an unknown amount of a half/half MDMA/MDA mix (pure, reagent tested, lab tested, and of course human tested.)  The last time I used the syringe I believed I had dosed about 5-6 mg of 2c-e (with a tolerance), and 200 mg or so of the MDMA/MDA mix.  My observation has been that I've been a bit surprised 2c-e didn't dissolve as much as I thought it would in the small amount of water I used (normally don't use much above 1 mL)<br><br>
So I take out my lube and suck up about 2 mL and work to inject it.  <br><br>
00:05 I'm getting faint intestinal spasms.  An urge to take a shit comes onto me.  <br><br>
00:10 The urge is too much so I go ahead and use the bathroom. Very little comes out.<br><br>
00:15 Injected myself again with more and play with myself more.  Yet again the spasms are coming back.  This time I'm on the toilet and rocking back and forth in a constant state of 'pushing.' Nothing is coming out. I'm looking at a particularly dull pair of jeans on my bathroom floor.  Yet, when I'm looking at them, they seem quite colorful, with smooth and gentle curves and ripples in them.  There's a subtle depth to them.<br><br>
It's at this time that something clicks in me.  The spasming was a symptom I've had previously with 2c-e when it goes up there.  I sometimes had to lay on my stomach for 5-10 minutes and squeeze to prevent some automatic 'pushing.'  To clarify, it's not like diarrhea, where something is building up and applying pressure, but more like my muscles automatically want to 'push.'  It's not unpleasant.<br><br>
01:00 It's a +.  MDMA/MDA does not make sense as the culprit for the slight increased intensity on the perception of color.  2c-e though is very possibly why I am experiencing this.  <br><br>
Summary: While I had larger doses in my previous experiences with 2c-e, I had also had some tolerance built up.  Due to my small size, and 2c-e's very powerful nature (doubled or tripled intensity when insuffulated or rectally administered), it makes sense I had received some threshold effects.  <br><br>
I want to stress that it hadn't occured to me that I may possibly be dosing myself with 2c-e when I first administered myself with lube.  I remembered that I last used 2c-e with the syringe only after I developed some changes in consciousness.<br><br>
Conclusion: 2c-e is very very powerful, and this experience illustrates how accidental dosing may occur and blindside someone. Anything, any equipment/paraphernalia/apparatus used to dosing should be carefully cleaned before the next use, preferably with varying solvents (water, or vodka since most don't have acetone or dichloromethane in their kitchen).<!-- End Body -->
