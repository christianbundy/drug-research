I certainly went about doing this the wrong way! This report is to help you not make the same mistake as I did, although it wasn't terrible or that unpleasant. <br><br>
10:00 PM - 5:00 AM<br><br>
I begin my story the night before hand when I was <i>finally</i> left alone to cook my cactus. I had little time to do it so I had to cook it that night. I used a method where I chopped, mixed with water, blended, cooked and strained the mixture to perfection. This was very carefully watched and I kind of took some foolish pride in my extraction, sacrificing sleep (required for a safe trip) in the process.<br><br>
5:00 AM - 6:00 AM<br><br>
I took a nap while it cooled down, I had some intense dreams spurred on my sleep loss but I woke up confident enough to continue with the process. <br><br>
6:00 AM - 7:30 AM<br><br>
I poured the mixture through a t-shirt into the blender, squeezing it to get every last drop out of the ball of cactus. The spines were <i>not</i> fun to squeeze, although they had been softened. I went out and grabbed some apple slices and grapefruit juice and began my trip journey.<br><br>
7:30 AM - ??? AM<br><br>
I don't know how long it took to chug that nasty liquid down. I had heard stories of nausea so I took a shot every 10 minutes or so, the kind of shots I'd do when I first started drinking hard liquor. My God it was terrible, but it was a learning experience, and by the time I 'finished' there was still half of the liquid left.<br><br>
The mescaline slowly took a hold of me, I didn't notice it too much at first, but I began to watch cartoons and do childish activities almost immediately. Light began to become intense for me and everything sort of became enhanced. As I was basking in the experience a nasty headache started to settle in.<br><br>
I went outside and was blown away by what I had missed. Beyond my fence there was thousands of things in the distance. I would have never noticed them before. The trees were alive with motion and the wind began to become very connective with me. I could not stand for very long out of lack of interest in standing and began to view the world on the ground. I suddenly became aware of the microworld all around us.<br><br>
I watched the ants go about their busy day. I realized they were happy working and didn't need the kinds of complex emotions humans needed. They had purpose in just collecting things. <br><br>
I watched flowers and saw their complex forms. I did not contemplate about them however. I just admired their bright colors and pleasant nature behind them I decided that they were a good thing.<br><br>
The grass seemed to be a forest that had been under our noses the whole time. An entire world beyond human grasp! And as I layed out on my concrete patio experiences of my childhood started flowing back to me.<br><br>
I remembered so much. I could feel what I felt when things happened. I started to feel sad at times and happy at others and I realized that my childhood shaped my being today. I realized I had to forgive those that had hurt me and that I was feeling like I was beginning anew.<br><br>
My time outside was the most memorable. It was very pleasant, but my headache had grown very intensely and I still had half a cup of San Pedro juice to down.<br><br>
I went back inside and attempted to swallow as much as I could. It was horrendous, but as the trip continued I began to care less about the taste and more about the experience. I continued throughout the day to chug and continue with my trip, mostly just talking on the phone and watching television. Rather uneventful but my headache became severe at this point<br><br>
The ever present nature of it was unavoidable and not advil nor any other pain medication could solve it. I didn't really understand at the time what was going on but I'm fairly certain it was exhaustion of the body and mind for I had only eaten apple slices that day.<br><br>
The sun eventually went down and I tried going to bed. I turned on a recording of rainfall on my speaker system and sunk into my bed. It was amazing.<br><br>
I could focus off of my exhaustion and just feel the amazement of the world around me. I grabbed my acoustic guitar and started playing blues scales with my eyes closed imagining I was on my grandparents porch on their farm in a heavy rain, playing my guitar. The feeling of peacefulness and tranquility is still with me as I'm typing this message. It was long due for.<br><br>
Eventually around midnight I got up and took a shower, the shower was incredible as well. The warm water really helped soothe me and felt like it soothed my soul as well. As the shampoo went down my body I could see every single bubble. The complexity of the bubbles in the soap was intense at the time and I spent a lot of time playing with them. I began to sing, just improvised lyrics at the time and came into a nice harmony with the sound of the water in the shower and everything around me.<br><br>
When I got out of the shower I felt clean, not only physically but emotionally and spiritually which is funny because I'm an atheist. My whole being felt cleansed and my headache was diminished. At this time I was exhausted. I fell asleep but I don't remember doing it and woke up feeling very peaceful but a little isolated and a bit cautious about the world around me.<br><br>
Still my life after the trip was greatly improved. My attitude toward everything drastically changed and I'm extremely happy today. <br><br>
Am I going to do it again? Maybe. In my opinion it's highly non-addictive, very safe and life changing for the better. <br><br>
Everyone should do mescaline at least once in their life time!<!-- End Body -->
