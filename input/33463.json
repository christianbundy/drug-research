 "report": "<p>I've been purchasing a lot of ethnobotanicals recently and have been keeping a stock of kratom for the weekends. Usually when I do the drug I use it as a replacement for alcohol, as I recently had a DUI and have been trying to cut back. Well, last night I was in party mode and before going out a friend and I smoked some salvia 5x extract and drank a glass each of kratom tea (made with 2 Tbl kratom powder in a espresso machine). We had a drink each before going. Something that night reacted very badly with the kratom.</p><p>We went to a club and met up with some friends. We had smoked the salvia and 1 bowl mid-grade mj at 7:00pm or so, drank the kratom tea at 8:00, and got to the club at 8:30. Over the next four hours we drank maybe 4 drinks apiece (we are both drunks and can drink 10 or more drinks without adverse effects). We smoked a bowl of very high grade mj and after that I went to the restroom and was violently sick. I was extremely pale and my head was swimming, and later returned and puked again. This second time there were no drinks remaining in my stomach, but I ended up hacking up very scary mix of what looked like wet black charcoal and grey fluid.</p><p>I went back to the table and tried to pull my head together and let my body settle, but I still felt very ill. My friend who had shared the kratom all of the sudden had to puke 10 minutes after I had returned the second time. He was also suffering adverse effects after purging his stomach and we decided to leave (about 12:30). He dropped me off at my house and I crashed hard and slept for 12 hrs, waking feeling alright but still having the kratom hangover.</p>"
