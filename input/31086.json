 "report": "<p>At about 9pm 3 friends and I, 1 male 2 female set out for a spiritual experience with 2-c-t-2. My friend and both have had previous experience while the girls had all only tried it once and it was like a 15mg hit. </p><p>Unfortunately I've had problems in the past cause of massive stress. The particular chemical seems to be heavily influenced by emotion (more than tryptamines for me at least). Now there was only about an hour and a half on onset with relatively no sickness. Then vivid closed eye visuals that when in a good mind set can be easily manipulated to produce memories or random things in my mind. Well we smoked a good amount of Bud cause otherwise some of us get headaches, and it calms emotions. We sat and laughed, made witty jokes, and watched futurama till about 230-300am. Then we migrated to the back porch (It was about 50-60 degrees we had blankets) where we piled on a futon and smoked and spoke. </p><p>But eventually some thing odd was happening. I had realized none had spoke in a long time but I had been having a conversation with my male friend for about 15m inutes before I realized it wasn't out loud. We had been talking about mindless bullshit at first confirming it aloud every couple minutes. Once it had been realized there was a lotta omfg and dumb shit like that. I had only thought it was between me and him. But thats about the time I first heard the girl next to me... Unfortunately, I had realized she could hear me and I was thinking about hookin up eventually and other oddities and this drove me nuts. I had felt I had lost privacy and quickly couldnt handle the speech any more because I had given plans and rambling insanity and felt embarassed and uncomfortable. Eventually I had come to grips with it but still was having trouble recieving thought after that cause of some of the things I had heard I wasnt ready for. I freaked at one point and broadcasted everything I was thinking for an hour.... Bastards sat and listened, drove me nuts cause they'd repeat what I said out loud and I'd loose privacy again. I eventually had to get up and leave till I could block them out properly and by then I wanted to talk but my defenses were up too high and I could only pick out pieces of speech. </p><p>I was quite astonished by the whole ordeal and would like to know if anyone else has had similar experiences.</p>"
