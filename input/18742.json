 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a really pleasant experience with NO negative efffects a nice come down and a refreshed feeling after sleep.\r\nThe dose was tried at this level due to the fact this compound had not been tested previously in our research circle. I am positive now that next trials will be somewhere between the 40-55mg mark. This was a thouroughly enjoyable experience however with hightened senses all around. The appreciation of art, music, touch, taste and smell and incredibly effective at de-stressing. I can see the 25-35mg mark being very usefull for public activities and enhancement of appreciation of many things. The mood was very humerous and good spirited.\r\nEffects took approximately 1.2-2hours to really develop with the plateau starting at or around the 2.5-3 hour mark lasting about 2 hours then tapering off to a very relaxed state and drifting off to a very refreshing sleep.  Awoke feeling VERY refreshed and with no negative effects. The whole experience is very relaxed with very mild stimulation.\r\nI think this can and will be a very useful theraputic tool in the future. It had much to offer with nothing really negative at all. At this dose level at least. I look forward to future trials with much anticipation.\r\nMuch investigation is needed.\r\nAnother valuable Phenethylamine with much to offer!\n\n\n"
