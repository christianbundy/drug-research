 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've spent enough time abusing various substances - some in order to cut back on the anxiety that comes with orchestral auditions or concerts. Some see beta-blockers as cheating when it comes to taking auditions, but it the cut-throat music business of today, any edge I have is one-up on the next guy in line for the job.  Beta-blockers take away that anxiety that would normally make me miss notes or get so nervous that I can't even play.  I only take them when needed - auditions, large performances, etc. but I think they are great.  I may give a try at taking a few just for fun, but right now, I'd say they are a great friend to musicians or anyone that has anxiety in front of crowds.  My typical dose is 40mg.\n\n\n"
