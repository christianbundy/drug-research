Compounds ingested: <br>
DMT [who knows how much I had actually consumed that evening.. hundreds of milligrams over the course of the evening]<br>
MDMA [~180mg total, 35-40mgof which were insufflated, the rest taken orally/sublingually]<br>
Cannabis/hashish [more toward the end of the night.. smoked much more than normal.]<br>
Diazepam [5-10mg just before bed]<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
Ive had a lot of experience with MANY psychedelics.  2c-c, 2c-b, 2c-e, 2c-i, 2c-t-2, psilocybe mushrooms, 4-aco-dmt, 4-ho-mipt, aMT, DMT, 5-meo-dmt, DPT, LSD, LSA, MDA, MDMA, bk-MDMA, 4-mmc [if you count this], Ketamine [racemic and pure S-isomer],  DXM, 4-meo-pcp...probably a few others I cant think of off the top of my head. At the time of this report, I was 20 years old, 61, and 170-180lbs, and male.   <br><br>
After meeting up with an old friend we drive to a very small town a few hours from the city we're from. i knew that there was going to be a LOT of VERY clean dmt at our destination, and i had negotiated a trade for ~500mg of dmt for my remaining 52mg of 2c-b.<br><br>
as i arrived in the most beautiful landscape i've seen in a great while i'm met by the person i had negotiated the trade with, and a bunch of other interesting people that were still essentially strangers. I'm introduced to Dr. DMT, and he enthusiastically greets me, and tells me about the excessive amounts of mdma he had taken that day. he was on about 500mg; he thought the caps he had were going to be ~75mg, but turned out to be about 100mg.  the mdma was snow white shards, and looked and tasted very pure.<br><br>
we talk for a while, then he pulls out the most beautiful, white crystalline DMT i've seen in my entire life...moments later i load 105mg into my freebase pipe and blast off. 3 BIG hits.<br><br>
the first two got me to 'tryptamine land', and i hesitated, then knew it was in my best interest to go for magic number three. i close my eyes, drift off, and still feel a bit of fear. momentarily, i notice that the cloudy swirling psychedelic patterns filling my vision are the most beautiful thing i've seen in a while and i've been tripping on a weekly basis most of this month, mostly on various 2c-b combinations. as these mirroring patterns on either side of my field of vision converge in the center of my vision, i 'lose track' of my body, and reach a very mellow ego death. the red and violet swirls which seemed to defy all earthly spatial dimensions [seemed to move in ways which tangible objects in the real world simply cannot] combine in the center of my vision, and form what seemed to be an entity made of bright gold pulsating light. i'm filled with more excitement, and joy than i have been in a while. this 'being' seems to swirl, dance and pulsate for a while, but before i know it i was back to the 'real' world, and jumping with joy.<br><br>
We hung out for a while, took a few more small hits, then i decide to trade some 4-ho-mipt and a few diazepam tabs for 2 caps of the mdma...didn't intend to dose them that night, but within a few minutes i decided the environment, and vibes were VERY conducive for a nice 5-ht bomb, so weighed out 20mg from one cap, insufflated it, and dumped the rest in my mouth...definitely tasted like a mouth full of mdma. the roll came on very mildly, and was a little anxious before for a few minutes, but it faded into euphoria shortly. i wasn't too far off baseline, or at least i didn't think i was until i told a woman [slightly older than me, with a husband and child] that i thought she was beautiful. [i was rolling.]<br><br>
we all pass around a dmt pipe for a while, taking sub breakthrough doses and just talking, and acting goofy. i decide to take more mdma [this was maybe 2 hours after my first dose] and dump out ~15-20mg of the second cap and snort it, then dump about half of what was left in my palm and lick it up.. not sure why i like to taste the molly...i guess it's just some sick pleasure i've associated with the disgusting taste [after weighing what was left over the day after, I had consumed about 180mg of the mdma].  my friend [who was on all the mdma, and dmt] decided to drop the 52mg of 2c-b...for an hour or two, all he could say was 'wow'. he was absolutely in ++++ range, and the fact that he was so high, boosted me up quite a bit. <br><br>
we all hung out for a while, and took a brief night hike, and smoked more dmt, and a little hash. i felt very sedated, not at all unlike aMT, but it had a less 'ecstatic' head space; it felt more like i was 'fucked up' than was tripping...at least until we drove to a beautiful ridge overlooking a city and ENDLESS hills covered in trees. a few friends and i seemed to pass the dmt pipe back and forth FOR EVER. with monster hit, i got a little farther, but at the same time, became more accustom to the headspace, and twisting, crawling visions.<br><br>
we got back to the house, and proceeded to smoke MORE dmt. it gradually became a bit less visual, and more of a head trip. i felt AMAZING. the mdma had me fully immersed in my surroundings, and the endless pile of dmt i'd been casually hitting all night brought me to an intense visual state, but it was strangely mellow.  As the dmt wore off, the lovey mdma flow paired with the tryptamine glow reminded me again of aMT.<br><br>
things started to wind down, we smoked a LOT of very high quality hash, ate some food, and took a few mg of diazepam. i passed out within an hour, very satisfied at what was EASILY the best MDMA experience i've ever had.  I woke up the next day, ate lots of fruit and vegetables, along with some 5-htp, and felt GREAT.  The first time Ive gotten an afterglow from mdma, as opposed to days of depression.  <br><br>
my one regret: not saving a few mg of 2c-b for myself<br><br>
This experience was summer, 2010, about 1 year ago...I wrote the above report within a few days after the experience, and I truly believe that this combination of drugs was one of the best nights of my life. This night started a close friendship with the newly acquired friend [Dr. DMT...not the compound, but the person I tripped with], and a year later he is one of my closest friends.<br><br>
I write this trip report because the AMAZING synergy between these two compounds.  Since this experience, I have had good luck introducing friends to DMT while they under the influence of MDMA; these friends were normally scared of dmt, and now love it.<br><br>
If you are a psychedelic drug user, I STRONGLY recommend this combination, as it TRULY is amazing. Especially if you would like a full dmt experience, but get scared off before you can smoke the full intended dose.<!-- End Body -->
