The trip lasted quite a while, but I will make a long story short.  After tripping for about 3 hours down by rocks at the base of a beautiful waterfall about 30 ft. high, we decided to go to the top of it.  We eventually climbed to the top of the rocks, and my friends and I all found our most confortable spots.  I lay flat on a rock, with my head propped up by my sweatshirt and a small niche that I thought was 'meant for me.'  In front of me and to the right lay 2 large boulders, on with a flat face that was facing me, and the other was a more traditional spherical boulder.  To my left was the waterfall, and the 30 foot drop that scared me at times.  My friend cracked the N2O into the balloon, as I am inexperienced in doing this (and too drug induced to learn after 8 bong loads).<br><br>
He handed it to me and I took deep breaths and put it to my mouth, but not before pushing play on my cd player at full blast.  I had the song Fluff by Black Sabbath.  Anyone who has heard this song may be able to guess what was in store for me later.  I inhaled and exhaled, over and over, going slowly and increasing the pace of my breath.  I inhaled about 7 times before I could not hold the baloon anymore.  I dropped it and I saw it fly out of my vision.  My friends were standing in front of me having a conversation, and this is where the most frightening / best trip of my life occured.  My eyes shut as I watched my friends disappear from my vision.  I guess my eyes moved slowly upward, because by the time my vision gave out I was looking at the top of the flat boulder in front of me that they were standing in front of.<br><br>
I could now only hear my song, and let me tell you, it was the most beautiful thing I have, to this day, ever heard.  The echo and chorus on it sounded like it was digitally pumped up 200%.  I was suddenly concious of my slowing breathing until it stopped.  I have never passed out before from a drug, and I believe this is what I did.  The colors I saw after the black faded were incrediable.  Blues, reds, oranges, purples and whites (purple and red dominated the vision) spun around in a wonderful ballet, and in my mind I thought these exact words 'oh my god, my heart stopped (I have a heart condition) and Im dead.  Oh my god...Im dead.'<br><br>
These thoughts of fear disappeared into bliss.  A feeling I could not describe befell me, as if I had just found the state I was in before I was born.  I sat there, listening to my song, waiting to be reborn in a different form.  I seriously felt like my spirit left me and went to the realm where you wait to be reborn, which would proove Buddha right.  The trip lasted for quite awhile, I lay there listening to the heavenly music pass though my spirit, and watching the colors spin around and around.  Suddenly, the echo faded away, and I believe I returned to conciousness.  What is amazing is this is exactly when the song ended.  A feeling of relief that I had not died fell on me, and my eyes opened showing my friends.  I layed there on the rock and contemplated what had just happened as the next track of the cd came on.  I looked around me.  I was drooling, the balloon was all wet and so was a spot on the rock behind me.<br><br>
I dont believe I will ever do this again.  I believe that that one seperation from complete reality, and the touch with death was enough for me, and it would be pointless to relive it.<!-- End Body -->
