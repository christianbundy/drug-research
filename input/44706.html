Yerba Mate is a pleasant drink similar to other caffeine drinks but with a profound difference, at least for me. The effects, subjectively, include a much more calm feeling, a sense of mental clarity, appetite suppression, and a smooth energy kick.  I used to drink a cup or two of strong coffee made in a French Press, and as many people well know, too much coffee and/or tea, cola, chocolate, etc. can make you feel jittery, irritable, and twitchy. I have not had this same twitchiness with Yerba Mate even though I've consumed a bit too much from time to time. This minor overdosing gave me a speedy feeling that was a bit stronger than I wanted, I don't like to feel manic, but even at that dosage I did not feel as jittery as compared to too much coffee. <br><br>
When I began drinking Yerba Mate, I gradually felt a diminished desire for coffee and now drink mate instead of coffee. I use a semi traditional approach -- a modern interpretation of the mate gourd and 'bombilla' straw. I like the traditional method, but it's difficult to travel with an odd shaped gourd with no lid. I ended up purchasing a special cup with stainless steel liner, insulation and a top with a hole for a straw. The filter straw (bombilla) has a finer mesh than the traditional straws and does a better job filtering out the finer plant material that often comes through into your mouth, particularly with the traditional bombilla design. The modern straw is made of a food grade plastic. The traditional gourd and metal bombilla has more appeal stylistically, but the modern set up works a bit better in my experience.<br><br>
Save the rainforest, drink Yerba Mate.<br><br>
When I buy mate, I buy it from a company that harvests from the forest as opposed to a mate plantation. Forest-grown products help save the rainforests because it provides income for people so they will preserve the land rather than clear cut for cattle or other such short lived ventures. <br><br>
