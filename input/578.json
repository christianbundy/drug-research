 "report": "<p>\nIt was Sunday nite in Las Vegas and I decided to stay in my 4 Queens hotel room.</p><p>T+ 0Hr, Drop 12mg encapsulated.  Buzzed at T+30min.</p><p>T+ 1Hr, I drop another 10mg. </p><p>T+ 2Hr, I drop my final 10mg.  Almost instantaneously my X type experience shifts gears.  Within 30 more minutes I have pleasantly discovered that the Foxy (we call it DiPT, as in 'wanna get DiPT?') effects blossom exponentially beyond 20mg.</p><p>T+ 3Hr, I am at the level of a 200mcg+ LSD trip and still climbing - very visual yet gentle, NOT overpowering.</p><p>T+ 4Hr, still peaking.</p><p>T+ 5Hr, still peaking at the equivalent effects of nearly 300mcg LSD.</p><p>T+ 6Hr, still experiencing a slow-sustained peak.</p><p>T+ 7Hr, still in the sustained peak, but I have passed the apex.</p><p>T+ 9Hr, slowly dimishing BUT quite high by normal reality standards.</p><p>T+ 12Hr, back to baseline.</p><p>I am pleased to discover that getting DiPT at 30mg+ (staggered 1/3 per hour ramp) is BETTER than P. cubensis and more like LSD in many ways - contrary to previous reports the 'FoxyDiPT' is NOT a 'mild semi-psychedelic' it is a FULL BLOWN psychedelic with a unique gentleness and very visual signature.</p><p>You've been stoned, dosed, even ripped - now get 'DiPT!'</p>"
