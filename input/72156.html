Having aquired a gram of this substance many years ago, I have now just tonight exausted my supply and am experiencing the effects of my last dose as I write this. <br><br>
In all of my experience with this drug--- which I have never mixed with any other substance- there appears to be no cognitive changes whatsoever.   The only change that is prominent is the auditory effect that has been well documented.<br><br>
It's an interesting substance in that it is a tryptomine and it has no distinct cognitive effects other than the auditory ones, and I'm sure Shulgin was very impressed when he first tried this one out as I was initially. <br><br>
But in repeated uses, the only constant is the auditory (lowering of pitch) nature and there is nothing deeper (at least for me) to this drug at all.   I don't have a milligram accurate scale, but the highest dose I've probably taken is 150mg orally.   And I have only experienced the auditory effects and nothing else.  Not even a slight change in my thinking.  <br><br>
I'm not sure of the legality of this drug anymore-- as I got it when these substances were more or less legal, but I won't try this drug again as it has nothing to offer for me at this point in my life.   <br><br>
Again, I have never mixed this drug with any-other, and I assume THC could really potentiate possible 'psychedelic' effects of this drug more than what I have felt with just DiPT alone.<!-- End Body -->
