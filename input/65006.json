 "report": "<p>I am simply writing to give my experience with dxm and store bought urine tests.  I have been addicted to heroin, cocaine, as well as other substances and have been to a rehab for treatment.  I am tested regularly for drugs using a 'First Check' urine test.  It is FDA approved.  I was tested approximately 12 hours after my ingestion of 40 robitussin gel capsules and tested negative for all substances including, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, methamphetamines, MDMA, amphetamines and PCP.  Keep in mind that I had only used the robitussin tablets and nothing else.</p>"
