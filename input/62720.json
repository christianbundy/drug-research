 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was prescribed Adderall once I was diagnosed with ADHD, at the early age of 17.  My doctor literally asked me what dose I felt was fit, based on my illicit experimentation a few years prior! During the summer of 2006 I found that I hated the widely dispensed extended release formula (20mg XR). This schedule never granted me the ability to eat enough, made it easy for me to chain-smoke, and interrupted my sleeping cycle.\r\nI am now prescribed a daily 30 mg. dose of generic, non-extended release formula Adderall, or amphetamine salts as the bottle reads.  I much rather eat and sleep well as opposed to getting revved on Coast to Coast all of the time, so I take the meds sparingly.  Doing so keeps my tolerance low and thus makes the medication more effective when it comes time for me to hyper-focus or be the life of a party.  Partying/Drinking under the influence of Adderall and other drugs is a fools game just to remind you.\r\nWhen Im not rolling with Bennie and the Jets, I down a daily dose of St. Johns Wort (1,400mg), which I have come to love more than sweet Mary Jane!  St. Johns is like a guardian angel to me, the effects arent overpowering or dominating, but there in the back round to positively guide and sooth my emotions.  I find it hard to think negatively and really appreciate life when my buddy John is with me.  Ive also noticed that I have much more patience, politeness, and appreciation for music and art.  There may be even a slight aural distortion I experience, but it may be just a placebo effect.  At any rate, I cant complain!\r\nI was warned by a quack not to mix St. Johns with my prescription.  He couldnt give me a definitive reason why, and it turned out the good doctor wasnt familiar with (or perhaps secretly opposed) the OTC Godsend.  Another physician told me to try it out with caution.  So I did, and now I wont take Adderall without St. Johns Wort.  St. Johns Wort, in my experience, doesnt noticeably weaken the effects of amphetamine, but the side-effects are dramatically reduced in severity.  No longer do I become irritable while speeding along, snapping at anyone who dares say hello.  My clarity of thought is further heightened, but with an upbeat twist.  Simultaneously I will feel positively motivated with St. Johns help, and hyper-focused with amphetamines aid, the dynamic duo joining forces, allowing me to accomplish more and focus longer, all with a smile!   At times I even feel the urge to eat, which I never experienced with taking Adderall alone.  The dreaded crash seems to lose a modest level severity, but St. Johns doesnt help much in putting me to sleep.  For that, I have Valerian and Kava.\r\nBottom line, this has become one of my favorite chemical combinations.  It takes the edge off of Adderall while not diminishing its potency, and boosts my morale enough to see a boring assignment through.  I hope to further experiment increasing the potency of Adderall by taking it conjunction with St. Johns Wort and Gotu Kola, but thats another story.\n\n\n"
