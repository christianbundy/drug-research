 "report": "</p>\nMy mother drug tests me, I read about putting 6ml in a 60cc sample of urine. </p><p>She uses Home Marijuana Test Kits that she buys at pharmacies.</p><p>I had smoked 2 bowls of headies weed on friday night, for the first time in </p><p>over 2 weeks (I know I was clean previously because I had been drugtested by </p><p>her 3 days before I smoked again, and I passed). Saturday night, I smoked </p><p>another bowl. Sunday morning I ate a poptart with about .5 grams of shwagg </p><p>cooked in. Tuesday, I was tested.</p><p>So, I put approximatly 6ml of visine in the urine (slightly diluted because </p><p>I drank 3 cups of water beforehand). I failed.</p><p>So people who say that visine yield false negatives are wrong, because in my experience, it does not. I'm 17 years old, weigh 130.</p>"
