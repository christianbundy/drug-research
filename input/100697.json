 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n2300 1200micrograms under tounge\r\n2320 1200micrograms under tongue\r\n0000 I'm out of my depth, my visual field is completely covered by repeated shapes. I look in my hand and droplets appear - a billion miracles forming.\r\nMy voice is strange - echoing.\r\nI never expected this.\r\nDreadful nausea - I'm frightened.\r\n0100 I float between feeling scared and joy. The nausea is passing. I lie on my bed and play my music. \r\n0200 My dark room fills now with gargoyles and the walls breathe.\r\n0230 Finally I find myself relaxing. The light that comes from behind begins to move forward and the gargoyles disappear.\r\nI seek out the light and as I look I see an intense light as people describe in Near Death Experiences. But it is first behind perspex. My path is clear. \r\n0300 Finally, fully joyful, the light - my communion with the divine - is fully visible and showers of beauty fall from it. I am an an 'atrium'. My audience with the divine light which lifts my spirits. All that is beautiful is a manifestation of the divine. And I am well stocked.\r\nLarge polls hold this immense place - but the light is independent. Perhaps this drug is the way we may come to the divine. \r\n0400 Afterglow and much to say. Had I been cautious I would never have found such.\n\n\n"
