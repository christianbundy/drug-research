 "report": "<p>2300 1200micrograms under tounge</p><p>2320 1200micrograms under tongue</p><p>0000 I'm out of my depth, my visual field is completely covered by repeated shapes. I look in my hand and droplets appear - a billion miracles forming.</p><p>My voice is strange - echoing.</p><p>I never expected this.</p><p>Dreadful nausea - I'm frightened.</p><p>0100 I float between feeling scared and joy. The nausea is passing. I lie on my bed and play my music. </p><p>0200 My dark room fills now with gargoyles and the walls breathe.</p><p>0230 Finally I find myself relaxing. The light that comes from behind begins to move forward and the gargoyles disappear.</p><p>I seek out the light and as I look I see an intense light as people describe in Near Death Experiences. But it is first behind perspex. My path is clear. </p><p>0300 Finally, fully joyful, the light - my communion with the divine - is fully visible and showers of beauty fall from it. I am an an 'atrium'. My audience with the divine light which lifts my spirits. All that is beautiful is a manifestation of the divine. And I am well stocked.</p><p>Large polls hold this immense place - but the light is independent. Perhaps this drug is the way we may come to the divine. </p><p>0400 Afterglow and much to say. Had I been cautious I would never have found such.</p>"
