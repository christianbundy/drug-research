 "report": "\n\n\n\nWhen I first started, I just wanted EVERYONE to have a taste of it, it was so beautiful.\r\nI've given up pilling now, because last week I had to have an abortion - had I not been eeeeing off my face the whole time, I firstly would never have slept with the guy I slept with, let alone do it without contraception!\r\nNow the thought of E makes me nauseous and sad - when I first took it, it was the best, best best thing I'd ever experienced.\r\nI remember begging friends to take e with me, and telling them it's different to normal drugs. I don't think it is anymore.\r\nIt's just such a pity that people can't feel like they do on E, naturally.\n\n\n"
