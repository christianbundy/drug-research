 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n500 Mg Equiv. 0.8% Valerian Extract (Taken orally)\r\nTook 5 capsules, waited 15 minutes, then (feeling nothing) took 3 more.\r\nFelt a little comfortable, and my memory seemed to be a little effected. (Still is)\r\nWaited 10-20 minutes, took 4 more capsules. Then about 5 minutes after, took 6 more.\r\nOn them right now, I feel very comfortable. Thats about it. My mind also seems a little fuzzy, and my perpective seems a little messed up - edges not lining up rarely.\r\nOverall, I can see the legitiment uses of this drug but it's recreational use isn't very strong.\n\n\n"
