I was given several purple tablets by an adult friend who said that they were called 'Purple Passion' and that they were ecstasy.  He and his wife had tried them and said that they were excellent, so I was quite enthusiastic about trying them.<br><br>
I managed to arrange for a Saturday during the summer where I could be away from my wife and daughter and spend the day with one of my best friends at his beach house and 'X.'  ('X' was the verb we used for doing ecstasy in the old days.)<br><br>
It was a beautiful, crystal clear sunny day and my friend's beach house is a quick 3 minute walk to one of the nicest beaches in the state.  The water is a bit cold, however, as it is the North Atlantic, but on a hot summer day one can swim for an hour or more without getting into trouble with their body temperature.<br><br>
We each took a 'Purple Passion,' unknown dosage, and washed them down with a beer.  Throughout the day we drank beer off and on - nothing like a case or anything between us but perhaps 4 or 5 beers each.<br><br>
I had burned a CD of some new, crazy music I had downloaded from the net and labled it 'Purple Passion' and we fired it up as soon as the effects started coming on.<br><br>
The effects were quite 'intense' and while they were similar to Ecstasy I could tell that what we had taken wasn't true MDMA.  The energy was there.  The affection was there to some extent.  The energy level was far higher than I would have expected with ecstasy.  I was very aware of a strong, 'clean' buzz.<br><br>
Aside from some of the affection, the social aspects of Ecstasy weren't present.  Rather than head down to the beach and interact with people I was perfectly content to sit in my buddy's living room, groove on the music and chat with him.  We were chatting a mile a minute, of course.<br><br>
The body impact seemed low.  I am prone to jaw-clenching and found myself clenching a bit but not overly so.<br><br>
My buddy, who straight or fucked up is always 100X more social than I am got us motivated to head down to the beach.<br><br>
We walked down with our arms full of towels, coolers, lawn chairs, suntan lotion, etc.  His beach is technically a 'private beach' servicing several hundred families so there were plenty of people around but not as many as one might find at a public beach on such a hot day.<br><br>
I am overweight and generally do not like to sit around with my shirt off but the drug felt so good that I allowed myself to bask in the sun with plenty of lotion.  It also gave me an opportunity to show off some of my tattoos.<br><br>
I got up the courage to get in the cold water.  Massachusetts ocean water north of Cape Cod is pretty cold, even in the summer.  There is an initial shock as you get in but once you are in you get accustomed to it rather quickly and it can become quite enjoyable.<br><br>
I walked out until with my feet on the ground only my head was above water.  I love doing that and sort of bobbing back and forth with the current and waves.  At high tide this beach drops off at an acute angle so I didn't have to walk out too far.<br><br>
I bobbed and floated and grooved on the scene around me for at least two hours.  There was a group of kids near me who were playfully fighting over control of an inflatable boat and they had several water toys.  I mediated their conflicts to some extent, helped some of the younger ones on and off the boat, towed them around, etc.  I felt very positive about these kids.<br><br>
My buddy stayed on the beach and sunned himself.  We'd exchange a wave of the hand periodically to let each other know that we were OK.<br><br>
As the afternoon wore on the people at the beach started disappearing and I watched the sky grow darker in the each - not quite a sunset, but an interesting purple influenced skyscape nonetheless.<br><br>
I got out of the water, dried off a bit and we returned to my buddy's place.<br><br>
We took a third Purple Passion, crushed it and snorted it which bumped the trip intensity back up to close to its highest levels, although it receded fairly quickly after that.<br><br>
The downside was quite harsh with a heavy body load.  I was basically sore throughout my body, presumably from tensing my muscles.  I was particularly sore in my jaw due to clenching.<br><br>
I took a Vicodin ES (7.5/500) and 10mg Valium to help 'cushion the blow' of coming down and washed them down with more beer.<br><br>
At some time long after the trip was gone I said goodbye and drove the 20 minutes back to my place.  Both my buddy and I felt quite good about the trip.<br><br>
The next day I felt like absolute shit and I actually had to stay in bed.  I countered the discomfort with more painkillers and benzos but the pain and discomfort ran deep.  I realized by the end of the day that I was really sick.<br><br>
I am prone to bronchitis and pneumonia and after a day or two more of being bed-ridden and feeling like shit I felt the bronchitis coming on strong.<br><br>
Normally I would self-medicate with the appropriate antibiotic but I felt worse this time than I usually did with a lung infection, so I went to see the doctor.<br><br>
Sure enough, I had a fairly serious case of pneumonia and was instructed to go to the emergency room.  (I never mentioned the drugs to my doctor or to the people at the hospital).  At the ER they monitored my blood oxygen levels (the infection was such that I wasn't absorbing enough oxygen as I should have been) and they had me suck on a nebutilizer(?) of albuterol for several hours plus they started me on Zithromax plus an oral steroid (Probably Prednisone or Prednisolone) which felt quite nice.  I always feel like SUPERMAN when taking a steroid.<br><br>
After a few hours they sent me home, told me to take it easy, gave me a few days worth of the steroid and the rest of the course of Zithromax to finish.  I was fine 48 hours later.<br><br>
I had several 'Purple Passions' left and compared them to photographed/tested samples on Dancesafe.org and found some definite matches, all of which tested for NO mdma and for BZP &amp; TFMPP only.<br><br>
The purpose of this report is not for me to say BZP + TFMPP = PNEUMONIA - that would be incredibly stupid.  What I want to make people aware of is that one's immunity system can be comprimised when under the influence of this sort of drug.  An active 30 yr old should NOT be getting pneumonia in the middle of the summer after a day at the beach.  I am convinced that my immune system was lowered while I was under the influence of the drug(s) and that the appx. 2 hours I spent in the cold water didn't help matters any.<br><br>
I have since had another similar experience with cocaine over the holidays this winter - a night of cocaine abuse in an ice-cold and wet environment led me down a similar path to pneumonia.  I don't even bother seeing the doctor anymore when this sort of thing happens - I have plenty of Zithromax on hand just in case.<br><br>
As for BZP &amp; TFMPP, I wouldn't call them GREAT drugs.  They were fun and barely 'passable' as Ecstasy.  Someone who never had real Ecstasy before would certainly not have been disappointed.  I'll hold out for the real stuff next time.<!-- End Body -->
