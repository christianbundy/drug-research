It started when I took between 12 and 15 vivarin at my dads. He drove me home and the ordeal began.</p><p>T+30 min Everything was distorted and I was cold so damn cold.</p><p>T+180 min Mom came home and I told her I was sick.</p><p>T+300 min It just hit hard. I puked. It burned my throat all the way up I feared for my life and began to read my bible as I sure as hell wasn't gonna sleep for a long ass time. The Tv froze and didn't work except for one channel that had my beloved Indians losing at the world series.</p><p>T+480 min Fell asleep into a hellish uncomfertable ordeal.</p><p>3:AM I wake up and throw up everywhere. I go eat but when I stand up I puke it back up mom said I don't have to go to school so I spend the day vomiting when I stand up.</p><p>NOON Started vomiting BLOOD, dark black blood, likely from acid burning my gut.</p><p>Next day I came down but still have pain.  </p><p>AGE 12</p>"
