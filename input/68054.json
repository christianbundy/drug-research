 "report": "<p>I got some wormwood plants from my neighborhood, dried them (hanging upside down), filled a jar halfway full with dried wormwood, add pure moonshine(70-80%) and fill up the jar. Then I put the jar in a dark, room-temperature place and let it stay. This mix gets stronger and stronger the longer I keep it. Mine is now on the 7th year and it's really strong.</p><p>I like to add 5-7 drops to a cannabis/tobacco mixture and roll into a joint. I find the effects of wormwood to be much like the marijuana effect, but more muscle-relaxing and a 'deeper high'.</p>"
