﻿MJ Brownie Experiment<br><br>
What are the effects of eating pot?<br><br>
Start Time is 9:15 p.m.  (7/12/03)<br><br>
Control:<br><br>
I weigh ~135 Pounds (60.25 kg)<br><br>
No THC in my system for at least a year!<br><br>
No drugs in my system in the last week (caffeine, DXM, aspirin, etc.)<br><br>
I have a completely empty stomach!  I ate last at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon.<br><br>
I will list my feelings every fifteen minutes until I really feel heavy effects (if I<br>
do)<br><br>
I know the diazepam is against the rules to control this experiment, but this is for<br>
my own good and I can distinguish the different effect of the two drugs/highs<br><br>
My recipe for an identical experiment is as follows<br><br>
Stuff you need:<br><br>
	1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped<br>
	4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, softened <br>
	½ Cup sugar<br>
	1 egg<br>
	¼ Cup all-purpose flour<br>
	½ Teaspoon of vanilla extract (for taste)<br>
	Around ½ oz of herb, depending on the strength you want<br>
        your brownies.<br><br>
Process:<br><br>
1.)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a   cupcake pan<br>
     that makes 4-6 cupcakes (depending on how large you<br>
     want the brownie.<br>
2.)  Combine the herb and butter in a small saucepan over<br>
low heat, stirring frequently.  When the butter and bud have heated up for awhile (just a few minutes) add your<br>
chocolate and let that melt and continue stirring.  After<br>
everything is blended remove the mixture from the heat.<br>
3.)  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the sugar. <br>
Than beat in the egg.  Gently stir in the flour, salt, and<br>
vanilla.  Pour and scrape the mixture into the cupcake<br>
pan about 2/3 full on each one.  Put the brownies in the<br>
oven for 20-25 minutes and check periodically to see if<br>
the middle of the brownies is set with a toothpick.  Let<br>
them cool on a rack, outside, in the refrigerator, etc. <br>
They stay good a few days and make about 4 brownies.<br>
4.)  The brownies will take about 30 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach.  Eat one every 30 minutes and you should be out for the night within 3 hours!<br><br>
NOTE:  The smell of bud shouldn't flow out of the oven, but it smells pretty bad in the oven, but not anything you'd expect from pot.  I actually though I got a contact buzz while cooking it, but really it turned into a headache.  (not pleasant)<br><br>
9:15 p.m. -  I ate one Brownie Cake that contain ~1/9 oz of commercial bud.<br><br>
9:30 - I took 10 mg of Diazepam to control my anxiety while stoned.  (I seem to have a problem with paranoia)  Also, my parents are up stairs, so in case I get super baked I wont get scared! Believe it or not, I actually feel a buzz coming on from the magic brownie!  It is nothing like the coming up while smoking, it seem to affect how my body feels (in a good way!).<br><br>
9:45 - Nothing much different, It seems that I am totally normal around my parents because Im not flying to the peak as you do while smoking.  This is a real benefit to a person in a social setting, but I still dont know for<br>
sure how high I will reach tonight.<br><br>
10:00 - Still not much has changed; I think I feel different (you get the point).  I am eating another brownie that contains ~1/9 an oz of bud.  I also consumed another 5 mg Valium pill.<br><br>
10:15 - Im starting to feel like Im moving up fast, my first brownie must be kicking in. I feel baked already, I cant believe that it hit me so hard in just 15 minutes between 10:00 and 10:15.  I noticed that there is a weird body high that I dont normally experience while smoking.  I feel heavy and feel stuck to my chair I dont even want to move right now.  Walking feels weird, kind of like the Robo walk from a DXM trip.  I feel mentally clear, and this doesnt happen by smoking either!  I am excited of what is next!<br><br>
10:30 -	I am toasted right know I had to lead my friend through the process to log on the internet, and I didnt ever care that I was baked (I believe this is mainly the diazepam that eliminated my paranoia.)  I feel like I am stoned in a more calm way, so you can easily control your self in situations that normal smoking would leave you unprepared.  My mind is a little cloudier and find myself getting off task easily, and looking around a lot.  Typing is harder now, it seems that when if I think about what I am trying to write than it seems harder, so I just let my thoughts flow.<br><br>
Nothing below is proof read for errors to show my intoxication level.<br><br>
10:45 -	The normal Marijuana smoking effects are beginning to show up.  These include the munchies, and cotton mouth.  A real intoxicating body high is present.  I feel like I am pulling my legs along, that is similar to being drunk.  I think the THC and Valium are a synergistic mixture.  I feel so relaxed, and kind of like passing out.  I used the delete key about 50 times during this paragraph, and I skipped a lot of words that belong in the sentence in the way I thought it out.  It is now 10:50 after I completed this journal entry.<br><br>
11:00 -	I am blown out of my mind, I feel all the normal effects with smoking herb, but with eating it acting normal is hard, you just need to go with the flow!  I feel baked, but I still have half stash to eat, so I hope it is cool.  I forgot to mention that trip properties of bud are now beginning to show, I am too fucked up to go in front of my parents without any trouble.<br><br>
11:15 -	I am stuck in the chair in front of my computer.  I tried to get up, but I felt like my but was glued down to it.  I walked around and my vision is blurry like the beginning of a 2nd plateau DXM trip, but I fell like I am swaying around.  A lot of the movements I make seem to be done without thinking they flow together.  Typing is easy if you dont have to think about what you are writing, or I always screw up my wording.<br><br>
11:18 -	I feel like passing out for awhile.  Totally blown, not like the time I smoked ¼ oz last year.  (It took me over 6 minutes to right this sentence!)<br><br>
12:00 - Im having closed eye visuals, ones that you dont get from<br>
smoking, I really enjoy eating the buds more because of the high, and I hate the feeling in your mouth while you smoke.<br><br>
Sunday 9:00 a.m.<br><br>
I still feel different; I have the same feeling of when I began to feel the brownies last night.  I remembered that while I was sleeping I felt a buzzing sensation throughout my entire body.  My vision was buzzing/blinking slightly also.  It was a slight trip while I was laying on my bed, nothing intense enough to scare anyone, but I never finished the entire ½ oz, only a ¼.  I saved the rest for my DXM trip tonight.  I kind of regret taking too much diazepam because I passed out before the peak of the experience, but even before my peak the experience was very intense and nothing like smoking pot! I feel like moving around a lot when I smoke pot, but while eating it I just want to chill in one spot and not do anything!<br><br>
11:30 -	I feel like I have a little hangover, or maybe because I need to eat.  It was from the 15 mg of Valium I should have stayed with five or ten.  (I only weigh 135)  I was actually planning on doing 600 mg of DXM tonight, but I might not be able to if this headache lasts all day.  Just smelling my last two brownies makes me want to puke!<!-- End Body -->
