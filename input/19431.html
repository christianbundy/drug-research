I got some calea from an herb shop, 5.75 for 30 grams which I found would be very nice if the effects were good.  I was excited about it because of my lack of dreaming, or remembering my dreams.  I also have an intestinal disorder and the indians used this to help people with these problems.<br><br>
I smoked a small bowl to test out the taste.  The taste was wretched at first, but I found if I take light slow hits the intensity of the taste lessens. I immediatly felt quite relaxed.  I noticed the relaxation effect is most appreciated if I lay down for a bit, especially if I close my eyes, not to sleep but just for meditation.  After the first bowl I actually fell over after I got off my bed because my legs were so relaxed.<br><br>
Before I went to bed I smoked another bowl and layed down to sleep.  When I sleep I think too much so I always focus on visuals seen from meditation to get my minds off things. While I was on calea the visuals were very vivid, and random visuals out of the blue would pop up, and very detailed ones at that.  The best visual I saw was a wall and a creepy Mexican Indian priest moved around the corner.  Unbelievably detailed, I ripped opened my eyes in terror.<br><br>
When I woke up in the morning I could not remember any of my dreams, or if I had dreamed.  I was thinking about things and remembered an event from the night before.  Then I realized the event never happened and it WAS a dream from that night and now I remember dreaming it and having dreams most of the night. The dream I remember was just me and my friends sitting in a room. It was so lucid that I actually thought it was real the next day.<br><br>
Today I smoked a rolled cigarrete with my friend.  Thats definitly better than using a pipe.  He noticed the relaxation also.<br><br>
Overall, this is a great herb, cheap and I receive good effects from it. <br><br>
From reading and slight experience I believe the proper dose is to smoke some and when you lie down to sleep, if you can't feel your heart beating, then you probably haven't smoked enough.<br><br>
This herb has definitly gotten some bad slack, probably from people who just like getting 'messed up' from substances.<!-- End Body -->
