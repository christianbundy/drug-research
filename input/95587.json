 "report": "</p>\nI'm writing in about my experience of the interaction between Effexor (Venlafaxine) and Cannabis.</p><p>* HowWellDocumented: I'm alive and well - does that count?</p><p>* Description:  I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg since September 2010. </p><p>I have no diagnosis but it floats around depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Soon after getting used to the meds a few weeks I started smoking again. I did experience a few episodes of extreme nausea and puking. I would feel dizzy first, then puke. This happened maybe four times, and I only ever puked again from including booze later, but have since gotten used to this as well. </p><p>My point here is that the interaction is going to depend on your personal combination of genetics and your tolerance levels. I want to add that I have skipped one day of the pill recently and by the evening I was having those brain zaps/shivers/waves in my head and it was awful. Awkward, like holding an odd box. I am tempted to think the Effexor is more dangerous than the weed...</p>"
