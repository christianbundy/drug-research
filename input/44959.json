 "report": "</p>\n1100mg of DOB-Dragonfly was dissolved in 1ml of ethanol that was then poured into 21mls of distilled water. This allowed each ml of liquid to contain 50 micrograms of the substance.</p><p>The equivalent of 750micrograms was taken at 4:10pm. Here's what happened.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Here's what happened in detail:</p><p>T+3 hours. Something feels different, but I'm not sure what.</p><p>T+6 hours. Is anything going to happen? I'm not even thinking in a tripped out way. It's just normal me. Should I take the last bit in the vain hope that it will make me trip out? Or will it just keep me in this boring state for a longer? I decided against taking the rest.</p><p>T+8 hours I watch tales from the trip side. Its as bad as this trip. But it makes me want some 2c-t-special-G. Am I tripping? Nope. How do I feel? I'm dreading the next few hours when TV turns into infomercials and bible shows. And to top it off my girlfriend has a friend over so I can't do anything else other than lay in bed. I feel just like when I've had some meth and the fun has worn off and all I want is to sleep. Let me sleep damn you drug! ARGGH</p><p>T+14 hours I think I fell asleep.</p><p>T+24 hours. I definitely fell asleep. Slight headache. Other than that, I feel ok. Can I remember last night? Every boring detail.</p><p>In short, 750micrograms was not enough to do anything noticable to me, but it did keep me awake and extremely bored.</p><p>I'd like to up the dosage  but this is such a rare chem, that I doubt I will get the chance again...</p>"
