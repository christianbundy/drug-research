I had taken acid one time before this and experienced very little results.  The reason being is that i thought for sure this would be exactly like mushrooms.  Where my mind is gone and my body feels as if it can go on for days.  However i just recently dropped 3 hits of some decent acid bought from a friend to try and see if it would actually work.  <br><br>
I took it at around 6:00 pm outside with one of my friends.  These doses take a lot longer to kick in than any other ones that we can aquire here so it was about 9:00 before i could really say that it hit me. Also i had taken 2 E pills at about 7 because i was trying to have them peak at around the same time.  <br><br>
So at around 9 my mdma was fully peaked.  And i was very dissapointed in the acid because not much had really been going on.  Then all of a sudden i got the feeling that something was different. This wasnt psilocybin, it was acid.  I finally realized how acid worked.   While tripping (extremely hard) i realized that acid only goes as far as I will let it go.  Visuals arent just laid out in front of me, I have to actually try to make the drug work.  And when I do, I can trip as hard and as long as I want.  There is no limit when I'm on acid.  <br><br>
So throughout the rest of the trip there were crazy cartoons, peoples faces, and images on the wall flowing and morphing at my amazment.  This drug truly does hold a place in my heart.  And im am glad to say that i am enlightened now because of a little piece of paper that i dropped in my mouth.<!-- End Body -->
