It was near Christmas and my choral group was putting on a concert for some local women's club.<br><br>
Afterward's a friend of mine asked me if I wanted some OC's.  I said sure.  He sold me the Oxy for 15 dollars and threw in a free 10mg morphine tablet.<br><br>
He told me to take them both at the same time, he said the feeling was amazing, almost orgasmic.<br><br>
I drove home and at 5pm I took the morphine and snorted the oxycontin.  About 15 minutes later I felt the usual opiate/narcotic laid back feeling.  I am pretty experienced with opiates and narcotics having taken everything from Codeine to percocet to lortab to demerol.  I also smoke top quality marijuana everyday.  30 minutes have passed and I am having trouble walking and concentrating.<br><br>
I want to sleep but I know it will be a waste of good pharmaceuticals.<br><br>
I get something to eat and try to read a book.  This doesnt work so I just sit on my bed enjoying the body tingle and 'sinking through the bed' feeling.<br><br>
1 hour and 30 minutes have now passed and I can barely keep my eyes open.  Finally I pass out.<br><br>
I have some great dreams while out but they are hard to remember.  Opiates give me great dreams. Sam Taylor Coleridge wrote most of his poetry under the influence of opitates.<br><br>
When I finally wake up several hours later I still have the laid back feeling, but nothing too great.<br><br>
Overall I would say it was pretty boring and way too heavy of a dose to enjoy.  All I wanted to do was sleep.<!-- End Body -->
