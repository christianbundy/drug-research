Most heroin users find out how much to snort from the 1st person they do it with.  Usually that's between a 1/4 or less of the bag.  I'm not sure what that weighs out too, but I'm talking about the stamp bags, they are relatively small.<br><br>
The tolerance builds extremely quick, and by the following week are usually up to a full bag.  My friend at the end of her using (which was about 8 to 10 months into it), was sniffing 8 bags at a time to feel the effect that still didn't touch the first time she did it.  But it's just as addicting and gives the same withdrawal.<br><br>
The only upside (if you wanna call it that) is that it's stronger than smoking it.  And the first time people do it, I've heard from many people, the hit is almost as amazing as shooting it.  The hit peaks in about 10 minutes, and stays pretty close to that feeling for a few hours.  Then I still feel relaxed for probably about 8 hours.  <br><br>
After a while, it's almost impossible to get that great feeling.  It just makes me feel normal, even when I increase the dose (unless we're talking like 15-20 bags here, and that can get steep at between $10 or $20 a bag) so I think that's why probably 1/2 the people who sniff it get to shooting it along the line. <br><br>
The bags aren't that strong around here in Pittsburgh lately it seems, so I also believe the bags to have very low purity.  Maybe if it was more pure, people would probably sniff way less.<!-- End Body -->
