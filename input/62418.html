I've been having trouble sleeping for a while, I ran out of Ambien and my doc doesn't want to prescribe it anymore. Over-the-counter sedatives like Doxylamine, Diphenhydramine, Chlor-Trimeton or Valerian make me drowsy, and it takes forever to fall asleep. I don't sleep well, and I feel dazed the next morning. A week ago, I remembered that I still had some Flexeril (10mg cyclobenzaprine) from a car accident. It was prescribed to me as muscle relaxer for the night time. I had a different one, Skelaxin, for the day, which was less sedating. I remembered that the Flexeril really knocked me out.<br><br>
So after almost not sleeping for several days, I took 20 mg around noon. I fell asleep on the couch within minutes, just woke up to eat a bit, fell asleep again, and then even slept the next night. On the next day, I did the same thing the next day, took 20 mg around noon. I slept beautifully. Later that day, I took 30 mg before bed time and slept like a baby again.<br><br>
However, after that, Flexeril hasn't really been able to make me sleep anymore. Now of course I can't use Flexeril to get to sleep anymore, but because I've taken it for a while, I need to taper off it now because otherwise I feel sore. So, for the short time, it was a good alternative to Ambien and way better than OTC sedatives, but it lost most of its potency after just two or three days.<!-- End Body -->
