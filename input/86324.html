Background Info: I am a 20-year-old, 100 lb female. I have smoked marijuana for more than a year, usually 2 or 3 times a week. Before this experience, however, I have not smoked marijuana for more than a month. I bought K2 Summit from a local smoke shop to try since I cant smoke pot anymore because of drug tests. Before this experience I took two small hits of it from a pocket vaporizer for the purpose of making sure I was not allergic or had any immediate negative reactions. This did not make me high at all; they were VERY small hits. So in effect, this experience was my very first time smoking K2. I have read a lot of stories about severe paranoia, cardiovascular problems, and even seizures due to K2, so I planned on not smoking very much for the first time just to be safe and to gauge my bodys reaction and tolerance.<br><br>
The Experience<br><br>
0:00: I put a pinch of K2 Summit into my one-hitter pipe and took two small hits. I felt no immediate effects.<br><br>
0:14: Im sitting here in my bed on my laptop, looking at artwork online. I dont feel much yet, maybe a little bit of a head high, kind-of unfocused and light-headed. Im thinking about trying another hit or two if Im still not feeling much in the next 20 minutes or so.<br><br>
0:35: About five minutes ago I put another pinch into my one hitter and took two more pretty small hits. I dont even know if the first one counted as a hit, though. Im just really worried about doing too much; Ive read some horror stories about K2 online. Since this is really my first time doing it I want to be extra careful to start with just a little until I figure out my tolerance. I also made myself some tea. Lemongrass green tea. And brought some granola up with me. Yum. Im definitely feeling off. Similar to slight marijuana high. What Ive read about K2 made me expect that its ultra-potency made just a couple hits make you really high, but so far it doesnt seem that way. The high is pretty mild. Mostly light-headedness, my visual focus is just a little different, and my mental focusing ability is a little impaired. Its a little bit harder than usual to keep a train of thought, something that is common for me when high off marijuana.<br><br>
0:39: My audio perception seems more refined. Everything seems a little louder and clearer. When I eat granola its so loud. It sounds like crunching rocks in my head.<br><br>
0:52: Still on my computer. I almost feel as if the peak of the high has passed already. At the highest point it was mild at best. Im still definitely feeling a little high, but I guess I didnt smoke enough because its been pretty minimal this whole time.<br><br>
0:57: I mostly feel like I wish I were super baked off marijuana. The high Im feeling is mild enough that its possible that most of it could be psychological due to my expectations. The slight high I do feel does feel good, however, and very similar to an equivalent marijuana high. Theres a little visual/audio distortion, slight light-headedness, difficulty focusing on tasks, slight euphoric effect/happy feeling. No eye redness or increased appetite, probably because of the mildness of the high.<br><br>
1:04: I definitely have a heightened sensitivity to music. Just turned on Deadmou5 Ghosts and Stuff. LOVE this. Electronic music is highly underappreciated. Its so complicated, layered, refined just indescribably incredible. I can feel this music in my whole body.<br><br>
1:45: I listened to Radiohead for a while, and then just jacked around on the Internet. I feel pretty much sober now, but have a headache. Ive never gotten a headache from smoking marijuana. Im going to call this the end of the experience for now.<br><br>
Summary: Overall it was comparable to a mild high from marijuana. A little bit disorienting, light-headedness, decreased ability to mentally focus, lifted mood, slight paranoia, and slight visual distortion. A heightened sensitivity to sound and music seemed the most pronounced of all the effects. I didnt have a dangerous reaction or a frightening experience at all, so Ill probably try it again some other time, but a larger dose. My goal this time wasnt to get super high, but to try a small dose, gauge my tolerance, and see if I liked it. Overall it was enjoyable, so I would like to try again with the goal of getting pretty stoned.<!-- End Body -->
