I initially began use, and provided a glowing recommendation of Kratom as a tool to ease the pain of RX opiate withdrawal. The down side is that it makes me feel great (for a while). As doses begin to edge up, and believe me they do, I teeter about feeling a wee bit strung out. Another issue I noticed is that it can easily increase my physical energy enough that I can run myself readily into the ground. But it is just a plant, not even a 'real' opiate so big deal, I should just be able to stop.<br><br>
Not even close.<br><br>
I've 'withdrawn' from opiates before. The first few days are almost identical to serious hydrocodone withdrawal. But it is days 4-14 that catch me off guard. Fatigue sets in. Followed by 2-3 days 'lost' to relative detachment from my surroundings. Then I am welcomed back by a CRIPPLING depression. And as with most other opiates, I know what would fix the problem. Just a wee pinch of a rather innocuous leaf. Yes I tapered, yes I planned for it, and nonetheless, total devastation.<br><br>
It is the same old story. We should all have the right to feel as good and pleasant, and happy as we do when thoroughly opiated. But that is a fool's venture. We know it can't last. It is not worth it. Use it once and I'll simply be upset that it can't always be that way. Use it for a while, and I'll lose what little contentment I once had. And the worst part is I will know where it went.<br><br>
