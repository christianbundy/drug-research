A good friend of mine procured 100 generic soma tablets from an online pharmacy and the wheels were in motion...<br><br>
Me and a few close associates and fellow drug enthusiasts embarked on what would end up being several nonsequential days of madness. Basically, soma is a vile drug, and tolerance can go up amazingly quick. At first 1 single tablet caused a mellow relaxed feeling, eventually I ended up needing 5 just to notice a slight buzz. When I am in the depths of soma intoxication I am often unaware of just how seriously fucked up I am. Throw alcohol into the equation and you've got a recipe for antisocial debauchery.<br><br>
My comrades and I each took 30 tablets to carry (there were 3 of us) and headed towards a nearby campus bar. We were all taking the tablets as needed and just hanging out, eventually my buddy went to talk to a girl and that's when I saw just how savage things were. He was slurring his speech to rival that of a common mental retard, and along with this there was the peculiar tremors caused his hands to shake. This guy came across like a crazed Jerry's kid with turrets syndrome and some serious brain damage...needless to say he didn't impress the girl. The soma slur and shakes are two very unattractive side effects that each of us experienced.<br><br>
When night fell, we went to another friends house and started drinking apple martinis. The combination would only lead to further embarassment and ruined friendships. I only had a glass of the potion, although my 2 buddies polished off the stuff (a 5th of vodka, and a 5th of apple schnapps) to this day they accuse me of drinking it all! My buddy told the other friend whose house we were at that his girlfriend, who happened to be standing next to him, was ugly and that he should ditch her. We left soon after.<br>
After the beverages were drank we did what most intoxicated guys do when bored, try and get some action. We all went over to the frats and hit up a party, where I lost one of my pals. He later reported awakening in the shrubbery outside a local middle-school. When the party got weak the rest of us went to hang with some girls at their dorm, and trouble insued. <br><br>
Anyways, long story short we aren't welcome at the girl's dorm anymore.<!-- End Body -->
