 "report": "</p>[Erowid Note: 'Bath salts' and similar products generally do not list ingredients or dosage on their packaging. Analysis has revealed that ingredients in a single product of this type may vary over time.]  </p><p>BACKGROUND: I was a heavy/chronic meth user for 6 years. I have been mostly sober for a year and a half, having used only a very small amount a couple of times during this period.</p><p>EXPERIENCE:</p><p>I tried some 8 Ballz bath salt. I understand why people would use it as a legal alternative to meth, because it is probably the closest thing they will find. It causes the same 'amp' as coke and meth while still producing a similar mental high or euphoria as meth that I don't get from coke.</p><p>HOWEVER:</p><p>The main problem I found with it is that I get pounding headaches immediately upon use that I don't get with meth. Also, I had serious restless leg syndrome, and was much more overheated/sweaty after using bath salts than meth. The good effects don't seem to last as long as meth's. And then of course there is the crash.</p><p>USE AGAIN?:</p><p>I think the only way I would use this again is if I had a serious craving for meth and just needed to 'scratch the itch' and snort something similar.</p>"
