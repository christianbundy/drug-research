Three of us came together to share a sacrament of Salvia.  Consumption method was smoking dried leaf via a water pipe.  One person wasn't sufficiently used to operating a water pipe, and experienced mild euphoria.  The other received five hits on three bowls and reported visual symmetry and shifts in relative gravity, as well as experiencing a parade of colored squares which arranged themselves into a cube structure around them.  <br><br>
I received five hits on three bowls as well, and experienced a 'background' musical harmonic and visions of DNA formation.  It was as though each side of the pair were giant walls, off which bounced photons, which swirled in eddying waves in symmetry with the helix of DNA.  I believe this is part of an 'electromagnetic' functioning of DNA, where the actual coding of information is as holographic information.  I also remembered that these images were as a memory to me - something I remember seeing as a baby. (or pre-birth?)<!-- End Body -->
