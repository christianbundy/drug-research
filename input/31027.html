A friend of mine offered me a couple oxycodones for a reasonable price, and I was a little curious.  I'd considered trying oxycontin several weeks prior and decided not to, mainly because it involved taking a time release pill or crushing one, and I didn't want anything that strong.  <br><br>
The next afternoon, I ate a single 10 mg table (they said WATSON on them and then the 3-number code for watson 10 mg oxy, I looked it up before I ingested).  My reading on here led me to believe this would be a weak dose, and I almost took two.<br><br>
After an hour I wasn't really feeling much at all, so I smoked a little.  This gave me a very mild body buzz, so I figured 'hell with it' and slammed a 12 oz molson.  That was probably a mistake.<br><br>
Ten minutes later I was literally too wasted to do anything.  I decided to watch a TV show on my computer, and I felt pretty good until it ended, but then I didn't know what to do.  I'd go into the bathroom and look at how fucked up and swweaty I was and freak out, and then I'd sit back down on the couch and decide I felt wonderful.  <br><br>
And so for the next three hours, this sine wave existed, of flashing back and forth between feeling wonderful and feeling like absolute worthless junk.  I never felt physically ill, but when I closed my eyes everything got 'choppy', I would immediatly become unable to think about anything other than how wasted I was and how much I wished it would stop.  Then I'd 'sine wave' back up, and feel like it was a good feeling again, like a really really strong hydrocodone buzz.<br><br>
What bothered me the most was that even though the experience was neutral at best and hellish at its worst, for the next week at least, every day I would consider taking another oxy, even though the logical part of my brain knew I wouldn't really enjoy it.  I understand how people can get hooked on this stuff, and that sounds, to me, like a fate worse than death, literally.  I still enjoy my vicodin here and there, but my advice to anyone is, don't mess with oxy in any form unless it's prescribed to you for a medical purpose, this is NOT a 'fun' drug.  I don't really know how much the single beer amplified the effects, but I don't really aim on ever finding out, either.<!-- End Body -->
