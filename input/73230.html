I wanted to start out writing this as describing who I am but you are not me and I am not you...I am I. I and I share a universal conscious that exists based on fear and love. I am accepted by nature and Love and distracted by man and Fear. <br><br>
I could dwell much further but the internet is just a tool to show off what we as energy beings find out about ourself and feel we must share with other beings of conscious around us. <br><br>
-----  These type of thoughts ran through my head during my whole trip ----<br><br>
I snorted what I think was close to 20 mg but might have been more like 30 mg. I started out my ascension by walking on an outside mall in a grayish dusk setting. I am very familiar with this setting which is funny when I started to trip out and feel as if strangers could sense what I sensed, but just like when I'm on pot I was wrong or paranoid. BUT that feeling went away as I approached my friend that was picking me up. <br><br>
T+ 40? I hadn't even peaked yet and I had already lost sense of time......LOVE IT. I am not fond of the invention time and thus realized it was going to be a good trip. My friends and I drove what was 30 or 40 minutes probably to a party that was going to be full of fellow high school alumni. The car ride was amazing yet different at times. The rush of going 55 mph felt like a rocket ship and I saw little green, blue, and red eyes spiraling to the center point of where I was gazing out the window. I then realized visual and music were going to be my friend. <br><br>
When I got to the party almost immediately I encountered inebriated drunks who seemed to be pitiful to me. They were drinking this man-made shitty beer that was an attack on the mind rather than an expansion of my individual conscious. Many people who found out I was the only guy there on hallucinogenics began asking if I was okay or tried to fuck with me, but in my advanced state I wanted to ask the drunks if they were okay because they were acting like dumb fools who want to drink modified crap that makes them forget their fun nights rather than cherish them and learn.<br><br>
T+ 11:00 I can't right anymore because my trip lasted for very long. I stayed up all night and luckily people at the parties I go to are late goers so I was never lonely. BUT through out the whole party I felt a sense of waves. Waves of desire to run out into the field of the house I was at and sit and pander and appreciate just 'being.' I furthered my ever present thought of universal Love. I felt like a wise man and it's because I was. Thoughts and puzzle pieces were connecting and I was gaining touch with who I am and what I truly desire.<br><br>
I could feel who my 'friends' really were in my eyes. I felt that I have to stop being fake to them and just not hang out with many of them because their lifestyle and thought patterns just don't mix with mine the way I feel they can. All of the people their are still distracted by marketing and CULTure. this drug helped me discover SO many things about myself, about life, and about death. <br><br>
LIFE CHANGING!!! So many different aspects of this trip. Hallucinating, self reflection, intelligent conversing, lifestyle changes, I felt emotions that I didn't know existed. All I could do was sigh with compassion. Fuck alcohol parties and crappy food. Psychedelics and nourishment of the soul are my choice in a night.<!-- End Body -->
