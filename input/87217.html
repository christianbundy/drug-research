This is a quick summary of the time line of a 16 mg. 4-HO-MIPT trip with some material that is roughly 6 years old. I'm very familiar and experienced with the classic psychedelics as well as a host of other natural and synthetically derived hallucinogens, having been using psychedelics for a couple decades now.  This, however, was only the second time I've tried 4-HO-MIPT. The first time was about 5 years ago at a 12 mg. dose along with piracetam and choline supplements taken a couple hours before dosing.  I recall it being rather pleasant, rather like Psilocybin mushrooms with the high/slightly intoxicated head space, with similar visuals and a short duration. This time I again took roughly two grams of piracetam along with choline and ALCAR about an hour before dosing.  The 4-HO-MIPT was weighed on a milligram scale and ingested in a jell cap roughly one hour after a regular sized dinner.  I note the jell cap and the dinner as these may have caused the drug to come on much slower than if I had taken it on an empty stomach mixed in juice.  <br><br>
Time<br><br>
0:00 -  16 mg. 4-HO-MIPT weighed on a mg. scale swallowed in a jell capsule<br><br>
1:20 - I can feel the trip starting to come on at this point, somewhat subtle but definitely there and increasing. <br><br>
1:39 - There has been a very rapid come up over the past twenty minutes.  I go take a warm shower so that I'll feel clean and refreshed for the trip.  <br><br>
2:10 - tripping steadily since 1:45 without much of an increase in intensity or the strength of the trip or visuals from that time, it seems to have plateaued.  <br><br>
3:45 - still tripping quiet nicely.  No overt OEVs, general color enhancement, shifting and morphing surfaces and patterns when looked at, some nice CEV when I don't focus on it.  Very nice head high, yet fairly clear thinking and sex was wonderful on the material.  Physical sensation is simply lush.  <br><br>
4:30 - still tripping, not sure if it's letting up yet or if I'm just used to it by now, feeling rather sleepy although it's not very late for me.  <br><br>
5:34 - much of the intoxicated/high feeling is gone by now, a little of the tripping feel persists but I feel like I could go to sleep.  I toss around for maybe another half hour before drifting off to a good sleep.  Woke up the next morning refreshed with no lingering feeling.   <br><br>
Although I recall this chemical being more visual the last time I tried it, it was still rather effective after 5-6 years of being stored in a dark, dry 50-70 degree environment. To me it feels very much like mushrooms with the slightly intoxicated high head space, yet thinking and communication flow easily without impairment.  The body feeling is very similar to mushrooms as well, without the stomach issues common with ingesting P. cubensis.   All in all this was a very enjoyable trip that was easy to fit in the evening without being up all night.  I'm often hardheaded with tryptamines so this dose may be more intense for others; I think I'll try 20 mg. next time to go deeper with this one.<!-- End Body -->
