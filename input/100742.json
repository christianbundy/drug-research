 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nLet me start by saying that I am a fairly experienced user of psychidelics, and many other substances. I have done LSD, psilocybin cubensis, DXM, prescription painkillers like oxycontin etc. \r\nAnyways, here is my setting. I was at my local cemetery because is it seriously enormous.\r\nT+ 0:00 Inserted tab in my lower lip. I did not taste the tab unless I touched the tab w/ my tongue. Very bitter.\r\nT+ 0:15 Starting to feel my eyes tingle, and if I stared at the trees, my vision would slightly move, but probably placebo.\r\nT+ 0:45 I start to feel a little anxious and happy at the same time. The clouds in the sky were starting to move in waves. The trees would extend, and then shrink. I started to feel very sweaty and my skin turned a little red.\r\nT+ 1:00 Holy shit. Everything a extremely bright, and seeing patterns flashing before my eyes. When I stare at something it would look like it would dry out and there would be more detail from just staring at the concrete. I decided to leave the cemetery and ride my bike around my neighborhood.\r\nT+ 1:30 I am very sweaty, so I head to my house where the A/C is on full blast and I drink some iced tea. Everything has a slight chemical after taste. I lay on my bed, and my ceiling, TV, posters, and walls are turning blue and every inch of anything I look at would swirl and move in its own direction. I would only see it in my peripherals because there is a swirling pattern of blue, purple, and teal. Wow.\r\nT+ 1:45 I have stopped sweating and go ride my bike around my neighborhood, then meet a friend at the cemetery who was tripping on LSA. My whole body was tingling, I feel like I want to move constantly. Everything is morphing into each other and swirling different colors. This seriously is amazing.\r\nT+ 3:00 I feel as I have hit the plateau of my trip. My skin is red, I am very sweaty, and I still cannot stop smiling. I begin rambling nonsense to my friend, my speech is just like, 'This hard is tripping making me.' Nothing else too significant happens except patterns and morphing.\r\nT+ 5:00 I am still slightly tripping. Visuals are still going on, but I have calmed down and just watched TV, enjoying the A/C.\r\nAll in all, this shit is almost as good as 2 - 3 hits of acid if not as good. I had to take an Ambien to fall asleep because I was still rather awake. Next day I felt a little anxious, and I ate so much food because I did not eat much during my trip. This is something I can do every week if I could.\n\n\n"
