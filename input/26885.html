I acquired some so called 'e' pills from a dealer and went about looking them up online. This being my first time experimenting with E I decided to look my pills up and make sure I wasn't getting into some meth or coke. I was lucky because my pills and 2 designs on each side and little blue speckles. I found an exact match under sunflower and to my surprise it only contained MDA. At first I was bummed but then looked up MDA online only to find that this substance was as magical as MDMA.<br><br>
Substances taken before:<br>
5-HTP pills(50mg) I took 2 every 2 hours or so leading up to the trip. So in all about 6.<br>
1/4mg klonopin about 30 mins before. I get very nervous before trips and it often makes me want to yack. 1/4mg helps nicely.<br><br>
People joining me:<br>
My girlfriend, Who we call E(coincidence)<br>
My buddy, B(a very experienced tripper)<br>
A few people meet around my college campus<br><br>
Set and Setting:<br>
College campus. Very friendly people about. A thursday night, so we trried to avoid the drunkards.<br>
We also spent time in the car and in wal-mart.<br>
Mostly spent in dorm rooms.<br><br>
Mindset:<br>
Feel pretty good about life and I am not on any medications.<br><br>
The trip:<br>
Well it was about 9:40 and me and E decided to take our doses. I turn on Wish You were Here and move about the room. I'm a little anxious but E is not at all. I decide we should take a walk around the beautiful campus(because it is fall, and there is a nice chill in the air). E accepts and we begin to discuss our weeks as we head over to B's dorm room. We find him at about 10pm and he knows somthing is up because we look like we are up to something. He asks if we have been smoking,but I tell him the real deal. He is excited because he loves to get invovled in trips. We move into his room and we begin to talk about MDA. At about 10:15 it hits hard. BOOM it is on for me. The lights are changed from about 10 mins ago. They seem to be shining brighter and have a bit of a blue hue to them.<br><br>
E feels nothing at this point. I can't stop moving around and I feel a feeling that I cannot describe. Nothing like tryptamines or acid. B decides we should go look for some glowsticks at wal-mart. I'm intrigued because wal-mart is a trippy place to begin with. E says she feels a little different and we head to the car. The walk there is AMAZING. I can feel the cool wind flowing over my body and the lights look incredible. I feel an inner sense of peace and trust toward my peers. I also feel connected with life in general(ie. The trees,small animals.<br><br>
The Car. This are very strange in the sense I have never felt like this. I get into the car and I'm really overwhelmed at this point. I feel like 4hits of acid overwhelmed. I puke out the car window.  (we are not moving yet) Things seem to be spinning around and the colors are SO bright and vivid. I'm sweating and I'm moving around the car when I calm down. B gives me some water and I drink. We get back in the car and turn on some J5. WOW. Its like I hear music for the first time, or I have sex for the first time. Music is pure bliss! I rock my head back and forth and feel chilled out. We start driving and the cool air from the windows are wonderful. We all sing aloud and listen to some loud J5. E has peaked as well. I think it is about 11pm at this point.<br><br>
The wal-mart is SO crazy!! There are strange colors everywhere and I do not know what to think at all. B looks for glowsticks while me and E run about and dance around. B starts to yell out pscyedelic mumbo jumbo(phrases that mean nothing) and begins to talk in german. Atlast we find glowsticks and we buy about 4 packs. We also get some gum. B deals with the money and the cashier gives us strange looks and starts to laugh. We tell her that she is awesome and we leave.<br><br>
We listen to some groovin beatles on the way back and chew on some gum. Still feeling wonderful. We create some small talk but the music is still to interesting to get invovled in our serious empathetic feelings.<br><br>
We get back to the room and I break open the glowsticks. At this point I notice trails on the glowsticks. B has some blacklights and several black light paints. I ask B to paint me with black light paints. He agrees and E also gets invovled in painting me. He turns on some assorted music. (easy listening, more beatles and some other 60's era music) Electronic music is not really very enjoyable at this point. The paints look AWESOME. I'm not so overwhelmed by the MDA at this point and we begin to talk VERY openly. We discuss B's love life and the fact that he can sometimes be a womanizer. We also discuss me and E's relationship and our plans for the future. (note. Me and E have been dating for around a year and are very much in love at this point). We discuss marriage and we also get invovled group hugs. We each play the songs that help us feel the best when we are down. B picks Simple Man and I pick a song of Neil Young's new one. I also choose Melissa by the Allman Bros. I don't remember E picking anything at all. We hug somemore and decide to walk back to E's dorm room.<br><br>
I would say that it is about 2am at this point and I feel a decrease in the experience. We enter E's room witha friend J(female)and we put on some happy music and start to talk. J feels a buzz of the situation and becomes more open as well. We discuss her trtoubled love life and we all agree things are looking up now for her. I feel far more open at this point. My defenses are down and we proceed to discuss very openly, how we feel about our lives in general.<br><br>
Coming Down. <br>
At about 3am me and emily are smiling and cuddling with each other when I start to feel a little anxious. I get into some thought loops and I decide that I want to fall asleep. I take 1/2mg klonopin and drink some red wine. 1-2 glasses. I quickly pass out in a very euphoric state. E falls asleep a little later.<br><br>
The next morning.<br>
Boy I feel spent. I need SUGAR! I take some 5-HTP and head over to harris teeter to buy a big loaf of italian bread and some powerade. I eat and feel much better. I feel different for the next day or so. After that I feel baseline.<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
I felt that MDA was very helpful for me. It allowed me to openly discuss things and I don't feel that it was hedonistic or just a feel great drug. I don't think that it changed me, but I feel that I will keep a small part of the experience in my mind and try to be more open at times when I think I should be. I think that I will use this substance again in the future. I feel that Mushrooms and MDA may be a good mix.<br><br>
Note: I feel I came on faster because I had taken 5-htp all day before the trip.<!-- End Body -->
