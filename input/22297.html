Although my parents are against me using drugs because of my mental illness (I am schizo-affective), I have found that hallucinogens help me clear up a lot of issues that I have having a psychotic disorder.<br><br>
When I found out my 12 year old brother was smoking pot, I decided to intervene. Rather than lecture him, I decided that the best thing to do was to show him how to handle the new experience. One day he confided in me that he had some weed and I basically said, 'Well, let's go smoke it.' He was very suprised that his rather protective older brother actually suggested that we do drugs together. This was not my first time smoking with family members, I had smoked pot with my cousins a few years earlier.<br><br>
I am very glad to see that other families also share in the experience of psychoactives. Hallucinogens play a major role in my life and I strongly believe that the world would be a better place if families learned to share their experiences.<br><br>
