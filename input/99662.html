Preface:<br>
I am a young man with a fair amount of psychedelic experience.<br><br>
4-AcO-DMT was made by Albert Hofmann (quite rationally imo; chemically 4-AcO-DMT::Psilocin as Heroin::Morphine as ASA (Aspirin)::Salicyclic Acid etc...) after the discovery of psylocybin/psilocin. Numerous prior experiences with cubes had made me interested in this acetylated version of the substance. This is my first experience with the material.<br><br>
The Experience:<br><br>
1 gel-tab containing 10-12mg 4-AcO-DMT was ingested. About ten minutes later mild colors began appearing and a sense of aural calmness. ten minutes later I notice time has began to slow (about 30-50% perhaps) and I feel a sense of body load building. I am listening to music comfortably enjoying the experience floating nicely to a mental ++/body +++. <br><br>
About 45 minutes after dosing I looked around and suddenly realized my mind was very lucid considering the body load I was experiencing. After the realization the body load eased down to ++ and I remained in a powerfully relaxed state. An hour after the inital dose I feel that I would be able to handle more. Knowing the fairly steep dosage-response curve, I ingest another half gel-tab (~5-6mg).<br><br>
Fifteen or twenty minutes after the supplement dose I feel the effects coming on and float up to a overall +++ for a brief time. Effects continue for 3-4 more hours tapering slowly taking very similar form to my experiences with mushrooms. I sleep and wake up the next morning earlier than usual (good thing) feeling invigorated and ready for the day.<br><br>
Sum Up:<br><br>
The dosage I took would be approximately comparable to 1.5-2g of shrooms. Maybe it's BS But it was like I could feel the material being metabolized (deacetylated); and once it had the effects were indistinguishable from psilocybin mushrooms. On a note about the difference between 4-AcO-DMT and psilocybin, before they are metabolized (on the come up) I find psilocybin to have a cartoony/ancient feeling, where as the 4-AcO-DMT had more of a sparkly/modern feeling.<!-- End Body -->
