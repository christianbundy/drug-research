 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've been interested in trying Morning Glory Seeds for awhile, but the consistent report of nausea has made me wary.  From reading other people's experiences they seemed to get nausea regardless of how they ingested it.  After reading more online, I found that this was likely due to small traces of cyanide found in the seed shells.  <br>It seemed to me, people who ingested the seeds on an empty stomach had the best luck with avoiding longer periods of nausea and vomiting.<br>Today I finally decided to give it a try, so I gave it a low dose test run, chewing 1.5g of seeds.  My reason for a this was just to make sure my body responded well enough to the substance.  I had eaten a bowl of cereal about two hours before.  I ate a hot pocket and a banana an hour after chewing the seeds.  <br>Other than very mild cramps and not so mild gas, I felt fine.  I noticed very slight visual movement when looking at patterns.  Walking felt good. My legs were stimulated and a bit tingly.  Emotional effects were present, but not strong.  My mood definitely felt different, but I couldn't determine how so.  <br>I will be increasing the dose probably later tonight to 4g.  Until then, I will refrain from eating, so that my stomach is empty.\n\n\n"
