Less than two weeks ago I found myself barely making it out of a mandatory stay at the local mental institution because of an 'overdose' of Alprazolam (Xanax). <br><br>
The situation is described below.<br><br>
At approximately 9:45 PM I consumed 26 0.5mg Alprazolam tablets in less than 5 minutes, with a cummlative dosage equivilant to 13 mg (oral). After which, I remember very little for around 15-18 hours beyond consuming the medication. My parents found me passed out across a desk in which I had been sitting at approximately 3:00 AM that morning. I showed signs of being excessively drunk, although I had no problem telling them the truth (which I otherwise would have conceiled), which was that I had taken an excessive dosage of Alprazolam. <br><br>
At approximately 9:00 AM that morning, I woke up, and was taken to the local general physician. I told many 'secrets' during this time (information I would have otherwise conceiled). Even thoughts that I had kept personal for a decade or more were revealed to members of my family. After taking a trip from the general physician to a psychiatrist nearly 80 miles away, I was admitted to the ER around 4:00 PM. It was not until approximately 5:00 PM that I became fully aware of the situation I was in. Luckily, I was able to regain a train of thought, and was able to avoid being admitted to the psychiatric ward by telling the doctors that I had only taken 6 additional tablets to my normal dosage (obviously, not the truth). They were not aware of the whole situation, and allowed me to leave shortly afterwards.<br><br>
No other substances, other than one beer at approximately 5:45 PM the day I had consumed the pills, was involved in this incident.<br><br>
The best way to describe the feeling of the incident was a 'zombie' like state, with memory lapses far greater than any other substance I have previously used. It was very difficult to realize the entire situation until 30+ hours after the Alprazolam had been consumed. I must also mention that I have been an Alprazolam user (by prescription) for over a year now, with a regular daily dosage of 1.5 - 2.0 mg (oral). <br><br>
The effects of this medication were much much different at a high dosage of 13mg than they were at 2mg. It wasn't simply a greater 'enhancement' of the effects, but an entirely different experience. Not a good one to add to the book in my eyes!<!-- End Body -->
