 "report": "<p>I obtained 28g of Syrian Rue seeds and 28g of Mimosa Hostilis root-bark through ebay. I wanted to make enough for 3 people, and I decided on a dose of 3g of syrian rue and 8g of mimosa. Since I didnt have a scale, I used the highly scientific method of halving to get 3g of syrian rue. I dumped out the package, halved to 14, halved to 7, halved to 3.5, and then took away a little bit. For the mimosa, I just removed a large piece of bark and hoped it was about 4g. </p><p>I was too lazy to boil two things at once, so I put both ingredients in a coffee grinder, grounded the syrian rue to dust, and the bark to stringy fibers and put it in water with 500mg of Vitamin C. I put it on a slow boil for 20 min, let it cool, and strained the whole thing through a shirt. I added more water to the goop left over and boiled for 10 more min. I strained it again. I was left with about 25 oz of ugly brown liquid. I boiled it on high for about 30 min until I was left with about 11 oz of the liquid. I poured it into 6 shot glasses. 2 per person. </p><p>We waited until it cooled and then dosed at 4:15. It tastes like shit so we chased with OJ. I had only eaten some yogurt that day, and we all had maintained a diet appropriate for maois for the past 24 hrs. </p><p>Jon downed both within a minute. Josh and I had one shot glass each and waited. </p><p>T+00:17 - 4:32 - Jon pukes 7 times. Josh and I dont finish the rest of ours because we are pussies. We had about half of our decided dose, so about 1.5g of Syrian Rue and 4g of mimosa hostilis. </p><p>I am extremely nauseous from t+30 to t+2:00. I try to puke, but cant. After two hours, dizziness is gone. I feel fine, my stomach is a little upset, but it might be from not eating. I have a hamburger. None of us have any effects. We all feel completely normal.</p><p>Two lessons from this story: If you puke too soon, you wont get any effects. If you dont have enough, you wont feel any effects.</p>"
