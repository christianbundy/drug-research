I had been on a long binge with marijuana and hashish, and, slowly being bored of the experiences, decided to try another drug.  Rather than take the next step into hallucinogens or stimulants, I bought a sampler pack of herbal joints.  Among other things, the sampler contained a joint of Calea Zacatechichi.  I did some heavy research on the effects and side effects of the plant, and decided that I had nothing to fear from it (I'm tend to get easily freaked out and nauseous when on drugs and like to know what I'm in for).<br><br>
The day of taking it, I made sure to get plenty of physical activity in so that I would get a relaxing sleep.  Before I could take the Calea, a friend invited me to smoke some pot with him.  He had recently purchased a strain of weed that gave more of a body high and induced more lethargy than mental creativity.  Around 11:30 PM, I began to feel sleepy and decided that it would be a good time to try the Calea.<br><br>
The joint stayed lit easily and the smoke was smooth, but that didn't matter at all to me.  The flavor from the smoke was absolutely putrid.  Now I knew that the tea tasted bad and had to be adulterated, but the flavor from the Calea smoke was only comparable to a combination of fresh dirt, lighter fluid, and raw sewage.  Every puff had to be followed by a large swig of water and a few seconds of fresh air.  I stopped at one point and said to myself, 'This is the Leaf of God... The Chontal Indians have been smoking and drinking it for years and years.  I can put up with one bleeding joint.' The joint was larger than I had expected (it was one of those cone types) and I felt I had smoked enough by the time it was a little more than halfway down.  I went back inside, brushed, flossed, etc, and laid down to sleep.  <br><br>
It was summer and, not being in school, I was sleeping-in and going to sleep late.  I laid in bed, tossing and turning, focusing on things I wanted to dream about for hours and hours.  I had gone through countless sexual fantasies in my head, trying to push my dreams in that direction.  I think I finally got to sleep sometime around 3:00 AM. My dreams were more vivid than they had ever been before.  I could recall the entire sequence of events, complete with useless details.  I won't bore you with the dream itself, but it was something along the lines of me, in pink bellbottoms, at a party in Tijuana where Margaret Cho showed up to tell stories and ended up boring people away.<br><br>
Though I wouldn't dare try to interpret the meaning of such a dream, I am infinitely grateful to the Calea for allowing me to experience such a vivid dream.<!-- End Body -->
