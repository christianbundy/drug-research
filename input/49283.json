 "report": "<p>I have got no problems with my brain (just little bit hyperactive), but I was curious about expirience with some Smart drug. First day, morning, dosage 2400 mg. For about hour nothing, but than I started to feeling weak euphoria. Few minutes later my mood shifted to weak anxiety. This switching of moods lasted about an hour and a half. Than it disappeared. </p><p>The same happened after my lunch and afternoon dosage. Between times of effects I was feeling more normal. This was the same for about four days. Than I started to feel strange for the whole day. Worse concentration, problems falling asleep, everything seemed less real to me, I was tired (effects were weak, but sometimes not so pleasant). I found it similar to low dosages of alcohol. Maybe was problem in me, maybe that I was not taking lecithin, but I am glad that I tried it...</p>"
