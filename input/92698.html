I was at a party with my girlfriend and I did not have any bud, so I bought some synthetics called 'Diamond Dove'. I arrived at the party and I started to drink some vodka. I was drunk and had ran out of alcohol. I wasnt satisfied of how fucked up I was so I took out my Diamond Dove and packed a bowl. I had only taken 2 hits and about 10 seconds later I had felt the following: <br><br>
-my heart beat was 3 beats per second, at 180bpm, 2nd degree hypertension. <br><br>
-I was leaning sideways when walking and all sounds echoed strongly<br><br>
-my vision would pulse everytime my heart beated<br><br>
-my vision was extremely swirly like a horizontal S and moved not stop like a wave.<br><br>
-my reaction time a about 5 seconds <br><br>
-I collapsed on the balcony against the railing and was in aw when looking at        everyone staring at me <br><br>
-many people tried to help me but I kicked them away because I thought they were going to kill me<br><br>
-I was screaming at the top of my lungs 'go away!' <br><br>
-my speech was slurred to where it would only be mumbles and grunts (I was actually trying to say a full sentence)<br><br>
-I had sat on the railing for about 15 to 30 mins<br><br>
-when my girlfriend tried for 15 mins to get me up and to the car so she could help<br><br>
-when I had gotten up I fell again<br><br>
-eventually she got me up and literally was holding my whole body up<br><br>
-I punched her in the face leaving her with a black eye (she told me that the next morning because I did not remember)<br><br>
-I passed out in the car<br><br>
-woke up in the car near my house with my best friend in the drivers seat<br><br>
-I tried with all I had to just move my arm and when I did I threw up from the movement <br><br>
-I got the bed spins in the car and passed out again. <br><br>
- 2hrs had passed and my heart rate had not decreased<br><br>
- I had a seizure (yes a real seizure) and my friend had to help me <br><br>
-they had spent 30 mins to get me out of the car but I would refuse.<br><br>
-stumbled inside and luckily no one was home<br><br>
- passed out on my bed <br><br>
-woke up and I did not remember a single thing (not exaggerating, and my memory had come to me weeks later)<br><br>
The day after that night I had gone out with my friends and smoked more, geeking about what had happened. You can never stop a true stoner from smoking.<!-- End Body -->
