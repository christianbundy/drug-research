Recently I've been trying out a number of rare, legal and herbal highs. It started off as a spiritual endeavor but if I'm realistic about it, I'm a chronic cannabis user and I'm really looking for something new to alleviate the boredom of years of casual joint smoking.<br><br>
I've had some life-changing and spiritual revelations years ago with a number of substances, but I believe that these are personal experiences in which there is no value sharing. I'm also more cynical about the cosmic significance of these experiences than I once was and my present mind-set is one of scorn for any trip that is accompanied with ceremonial trappings or a pretentious spiritual setting or purpose.<br><br>
That's just so you know where I stand on 'entheogenic experiences.'<br><br>
I recently got hold of some 5x Calea extract a large bag of dried opium lettuce. I had heard that there was a good synergy between the two.<br><br>
I started the experience sober; no cannabis or alcohol after a day of meaningful employment. Neither stressed nor particularly relaxed.<br><br>
I rolled a joint (the UK way, with a small amount of cigarette tobacco to aid burning) with a very small amount of Calea extract. I can't give a weight as I have no scale, but it was much less than a gram. By volume, if I were using hash, it would have been a very light joint.<br><br>
Within a couple of minutes of smoking just over half, I felt a light-headed stoned feeling. Subtle, but noticeable. I gave my partner the other half but he said he could only just feel something. I felt a child-like sense of fun and found myself talking in a baby-ish voice and my light-headed feeling continued for maybe half an hour or slightly more. One notable difference between us is that he is a 20 cigarettes per day smoker. I smoke a small amount of tobacco in cannabis joints. Even so, I don't think the tobacco would have caused any of the effects I felt.<br><br>
We went to bed shortly after this and I prepared another (UK) joint, this time with about twice as much Calea and a small amount of wild lettuce (enough to make a fat joint). We smoked this together and my stoned feeling returned and my partner also felt a pleasant stoned feeling this time. It was the equivalent of a strong cannabis joint, although I would say it was somewhat different from a casual cannabis high, more light-headed and childish. We finished off a roach-end of a cannabis joint that was left lying around from the weekend (a couple of draws only...).<br><br>
We had very enjoyable sex while this feeling lasted. This was not because of any sensory changes. But I felt a slight lowering of inhibition, as with alcohol and a sense of fun and pleasure. I still felt stoned afterwards as we drifted off to sleep. My partner has trouble sleeping and so took a tablet of 5-HTP to induce drowsiness. I did not have anything because I have heard the reported dream-inducing effects and I did not want to adulterate this experience.<br><br>
I woke up having had a long, unusually detailed dream sequence with a complex but unusually meaningful and coherent plot/story. It was disturbing, though not frightening, because the part I played in it was very out of character for me. It seemed to be a dream rooted in anxiety, but I felt empowered by it on this occasion. I intend to think a little more about the symbolism, in case there is a subconscious message. At no point did I feel that this was a message from a spiritual/supernatural source. My partner did not remember any dreams.<br><br>
In conclusion, there is no doubt that this really worked, and I will use this combination again as an alternative to a casual cannabis joint. The effects are not profound enough for me to get really wild about, but they are real. The dream inducing effect also makes this a bit more interesting than casual cannabis use.<br><br>
I'd agree that there's a good synergy between lettuce and Calea. Unanswered questions are:<br><br>
 Possible synergy/antagony between tobacco/nicoteine addiction and the above?<br><br>
 Possible synergy with cannabis/chronic cannabis use?<br><br>
 Possible reduction in dream inducing effects if any sleep inducing medication is taken aswell?<br><br>
 Two final points - bear in mind the concentration of my Calea extract. You might have to take quite a lot of unenhanced Calea to get a good effect.<br><br>
 Both joints were pleasant to smoke, with a mellower taste than a normal cannabis joint and less dry mouth.<br><br>
Hope that's helpful to someone out there.<!-- End Body -->
