I have been a fairly common user of almost every drug available for the past 2 years.  I have used mushrooms, ecstacy, dxm, cocaine, crystal meth, various uppers and downers all about 10 times apiece. I have also been a daily pot smoker for roughly 4 years.<br><br>
LSD was never really available to me though it recently has.  I have only used it a few times and on my fourth use I took a single hit that was of moderate strength and then another approxamitely three hours later.  After tripping for a very long time and eventually coming down and passing out, I awoke to find that I still had visual 'trails'.  It is very similar to the effect that the mouse pointer is capable of doing.<br><br>
It has been roughly 4 weeks and I have ceased all drug use in an attempt to see if it would cause the trails to dissipate.  It has seemed to have little effect as I still see them on any fast moving objects.<br><br>
HPPD has not interfered with my living but it becomes very hard to look 'hand talkers' in the eye.  My focus tends to drift to the visuals that occur.<br><br>
I previously have been prescribed to xanax (used for recreational purposes only) and I will be attempting to use it as a treatment as I've read that the benzo catagories may have an effect. I hope that the benzo will have a dampering effect or that this problem will go away with time.  <br><br>
Since the other visual-inducing drugs never caused this condition despite excessive dosing and use, I would warn that lsd was most certainly the drug that caused this and that one might consider using other psychedelics if one feels the need to use them.<!-- End Body -->
