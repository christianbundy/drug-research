 "report": "<p>Let me start by saying that I have used many types of benzos for about six years - ever since I was diagnosed with cyclic vomiting. The benzos are great for reducing anxiety, but I have a tendency to find an empty bottle about a week or two before the refill date> :-(</p><p>Recently, I took way too many of my xanax too soon and decided to get some in Mexico, where it is known as 'Tafil.' I decided to buy some prozac as well, as I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, which I had not treated with either drug therapy or counseling. I have been using prozac for about six weeks now, and several things have occured.</p><p>I attribute the following beneficial effects to the use of prozac, 20 mg, once daily in the morning:</p><p>1. having more energy</p><p>2. having more motivation to utilise the energy</p><p>3. lessened anxiety</p><p>Now, as I said, I also use xanax, 1mg t.i.d., and I am considering tapering off this benzodiazepine. The prozac, as the Wikipedia entry suggests, has a 'strong energizing effect.' I am grateful for this drug. I know it increases suicidality in some, but I have never had those types of thoughts, and the drug DEFINITELY works for me. I have been diagnosed with both generalized anxiety and depression, and the prozac/xanax combo seems to be 'doing the trick.' I hope to one day go through life without these meds, but for now, they help me get by without any adverse effects.</p><p>NOTE: At first, the prozac induced akathisia (a.k.a. 'inner restlesssness') which I offset by doubling the xanax. This lasted for about two weeks, after which I went back to 3 mgs a day of xanax rather than 6.</p>"
