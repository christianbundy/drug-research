Quite a few reports on buprenorphine most of them involve puking. I'm trying to avoid that if possible. Ive never puked from an opiate before and dont want to start now.<br>
Experienced opiate user, but no tolerance I do random drugs every couple weeks. 30mg oxy or 40mg hydrocodne is the most I'd take in a night. <br><br><br>
Somewhere between 0.4mg-0.6mg suboxone taken sublingually. (An 8mg divided into 4 pieces, one piece divided in half once, and one of those divided in half again.)<br><br>
0:01 - Watching jeopardy.<br><br>
0:50 - Slightly dizzy, could be placebo effect or being tired from the soccer. About to take a shower.<br><br>
1:10  Out of the shower and feeling normal. I realized the dizziness was from staring at my computer for too long.<br><br>
1:40  Light buzz kicked in, feels kinda like the start of an oxy high. Bout to head out to blockbuster and publix.<br><br>
2:00-4:00  Light buzz continues, never actually gets me that high.<br><br>
4:00+ I feel pretty baseline. I'm guessing some must have flaked off when I cut the pill so I ended up taking close to 0.4mg which seems like a pretty small dose. The only problem that I had with my stomach while I was on it was some sharp pains that felt like hunger pangs. This was probably due to the fact that it was around 12am and I had last eaten at about 3pm.<br><br>
Next time I do it I'll double the dose and see how that works out.<!-- End Body -->
