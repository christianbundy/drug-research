 "report": "<p>I had read that coleus had mind altering effects. What I gathered was that it was almost like a mild cross between psilocybin and salvia. I have tried the quid method with 8 to 10 leaves on a few occasions, experiencing nothing more than a terrible taste. One report claims that the flowers are much stronger than the leaves. So I collected the flowering tops off of my coleus plants and set them aside for a few days to dry.</p><p>About an hour ago I rolled 2 cigarettes and smoked. After a few minutes I noticed a very slight relaxation and shortening of attention span. It is now about an hour later and I still feel somewhat relaxed. It feels NOTHING at all like a hallucinogen and I am very dissapointed. Perhaps I need to smoke a lot more in an extract. Coleus may be good as a mild sleep aid but definately not a psychedelic. I will put it's effects into the same category as passion flower and leonotis titled: 'Barely more than placebo.'</p>"
