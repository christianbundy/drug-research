 "report": "<p>\nAs a semi-hypersomniac with a severe case of ADHD, I was prescribed Provigil in late June of 2000. It is being tested for off-label uses to treat ADD and ADHD. </p><p>100 mg oblong, white, pill was crushed and snorted. More of a bitterness then the sweetness of amphetamines like Dextroamphetamine Hcl or the salts of adderall.</p><p>Not-so-speedy feeling sets in and lasts approxamitely 3 hours. It was more like being stoned into concentrating. </p><p>1 to 10 scale rating of recreational value, with 10 being the best: 3. </p><p>I have had many recreational experiences with oral administration, but never such a strong, intoxicated feeling was felt until it was tried insufflated. Many friends and associates of mine have tried Modafinil both orally and nasally and they seem to get sped up from it, unlike me. Everyone agrees that it helps very much in the area of improving concentration.</p><p>I have experienced being 'sped up' just once from Provigil, this being the first time i've ever taken it. 300 mg oral provided a less-euphoric but similar experience to doing about 10 mg of dextroamphetamine.</p>"
