This second encounter with the plant Salvia.<br><br>
Was one of a strange angle. No grid, no force lines. Nothing, this time my soul was ripped in half. Then fused back together again. During the five minutes or so I was high. I was contacted mentally by a shadow person. It hovered above me, as I attempted to reach out and embrace it. It found me to be of an annoyence. What was this pathetic soul doing in my realm is all I got from it. I smiled in an attempt to communicate that I was not here for a fight. I tried to show, I'm of good intention. Then this shadow being started to slip away. I could feel my body come back together. My soul fused it's self back to it's original shape. I quickly filled another bowl full in an attempt to re-establish contact with this being. Alas it was gone. Nothing more happened apart from turning the TV on and laughing uncontrollably at a program.<br><br>
In retrospect I think this shadow being was attempting to scare me. The mere fact that this stuff only lasted at most (the peak that is) 5 mins. Set my mind at ease. Whatever it was that I was in contact with could not retain me, nor I it. As my second attempt to hold on to that plateau ended in failure.<!-- End Body -->
