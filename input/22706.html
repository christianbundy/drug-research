The first time I tried ecstasy, I was hooked.  When I popped that pill, it made me feel like everything was right in the world.  I felt as if everyone in the room loved me as much as I loved them.  I felt at peace with everything in my life.  I was so high that I was hallucinating and talking to myself, but I thought I was just thinking.  <br><br>
Soon, I started using meth.  I started off snorting about a 20 bag a week.  When i snorted it, all i wanted to do was talk, but I would get so high, that I couldn't think.  I would shake and grind my teeth so much that they would hurt the next day.  Soon, I started smoking it.  I never really knew what it was like to be high on meth until that day.  I started buying larger amounts and staying up for days.  When I was high, I felt like I could do anything.  Sure, I got crazy/paranoid, but I loved that feeling.  I loved feeling so out of it and not knowing what was going on.  I was now strong and I was not shy anymore.  I could now do my homework every night, but not remember that I did it the next morning.  I was smoking about a gram a week, but then it turned ugly.  I could no longer function without the use of meth.  I started smoking about 3-4 grams a week.  I started thinking that my friends were just using me, but in reality, I was just using them to get high.  I stole money from my parents and I hooked up with a guy that batched.  I thought that was awesome because I had free dope all the time.  I basically lived at his house because he gave me dope.  People told me that I could not control my drug use, but i just shrugged it off.  I knew i was in control, or was I???  <br><br>
My life became so unmanageable and I became so depressed that I didn't want to live anymore.  When I would get high, I would start to think about dying, and I would cut my wrists.  My parents knew I was sick and sent me to rehab, but i didn't care.  I got high anyways, and because meth is out of the system in 3 days, i passed all my UA's.  But then I found CMA (Crystal Meth Anonymous).  It's saved my life.<!-- End Body -->
