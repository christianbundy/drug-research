 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSo finals were rolling around, and my University gives us students the luxury of 2 study days.\r\nI had organic chemistry I at the time and, lacking Adderall, I decided that I'd attempt to use AMT as a study aid. This was back in the good ole days when it was legal.... ah those were the times.\r\nSeemed a good idea: the first 6-8 hour amphetamine-like energy I figured could be well spent processing the magic of organic chemistry, with the second wave of the experience for some light philosophical adventures.\r\nI had previously made 40 mg capsules (visually), so I took a quarter of one of them. Both measurements were visual, so the dose was probably greater than the 10 mgs, because I'm usually generous.\r\nSo I remember dosing around 9 AM or so. I walked down to the local pharmacy to get some munchies for studying... this was a good 15 minute walk. While in there I notice my stomach is doing the whole AMT thing, so I grab a ginger ale, this was before I knew ginger ale, at least Canada dry's version, lacks any ginger. Also grabbed some Cheezits.\r\nSo I get back to my apartment, a good hour has passed. I put my nose in the books. \r\nAnd my theory was correct! I was intent on the reading, I was jumping from figure to figure, taking it all in. I killed the box of cheezits, which led to some GI problems...\r\nAbout 3-4 hours later is where I ran into some trouble. Basically, the way I recount it is that I got way too optimistic about my situation. I didn't see the need to study anymore... I convinced myself I had learned all I needed to. And the outside world just looked so intriguing. \r\nSo I went for a walk. On this walk my ex-girlfriend called me... she was checking out new apartments (we had very recently broken up, and we had been living together). So I went up to the place and amused myself as they used me as their measuring device, because they forget a tape-measure.\r\nI'm not sure what happened the rest of the night, but I don't think I got back to studying.\r\nThe following semester I did get a hold of some Adderall for the study days and it was much more effective... something like 7 hours of straight studying.\r\nSo, long story short, this was effective for the first 3-5 hours of the experience. When the second wave of the drug starts to kick in, however, I became extremely and convincingly optimistic (which I attribute to the drug)... thus losing motivation to study. \r\nI did get a B+ in the class though. Not too shabby.\n\n\n"
