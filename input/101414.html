<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body -->
Male, 22, healthy build. Take one multivitamin, 150mg-300mg gabapentin for anxiety, both daily. Stopped 1 week prior to dosing etaqualone. <br><br>
Had lots of experience with all kinds of downers benzos, opiates, psychedelics stimulants. Weed, you name it. From the basic to rare and exotic.<br><br>
I took 1mg etizolam and 100mg tramadol the night before this, besides that only pot smoked all week. <br><br>
I smoked cannabis and cigs all through this report, as I usually do. <br><br>
10:50<br>
Swallow approx 500-mg<br>
Its odd dumping a big pile of powder without some anxiety as the powders I handle are usually active in amounts 100's of times smaller then the pile I'm looking at now. <br><br>
10:58<br>
Yup all ready a lil high I'm pretty sure. <br><br>
11:15 Initial wondering about if I just ate a mislabelled chem gone. <br>
Now just hoping I didn't eat a bunk synth chem. Ill chalk up that 10:58 entry to placebo<br><br>
11:25<br>
Stood up. Woah, nice and uncoordinated. A bit of a content mindspace. Having fun waving arms around and rolling on floor giddy and stupid. Wish wasn't so cheap per dose or id deff be getting down on this often. <br><br>
Nice euphoria too. Like a uppidy opioid. Not as lovey or solidly content feeling as opiates.<br><br>
Guess I didn't get a bunk batch cause I'm high as shit. Really fun to rotate my torso and let my arms flail around<br><br>
11:45 <br>
Too uncoordinated to type notes now, Using siri to input text.  <br>
Outside for a cig, Damn I love these things at this point.<br>
They turn my body to Jell-O and the hardest concrete floor into a fluffy bed of feathers or cotton.<br><br>
Took a good amount of time to figure out why my computer wasn't controlling my iPhone volume.<br><br>
11:55<br>
Body is so loose it feels weird to cough<br><br>
12:00<br>
Decide to go for a walk look at my board on the way out and think that would be so much fun but I'm way too any related to ride my skateboard right now.<br><br>
Still feel content, a slight bit of dysphoria, Feel like my inner monologue is being narrated in the 3rd person. EX: ok so there's the clouds, they look nice to me, there's the moon, I enjoy how its illuminating the street.<br><br>
I'd certainly be one of those fools playing a highly inflated price for eludes once they were made illegal kind of like what happened with that OC's and OP's<br><br>
12:10<br>
I want to take this with my friends, I want a huge stash of these, for every Friday I love them<br><br>
12:20-12:45<br>
Marked decrease in effects. <br><br>
1:00 <br>
Baseline, Play gta for a hour<br><br>
2:00<br>
Fall asleep<br><br>
Got a good nights rest and woke up not feeling at all groggy from the Etaqualone. So glad I got to get an idea of why ludes were so popular. The short duration is a real bummer because it is really very enjoyable. Its an amazing analgesic. I'm usually in horrible pain in my back from work. While on the etqualone it was not noticeable.<!-- End Body -->
