<br><br><!-- End DoseChart  --><!-- Start Body -->
It was the first night of christmas break from school in our county. A few friends had been doing angels trumpets in the past few weeks, and I decided it was my turn to try them out. I read up a little, and come nightfall I harvested from a local plant. I grabbed a few flowers and leaves off of this 6-7 ft. plant. I went home at midnight, chopped up two 7 in. flowers and a leaf. I boiled the product in a liter of water. I picked up a friend, 'Germexican', in the car, brought him over, we each drank half a liter, throwing away the plant matter.<br><br>
After 30 min. or so, we got a slight body buzz with some hardcore cotton mouth. We were listening to some slow lounge/techno, just chilling. I would compare the buzz to smoking some shitty bud, without the high. We both fell asleep, and my friend woke me up at 4 am. I drove him home, we were dissappointed. I went home and slept, woke up at 10, and decided to eat some straight up. This was mistake number one. <br><br>
I was supposed to pick up my younger brother and sister at day care at 12. I made myself an angels trumpet and ham sandwich with two flowers, a leaf, a slice of ham, and some mayo. I washed it down with a cup of water. The plants did not taste very good, but didn't really taste all that bad either. I ate the whole thing. the stem or main vein or whatever of the leaf was difficult to chew. After 20 minutes I grew impatient, and ate a whole other flower. Then half of another five minutes later. I cleaned up my mess and drove over to a friend's house. Let's call him 'Jew'. <br><br>
Jew is my smoking partner. I have smoked a lot of bud with this guy. His room is the designated and preferred smoking area. I had not smoked in about 4 months because of a few lifestyle changes, but he's still a good friend and i wanted to hang out. We're in his room and he's smoking and he asks me whether I am feeling anything yet. I say 'a little...not really, though'. Actually, I would describe my mindset at that time as similar to right before ecstacy kicks in. When I know some shit is about to happen to my body/mind, I can feel something coming, but not just yet. He suggests I take a hit of his pipe to get things going. I comply, and lay back after one hit on the couch, listening to some music. As I'm staring at his dresser, relaxing, i see worms underneath the flat drawer, wriggling around under the skin of the wood. Also, I had developed some hardcore, bad ass cotton mouth since I had stepped into Jew's house. I'm talking, unimaginable cotton mouth. White, dry lips. I could hardly talk. <br><br>
I tell Jew that I'm starting to hallucinate mildly, and that I should get home before it hits harder. We walk downstairs, and Germexican says to me 'Hey, remind Jew to get you some water, you look pretty bad'. I say 'Oh yeah.....thanks for reminding me'. I ask Jew for some water. He gets me a glass, I down it, biting dead skin off of my lips with my teeth and swishing water to every part of my oral cavity. Jew says 'You ok to drive'. Yeah. Peace. So I run out to my car and start driving home. I feel just a little stoned at this point. Later in the night I realize that Germexican was not at Jew's house, and that I was talking to myself in the kitchen. But I start driving home (a 9 minute drive) and black out after about 2 minutes on the road. <br><br>
Apparently I drove ok while blacked out, because when I came to at 12:40 (about a minute past the turn for my house) I was in a turning lane, stopped. I had been gone from Jew's house for about 50 minutes. I turn (still stopped in the turning lane) left and look at Jew. I tell him to stop laughing, that he's tripping me out. I turn off the radio. 'Fuck', I say, looking at the time. 'I was supposed to pick up the kids almost an hour ago'. 'I'm going to go pick them up, then drop you at your house, ok Jew? I look back over at him, but he's not there. I am confused, but black out again.<br><br>
Five minutes later I regain a little conciousness while going 60 (the speed limit) along a highway next to the gulf of mexico. I start losing control of the car, and swerve slowly on and off of the shoulder of the highway. Jew is in the passenger seat, cracking up. I tell him 'watch the road, dude, your going off of the road', thinking for some reason that it is under his control. We drive left, into the median, across the other lane of traffic, and onto the opposite shoulder into some sand. Jew say's 'watch this', smiles, and hit's the gas a little, drivings us a few feet further into the sand and nudging a small wood/wire dune fence. He thinks this is so funny. I lay my face on the steering wheel and fall asleep.<br><br>
I immediately wake back up to a knock on my window. A policeman. He asks for my licence. I give him my sam's card. He asks why I just hit his fence. 'It's not your fence', I say. He repeats the question. 'I didn't....my...my brother...man....my brother Jew did...he's...' I look over. Where is Jew? I didn't mean to say brother. I couldn't really form sentences at this time. Whatever came out came out. I am confused. He asks me to step out of the car. I think it's night time, but it's about 12:50 in the afternoon at this point.<br><br>
I am a little sketchy about the details at this point. I take a BAC, no alcohol in my blood. He says he thinks i'm on drugs. My mom is there. He tells her that I am talking to people that aren't there. I realize subconciously that I am halucunation, and that I am fucked in this situation, but I continue to be confused about why I am action so crazy. I am very polite with the officer, and compliant with everything he asks of me, to the best of my ability. He asks me to walk over to him. I try, but I know subconciously that this is an impossibility. I take two steps, and then my pelvis flies foreward like it was hit by a car. I fall into the stickers and sand. I get up, take another step, and the same thing happens, only this time I fall onto the officer. He catches me, handcuffs me, and puts me in the squad car. He asks if I know where I am. I give him the correct location. <br><br>
I black out for a bit, talk to my grandfather, black out some more, then I am at a table talking to the officer. He asks if I know where I am. I give him the same answer I did before. 'No', he says. 'You're at the police department. You've been arrested for driving under the influince'. This does not bother me. He makes me sign some papers, which I cannot read because my nearsighted vision is blurry. I am taken to a small holding cell with black iron bars for a door. I sit on a bench in the cell, watching a few officers walk past occasionally. I black out and wake up, staring at this green grid in front of me, in place of the iron bars.  There is a female, odd looking, about 8 feet tall and 4 inches thick, slipping in and out of this green grid. I see a spider hanging from the ceiling near her. I am completely focussed on these things, not aware that they are not real or that anything else exists except for this girl, spider, and grid. I wake up in my mom's car. She is driving me to the hospital. I am depressed, and not completely with it yet. Just enough to understand the situation and be depressed about it. I check into the hospital. I had been in the holding cell for 6 hours. It had seemed like five minutes.<br><br>
The rest is not really important, except that I spent 21 days, including christmas and new years in rehab. And this bitch at the hospital took like 6 vials of blood out of my arm, and was digging around with the needle, not leaving it stationary. Bitch. Also, I think that the trumpets did some sort of neurological damage (minor), because a week or two later my right eye developed a small, rapid twitch that comes and goes, and has been with me for 2 weeks. It isn't noticable unless you're looking for it, but I can feel it and it is very aggitating. <br><br>
This was not tripping, it was hallucinating. There is a difference. I reccomend that you just get some acid or shrooms rather than this, but if you're going to try it, DO NOT DRIVE. And I reccomend having someone with you who is not tripping. Maybe on some ecstacy or bud, but not tripping. This was not really worth it for me, but I suppose it's one more crazy experience to add to the list. Peace.<!-- End Body -->
