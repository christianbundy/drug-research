 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI read up on the subsatance kava on this very website, i am not about to become sucked into mainstream illegal drugs and i was looking for a way to be relaxed and feel and see wonderful things in a legal way. After reading the tesimonials i decided to give kava a try. my first few times the pills didnt do much but slightly relax me. lately i decided to up the dose and see if, like cannabis, it would work after a few goes at the drug. WOW! it is unreal. heres what i experienced...\r\n[8 180mg caps of 55% kavalactone and 4 400mg caps of 2.5% kavalactones]\r\nPros: \r\nstate of utter realaxation\r\nheavy legs, [urge to rest and let go]\r\nvision sharply focuses then unfocuses\r\nvision blurs as u move or others move quickly,\r\n   when u steady a cool drifty state takes control of u for a few seconds.\r\nlights and colors pop out and seem intriguing\r\nyou feel like u are moving when u aren't.\r\neverything seems good\r\nmusic is elegant and flowing\r\noverall it is a wonderful experience\r\nCons:\r\nslight nausea\n\n\n"
