This drug has been called 'ethylacybin' for its mushroom like qualities and my experiences certainly convinced me that this comparison is well founded. It is very emotional, as are mushrooms for me, and the few open eye visuals that I had involved a bit of bending and twisting of straight lines. Closed eye visuals were, in contrast, phenomenal. As with mushrooms it was a very spiritual experience for me, putting me squarely into the presence of the goddess. I found also to be very good at making clear, sometimes painfully, what is missing from my life. Although this last bit is very likely the result of things brewing in my own head and I wouldn't necessarily expect others to have this experience.  <br><br>
The setting was a new years eve party (although I took it the day after new years eve) at a large house someplace warm. It was full of amazing people, many of whom were also tripping on various things, some fine music, and a fair amount of good ground control. I consider this to be very close to an ideal setting.<br><br>
I started with 15mg of the powder insufflated.  Sadly, I had no trip clock set so it is hard to say what the exact times where, but I'd say that I was getting alerts by 15 minutes. However, it wasn't enough, so I stuffed another 15 mgs into my nose and that did the trick.<br><br>
At about t+30, I was well into the trip and decided to join the crowd watching Moulin Rouge, however, by about t+60, the emotional content of the drug was starting to kick in and I was unable to deal with the utter sadness of the movie, the thoughts of what was missing from my life, and the fear that I would never find true love so I left the movie and spent a bit of time on a couch, simply trying to keep it together. Ground control was plentiful, and checked in, but there was little that they could do, and I was forced to wait this out. Thankfully, it was only about 30 minutes of this, and looking back, very good for me in an educational sort of way.<br><br>
I'd heard reports from others who'd taken this compound, that the open eye visual were very strong. I had very few of these just some bending of straight lines and a little bit of breathing wall, but close eye visuals were friggin fantastic. Cartoon dragons and lizards, writhing Celtic knots, scenes from movies that I'd enjoyed rendered into animated insanity all dancing in my head. I found that I could more or less select what it was that I wanted to see and there it would be, as real as life projected into the backs of my eyelids.<br><br>
I came down with a little dancing and frolicking with a group of folks on acid and finished off the night with some 2CB-hydrobromide (also insuf, ouch ouch ouch). I'm guessing that this lasted about 4 hours. No ill effects from that mixture, but that is another trip report.<br><br>
Overall I would say this is a fine drug, on par with mushrooms, but like Mushrooms, I'd warn anyone who has any serious amount of unhappiness in their system to avoid this stuff. It just blew my emotions up too much to be handled with that. I believe it would be unwise to try this without a sitter.<!-- End Body -->
