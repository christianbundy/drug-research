 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI've had serious social and performance anxiety since I can remember. My doctor put me on propranolol (20mg three times daily = 60mg/day) six months ago for headaches but instead it significantly improved my anxiety. <br>I used to experience shaking hands, trembling voice, blushing, sweating, and trouble keeping my thoughts focused any time I was in a social situation or had to perform (music major). After being on propranolol, my hands don't shake, I don't feel as hot and sweaty (though still a bit), my voice doesn't shake, and my head is clearer/I can think and remember things better. <br>This has made a huge difference in my everyday life and really helped me as a musician. I  still have situation-specific anxieties but this drug has helped immensely. Best of all, no negative side effects!\n\n\n"
