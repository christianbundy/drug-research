A while back at a techno party, a friend of mine asked me if I would like to try 20mgs of 5-MeO-DALT. He told me it was nice and mellow, and this was a small dose, and it wouldn't be anything too extreme. It was in the wee hours of the morning, probably around 9am, and I had already been playing with chemicals all night (Ketamine, LSD, and MDMA). I tried it, and didn't feel a thing, because I was on the influence of so many other drugs and was super tired.<br><br>
So, I decided to order a gram of 5-MeO-DALT from a research chemical website on the internet for my own experimentation at a later date. <br><br>
I received the packet it in the mail, and took a few small unmeasured licks out of the bag during the course of a hard partying weekend, and again; didn't feel a thing.<br><br>
Fed up with this nonsense, I got off of work early, went home, and decided to get some results.<br><br>
I've done a lot of drugs, I wasn't scared of a little sketchy white powder. My cheap scale says I did about 60 milligrams, but it's a cheap scale and I rounded down instead of up. <br><br>
I was in a good mood, well slept, and had a relatively empty stomach. The setting was at my house on a nice sunny day at around 3pm. <br><br>
I put the powder on my tongue and washed it down with some water, and then took my dogs out for a walk. On my stroll around my neighborhood, I started coming up in about 20 minutes. I was feeling lightheaded, warmer, and my legs were getting a little wobbly. I started getting higher so I walked towards home just to be safe.<br><br>
At first the come up was a little similar to LSD or MDMA. But I didn't get any visuals or and happy fuzzy feelings. Instead, my inner monologue turned towards a negative direction, and then into total panic. I decided that I should head for my room and lay on my bed and ride it out. <br><br>
I've had some bad trips on other substances, so I told myself that I'd be okay. My curiosity got the best of me, so I started reading about 5-MeO-DALT experiences on the web, while peaking. I got through the first few sentences of someone describing their overdose and subsequent trip to the hospital; then I decided that was a stupid thing to do while freaking out on drugs, so I closed my laptop and cuddled my dogs for a few moments.<br><br>
I decided that I had taken way too many drugs before, and they didn't kill me, so this one most likely wouldn't kill me either.  I got myself together, lit a cigarette, and smoked it in a hammock in my yard. I was done freaking out, and I didn't feel so high anymore either. It was about 4:30pm. <br><br>
I made some phone calls to some people I love, and then walked my dogs again, and by 5:00pm I was pretty much back to normal and feeling much better.<br><br>
Maybe if I was in a fun environment, like a dance party, or at least with some friends, it could be fun. I'll try it again sometime, maybe 20 milligrams on the hour every hour for four hours. <br><br>
All in all, this my 5-MeO-DALT trip sucked. The come up wasn't anything to write home about, and can be summed up as disorienting. The peak was more or less a panic attack. My chest got a bit tense, and I was taking heavy breaths. My thoughts were troubled, and I just wanted it to stop. The comedown wasn't bad, maybe a bit confusing.<br><br>
The same results can be achieved by riding a sketchy carnival ride that might fly to pieces and kill you, but really just scares the shit out of you for a little while and returns you to the ground.<!-- End Body -->
