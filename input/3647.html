15 out of 35 of us that went on a haunted hayride ate the wicked liquid.  15 of us have not been the same since.  We all expected a body buzzzz and some visuals, but none of us expected what happened next.  That night new doors of perception opened in our minds.  I have always been the type of person who does their drugs, that night the drugs did me.  I almost lost it.  I have never blacked out from lsd before, and that night there are hours i dont remember.  Everyone who ate it tripped for over 24 hours.  I my case it was 48.  I fell asleep and when i woke up i was still tripping. <br>
I watched some of my friends freak out.  Others would try to talk them down but we all found that we could not find the words to exprese the thoughts in our heads.  My body was twitching my eyelids were fluttering.  It was ruthless.  I never thought i was going to come down.  My friend S almost drowned in the shower.  When i took one i knew that water was hitting my body but it didnt feel like i was getting wet.  We all call it the wicked liquid, for this reason...what is in such a minute drop of liquid that can freak out 15 adults?  For all of you reading this I dont know what strain of liquid it was so if asked if you want some liquid lsd, think twice.  Liquid USED to be my favorite type of LSD.  NEVER again.<!-- End Body -->
