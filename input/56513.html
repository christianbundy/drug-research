I am a heavy drinker so anything else I take I must first check for interactions. Finding no serious warnings of mixing Neurontin with alcohol, or finding any reports of such I decided to experiment.<br><br>
Around 8pm I took 8 300mg Neurontin pills with a bottle of mountain dew. While waiting for the pills to work I started my nightly drinking gin also mixed with dew. I thought the more soda I drank the faster the pills would kick in.<br><br>
About 3 hours later I was pretty drunk but not to the state of being out of control. The pills had definitely kicked in but not till I thought about it. I felt really floaty, almost like a small dxm mixed with weed type trip, but more euphoric.<br><br>
An hour later a friend came by and we decided to get some coffee at an all night coffee house. I took a few more pills before we left. There I consumed 5 regular coffees, it just tasted so good, I don't know if it was just excellent coffee or my mindset. We played cards and sang along with the karaoke for about an hour, something I usually hate. I just felt so sociable and happy.<br><br>
We then left and returned to my place where I popped a few more pills and had a few beers. We played the playstation 2 for hours and I just loved every minute of it.<br><br>
To conclude, I think the mix was an excellent and I never felt any ill effects. Woke up the next morning still high but not hung over or zombie like at all. I look forward to many more good times with this combination.<!-- End Body -->
