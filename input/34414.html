This was my first time using cyclobenzaprine.  It was before an important meeting I had at about 7:30.  I took 30 mgs. I brought 30 more with me.  About half an hour later, I felt nothing so I took the other 30 mgs I had with me.  That was during the meeting when I said I had to go to the bathroom.  Then I felt light-headed.  It was the greatest sensation Ive had in a while because right now I cant use any other drugs because I am getting tested and shit.  <br><br>
I had some moments where id shut my eyes and just feel amazing.  It was kinda like shrooms the trippy effects I had but not nearly as strong.  I didnt see anything but occasionally if I stared at something real long it would start moving. I also felt very tired and wanted to leave the meeting very bad to go to sleep.  The effects lasted a lot longer than I expected and I was very satisfied with them.<!-- End Body -->
