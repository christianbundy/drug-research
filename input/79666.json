 "report": "<p>Fibromyalgia is ameliorated by different medications in different people. For me, the 'magic pill' is Ambien. </p><p>I don't get high on Ambien, nor does it 'make' me go to sleep. I take it about twenty minutes before I want to lie down, and spend that twenty minutes doing my usual pre-sleep routine. When I begin to go to sleep, I see normal hypnagogic shapes and colors, and slide right down into normal sleep. I can be awakened from it (though I am not very gracious) and wake normally after eight to nine hours with no hangover. I apparently talk in my sleep on it, but having talked in my sleep from childhood, this is nothing new. </p><p>Ambien makes the difference between being able to function the next day and being so tired and sore that I can't think straight.</p>"
