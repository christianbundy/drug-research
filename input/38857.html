Having experimented with smaller doses of Piracetam and Hydergine, and noted the apparent potentiation of the two when taken together, I decided to try an attack dose of Piracetam - 5600 mg - in combination with a decent dose of Hydergine - 9 mg. I also took a cap of 250 mg Choline Bitartrate / 250 mg Inositol - which is generally recommended because of Piracetams tendency to deplete the brains choline reserves.<br><br>
In my earlier dabblings, I had already found myself slightly surprised by Piracetam and Hydergine - the effects being more pronounced than I had expected from accounts elsewhere. A brief summary of my reactions:<br><br>
* Increased awareness and enjoyment of detail, both visual and auditory, and a corresponding sense of sparkle in my environment.<br><br>
* Strong desire to listen to music, and great impatience with the wrong sort of music - the right sort of music being instrumental music, ideally semi-ambient - not rhythmic/percussive enough to be insistent, but with sufficient structure and imaginative evolution to maintain stimulation.<br><br>
* Physiological effects associated with vasodilation: slight discomfort of the eyes (which I also sometimes experience with cannabis+tobacco) and slight prickliness in the temples. Also minor stomach discomfort - but my stomach is unusually sensitive.<br><br>
* General stimulant effect, of a mild amphetamine-like quality.<br><br>
* Lack of perceived increase in intellectual capacity or memory. Smart drugs dont make me smart. I am a writer, and had hoped for some sharpening of the associated faculties, but on most occasions results were not clear-cut.<br><br>
* A characteristic white flash on opening the eyes after theyve been closed for a while (also noted by a friend who had tried this combination) <br><br>
I mention these previous effects in some detail, for the reason that I found the large dosage rather disappointing. A lot of vasodilation, corresponding amount of general stimulant effect, but the nootropic mental effects were fairly limited. I gather some people need an initial large dose of Piracetam before it takes effect, but I never found this, and would recommend lower dosages - 800 to 1600 mg Piracetam in combination with 4.5 to 9 mg Hydergine works well for me. And 250 mg choline for good luck. Taken together these three have a much more pronounced effect.<br><br>
One interesting anecdote from my larger-dose experiment, which is illustrative of the way these drugs work. I had fallen asleep for a while, about an hour after taking them (I find that, apart from general stimulant qualities, noticeable effects from Piracetam and Hydergine dont kick in until about three or four hours after ingestion - I imagine the sublingual versions hit a lot quicker, but havent tried them).<br><br>
I woke up about three hours later and began looking around the room - the raised wallpaper patterns on my ceiling which become more interesting on nootropics were interesting, but nothing exceptional. Then after a while I tried to move my arms, and couldnt. Nothing. Couldnt move my body at all. My first reaction was, Fuck, looks like Ive overdone it with this dosage. Then gradually I realised part of me was still not fully awake. What I was experiencing was in fact the familiar sensation of waking up partially: being able to see, but not yet move my limbs. Except that with the large dose of nootropics, part of me had woken up completely - the visual cortex/cognitive stuff was snap-bang wide awake - but my motor centres had yet to kick in. I guess this is a kind of literal example of the nootropics wake up my brain thing, but with the added insight that they wake it up selectively.<br><br>
I think these are drugs which act quite differently on different people, so it was well worth my experimenting vis-à-vis dosage. But for my money, a combination of modest amounts of each is best - and cheaper too.<br><br>
One further specific note - this combination might be of interest to anyone involved in performance arts. I sing, scream and play in an improv noise band, and after taking a couple each of Piracetam and Hydergine and one or two drinks, found that my stage performance became quite eccentric. I found myself howling with a great panache, twitching about on the floor and playing my instrument with one foot, and lashing frenetically into our drummers cymbals with a bottle of beer. Playing in a band is fun on smart drugs and alcohol. (testimonial)<!-- End Body -->
