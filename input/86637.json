 "report": "<p>I bought JWH-250 instead of JWH-018 because 018 is now illegal in Alabama. JWH-250 is just like 018 in intensity, but it lasts an even shorter time. Marijuana lasts about 2-3 hours (if I havent smoked in a while) and JWH-018 lasts an hour to 1.5 hours, but the intensity of 250 lasts only 30 minutes. It is still worth buying, though. I can get freaky high on this stuff, the problem is not that its milder, but that it doesnt last as long. This might be convenient for some people, though, who have a short lunch hour! </p><p>The powder I got was about $40 a gram s/h included and was white to light pink, and melted on tinfoil at the touch of a lighter to a pink liquid which vaporized. I did not try snorting it, since JWH-018 was not active when snorted. I do not know if it is cross-tolerant with 018 but the intensity of smoking it after 2 weeks without 018 did not leave me wanting more. Id compare this chemical to smoking the kindest of the kind bud, but the buzz leaves me very quickly. Worth it, though, again. </p><p>[Reported Dose :  15-25 mg]</p>"
