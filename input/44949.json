 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all I want to give a warning.\r\nDO NO SNORT!!!\r\nThe stuff is a new kind of pain and made my nose pour blood.\r\nThis is my experience\r\n0.00-took 4 40mg strattera capsules\r\n0.45-Beginning to feel effects. Feels a whole lot like meth\r\n1.00-Noticing wierd brain tingle effects and temperature sensations. Noted pronounced CEVs. \r\n1.30-Beginning to feel very very jittery. Concentration is gone. Mind drifting really far out. Thoughts litterally only half finished.\r\n2.00 Actually noticing chest tension and minor pain. Feels like a kinda sorta heart attack.\r\n2.30 Very tired and weak. Developing a headache.\r\n3.00 Trying to just sleep.\r\n5.00 Finally get past the horrible crash and drift off to a dead sleep.\r\n7.00 Wake up from said dead sleep feeling very groggy. Can't go back to sleep.\r\n7.00+ I felt groggy for the rest of the day and sleep was still disrupted that night.\r\nConclusion. This is not a fun party amp pill like adderal. This is strictly for those with ad/hd.\n\n\n"
