I've done speed a few times since earlier this fall--September or so. Prior to doing speed, I had only ever smoked weed; I did meth with my roommates, essentially just out of curiousity. The first time I did it, we did lines, which was a new experience for me. Some people find snorting speed to be very uncomfortable, even painful, and it is most definitely an unpleasant sensation, but not horrible. I was amazed at how quickly the drug hit me: I did a line, felt a nasty chemical drip in the back of my throat, and instantly felt like I'd been wound up to run around at a thousand miles an hour. So awake, wanting to run around, move, fix things, talk forever--an incredibly excited, happy, powerful feeling.<br><br>
Shortly after doing the line, I left with another of my roommates to go hang out with some friends of ours who live nearby. I was very excited and energetic feeling, very happy to be doing things, anything. I was very talkative and much more outgoing than I usually am once we got to the party. We all did some tequila shots--three or four, I think. Not a lot, but enough where I should have been pretty buzzed if not verging on drunk, but I didn't really feel the alcohol at all. I danced pretty much the whole night, made lots of conversation--much more than usual!--and basically felt really excited and happy.<br><br>
By the time everyone was leaving, it was probably about four or five hours later. I was bummed that the night was ending; I was still ready to party, party, party! I went home and stayed up with my roommates for a little longer. Then I decided that I could go to bed, so I tried. I could not have fallen asleep then for any amount of money. I was wide awake, and yet I wanted to sleep. I get this feeling whenever I do speed, and it may be one of the worst aspects of the usage for me. I decided to get up and do something. First I decided I wanted to go for a walk (this is at about 5AM or so), so I leave to go for a walk at the nearby university.<br><br>
I have never been so freaked out and paranoid in my whole life. I felt like I was being watched, or followed, like someone was going to 'get' me. I thought I heard footsteps nearby. I decided maybe I would feel better back home, but even inside my own apartment, I was freaked out, jumping at the littlest noise, worrying frantically. This was a huge, uncomfortable full-fledged bout of paranoia. It made time go by very slowly, and I started to get the feeling that I had always felt this jittery, nervous, anxious feeling--I honestly felt like I was going a tiny bit crazy.<br><br>
I finally managed to fall asleep for a couple of hours a little later in the morning. I felt awful and dragged out the rest of the day, and the day after that--for me, the comedown off of speed is always awful. My roommates tell me that this gets 'better' if you take it more, and also that they are able to sleep and eat semi-normally on it. Of course, doing this means taking more speed, which is not a good idea, by anyone's judgement that I've ever heard speak of it. I forgot to mention that, obviously, speed is a major major appetite suppressant, to the same extent that it won't let me sleep, it just doesn't occur to me that I need food or rest, and when someone suggests it, the idea just sounds generally unappealing.<br><br>
I have done speed a few more times since, and haven't had such a bad experience with paranoia, which I think was brought on by me being awake and by myself for several hours. My best experience with the drug was probably the last time I took it: I stayed up with on of my roommates and we pretty much smoked it all night. We talked for nine straight hours--it was a really cool experience, and I enjoyed being up like that. However, as usual, my comedown was awful--I felt run down for a week, week and a half.  Also since about the third or fourth time I personally took it, I get awful jaw clenching on it, where I glench my jaw compulsively. This has happened to me to the point where my jaw is sore for four or five days, to the point where it's uncomfortable to eat. Not fun.<!-- End Body -->
