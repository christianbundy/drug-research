First off, I'm no stranger to benzodiazepines. I've used a few to date varying from Klonopin and Valium, to Xanax and recently Triazolam. On this occasion I obtained about 30 or so tiny pills of Triazolam (.125mg/each). I did some research online and found that it's really not a good idead to consume any more than 16 pills(in other words - 2mg of Triazolam) at one time. So, at home, I set out 16 pills and figured I'd go for it. <br><br>
It was the beginning of the weekend and I was hella bored and my girlfriend had gone off to some party that wasn't for guys. So, I figured I might as well. I sat in front of TV watching Sponge Bob and some other fucked up little kids cartoons. Initially, I popped about 8 pills at once. Those seemed to hit me nicely in no time at all since I had an empty stomach. I began to remember what benzodiazepines are all about and how they effect the body once more (seeing as the last time I enjoyed them was Klonopin downed with lots of alcohol with my friend. <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> We ended up taking our friend's brand new Audi A4 out for a fucked up joyride in the wee hours of the morning and crashed it into a snowbank -- that's another story though). <br><br>
Anyway, after those first 8 pills things started to get hazy. My motorskills where diminished and I'd occasionally have trouble with slurring words. When moving my head from side to side it somewhat created tracers, probably due to slow eye movement. On the other hand, I felt some degree of relaxation. After those 8 pills I still had 8 more left which I ate slowly one by one over the course of a little while (maybe about an hour though it's hard to recall). That's another thing though, benzodiazepines make my memory hazy indeed. It's like the short term memory loss with weed but times that by three. And when mixed with alcohol anything is possible. Such as a black out, even if you didn't drink all that much. After I had the 16 Triazolam pills in my belly I decided to take off and find a party. Bad idea. I hopped in my Subaru and as soon as I was getting out of my driveway I slammed into my Mom's van. <br><br>
Since the pills were in full effect I didn't seem to care too much and just headed on down the road to my friend's house in which I could party at. Alright, so I made it to the party only to find it was a small get together so I headed home. I was feeling extremely tired from the pills so I sat in my bed. Randomly, my girlfriend showed up and we put on a movie. I think I managed to view the first few minutes before I fell asleep. My girlfriend tried to wake me up, but it was no use. I was passed out cold. Here's the strange part - after the movie my girlfriend woke me up and we had a good night kiss and a little chat. I dont remember that at all. <br><br>
I woke up the next morning in my La-Z-Boy chair feeling fine. All in all Triazolam was a fun time. I personally like a high dose of Valium every now and again and perhaps some Klonopin/alcohol(though not in excess) to get the party going.<!-- End Body -->
