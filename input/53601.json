 "report": "<p>This was my second experience with hydromorphone, it was enjoyable until it was time to come down, that sucked until I took some speed (Aderall).</p><p>5:00pm - Snorted 2mg hydromorphone. Small effects, felt nice for awhile.</p><p>5:45pm - Swallowed the other 4 tablets(2mg each).</p><p>6:15pm - I felt very significant effects, sort of euphoric, but then again not really. It was a very plesant buzz though.</p><p>7:30pm - Fell asleep for maybe an hour.</p><p>8:30pm - Still feel a strong buzz, I was starting to come down, but I still felt good.</p><p>9:15pm - Starting to really feel the full effects of coming down, everything I say is too loud, any noise (there is alot of noise in my house, 6 kids) I feel like telling my whole family to shut the fuck up. They want to know what's wrong with me, so I tell my mom I'm niccin (need a cigarette). So she drops me off at a gas station. I see a few of my friends there. I tell them how bad I'm crashing so he sells me a 20mg Aderall. After about 10 minutes within consumption, I start to feel much better. I find some dude to buy me cigarettes, I then get picked up. I go home and feel sooo much better from the Aderall, smoke a few cigarettes, then go on the computer.</p><p>11:00pm - I feel energized, yet very relaxed. I listen to music for what seemed like hours, in fact it was hours. Just sitting there listening to music, I felt so wonderful.</p><p>1:00am - I still do not feel tired in least, keep listening to music.</p><p>2:00am - Start getting bored with music, so I download 'That 70's Show', and smoke another cigarette.</p><p>2:30am - Watch the show, didn't find it funny like I usually do, so I put my music back on.</p><p>3:30am - Decide I really should try to get some sleep, so I go to bed.</p><p>5:00am - wake up, if you could say that, I wasn't really asleep. Just half asleep laying there. So I get up, and go back to my computer.</p><p>5:30am - Try to go back to bed. Lay there for what seems like hours, until I finally dose into a daze. I must have finally fallen asleep, because I woke up at about 10:00am, not feeling tired. </p><p>That's about it. Overall I enjoyed hydromorphone, until I came down, then it sucked. I really enjoyed speed, I just wish I hadn't taken it so late :)</p>"
