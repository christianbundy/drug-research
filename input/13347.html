I am a natural insomniac, never getting more than 2 hours of sleep a night, so I am always looking for a way to get a solid uninterupted 8 hours of sleep. I've been reading a lot about Chlorpheniramine maelate (I will call it Cm from now on), mostly in conjunction with DXM, but almost never by itself. After a little bit of research, I found out that Cm was an antihistamine, and one of the side effects was drowsiness... kool... so I bought a pack of Chlor-Tripolon. Before I took them, I grabbed a couple of blankets and a pillow, which I threw on the couch. Then I swallowed all the pills (I never do things halfway, but don't recommend it, there are dangerous side effects... seizures, comas etc...) I started playing computer, for about an hour when a sudden intense weariness came upon me. I tried to finish my game of Starcraft, but I couldn't keep my eyes open. It was all I could do to stumble over to the couch and flop down on it. Before my head hit the pillow, I was snoozing like a baby. I never dream, but tonite I did. It was quite weird actually, I dreamt of nothingness, the dream gradually shifted from pitch black to starck white, and back again; over and over. I was dreaming about nothing, but I was still dreaming. <br><br>
13 hours later I finally woke up. My roommate told my that he put my blanket on me, cuz I was asleep before I lay down. He also said that I wuz unwakeable, almost in a comatose state and barely breathing. It took about an hour after I woke up before I had the energy to move, speak or even smoke... and about 4 hours before I felt normal again. In conclusion, what I did was very dangerous, I won't take more than 72mg next time.<!-- End Body -->
