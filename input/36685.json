 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nSetting: Quiet night in<br>These capsules claim to produce an effect similar to that of magic mushrooms.<br>10.00pm<br>Took one capsule on an empty stomach. Very heavily under the influence of cannabis.<br>10.30pm<br>Took two more capsules.<br>11.00pm<br>Nothing had yet happened. Cannabis consumption continued.<br>12.00am<br>Still no effects.<br>12.30am<br>Still no effects. Ceased smoking cannabis.<br>01.15am<br>Ever so slight trailing(*) of lights.<br>01.30am<br>Sleepiness set in. Think this was due to the cannabis rather than the capsules<br>(*)Trailing, as I mean it, is in the same sense as if someone waves a glowstick past your face when you're on MDMA. Only this was nowhere near as pronounced as it is on MDMA.<br>Since that night I tried again with a full dose. I had not been smoking cannabis. They had no effect whatsoever. I do not have sufficient knowledge to propose whether or not there was an interaction between the capsules and the cannabis the first time, or whether cannabis consumption increases/decreases the effects.<br>I wouldn't bother buying them again, I can get a fresh portion of shrooms for the same price anyway!\n\n\n"
