 "report": "<p>I suffered from severe anxiety and panic disorder, and often used alcohol to self-medicate in the past.  Eventually this backfired and my anxiety greatly increased when I tried to stop.  So I was prescribed 0.5 mg of Klonopin up to 3 times a day.  I used this for about 3 weeks.  </p><p>Klonopin does miracles for my anxiety. Even my horrible social anxiety. I never felt any euphoria from the lower doses, and it doesn't seem to hit me at once, but the calming effects gradually increase. I'm not able to tell a peak of the effects either. For me, I just have a surprisingly effective mellow feeling of carelessness and ease.  It basically feels like I'm just in a position of neutrality, without horrible loss of control.  This is something I never thought possible.</p><p>I did notice it has the potential to make me very drowsy.</p><p>It also can be very addictive-I had no problem stopping after 3 weeks, but I also noticed that I really liked this drug and had a psychological desire for more and more of it.  I was careful and decided to use it very sparingly. Now I take it maybe once or twice a month.  Still as effective as ever. It's honestly changed my life and let me deal with situations I used to find impossible. It's a great drug but I would use caution if used.</p>"
