 "report": "<p>My Amanita experience took place on june 12, 2001.  I had not taken any psychedlics in some 3 years, due to a major fear of bad trips.  As far as these mushrooms went, all I knew was that these were 'different' than psilocybin's.  I decided to eat them by themselves (bad idea...they taste AWFUL!!!) with a friend of mine, on a whim at around midnight.  I wound up falling asleep not long after I took them.  The friend that had purchased these mushrooms took notes on my experience until around 3:30 am...she decided to go to sleep because she thought I had fallen asleep.  </p><p>Not long after she went to bed, my trip took a MAJOR turn for the better.  I wound up having the most vivid and intense visions I have ever had in my life.  I thought that I had died...I saw the creation of the universe and other universes.  I came to FULL terms with the reality of existense in this reality, as well as other realities.  Within a half an hour of experiencing all this, I woke myself out of my visionary slumber.  I woke my friends up to have them take better note of what I was doing.  </p><p>I felt drunk and off kilter. My hallucinations were extremely wild, but utterly non-psychedlic.  I wound up going into a complete state of delerium...I was just firing off random words, and was making NO sense, or so my friends say.  </p><p>I tried to wake up my friend who was tripping, but she could NOT be woken up.  She subsequently went for 8 hours without being woken up, and she could not describe her experience for weeks. </p><p>It is a brutally powerful non-psychedelic world, and would freak mosa lot of people out.  Not for the weak minded...</p>"
