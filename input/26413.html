The e tabs below were pink/red snoopies from Canada. We had taken them before with ZERO visuals. We even took the same batch once with small booster doses of 2-c-I and 2-c-t-7  :  3-5 mg apiece, and THIS had no visuals and was a 5 day comedown with hellish paranoia and very little e like effect. I hesitantly tried these pills again, thinking they might not be mdma. I had had them tested with GCMS and was told they WERE nothing but MDMA. I still doubted it after the last experience, which was also done w/o 5-h-tp loading. <br><br>
Something pushed me to take a piracetam with these. I took one tab, and went into an incredibly clean, pure e space, almost as good as my first time. And we only do e every 3-6 months... the comedown was gentle, no sharp drop as usual. And the e ride lasted almost 10 hours. It was not over!  This is what happened next, visuals the likes of which I have not seen on anything but DMT or high dose salvia. But with a totally clear head, as I was over the e by this time. In fact I would still be seeing gorgeous Arthur Rackham style line visuals in surfaces for the next few days. The paranoia was only a twinge this time, and the body pain was confined to a 2 day sharp headache.  I gobbled 5-h-tp in gram quantites before, during and after this experience, along with many grams of ester C.  The Piracetam was 800 mg along with the initial tab, 1 half tab was taken at the 2 and 4 hour mark.<br><br>
VISUALS:<br><br>
I noticed the new small crystal singing bowl was glowing in what looked like pink cuneiform script, but on close examination it was melting into also sanskrit, egyptian heiroglyphs and enochian/(atlantean).<br><br>
I played the bowl a bit and then picked up the large, double terminated crystal we got in china town last year, after dreaming it was there.<br><br>
I looked in the crystal and .... my god!<br><br>
A little blue parakeet, as sharp as high definition TV appeared! He seems to personify some kind of 'librarian'. HE LOOKS exactly like F., our little<br>
budgie!<br><br>
I could name a period of history, any period, and he would summon it. I could see every feather on his body.<br><br>
I went to the Pleistocene Epoch, saw huge armadillo? creatures with shaggy black fur and a white skunk stripe.<br><br>
I saw Heironymous Bosch in his stone studio, painting his great Tryptich!<br><br>
I saw many alien cities with throngs of strange inhabitants.<br><br>
I saw many millions more things, and all the bits of opaque stuff in the crystals was slowly circulating ...like blood and organs. Are crystals 'alive' at a time scale different from ours?<br><br>
This was all like a movie, THAT clear. MORE clear.<br><br>
Always the bird would fly in and clear away a scene and bring on a new one.<br><br>
At one point a graphical option came up with 'layers' of history I could choose from.<br><br>
I saw a pyramid open with blinding light, and a tall, glowing, utterly regal Egyptian Queen come out and greet a flying machine that resembled a beetle.<br><br>
I saw huge, boxy robots eating methane on a frozen moon....<br><br>
many views of the Arthropodic Band, great insect civilizations, many biomechanical ....<br><br>
I am going to practice all next week, I don't want to lose this ability again. I thought it was gone forever.<br><br>
need a larger crystal to enlarge the images, I know now why A.C. strapped the topaz to his head - larger field of vision. many things I saw in the crystal were on the surface of imperfections in the crystal matrix that were no more than 3 or 5 millimeters across...these had incredible detail too, but it took huge concentration to keep them in focus.<br><br>
the entire excercise lasted 45 mins, and was utterly exhausting...., tried to skry the great sphere as well, dimmer amber colored linear designs<br><br>
the animals of the old ice age - more amazing than I even pictured or imagined!<br><br>
I am going to try piracetam with all my serotogenics from now on.<br><br>
One thing I saw was very surprising, I forgot it until the next day. I seemed at one point to be in 2-way visuals with a lovely female humanoid sitting at a complex terminal setup or audio mixer computer? It had racks like a mixing setup. She seemed to see ME! and she was VERY startled!<br><br>
There were also a number of 3-d visuals in the room with us, which I have never had before. I never conceived them as possible. I suspect now my visual skills were probably atrophied by overindulgence in 2-d scrolling video games as a child?<br><br>
These were DMT quality visuals, even better and sharper and I was able to think, speak and deal with them in a very sane and logical manner.<br><br>
Now to get audio also? And more control over the 'channels'? Some of these visuals were obviously being morphed by or drawn from my unconcious, but most of it I believe is really from the 'Memory of Nature'.<br><br>
And this from what is certainly just plain MDMA!  Hail Piracetam? This was TOTALLY unexpected, at a time I am getting less and less from psychedelics, giving them up really.....<!-- End Body -->
