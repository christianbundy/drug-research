This was so scary.  i was looking forward to this party for 4 years and couldn't wait to get on to some good E and dance my @$$ off.  I get to the party which was outdoors and -5 degrees celsius outside, and met up with a friend who knew someone with some extra pills to sell.  I bought 2 off him and ate them right away. (never take something just because you trust your friends).  I was told they were Mitsubishis wich i have done many times.  Looking forward to the high i went out searching for my other friends. (the party was 4000+).  <br><br>
Someohow i ended up sitting on a haybale for an hour by myself.  not smiling, not knowing whether i was happy or sad or scared or high or straight or disappointed.  The longer i sat there trying to sort out my feelings the more lost i got.  My buddy found me and asked how my night was going yadda yadda yadda.  I just looked at him and said i was lost.  When he asked what i meant i almost cried.  Then i shook my head and turned away from him, virtually shutting him out of our conversation.  I no longer wanted anyone to talk to me but at the same time i wanted all my friends to be with me.  Everytime one finally walked by i would smile then hide my face because at last minute i decided i didnt want them around me at all.  <br><br>
Finally i made it to the jungle tent were i sat down and some people from another city hugged me for the next 4 hours and bought me hot chocolate.  People were coming up to me and kissing my forehead and giving me water because i looked horrid.  My eyes kept rolling back in my head about 5 hours after dosing.  Plus i started to get a white cloud floating in front of my eyes.  I felt as if i was watching everything but not actually a part of it.  I felt that i could never be a part of it and that somehow everyone was different and did not want me to be there (except for the people hugging me.)  once people approached me i then believed that they were happy unlike all the others.  I didn't move for 4 hours in total.  I don't know if thats because i was cold, scared or sketching out.  I can't honestly say i knew if i was coming or going.  I Finally stood up and danced at 8am. (8 hours after dosing)  This is when the e kicked in for about 2 hours.<br><br>
After i got home i just became dead to the world for the next 3 days.  I barely spoke or moved.  I had a lot of inner turmoil and had a hard time dealing with every little emotion.<br><br>
i did have some other visuals like when i looked at my glowstick.  But since i did not know what i was on at the time and was panicking i preferred to watch people dance and concentrate on not having any visuals since i do not take drugs which cause hallucinations so this made my experience quite a bit more frightening.<br><br>
I may try it again now that i know what to expect but i recommend people do not take their friends word when it comes to drugs.  Sometimes they dont even know for sure that what your taking is what you wanted.<br><br>
Do drugs.  Dont let them do you.  Stay educated.<!-- End Body -->
