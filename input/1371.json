 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI planned to down a bottle o' tussin and go to the local theatre- I work there so I get to see all the movies scot free- anywayz- I drank a 4 oz bottle about an hour before the showing of I dreamed of Africa- frankly I was disappointed- I've done robo once before- and last time was pure madness- this time- I enjoyed my movie- but the shit wasn't kicking in hard- I was just slightly high.\r\nthe next morning I had to wake up for work feeling as if I had just run the boston marathon- I was dead tired- and I was shitting water the next day- I still think DXM has some potential- but I'll try a more closely monitored dose next tiume- and I think I'm sticking to pills next time- all in all- not an especially bad experience- but not especially good either.\n\n\n"
