A close friend of mine is getting ready to leave for a 6 month trip to Bolivia. This being his last weekend here, we decided to throw a party for <br>
him. He and another friend had both expressed some interest in trying <br>
methylone after I had discussed it with them, and this seemed like the <br>
perfect opportunity. Although I'd done it the past weekend, I decided to <br>
join them, so I measured out three doses of 150mg each and brought them to <br>
the party. I had considered bringing higher doses, but I figured it would <br>
be better to start them low and see how they respond. The setting of the <br>
party was at a friends house, with at most 20 people present, a DJ playing <br>
music, party decorations, snacks, etc. A typical social gathering. <br><br>
At around 9 PM, I told my two friends that I'd brought the <br>
methylone and asked if they were still interested. They mentioned some <br>
mixed feelings, worried that this would be another 'shitty internet drug' <br>
that would leave them feeling poisoned (as some tryptamines and 2C-T-7 <br>
had), but they decided to give it a shot after I reassured them this <br>
wasn't another pukefest trip. We all dosed together at around 9:15. The <br>
first friend is a male, age 22. I don't know his weight, but he's kind of <br>
large. The second friend is female, also 22, weighing probably around 110 <br>
pounds. Both are very experienced psychedelics users, having used LSD, <br>
psilocybin, MDMA, mescaline, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DMT (ayahuasca), 5-MeO-DIPT, <br>
2C-T-7, and perhaps a few others. While both like psychedelics in general, <br>
the nausea of ayahuasca and 2C-T-7 and the hideous experience of snorting <br>
DPT has left them somewhat skeptical about many of the currently available <br>
analogues. I can certainly understand this position. <br><br>
At around 9:45, we all began to feel initial effects. The girl said 'I <br>
feel good 'several times, sounding almost surprised. The guy said it felt <br>
like the initial phase of a psychedelic. By 10 PM, we were all more or <br>
less at peak effects. They both described the effects as being similar to <br>
the initial phase of MDMA, but toned down and subtly different. We went <br>
for a short walk outside under the full Purim moon, which was brightly <br>
illuminating the large yard. It was pretty cold, but this didn't seem to <br>
bother anyone.  <br><br>
Socializing was definately enhanced, but there was none of the <br>
emotional outpouring of MDMA. It was a nice friendly evening. All of us <br>
felt that it was a very relaxed and happy state of mind. By around 11:30, <br>
we were all coming down. Smoking some cannabis seemed to diminish most of <br>
the remaining effects, though it seemed to enhance some aspects. By 12:30 <br>
AM, the guy was feeling a little tired and decided to go home. I stayed <br>
until around 2 AM before I felt comfortable driving home. <br><br>
Both my friends expressed a willingness to do it again, but at a <br>
higher dose. <br><br>
Personally, I found no noticable difference between this 150mg <br>
experience and the 120mg experience of the past weekend (less than a week <br>
elapsed - Sunday afternoon to Friday night). I wonder if tolerance played <br>
a role? Probably. Were it not for the fact that my friend was going to <br>
Bolivia, I would not have taken it again so soon. I think taking this drug <br>
more than once a month would be a waste... not to mention an unnecessary <br>
risk, considering the highly experimental nature of this chemical. Taking <br>
this drug in a social setting was much more rewarding than taking it by <br>
myself - the exact opposite of MDMA. I would like to try it in a situation <br>
such as a nature hike with 2 or 3 friends... I suspect that would be the <br>
optimal use for this material.<!-- End Body -->
