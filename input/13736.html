I started off by taking 25mg orally.  I washed it down with a soft drink.  The taste was not good but did not linger at all.  Within about an hour i felt like i was on some form of speed.  I could not sit still.  I was extremely talkative.  After about an hour i snorted approximately 5mg.  The burn was intense but subsided quickly.  My mind started to slow down a little and everything in the room started pulsing.  After another hour i snorted another 5mg.  <br><br>
My friends were talking about how they felt like they were on mdma.  I was skeptical because i wasnt feeling anything like that.  10 minutes later i understood everything they were saying.  I had a sense of calmness and felt like i should look out for and take care of everyone in the room.  Once i felt that, i decided to snort 5 more milligrams.  <br><br>
After the last i snorted i started to get visuals.  the walls were flexing and the floors were swirling.  I would have to say be careful though.  I found it easy to dehydrate.  I didnt get thirsty i just felt kind of sick to my stomach and my head had a slight throb.  I drank some water and felt fine.  <br><br>
Another thing i noticed was the willingness to do any form of drug.  I probably would have kept doing it if we hadnt of run out.  I remember taking some ibuprofen for a headache and thinking to my self 'if 2 are good then 10 are better.'  It was very startling.  After about 10 hours i decided to try and get some sleep.  <br><br>
I smoked a few bowls and noticed that it brought everything back to a previous level.  I finally went to sleep.  For the first part of my sleep i was lucid dreaming.  I could control every aspect of my dream.  When i woke up i felt fine.  I would definately try it again.<!-- End Body -->
