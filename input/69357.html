I've been on Atenolol, a beta blocker, for only a few weeks, taking half a 25mg dosage to start (sometimes another 1/4 mid-day if my blood pressure spikes).  I was fearful of the combination and of course, didn't think I could ask the doctor!<br><br>
I took one very good E, later followed by another hours later, and another hours later.  The latter 2 were duds from what my fellow partiers reported.  In any case, my trip was awesome and I felt better than usual the next morning.<br><br>
I was previously on Azor, a calcium channel blocker. These made my blood pressure symptoms worse and after taking 2 E one night, I thought I was going to have a stroke or heart attack throughout the next day.  I felt horrible. My heart was speeding, pounding and beating erratically. My head and ears were pounding.  Do not try this combination!!<!-- End Body -->
