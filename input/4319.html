I went on a short hike through the redwoods forest at night, finding an ideal spot nestled between four huge trees, on the edge of a stream, to sit down and experiment with Salvia Divinorum in a safe outdoors setting (a first for me). <br><br>
I sat down, propping my back against the tree that seemed 'friendliest', took two small hits off the pipe, and closed my eyes. One-thousand-one, one thousand-two... shortly the familiar tingling filled my body with green icicles, and I found myself again lauched into salvia space.<br><br>
This time, I felt/saw my body as an energy reservoir, leaning against a much bigger and older energy reservoir that was the tree. I could feel it's roots go deep into the earth, and extend laterally out towards the other trees. Suddenly I felt as if the trees were watching me, silent witnesses, friendly but neutral, and so old. I felt these trees and roots as green energy currents. Next, I was drawn again into my own body, my spine seeming like a sort of hollow column of energy, with a bulb, like the end of a thermometer, at the bottom, the area of my coccyx. The colors in that column were extraordinary. Were the trees showing me something special about my body? Pondering that thought seemed to bring me out of the trance. <br><br>
After a few moments of digesting what just happened, I got up, thanked the tree by placing at it's base a small offering of some sage incense I had brought along, and walked out of the forest. I felt very lucky to have had a chance to connect and learn from these wonderful beings.<!-- End Body -->
