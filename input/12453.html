Me and two of my buddies each took 5 grams of these mushrooms, which came from one of our good friends.  They were ordered from a retailer in Indiana, who was selling them as poisonous non-consumables.  We took them at about 6:00 PM, I crushed mine up and mixed them with applesauce, and my buddies preferred to just munch them down.  We waited with much anticipation for about an hour, while just chilling out.  <br><br>
After about an hour, my friend told me that my pupils looked a little big, but I felt normal.  We went back and took 3g more, in hopes that this would start the trip.  Nothing happened whatsoever.  There was a period of about 30 minutes, when we where outside smoking a cigarette, where we noted that we all felt 'cracked out,' as if we were on the downside of a trip.  There was never any body buzz, auditory or visual halucinations, or any sense of trippin.  The only noted side effect was stomach cramps, and rank gas.  What a waste of money in my opinion.  I have tried mushrooms,exstacy, cocaine, and marijuana before and had great times.  The experience produced no desireable results at all.  A fuckin waste of money and time.  I'll stick to my other drugs and the mushrooms that make me trip, none of this feeling sick or cracked out bullshit.<!-- End Body -->
