 "report": "<p>I noticed Flexeril, my favorite non-entheogen, seems to have a quasi-bad rap. A while back I was having a problem with stress induced migraines interfering with my vision. A neurologist ascribed this to tension in my neck. I was given first a combo of Flexeril (10mg) and medrin (??). I had taken Flexeril before courtesy of my father for muscle strain from excessive strength training; but only once.     </p><p>Getting a script to Flexeril was a god send. I was floating. Nothing I had ever taken has come close to Flexeril in sheer muscle relaxation, wonderful for doing exercises similar to the san'ti posture in xing yi. I can do my standing chi gung for many times what I could take before and muscle tremors never happen (also energy in the body seemed to be more subtle and smooth in its flow, hard to describe. I also noticed that mentally it was easy to find one pointedness, in fact it was hard to avoid it, but enlightenment on Flexeril is a far cry from the truth). Soon however I had eaten my two bottles full and to fill the void my neurologist prescribed me neurontin and some sort of migraine nose spray. I touched neither. He also suggested I get botox in my neck to help the tension. I never called him again after that. </p><p>Give me Flexeril or give me death.</p>"
