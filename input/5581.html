Throughout my life I have sampled many drugs, however I never felt a need to get more of a drug until I tried crack.  I thought I could handle trying just about anything once. My friend had been smoking crack for a couple months and I always hassled him about it because I was worried, but he said I didn't understand because I had never tried it.  So one day my friend came over and I agreed to try it so I could maybe understand.  <br><br>
Well that day all we did was smoke rock after rock, until we ran out.  Then he took out more money and we bought more crack.  I personally do not like how crack makes me feel, the only reason I continued to smoke more was because my body was telling me to.  My friend says it's the best high, I however disagree. It simply makes my heart race, ruins my attention span and it made me feel very lethargic.  <br><br>
Smoking crack is something that will affect me for the rest of my life.  When people told me crack was highly addictive I thought 'yeah, whatever, so is cocaine and I do that sometimes and never crave it.' Well there's a big difference.  My cravings to smoke crack have yet to leave me and I didn't even enjoy it.  Everyday it crosses my mind, at least once.  I am honestly scared this craving will never leave me.<br><br>
Trying crack to understand my friend's problem was a huge mistake because not only have I caused problems within myself but now I can honestly say I understand my friend's problem and that makes me so scared for my friend because I know he is weak in the face of temptation.<!-- End Body -->
