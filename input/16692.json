 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nA close friend of mine is getting ready to leave for a 6 month trip to Bolivia. This being his last weekend here, we decided to throw a party for \r\nhim. He and another friend had both expressed some interest in trying \r\nmethylone after I had discussed it with them, and this seemed like the \r\nperfect opportunity. Although I'd done it the past weekend, I decided to \r\njoin them, so I measured out three doses of 150mg each and brought them to \r\nthe party. I had considered bringing higher doses, but I figured it would \r\nbe better to start them low and see how they respond. The setting of the \r\nparty was at a friends house, with at most 20 people present, a DJ playing \r\nmusic, party decorations, snacks, etc. A typical social gathering. \r\nAt around 9 PM, I told my two friends that I'd brought the \r\nmethylone and asked if they were still interested. They mentioned some \r\nmixed feelings, worried that this would be another 'shitty internet drug' \r\nthat would leave them feeling poisoned (as some tryptamines and 2C-T-7 \r\nhad), but they decided to give it a shot after I reassured them this \r\nwasn't another pukefest trip. We all dosed together at around 9:15. The \r\nfirst friend is a male, age 22. I don't know his weight, but he's kind of \r\nlarge. The second friend is female, also 22, weighing probably around 110 \r\npounds. Both are very experienced psychedelics users, having used LSD, \r\npsilocybin, MDMA, mescaline, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DMT (ayahuasca), 5-MeO-DIPT, \r\n2C-T-7, and perhaps a few others. While both like psychedelics in general, \r\nthe nausea of ayahuasca and 2C-T-7 and the hideous experience of snorting \r\nDPT has left them somewhat skeptical about many of the currently available \r\nanalogues. I can certainly understand this position. \r\nAt around 9:45, we all began to feel initial effects. The girl said 'I \r\nfeel good 'several times, sounding almost surprised. The guy said it felt \r\nlike the initial phase of a psychedelic. By 10 PM, we were all more or \r\nless at peak effects. They both described the effects as being similar to \r\nthe initial phase of MDMA, but toned down and subtly different. We went \r\nfor a short walk outside under the full Purim moon, which was brightly \r\nilluminating the large yard. It was pretty cold, but this didn't seem to \r\nbother anyone.  \r\nSocializing was definately enhanced, but there was none of the \r\nemotional outpouring of MDMA. It was a nice friendly evening. All of us \r\nfelt that it was a very relaxed and happy state of mind. By around 11:30, \r\nwe were all coming down. Smoking some cannabis seemed to diminish most of \r\nthe remaining effects, though it seemed to enhance some aspects. By 12:30 \r\nAM, the guy was feeling a little tired and decided to go home. I stayed \r\nuntil around 2 AM before I felt comfortable driving home. \r\nBoth my friends expressed a willingness to do it again, but at a \r\nhigher dose. \r\nPersonally, I found no noticable difference between this 150mg \r\nexperience and the 120mg experience of the past weekend (less than a week \r\nelapsed - Sunday afternoon to Friday night). I wonder if tolerance played \r\na role? Probably. Were it not for the fact that my friend was going to \r\nBolivia, I would not have taken it again so soon. I think taking this drug \r\nmore than once a month would be a waste... not to mention an unnecessary \r\nrisk, considering the highly experimental nature of this chemical. Taking \r\nthis drug in a social setting was much more rewarding than taking it by \r\nmyself - the exact opposite of MDMA. I would like to try it in a situation \r\nsuch as a nature hike with 2 or 3 friends... I suspect that would be the \r\noptimal use for this material.\n\n\n"
