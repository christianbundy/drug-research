I'm no heavy smoker of tobacco by any means; I smoke with friends at parties, but only then. In fact, I find most tobacco coming out of the U.S. to be somewhat unpleasant. However, I do enjoy tobacco snuff, which is hard to come by in my area, particularly if you are a minor with not a lot of money for gas to get to a smoke shop.<br><br>
My friend mentioned that at the gas station he works they carry snuff. I paid him 5 dollars for what he and I thought was snuff, but it turned out to be dip or chewing tobacco (the container has the word snuff on it for some reason.) I gave most of it away to kids who do chew, but kept a small pile for myself. I had chewed once or twice before, but threw up after loading my mouth with some foul vanilla flavored dip.  I decided to give it another shot, this time using much less.<br><br>
The usual head rush commenced, followed by the 'ick' feeling people who hate tobacco say they despise. This only lasted a minute. Next came an overwhelming calm which was border line euphoric. I ate lunch with no problems. In fact, the stuff wore off just in time, allowing me to have a pretty hearty appetite.<br><br>
I did another pinch and enjoyed it even more. I suppose the dose and variety is important. I have enjoyed this experience, and would like to partake of the gold leaf in this manner occasionally. I don't need to stain my teeth with shredded tobacco: for that I have coca-cola, which I have developed a minor addiction to (yes, the soft drink).<br><br>
I prefer snuff overall, but this type of dip is pretty damn pleasant.<!-- End Body -->
