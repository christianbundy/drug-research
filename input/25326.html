	The plan was to take a good dose of methylone, about 200mg, and add to that a medium sized smoked dosage of DPT at around the peak. I had heard before that DPT smoked at the peak of an MDMA experience was particularly magical, and seeing as how I haven't seen any reports on the combination with methylone instead, I decided it could be worth a try. I have quite a bit of past experience with smoked DPT, it being one of my favorite tryptamines, and prior to this experience I had tried methylone twice at 200mg. So, feeling fairly comfortable about my experience with each drug, I went ahead and took the 200mg of methylone and got on my computer to wait for it to come on. Probably what is most amazing about methylone is that it comes on so quickly. Granted, I hadn't eaten anything significant for about five hours, but still, to be feeling the effect of the drug within 30 minutes is amazing to me. At the time I knew that I wasn't at the peak yet, and so I decided to wait another 30 minutes or so before smoking the DPT. I unfortunately have not had any experience with any other MDMA-type drugs, but if methylone is any indication of them as a whole, then I'm sure I'd like them all. While it doesn't cause any sort of visual distortion for me (which I've heard others will occasionally experience), there is definitely a psychedelic mindset. Probably the most interesting part about the thirty minutes that I sat waiting to peak was amazing feeling of breathing. I recommend that anyone who tries methylone (and probably any of the other related compounds) get in a comfortable position and just breathe deeply. Not only does it feel amazingly good, but if you do some simple breath counting, it's much easier to reach pretty interesting meditative states.<br><br>
	But enough about just the methylone. It had been an hour since I ingested it, and I was definitely going strong at this point, so, with much effort, I convinced myself to stand up, abandon my wonderfully pleasant breathing exercises, and walk to my room where I had already prepared the DPT. Recently I've had some fairly difficult reactions to DPT, so while I was trying to combination out in order to see how the methylone compared to other?s reports of MDMA, I was also trying it in the hopes that the positive methylone-mindset would influence the DPT in a good direction. I think that definitely was the case. I smoked 40mg of DPT, turned on my favorite tripping music, and then turned off my lights to lie down and experience. The first thing I noticed was that the experience seemed 'duller' than usual. That may have been a consequence of only smoking a medium-sized dose (although usually 40mg would be plenty!), or it could be that I didn?t smoke all of the DPT and I thought I did, or it could be some kind of reaction between the DPT and the methylone. Who knows? I will say that classic DPT vibrations in combination with the heightened sensitivity from the methylone were pretty amazing. I was also right in assuming that the methylone would help to curb the fear that I have experienced the past few times I've tried smoking DPT. <br><br>
	Overall, the physical side of the experience was wonderful, most pleasant in every way. As far as my thought-processes go, I found this to be a veritable gold-mine. As soon as I realized that the methylone had effectively stopped 'the fear', I started thinking about exactly WHY I was afraid anyway. After I realized that I had more thoughts than I could remember floating around up in my head, I decided to get back on the computer and start writing. I spent the next five hours or so trying to document, in rough fashion, all the thoughts flying around upstairs. Probably the most beneficial aspect of this combination is that the DPT caused the classic psychedelic flurry of thoughts, and the methylone allowed me to approach all of them without any kind of fear or apprehension about what I might find. This is, of course, a wonderful setup for introspection, and introspection is what I got. <br><br>
        I'm not sure, however, if the combination would be worth trying again. As I said, the DPT was somewhat 'dull' to me this time, and it almost seems as though it's just a desecration of what is already a wonderful drug experience. Methylone by itself is certainly capable of causing the same kind of intense introspection that I experienced with this combination, I know that from past experience, and I just can't seem to shake the feeling that adding DPT to the mix was unnecessary. Why change what's already great? I am glad that I tried it this once, though, and I'd say that anyone else with the required materials and the desire to experiment would probably have a rewarding experience, but I personally will be leaving this combination behind me.<!-- End Body -->
