I had been reading about Kava Kava on the net, and it sounded pleasant to me, judging from the various reports.  So, my friend Kyle (140 lbs.) and I rolled up some blunts with pipe tobacco and cannabis, smoked at the beach, and decided to go get some.<br><br>
The GNC was still open, so we drove over to the mall, and picked up a bottle of 90 500mg capsules of the root powder.  It wasnt the concentrated kind, just the regular.  Was that a mistake?  So we take the bottle home, and empty out all the pills into a couple plastic baggies, and mix ALL of it with a can of Kerns Coconut Pineapple nectar.  I also added a little canola oil, to help it mix together.  I dont have a blender, which might have been another mistake, but we whisked it up pretty good, and it seemed to dissolve well.<br><br>
We were left with a milkshake-like drink, which we split, chased with another can of nectar, and some water.  The first half of it was actually somewhat pleasant-tasting to me (and only me), but the last few gulps were somewhat hard to get down.  Certainly a lot easier than drinking that much hard alcohol.  By the way, by the time we ended up drinking it at 8:30pm, I wasnt feeling the effects of the marihuana at all, which was good because I wanted to  feel the Kava Kava alone.  After we drank it, I was actually a little worried we had taken too much, as 45 pills worth each seemed like kind of a lot.<br><br>
But, after about 45 mins, I really wasnt feeling much of a bodily change.  I started to feel a little more relaxed, but also a little anxious, like before I drop MDMA, because I wasnt sure what to expect.  So, an hour after drinking the stuff, at 9:30, we split a pre-mixed alcoholic drink, as to quicken the effects of the Kava.  That seemed to have little effect, other then the alcohols.  About a half-hour after that, we went to the beach and smoked some leftover cannabis, and some resin we had collected off some bong slides.  Again, nothing but the usual high.<br><br>
My friend kind of veged out on the couch for a while.  I was dissapointed by the whole thing, because other then a slight change initially, I really didnt feel much at all from all the Kava.  I was expecting a lot more from the amount we took.   I still want to try some of the Kava from Hawaii, and perhaps next time Ill look further into prep methods, but overall, a waste of time.<!-- End Body -->
