 "report": "<p>My wife was prescribed Tramadol for a headache treatment, she had never taken it before.</p><p>She took 50mg followed by 50mg 0.5h later. In an hour a whole set of unpleasant effects appeared:</p><p>- nausea</p><p>- dizzyness</p><p>- agitation</p><p>- dry mouth and pale face</p><p>She almost fainted but ended up in a toilet vomiting heavily. The next 12 hours were spent either in the toilet vomiting or trying to sleep but couldn't. The headache came back stronger. Now it's 14 hours since she took it and she's far from feeling well. Drunk water is thrown up every time she tries to sip a bit so if it continues there's a possibility of dehydration.</p>"
