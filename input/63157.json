 "report": "<p>I read the report of the guy who took three cigarettes and made tea, I think he overdosed. So I decided to try just one cigarette.</p><p>I got a Marlboro Light from my friend 'A'. I got home and cut it open and put the tobacco into a tea ball (a metal mesh thing for making tea) and brewed it with almost boiling water. The tea smelled great. I took sips of it and noticed that it burnt my throat. Halfway through the cup, I began to feel nauseous. But I forced myself to drink it and went to take a shower.</p><p>While I was taking a shower, I felt even worse. I got out and went downstairs to dinner, I began to feel better. After I finished eating I felt the nicotine buzz come on. It was like a mild buzz, but still good! So the tea took about 30 minutes to take effect. Then the feeling grew stronger and I was very relaxed but focused. I called my friend 'B' and told him that it was great!</p><p>I would advise anyone that wants to try this to start out with small amounts of tobacco because it is very easy to overdose. I think my initial nausea was from the taste of the tea, which doesn't make sense because, it tasted very good! I will try this again with a regular cigarette instead of a Light.</p>"
