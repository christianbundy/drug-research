One day I was at a relatives house and I wanted to get high.  I had no herb.  No alcohol.  Nothing.  But then I remembered that my Uncle had been trying to quit smoking and had a bunch of Nicotine patches among other things.  I have never been much of a smoker, Just a Cig now and then.  I did a little reaearch and figured 7 would be a safe dosage.  Now they are supposed to enter your bloodstream over the course of 12 hours, so having seven on is about 12mgs an hour.  I put them on and went walking around Boston.  It was fun I had a huge Nicotine buzz and I even smoked a Stog for good measure. Well after about 2 hours I got home and grubbed.  Man I was loaded.  I wasn't scared because I knew the LD50 was something like 81 mgs.  I just sat around enjoyin a kind of light headed care-free stupor.<br><br>
Then the nausea hit.  I tried to get over it but couldn't.  I ran to the bathroom and puked.  I had never thrown up because of drugs before and it sucked.  I thought I was done but I kept vomiting and had dry heaves after.  Finally I took off the patches and sat around.  It was over as soon as it started.  I walked to the skate shop a bit tired but alot smarter.  I didn't even pick up a ciggarette fo r at least 6 months after that.<!-- End Body -->
