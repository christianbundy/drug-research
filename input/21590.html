Recently many people have started using it to refer to both A. peregrina AND A. colubrina. This report specified only 'yopo' so we do not know the exact identity of the seeds used.]</font><br><br>
After researching for a good source of DMT and 5meodmt for extraction, I found a website with a large amount of yopo seeds for a good price.  After getting the package I decided i would try smoking the seeds straight without the use of extraction just to test things out.  I peeled the shell off of the seeds and cut up and crushed as much of the material as possible (next time i'd recommend a coffee grinder).  I then smoked the seeds through a water bong.  <br><br>
I got about 2 hits before i started feeling the effects, and i wasn't even through with the bowl yet.  My face all of a sudden felt very hot and was tingling.  I suddenly got extremely nauseous and ran outside to throw up.  I ended up not throwing up but instead sat down in the grass and started enjoying the trip.  I had cev's and patterning and a very pleasant feelings overall.  The effects lasted about 10 minutes and then came down slowly after that.  I would say it was about a ++, very pleasant and worth the nausea.<!-- End Body -->
