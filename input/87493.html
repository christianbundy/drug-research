I've had the privilege to enjoy a wide variety of drugs in my life so far. My preference tends to the slightly energizing and mind-opening. My experience with nootropics is fairly extensive too and I've recently been working with combinations to find what I like.<br><br>
My best friend M had purchased some Olmifon from an online vendor. He praised the stuff more than anything and he's played with the smart drugs at least as much as I. So he gave me two pills to try, recommending I take them at the same time for maximum effect. I also had a container of piracetam powder that I figured I would add just for a kick.<br><br>
8:45 am (T+ 0)<br>
On a Saturday morning, I wake up with several chores on my plate. I take both Olmifon pills just after waking. I'm a habitual coffee drinker, so I roll out of bed and make a tall pot of double brew.<br><br>
T+ 0:25<br>
I've finished drinking my first cup of coffee while standing over the stove cooking a bacon and potato breakfast. <br><br>
T+ 0:50<br>
I sit down to breakfast with M. I've finished my second cup of coffee and I'm beginning to feel a slight head change, most likely from the adrafinil. He said full effects would be noticed by an hour; this seemed to add up.<br><br>
T+ 1:30<br>
After a third cup of coffee I'm thoroughly awake (I normally drink 2 on weekdays) and the adrafinil is creeping into my motivation center, working some serious magic. I've never felt this genuinely motivated!<br><br>
T+ 2:00<br>
I feel like I just did 3 lines of some really good coke. The body buzz is ridiculous for just caffeine and adrafinil! With caffeine alone I never feel a perceptible buzz, but this is amazing! Adding piracetam would only amplify this effect.<br><br>
T+ 2:45<br>
After moving around lots of furniture and cleaning half of the upstairs main room, M and I share a bowl of 'purple berry' for a break. I mix up a strongly flavored drink containing 5.02 g (centigram-scale-assured) of vile-tasting piracetam. I chug it with chagrin and wash it down with a fourth and final cup of coffee (at ~T+ 3:00). Normally weed pleasantly numbs my mind one level down from pure racing thoughts, but the adrafinil punches straight through with a persistent clarity.<br><br>
T+ 3:10<br>
The piracetam is hitting already. I haven't taken it in weeks because of the disgusting plasticky bitterness (far worse than any amphetamine), and the razor sharp mental edge is slicing though every puff of mental fog. I'd been having a remarkably good conversation about theoretical physics with M while helping him with chores. We jump through the conversation faster than we normally would. The cocaine-like buzz wore off slightly only to be replaced by a more pleasurable 4-way mix of cognitively active drugs.<br><br>
T+ 4:00<br>
M and I have been testing each other's mental abilities (something we do when we enjoy any drug experience together, LSD included) with mental math and trivia, and we were shocking ourselves and each other with our temporary mental nimbleness. We continue working on his house, now mostly finished.<br><br>
T+ 5:00 (1:45 pm)<br>
I feel astoundingly productive and motivated. I'm able to think extremely fast and accurately, or conversely focus all of my attention to performing a single task. I suppose that since all four of the substances in my body are focus aides to me on their own, I'm enjoying a hyper-focused state where I have complete control over my attention. I'm typically very scatter-brained and have ADD tendencies, but I feel completely on point. Knowing I have chores to do at my own apartment, I go home and clean the kitchen and my bedroom.<br><br>
T+ 5:35<br>
I was beginning to feel an enormous amount of unrooted inner tension, definitely drug-induced, so I run through my extended yoga routine. This takes me about 75 minutes listening to a recorded track of my own voice telling me what to do. This is by far the most enjoyable 75 minutes of my day, and perhaps even my week. I have NEVER been this relaxed. I was beginning to believe the mounting tension would persist through my routine, but if anything this mix helped me relax further. <br><br>
T+ 7:10<br>
I toke a small bowl to myself and then take a shower. I emerge feeling very refreshed. Happy with my productivity for the day, I sit down at the computer and play a few hours of online first person shooter. I notice my reaction time is nothing short of top notch, and my accuracy is up above my average.<br><br>
T+ 10:15 (7:00 pm)<br>
Still feeling as energized as I did 7 hours ago, I start cooking dinner: Greek gyro sandwiches. My whole group of best friends all gather at M's place to eat. We smoke repeated bowls, like always, as we eat. My head hasn't stopped feeling completely clear and still piracetam-sharp, despite the large amount of weed we smoke.<br><br>
T+ ~15:15 (midnight)<br>
I can't describe my amazement at my unrelenting motivation. I've cleaned M's entire kitchen, two rooms downstairs, and finished cleaning the main upstairs room while everyone else was downstairs drinking. I know that alcohol would only cut down my up-ness, so I refrain. We continue smoking even more weed, including a fat blunt of the same high quality, and by now I'm very, very high. The clarity is still there, though, but it is fading. The piracetam has worn completely off by now, and most of the caffeine from earlier is gone, but the adrafinil persists.<br><br>
T+ ~18:00<br>
I went home around 1:30 (T+ 16:45) and since then I've been working non-stop on adding to incomplete songs I've written. I feel no inkling of tiredness and I have no desire or reason to sleep, so I do this for a while.<br><br>
T+ ~21:00<br>
Still fully awake and alert, I play some more first person shooter. I'm not doing as well as earlier, but I'm still doing very well. <br><br>
T+ 22:15<br>
The sun is up and I'm still fully awake. I'm not getting annoyed with it either, I just feel consistently motivated and alert. I can tell my brain is slightly tired from the beginning of excessive waking hours, but I only barely notice it. <br><br>
T+ 25:15 (10:00 am Sunday)<br>
The adrafinil is just now beginning to wear off, in combination with a slight delirium. I'm awake enough to do a couple loads of laundry, and I watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on netflix.<br><br>
T+ ~27:15<br>
The adrafinil effect is mostly gone, being overtaken by delirium and mental exhaustion. The amount of stress my mind was under for the last 27 hours shows in how much my higher reasoning regions don't want to work. Math and complex planning are both impossible, and my reaction time feels very slow. <br><br>
T+ 28:30<br>
Tired of being awake and no longer able to focus, I go to bed. I sleep very deeply and restfully for only about 4 and a half hours, waking up at about 5 pm quite alert. <br><br>
For the rest of Sunday, I did what schoolwork I could. Around dinner time my brain was working at normal levels of speed and focus. I went to bed at 1 am Monday morning and woke up at 8:30 to get ready for classes like I always do.<br><br>
Conclusion: adrafinil is no joke. It has a strong euphoric potential that's opened up by caffeine. It's also the most motivating drug I've ever taken. It truthfully seemed like the natural state of being hyper motivated was simply switched on. I was very productive that day, and filled it with non-stop activities. I'm pretty sure that if I had redosed some more adrafinil I would have stayed awake much longer. I've read that people can stay up 5 days straight on adrafinil without losing focus or motivation. Adding piracetam to the mix potentiates all drugs, and weed is always great to add to any new drug experience. As for caffeine, it is more than meets the eye. The interaction it has with adrafinil is surprising and interesting. I really honestly did feel a pronounced cocaine-like floaty feeling and buzz from only those two in concert, not to mention being supremely motivated.<br><br>
I recommend all of the stuff I used on this day, especially adrafinil. This stuff is truly a wonder drug.<!-- End Body -->
