I am not someone who really does any drugs, althought the occasional marijuana is used.  However,  I have had some odd things happen to me that were totally by luck.  The first thing was sleep deprivation.  I wasn't doing it on purpose, but after a couple months I found that if I get, say, 4 hours of sleep per night, the first week or soo will be hell, but then my body gets used to it.  I won't always be tired, but if I am sitting, say, in a boring class or lecture, after around 5 minutes, it may seem impossible to stay awake.  However, I found with practice, this can be avoided. However, with sleep deprivation, there seems to be a mixture of conciouness, almost like I can fall asleep while still being awake.  <br><br>
It's like I don't know when I actually fall asleep, I will just all of the sudden realize that things don't make sence, and BAM I wakee up.  I don't fall asleep for long, ususally no longer than 30 seconds.  (for me)<br><br>
Another thing that I found very interesting was something that I later found to be oxygen deprivation. I simply hold my breath and bend my back over a chair I may be sitting in (I bend it as far as I can).  I Hold this until I start to feel a little dizzy. I come back up, and start breathing normally.  It's nothing big, but I will feel slight euphoria, colors will be brighter. My feeling may be dulled, and things like talking may seem confusing.<!-- End Body -->
