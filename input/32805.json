 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nWell, I'm not a smoker. So nicotine hits me quite hard. One day I was quite nervous and I took a cig from a friend of mine and smoked it in 1 minute or so. After throwing away the filter the nicotine hit me. I was really fucked! My cordination was fucked, I saw many colors, I just felt GOOD! The nicotine buzz is cool, but when I am addicted to nicotine, I just need it. I don't feel anything like that anymore.\n\n\n"
