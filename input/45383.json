 "report": "<p>I  recently received powdered Virola Theidora resin.  About 1/8 tsp. of a snuff was prepared by mixing 2 parts resin with 1 part baking soda (Yopo style) with mortar and pestle.  A self-snuffing device was fashioned so as to be able to blow the powder into the nose rather than snort it into the nose.  The snuff was ingested.  </p><p>In about 30 seconds an extremely powerful burn and ache up into the sinuses came on along with a pressure and change of skin color in the face to light purple (like that attained with bufotenine but lighter).  A very mild A. Colubrina (probably bufotenine) high was felt. Very mild.  Not sure if it was just from the pain and histamine reaction to the snuff in the nasal way and sinuses or to the chemical contents.  The pain became intense enough to drive me to blow my nose and sneeze continuously for 25 minutes.  That was about 45 minutes ago and pain is still subsiding.   No hallucinations.  No afterglow.  </p><p>A definite head change but perhaps no different than had I snorted Cayenne pepper up my nose.</p>"
