 "report": "<p>I have recently acquired a tobacco called dokha which is quite popular in the U.A.E. This tobacco is traditionally smoked in a pipe called a midwakh.  This tobacco is the most potent I have experienced yet.  </p><p>It is morning, I have eaten a small breakfast and drank 0.5 liters of water. I load up my midwakh which holds a very small amount of dohka, the bowl holds an amount approximately the size of one's finger tip.  </p><p>In it's container the dokha smells reminiscent of tea, very earthy with a subtle sweetness.  As I light the bowl, I note that the smoke is rather harsh yet not unbearable.  I take around 3 puffs, holding each in my lungs for 2 seconds.  At this point the 'dokha effect' makes itself known.  A strong head rush occurs which is not unlike the head rush associated with cannabis.  After  this subsides my limbs feel heavy and I feel a numbing sensation in my face.  These effects subside after about 15 minutes and the rest of the day I feel an afterglow of sorts, feeling relaxed and pleasant.</p>"
