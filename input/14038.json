 "report": "</p>\nI thought i'd share a little general information about 4meopp since I found out there isnt one. At first glace you notice it is in the PIPERAZINES family. But an actual experience showed me that its on the boarderlines of a psychedelic more then just the normal piperazine type stimulant.</p><p>It is a weird colored purple. Doesn't smell like much but when insuffalated it burns rather quickly but tends to leave fast, also produces a nasty drip. </p><p>Oral doses range from 100mg-500mg. 500mg is the largest dose I've read about being taken that was from 200mg first then 300mg redosed about 3 hours later. The higher the doses the more it felt like a trip instead of just a stimulant high. The effects are; Euphoria, body chills, minor visuals, and sweating. With redosing the pupils tend to dialate.  Hope I could help pass around some information.</p>"
