I have never experimented with any opiates or opioids stronger than oxycodone and hydrocodone.  But these I have much experience with.  I have dosed oxycodone about four times in my life, hydrocodone about 10, ODing on it once.  I almost always take my dope orally.  I tried administrating the drug by snorting a few times but concluded it wasn't effective, considering both hydrocodone and oxycodone come w/ about 100 mg of aspirin or tylenol per pill.  That is a lot of material to snort--hard on your nose.  I have never attempted to ingest either drug by IV.  I believe using a needle to administer opiates, opioids, and stimulants is solely a tool for addicts to make the drug more effective.  Believing myself to be no addict, I never use a needle.<br><br>
Approximately twenty minutes after ingestion the old familiar warmness, itchy, euphoric feelings set in.  The euphoric feelings began to intensify until reaching a plateau for about three hours 50 minutes after ingestion.  At this point, speech was slurred considerably, but nothing a little concentration couldn't handle, coordination was very impaired, the body is very relaxed and at peace, and small but pleasant, vertigo-like feelings were felt, however, nothing nearly as strong as 4th-plateau DXM trips or even Acid.<br><br>
On opioids, no visuals are seen nor desired to be seen.  Little interest is taken upon the world--no fascination with pretty flowers, or a blue sky; Its more of an oblivious, 'spaced out' feeling high.  Mental cloudiness is present, making thinking hard.  But this proves to be no obstacle--talking is very easy.  Talking intelligently isn't however- but can be achieved with a little willpower.<br><br>
The duration of these opioids are about 3-5 hours.  When completely down--a very relaxing sensation is felt through out the body--leaving you with no desire for more.<br><br>
It can be ultimately said that while acid makes you use 80% of your brain, opioids make you use 1% of it.  Opioids and Opiates truely narrow your view and interest to think about things--to sit back and just philosophize.  This is why I do not abuse these drugs.  I enjoy thinking and pondering the origins of anything from the universe to a molecule of dirt for hours on end.  But a rare change from this never hurt anybody.  Opioids are very pleasant, but not life changing and profound.  Not as spirtual--more physical and numbing.  Yet enjoyable.<br><br>
There are many things I notice w/ the recreational usage of opioids--<br><br>
POSITIVE:<br>
~those you are close to seem even closer, I dare to say the feelings may be somewhat similiar to minute doses of E<br>
~the old familiar euphoric feeling you get on pain killers: pleasant drowsiness, pleasant intertia, comfortable itching, and intense, strung-out, euphoria<br><br>
NEUTRAL:<br>
~pupils don't always diliate- my pupils become very small, but seemed to blend in with the color of my eyes.<br>
~nearly impossible to reach orgasm until at LEAST 24 hours after heavy doses<br><br>
NEGATIVE:<br>
~sensitivity to light, loud talk, and music.<br>
~the feeling of annoyance is always lurking amongst those you even dislike the least bit.  I suggest being alone or in close company of those you truely love and like.<br><br>
Anyways kids, that is my two cents.  Opioids are cool, as are Opiates, but abuse can be very dangerous and damaging.<!-- End Body -->
