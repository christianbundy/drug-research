 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm a typical stimulant fiend due to general lethargy (otherwise known as being a lazy ass).\r\nFor me, I don't think a person could measure any significant cognitive enhancements with this stuff.  It has other major benefits though.\r\n-- Seems to totally prevent hangovers\r\n-- Counters irritablility and lack of creativity caused be other simulants\r\n-- Enhances sensory perception\r\n-- Large powder quantities available for cheap\r\nIt's strange.  I have mediocre vision.  When I first started taking the stuff I could have sworn that my vision had improved.\r\nVery clean, relaxing feeling.  Makes me feel like a hippy, which isn't as bad as I imagined. =)\r\nPeace\n\n\n"
