I am 20 years old. My weekend began by going over to a friends friday and planning to stay there beacuse his folks were out of town. We woke up saturday and decided to get some shrooms and some pot to entertain us for the day. We called our friend who lived not too far away and got what we wanted. We bought an 1/4 of dried mushrooms(an 1/8 for each of us), and a 1/4 of some BC nug.<br><br>
We started by eating the mushrooms. They weren't too bad tasting but I had a beer to chase them down. This was my second time eating them. I was fairly excited about the day and was in a good mood. We sat around and watched some tv and listened to some music for a while till they kicked in.<br><br>
About an hour after eating them (1:00p.m.) we decided that they had started to work as everything appeared slow and distorted. I felt as if I was in a stupid stage like I was really stoned. When I say stupid stage in refering to feeling like a dumass, no thought patterns, just random incoherent thoughts that dont make much sense.<br><br>
Next my friend and I decided to smoke a blunt of our pot to interst things up a little. I rolled up about 2 or 3 grams of pot in a philly and we went outside to smoke. Smoking seemed much more enjoyable and we laughed and had a great time outside. I noticed that the day was beautiful and it was very sunny outside. We finished up the blunt and went back inside. We ate a little snack and watched tv for a while.<br><br>
We decided we wanted to go do somehting outside since it was so nice outside. We decided to go for a jog. My friend knew the area much better than I did so he led the way. Me and my friend were both in pretty good shape. We ran a couple of the most entertaining miles of my life. The time seemed to go by slow but I couldn't believe the time was over when we finished. Throughout the run I was taken in by the surroudings as my eyes wondered around the senery.<br><br>
We finished running and returned to his house. We decided some water would be a good idea because we were pretty tired and sweaty. I made a glass of water and I realized that the run had sobered me up. I felt completely normal except for a little drowziness caused by the pot I had guessed. Out of no where I started to feel weird and so I decided to go sit on the porch and get some fresh air.<br><br>
On my trip to the porch I started to black out. I got very hot and my vision slowly darkened. Next thing I knew I was waking up on the floor where I had fallin from walking. I was very hot and sweating even though it was very cold in the house. I walked to the bathroom to look at myself and make sure I hadn't screwed myself up when I fell. I was very pale with almost no color. My friend had no idea what was going on and I decided I better not tell him casue I didn't want to freak him out. I told him I was gonna go lay down because the run had made me tired. I filled up my glass of water and went upstairs.<br><br>
I laid down and I realized I felt like I was tripping again. It was only 3 hours later so I guessed it was possible. I sat there and had strange thoughts of basically nothing. I created a tune in my head to listen to while I lay on the couch. I still was kinda freaked out about the whole passing out thing so I wasn't completely calm. I felt as if I wanted to be done with the whole tripping thing. 20 minutes or so later I decided to get up and eat a meal. It was around 5:00 at the time. I got up and walked down stairs and ate a sandwhich. Again I felt completely sober. I was pretty sure I was there for good now(sober). We decided that we needed to go do <br>
something and we went to my friends house to hang out.<br><br>
When we got there there were a few people over including his parents. His parents were cool with the whole smoking pot and drinking thing. I think that they did it too as a matter of fact. Too leave out a bunch of boring details we drank beer and chilled out on the deck until it got dark(8:00pm). We decided we wanted to smoke some more with my friend as it was long over due from the last time we smoked. I rolled up another blunt with the same amount of weed as the last one, maybe a little more. We smoked and watched a little baseball in his room.<br><br>
We walked dowmstairs when we were done to join the other visitors. I started to feel weird again and got the same cold sweats and slow darkining if the vision. I walked into the room where everyone was looking for a seat cause I was sure it was gonna happen again. I wanted a place to sit when I passed out. Before I could even get close to a seat I woke up again on the florr with parents and friends all around telling me to wake up.<br><br>
I got up and went to a chair, I was very uneasy and sweating a lot. I felt really bad like it would happen again. My vision was very good, it was very blurry and dark. I think it stayed like that for a while. I remember telling his parents that we had eatin schrooms earlier and that I had done it earlier but I thought I would have stopped tripping buy now. They said I had almost no color in my face and I was sort of purple colored.<br><br>
The above was all I thought happened. I found out later on that night that other things had happened while I was recovering in the chair after the fall. They told me I passed out again while they were talking to me sitting in a chair. They said my eyes all of a sudden rolled back into the back of my head and I started to seziere. They said I did that for a couple of seconds and I woke up again. <br><br>
I have done mushrooms since and everything has been normal. I don't know why this expreience happened and I don't really want to remember it.<!-- End Body -->
