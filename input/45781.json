 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI ordered some calamus root from an online herbal shop. Worst idea ever. I remember reading that if you chew 2in of the root, you will experience stimulation. I tried it, and felt a little more upbeat. Then a few weeks later, (yesterday) I wanted to 'trip-out' from it. I have done weed, alc, dxm, methadone, demerol, soma, salvia, and nitrous. \r\n4:00pm I chewed and swallowed about 7 inches of the dried root, which tasted spicy and bitter. I also took some tums with it to ease any heartburn that might follow. I went to the mall and two hours later I still wasn't feeling anything. \r\n6:00pm I said screw this and got some panda express. 10 min later it started my whole stomach turned upside-down. I ran to the bathroom where i puked up a crap load of food, and calamus root. Soon after every 10-15 min i puked again. I puked in the parking lot, then got a ride home. As soon as I got home, I ran to the bathroom, where i stayed for a while. \r\n7:00pm NOthing more is coming out, just lots of dry heaves every 15 min.\r\n8:00pm  I leave my bathroom finally and go lie down.\r\n9:00pm  Thinking I am going to die, now a very bitter foam like substance is coming out..\r\n10:00pm  I have a suppository from when I had the flu really bad, the puking stops finally.\r\n11:30pm I fall asleep still feeling like shit.\r\n4:00am  I wake up and feel completely normal again.\r\nI reallly dont recomend this shit to anyone, its not worth it. I didnt even get high, and i missed out on a crazy party because of this shit. I say we all stick to weed and alc.\n\n\n"
