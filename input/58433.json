 "report": "</p>[Erowid Warning: Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.] </p><p>I an on probation and periodically my probation officer performs a drug test. One such time, my girlfriend and I had been tripping Coricidin Cough and Cold the night before. A friend had assured us it was safe because drug tests don't look for DXM. We both took sixteen pills.</p><p>My test came back positive for PCP. I had been sick so I claimed I had been taking too much to try to get better quicker and that I had no idea why my cold medicine was coming up as PCP but I was unable to convince her. She placed me in a weekly drug treatment that I am expected to pay for.</p>"
