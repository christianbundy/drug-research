 "report": "<p>\nI must admit, I was a little skeptical about trying this particular pharm., but after toying with the idea for a while (and being unable to score some weed) I gave it a go. I'd had quite a bit of tobacco and already felt a little nauseated and disconnected from reality. So what the hell, I checked online for the doses and popped 12 pills (@50mg a piece) I got a little stoned, but not really. Three hours later I just got sick of standing around waiting for something significant to happen so I went to sleep. </p><p>I experienced no hallucinogenic effects at all during my 'trip'. And the mindset change was so minimal as to be negligible (little more than you would get if you stayed up all night). I would think that taking what some consider a high dose should be immune to a little skepticism... but maybe not. On the upside, I experienced no negative side effects at all.</p>"
