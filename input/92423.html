Okay, for starters I'm a 22 year old guy who has experienced most mainstream drugs, 155 lbs, 6'0, and had been sober for about 2 weeks at the time of this trip. I AM taking 100 mg Zoloft and 150 mg Trazodone daily. I woke up at about 9 AM on a Saturday morning, and watched The Machinist, and then decided to do a little cleaning.<br><br>
I came across an old envelope which I had received nearly year ago, containing a capsule of 60 mg 4-AcO-DMT (which had long since crushed in the baggie) and a 100 mg sample of JWH-122. I had completely forgotten about this, and was eager to try the goodies. Needless to say, I did a little bit of research, and decided to take roughly 1/4 of the 4-AcO to begin with, and weigh out ~15 mg at roughly 9:00 PM. I measured out my dose onto a nail file, and then put it in my mouth. It was expectedly bitter as all hell, so I chased it with a hit of JWH off a piece of foil. I then laid down, and turned off the lights, and cranked the music.<br><br>
T+0:20 -  it was painfully obvious I was on something. The letters on the computer all began to scroll and swirl, with all of the windows wildly resizing at will, with the fonts changing as all of this transpired. This became a little too much for me, so I decided to go outside.  and have a cigarette.<br><br>
T+0:30 - I'm looking at the night sky, and the first thing I notice is... well, it doesn't look very much like night time. There's a big crack in the sky that resembles a vagina and while it doesn't look like day time ... it doesn't look like night either. I find this to be cool, and decide to head inside.<br><br>
T+0:45 - I type to myself - 'This shit is amazing.' I'm trying to find the right music for this drug and I can't. I settle on some random techno from youtube, which I never listen to. I get an intense euphoria and decide to watch Waking Life, which I'd never seen but always wanted to watch on mushrooms. I get sidetracked listening to what I think might be voices in my head and decide not to.. but instead, to redose another little bit, without weighing it.<br><br>
T+1:30 - I feel this intense, manic euphoria. I'm talking to my girlfriend on the phone and I'm being really, overly saccharine sweet, like I'm on ecstasy, but I don't notice. She asks 'are you high?' and I suddenly become really introspective and quiet.<br><br>
T+2:00 - I continue with my music, pretty well frying, and everything on the computer looks like a cartoon. I get CEVs of random stuff, intensely colorful polygons and stuff like that, but also just random scenarios in life that are vivid and rich.<br><br>
T+3:00 - I get horny, and I get the bright idea to jerk off. I go on a popular porn tube site and start browsing. Similarly to on amphetamines, I go crazy trying to find the perfect video. Tactile stimulation is amazing. My penis feels separate from my body, and it feels humungous and alien. I'm very aroused, but upon climax every time, I realize how futile an orgasm is and it feels like nothing again.<br><br>
T+4:40 - After wasting almost two hours trying to have an orgasm to no avail, I feel like I've come down.<br><br>
T+5:20 - After a little introspection, and asking myself if I could handle it, and whether or not redosing would be a waste, I decide to take the rest of the bag, approximately 40 mg. I lick the bag clean and everything. I return to my bed and lay down, not really expecting much. I turn on some more music, this time preferring rap for some reason, and take another hit of JWH-122. I start to whack off again, and midway through the pornstars start looking impossibly disproportionate, one girl looks like an alien, and it also begins to become CEVs.<br><br>
T+5:50 - Chaos. Faces start morphing out of the dark walls of my room, voices are coming from all directions. I can't focus on anything on my computer because everything is scrolling, moving, changing, and resizing so rapidly. I have to urinate, but the paranoia of seeing myself in the mirror leads me to pee in a bottle in my closet. The closet looks.. oddly sinister and tiny.. I turn off the lights and head back to my bed. My tactile sensation is incredibly heightened. I lay down and it feels like the covers 'grab' me. I spend some time just rubbing my head, and laughing maniacally. The euphoria is back, but I've lost my mind. I learn what I think is 'the truth,' but am reminded by voices that I will forget it because I'm on drugs. I look at the drug paraphernalia I have accumulated just to consume drugs this night alone, and I feel ashamed. I think about life, love, and everything in between. I start having intense CEVs and OEVs of pornography. I decide to try to write something profound and this is the best I can come up with..<br><br>
'Twenty things you should understand before being a parent.<br><br>
1.) the font is changing into some pretty shit i've never seen before then like comic sans and shit. also i love julie (my girlfriend!) alot. '<br><br>
T+7:00 - I go for a smoke, and I'm greeted with the harshest, most vivid display of colors I've ever seen. I can hear bugs crawling and it creeps me out. It also definitely still looks like daytime, despite being early in the morning. The cigarette tastes terrible. I find it hard to walk back to my room. <br><br>
T+7:30 - I take a hit of JWH, and all of a sudden I go into a negative mind loop. I think about the tattoos I got in prison and how one of the guys who sharpened the needle for the tattoo gun was a child molester ( I later found out when I got out) and I just thought to myself: what if he gave me AIDS? Then I started viewing porno CEVS, and flashbacks of all of the unprotected sex I've had. I cringed at how careless I had sometimes been. I thought of the filthy conditions in prison.  I heard voices saying 'You're very stupid Tyler, you're very stupid!' I thought of the girls I might have given AIDS to since I came home from the pen last year.. and it was just a very negative experience. I started to try and look up  AIDS and the words were taking personalities of their own, and still shapeshifting and scrolling everywhere. I finally calmed myself down a little later, and by this point the trip was mostly over.<br><br>
T+8:00 I am exhausted physically from 8 hours of tripping but my mind is still very awake and wants to introspect, but cannot do so effectively. I feel antsy, so I decide to take 300 mg Trazodone and go to sleep.<br><br>
I slept 6 hours and woke up feeling great, no hangover, just a little bubbly like the night after using MDMA for your first time. I got a harsh look at reality when I took this one. It was a little intense, but I'm glad I did it. Could be an awesome party drug in doses of ~15 mg I think.<!-- End Body -->
