We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
Last month I found out that you can get a major buzz off of keyboard cleaners. This is a can of compressed air called a Duster or as most people call it dust-offs. If you have ever hit a whip it b4 and want to feel something alot more intense, this is it. You can find this in any computer store or most electonic stores. But this is a REALLY strong inhalent and users beware take it for whats it worth. <br><br>
The hardest i have ever hit it was around 8 hits and they were all like 10 seconds long. I felt verry dizzy at first, then my vision collapesed came back within a second, then for a couple of seconds i had tunnel vision. Every thing you would hear sounded like WA WA WA WA WA. My voice got really deep and started sounding like the way you would amagin satan to sound like. This is all happening with 30seconds after i hit it. Then my heart starts pounding really fast almost like it is about to stop in its tracks. After a minute or so everything starts to calm down. I have never really gotten sick off of this before but after having a long night with it you may wake up with a little headache in the morning. But no worries thats just what happens when you kill your brain cells in a matter of minutes. j/k<br><br>
P.S. Have fun but be safe I have heard of one person over dosing on this.<!-- End Body -->
