 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nHere is an experience I had with 3g of 15X standardized extract.\r\n06/05/08\r\n1:15pm Drank black/oolong/green tea w/ 3g extract partially dissolved, iced.\r\nT+15 no major noticeable effects\r\nT+30 slightly lightheaded, perceived pressure in nasal area, dizzy\r\nT+45 still slightly lightheaded, no more pressure, dizzy\r\nT+60 more relaxed, no nausea as usually reported as of yet, a little relaxed.\r\nT+75 definitely relaxed, still lightheaded. sleepy.\r\nT+90-150 same\r\nT+150 slight hunger, relaxed, sleepy, no euphoric feeling throughout experience.\r\nOverall, nice. The company I purchased the extract from accidentally gave me an additional 8g, unknowingly, thus making my experience repeatable and quite low-cost. Normally, this would cost nearly $10 but instead cost $3.25, a definite bargain. The herb is a great way to wind down after work as long as I get to sleep before the nausea sets in. The sleepiness could have been a result of my early waking (3:30am). Will try again on weekend w/ higher dosage (6g) to see if it makes difference. Kanna seems to have a much more pleasant, albeit subtler, effect.\n\n\n"
