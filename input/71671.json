The company I purchased the extract from accidentally gave me an additional 8g, unknowingly, thus making my experience repeatable and quite low-cost. Normally, this would cost nearly $10 but instead cost $3.25, a definite bargain. The herb is a great way to wind down after work as long as I get to sleep before the nausea sets in. The sleepiness could have been a result of my early waking (3:30am). Will try again on weekend w/ higher dosage (6g) to see if it makes difference. Kanna seems to have a much more pleasant, albeit subtler, effect.</p>"
