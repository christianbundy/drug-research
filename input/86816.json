 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nTo make a long story short I theorized that taking 5-HTP with some marijuana would enhance the high. I took the pill right before smoking and I did not feel too much of a difference other than the fact that it lasted a bit longer than usual.<br>I did try it again but this time I took the 5-HTP about 4 hours before I smoked. The effects were amazing, very similar to mixing MDMA with marijuana minus the amphetamine effect and the hangover the next day.<br>I've done it a few additional times since and I's say its definitely worth a try.\n\n\n"
