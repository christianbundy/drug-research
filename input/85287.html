I discovered this compound while reading a website and decided to give it a try, given its legal status in the USA. I order it online and am surprised when it arrives from China in just over a week. It is shipped discreetly.<br><br>
I plan on giving this a try by myself first to discover dosages and effects. No one I know has tried it. I have tried many other entheogens, including the ones this is apparently similar to, mushrooms, MDMA and LSD. I do not know what to expect aside from what I've read in various reports.<br><br>
I choose a day to try it, and spend the day reading reviews and feeling very nervous about it. I begin feeling adverse physical effects associated with other amphetamines, and I haven't even taken anything yet. Finally, I decide to just take the plunge - this stuff is supposed to feel great, right?<br><br>
In the morning I had taken a 21-amino acid blend as well as DLPA and L-Glutamate capsules. The previous night I have taken L-Tryptophan.  I also took some GABA mid afternoon to calm my jitters.  <br><br>
I go outside and sit in the sun while setting intentions for the trip. They are to experience euphoria, beyond the duration of the trip, authentic bonding with my boyfriend (referred to from here on in as BF), lasting spiritual insights, no problems, easy come down.<br><br>
T-0 mins:  Begin gradually ingesting 100 mg dissolved in 3/4 cup of water<br><br>
T-3 mins:  Go to bathroom, look in mirror, pupils seem to be dilating and shrinking rapidly. Feel something slightly odd about being in small, dimly lit room looking at a mirror, and exit.<br><br>
T-20 mins:  Finish ingesting solution. Feel slight psychedelic weirdness. Waiting for BF to arrive, as he has not done any entheogens except for an experience on magic mushrooms, and I am the guinea pig for Methylone. If I feel like it's worth it by 6:30 pm, he may try it too.<br><br>
T- 30 mins: Feeling a little tingly and queasy. Breathing deeply through the experience, intent on resisting nothing. Palms are very sweaty. Heart rate is increasing. Jaw starting to shake a little. Stomach cramping a tiny bit.<br><br>
T-35 mins:  Go to bathroom, get a bit sick to my stomach, which is very common for me on any amphetamine. Consume two cinnamon tic tacs to occupy mouth.<br><br>
T-38 mins:  Feeling a little speedy, pleasant feelings beginning to spread through body. Move to couch, where I lounge with computer, aware that I am feeling choosy about watching or listening to anything. Not entirely sure what to do with myself.<br><br>
T-48 mins:  Feel anxiety subside. Stomach cramps subside. Heart is still beating rapidly, hands are sweaty, but I feel calm otherwise. Reading reviews while waiting for BF. Feeling like I will probably take a preplanned booster dose of 33 mg soon. No real visuals, just an extremely subtle change in the vibe of how things look. <br><br>
T-54 mins:  Having that feeling of having taken not quite enough of something. Hesitant to redose until 1:15 hrs has passed, since many people report effects aren't in full effect until that point, but know myself well enough to know that too little of something in the amphetamine family doesn't work for me, since I wind up experiencing side effects without the high. So far this feels fairly benign. Finding it necessary to focus my energy into an activity such as writing. Easy to focus.<br><br>
T-65 mins; I feel good. Relaxed. Not very shaky. My jaw has calmed down and my energy seems to be fully channeled into typing. I notice that when I stop writing, waves of anxiety return and my jaw wants to move.  Noticing that this drug has nothing in common with MDMA for me. Much closer to methamphetamine. <br><br>
T-90 mins BF decides to join me and consumes 100mg dissolves in water. I gradually take another 33 mg. I feel very calm. No euphoria. I am confident BF will not find this too intense (he takes 100 mg) since I've had more intense experiences on coffee. I am very clammy. <br><br>
T-125 mins Not much is happening for either of us and we both take another 45 mg.<br><br>
T-135 mins We get a bit chatty with one another, openly discussing issues in our relationship and beyond (though we are easily able to do this without substances, so it's hard to tell what's what).<br><br>
T-205 mins We get bored, and redose with another 45 mg. We take a bath, which feels nice, but I am still having that anxiety I tend to experience with taking 'not enough' of something.<br><br>
T-300 mins We decide that these small doses aren't doing anything notable for us and that we should just try another large dose of 100 mg each. I'm feeling jumpy and I consume a 0.25 mg Alprazolam.<br><br>
T-310 mins We blissfully melt into the couch, close our eyes, listen to music, and meditate for what seems like 5 minutes. I am doing a lot of internal work on myself, noticing where I'm resisting certain feelings and sensations, going deeply into them, and allowing them to dissolve. Interesting visions pop into my mind with my eyes closed. This feels incredibly therapeutic.<br><br>
T-510 mins We realize we've been meditating for 2 hours straight. We get up, I have a glass of wine. I take another 1mg of alprazolam to sleep and he takes nothing. He has a lot of trouble sleeping and I sleep like a rock for 7 or 8 hours. <br><br>
At no point did either of us experience wild euphoria, intense sexual impulses, or many of the other effects noted in other people's recounts of Methylone. But we plan on trying a larger all-at-once dose of around 200 mg each the next time we give this a shot, because we suspect that might have been the issue. <br><br>
This is clearly not a party drug, and I can't imagine doing it for any other reason except to deeply meditate and inquire within, or to have an empathetic conversation with someone who I am not normally able to go so deep with.<br><br>
I do not notice any hangover the next day, despite the large dose.<!-- End Body -->
