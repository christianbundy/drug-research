 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis year I grew 10 Henbane plants and they have just come to seed. I striped open several capsules and dried the seeds in the sun. I tried them in several small doses of 0.1 and 0.2 grames with litle effect. Last night I measured out 0.5 grams of the dry seeds and sat down to wait for the effects.\r\nHallucinations were minimal but were more pronounced in the dark. In the light the effect is more of a blur to my vision than  true hallucination. I developed the dry mouth that I get with any of the datura plants but it wasnt to much of a problem. I drank 2 cans of cider while I was waiting for the effects but as soon as they came on I found that I didnt want to drink alchol anymore. The cider had taken on a strange bitter taste.\r\nI felt quite drowsey in a similar way to Valium perhaps. My coordination and balance was completly shot to pieces. I could still walk and get around but it was the equivilent of being extreamly drunk. I fell over a couple of times.\r\nApart from the above my head felt quite clear and I will be experimenting again next week with a slightly higher dosage.\n\n\n"
