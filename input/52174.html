We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</font><br><br>
It was in the middle of summer and I was bored, I had nothing to do that day so I decided to go huff some gas, no idea how I came to that point. Well here I am, in my shed, opening up my red plastic gas can. I eventually basically shoving my entire nose into the can and begin to inhale. At first I thought this was bullshit, but then I felt a little funny when I got u to leave, so I went back to the gas can. I began to inhale the fumes for another 30 seconds. I think. I lost all track of time in that shed. I remained there, but my mind went elsewhere. After what seemed an eternity, I was thrust into a story about an evil witch who steals souls. The witch some how I assume was the gas can. The gas can sucked the life out of me I guess, and I think my brain or conscious shut down. <br><br>
I was left staring at the gas can, not able to move, thinking I was dead and I could do nothing. Of course I snapped out of it. My mind was blown away. I spent probably 5 minutes staring at that gas can, it seemed like a lifetime weirdly enough. I was so tripped out, I wanted to continue. So I did it again. This time, I heard the most peculiar sound. I think it may have been all the ambiance around me (cars, birds, lawnmowers, dogs) and it all combined in to one, perfectly understandable language, I began communicating with the axe in my corner. If my parents ever walked in on me they mustve thought I was crazy, but I dont even know if they did because I was having such a good talk with this axe, no idea what about.<br><br>
Then I turn around and I get the feeling I traveled back in time, no idea why. I thought it was the summer before. Then I had one last weird trip. While I inhaled , and stared at the gascan, I felt as though I was transported to another universe, where the zaniest thing is fact. I had another life there, and once again it seemed to be a lifetime, then that evil witch came back and made me think about the inside of me (my soul) about what it is exactly, the witch told me that I was able to do much more, then my soul turned in to another being and left me (my body), and once again I could not move, anything. Couldnt talk, move my eyes, Im surprised I was even breathing. Then  I became aware of what was happening. I locked the door, and ran away from it.<br><br>
I have yet to return to m shed. That trip has left a scar on my brain. Figuratively, and literally. I can't ever go back to the way I used to think of myself, the so-called witch made me see the most disturbing thing one man can ever see, his own death, and his own soul. Ill never be the same.<!-- End Body -->
