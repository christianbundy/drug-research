 "report": "<p>\nBeen working at a new job about a week now and just startin to get to know the people there. My boss stepped out for bout a half hour and this dude i worked with asked if i smoked opium. Told i have and asked him if he had some shit on him. he said 'no opium, but i got about 2 grams of heroin' fuck, i never done heroin, much less imagined what kind of fucked up high it would induce, but shit, free drugs, cant pass that up. </p><p>He said we would smoke the shit, i was glad cuz i wasnt about to shoot that shit up. he made a flat surface out of foil and placed a small sticky brown ball of it in the middle. he then gave me a small cone made out of paper. he held the lighter under the foil and when it began to smoke, i began to suck that shit up. harsh smoke but smooth, opium like taste. we each took about 20 tokes total, on and off, over a period of about 15 minutes. the shit crept up fast and the high is like a weak ecstacy body high. my reaction time was slowed way the hell down. while I was high, I felt energetic 'again', I could take on anything, kinda like crystal. it faded after about 15 minutes but i was buzzed for about an hour.</p>"
