Individual Information: I'm an 18 y/o male, about 165 lbs, I've experienced a range of drugs including mescaline, cannabis, LSA, and shrooms, but I wanted to start with a low dose because of the reported dissociative affects, and I didn't want to wake anyone with vomit noises etc.<br><br>
Preparation: I grabbed 3 of the yopo seeds I had and put them in the oven, they popped after maybe 5 minutes. I discarded the shell and ground up the seeds with a spoon, and mixed in some baking soda as a basifier at roughly a 2 part yopo to 1 part baking soda ratio. It would only ground so far so I put the snuff to be in the oven for 7 minutes or so to take away some of the dampness that the seeds caused. Anyway, ground it up a bit more and sift-blended it to a nice tan coloured snuff.<br><br>
Set and Setting: At night, everyone sleeping, on the couch in the living room, relaxed, bored, watching TV in the dark.<br><br>
T+0 I grab a dollar bill and insulfate a line containing half the powder (1.5 seeds) off of the coffee table in front of me. Stings like a bastard, but about half so much as kanna. Horrid tasting post nasal drip as others have rightly reported. Immediately I feel a bit more sensitive to the TV light, in the way you are at the very start of an acid trip.<br><br>
T+0:05 Pressure building in head, starting to feel some coming up affects like something might happen. Colours shift a bit on the television, a alight out of body where I was conscious of everything in my periphery.  <br><br>
T+0:15 I think another report stated that a feeling of grief came over them, the kind you feel when a loved one dies. I had this, a sort of pressure in the chest/heart area and a separate feeling of nausea. Basically I'm in unexplainable pain. A horrid state that lasted about 20 minutes that makes it quite obvious to me that I will never use DMT again, especially in high doses. The nausea I can get over, not that awful uncomfortable feeling. There is also a heavy gravity not unlike salvia. <br><br>
T+0:20 Starting about 5 minutes into the experience the visual and dissociative affect had been increasing. This was about the peek, very much like the pictures people draw of DMT, the body, the linear filling movements, and things would look typical 70's-ish, with the crazy colours and weird patterns also some interesting CEVS. I can see that if I took more I'd be flying through colours and my head and thoughts and shapes. Over all, not very impressive, kind of interesting, but considering the physical pain of it, it's a no brainer that this is my last time trying this.<br><br>
T+0:25 Starting to wind down pretty good and 20 minutes later I'm close to baseline. <br><br>
Summary: My conception of time was largely warped, some interesting CEVs and visuals of the 60s or 70s, the kind that are typically depicted. I prefer the mescaline or acid visuals a lot more though, they are much smoother on you. <br><br>
I was largely in control of my motor skills the entire time, I'd change channels on TV and think fairly logically. It's a completely different breed of psychedelic. It's nothing fun, nothing spiritual, maybe something that teaches you about yourself. Physically degrading though, uncomfortable, a feeling of being poisoned and physically drained. <br><br>
I'm not someone who gets overly emotional about trips, nor someone who passes them off and learns nothing. I try to be a realist about it. In my experience salvia and mescaline especially have held extremely strong spiritual connections for me. Acid and Cannabis are more recreational, but I'll learn about myself. DMT however, is a flashy jolting uncomfortable poisoning, even at such a low dose I see this. <br><br>
The few positives are: I feel a bit warm and nice, although slightly nauseous now that it's about 45 minutes over. A calm is over me, and throughout the 'trip' I had a sort of stillness. This is highly uncommon for me as I'm medicated for tremors and I'm a pretty shifty fellow. A connection to fellow humans that I don't usually have, it's very slight, but nice.<br><br>
All in all, screw this, please be smart and DOSE LOW your first time to get a taste for DMT. I cannot image the horror of physically emptiness I would've felt on a dose of 5,6, or 7 seeds.  If I want to feel empty and weak, I'll watch a loved one die, screw that sick feeling with nausea and dissociation added on just for some profound experience that doesn't exist. Spiritual drugs leave you with awe and epiphanies, not a fuzzy head from cheap visual affects. It's bearable though, and you may have to experience it for yourself. Don't be scared off from it if it's something you have to do. Not my cup of tea for sure.<br><br>
