 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI was recently expiermenting with Ritalin, my experiences were very enjoyable indeed, with positive consequences and negative.\r\nIt all started in the season of winter, I was prescribed Ritalin for ADD. My doctor gave me 20mg pills, encoded with an 'A' on it.\r\nIt was a monday morning and I was interested in snorting two 20mg pills. I grabbed two out of the prescription bottle, ran upstairs in my room, turned on some Rap music. I then sat on my computer table, took a lighter and crushed the two tablets up. I took a dollar bill and snorted them. I instantly felt a warm feeling in my chest, my nose did burn slightly. I began to feel hot (in a good way). \r\nAfter all this, the taste in my throat was gross tasting, I ran downstairs, went on my computer, turned on some music, WOW!  I felt something, extreme euphoria, I felt happier about everything, music was better. Everything in life felt up-to-date with me. I felt more body energy, people I talked to, I loved talking to more, people I hated, I liked talking to. After the effects wore off, i felt anxiety, and a little tired.\n\n\n"
