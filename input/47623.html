I was definately a bit nervous before trying this substance, but in the end it was definately worth it!  I remember it kicking in about 45-60 minutes after ingesting it.  The first feelings I felt were a soft lethargic, it actually felt great!  Another thing about 2C-I is that I gained a little bit of telepathic abilities, I know it sounds strange, but I was able to know exactly what someone was thinking/feeling while I was tripping.<br><br>
The hallucinations brought on by this substance are kind of hard to explain, they were not like mushrooms at all in my opinion, they had a shifting aspect that was cool but not too impressive, but looking at trees, clouds, and lights were absolutely amazing!!!  I saw faces in the trees and clouds, and lights had streamers coming off them which I controlled, I made the streamers sway with the wind.   <br><br>
However, dont smoke any salvia with this shit, I sunk down into a proverbial black hole of my mind!  I saw the outside world begin to shatter like glass.  I've done salvia several times with good experiences, but NOT with 2C-I!  It may have been just me, but be careful with what you mix!  2C-I and cigarettes are cool, but no intensifications of either buzzes.<!-- End Body -->
