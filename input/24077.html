See <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml">DXM Brand Warnings</a> for more info.] </font> <br><br>
First off I would just like to say, I love coricidin, I have never had a bad trip on it and I would just take somewhere between 8 and 16 pills at one time and four hours later I was in drugged up bliss. Thing is, this stuff can kill you. I found this out the bad way, the really bad way. I had a warrant out for skipping a traffic ticket, it was a stupid thing to do, pay your tickets! Anyway one night while out on some coricidin and looking for more I got caught by the police and was arrested till I payed my ticket, not really a big deal. Only thing was that while I was in the cop car I had a seizure which I later found out was caused by another active ingredient in coricidin.<br><br>
Not only that but DXM sometimes shows up as PCP in drug test and it did for me when the police gave me a drug test at the hospital. Everything is ok now but that was a really sticky situation.<!-- End Body -->
