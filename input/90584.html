I thought I would take the time to write about one of the greatest experieneces I've ever had in my journies with Research Chemicals.<br><br>
I would consider myself a rather experienced person when it comes to the mind being altered. I've done several of the popular illegal items like Mushrooms, Extacy, Coccaine, Heroin, and then also a lot of obscure rare RC's that would take me forever to type out.<br><br>
I was really intrigued about any phen after reading some of Shulgin's reviews and reports in his infamous books. He listed 2C-E as one of his magical half-dozen, so I figured as a start, this would be the wise one to choose.<br><br>
I ordered from a very trusted and reliable RC source, and began the night watching TV. I weighed out 35mg, which is on the heavier side of dosing, but I didn't want to have a weak trip for my first time. I parachuted it with some water, had a meal an hour previous, so I was hoping to avoid the nausia some of described.<br><br>
At the 1 hour mark, I started to feel something come over me. I turned on some music and put on visuals to go with it on my flat screen and got in a relaxed position.<br><br>
At the 1.5 hour mark, it really started to kick in. I didn't feel any of the nausia, so this was a total plus. My visuals started having trail effects, and colors were becoming distorted. The music was completely taking over me, and was allowing me to connect to a deeper state of mind. The trip just kept getting better and better, and the visuals on the TV were really insane. The bass from my sound system was creating a vibration throughout my body that was simply amazing.<br><br>
Honestly the best part of this trip was how much the music was controlling everything. I was laying down most of the time with my eyes closed having insane CEV's that were moving with the music. To really dumb down this trip, I would say it was like taking Extacy with LSD. I had an awesome sense of well-being, and it was like I was in a crayon world visually speaking.<br><br>
This lasted for about 2 hours, getting me to the 3.5 hour mark where the trip started to slowly ware down. The comedown was completely easy, and I started to get up at points and realize the bliss I just experienced.<br><br>
After 5 hours total, I was basically at a baseline state, but with an amazing afterglow. It was well into the morning, and I proceeded to my bed for sleep. My dreams were even amazing that night, fully vivid and colorful.<br><br>
The next day I couldn't help but smile all the time thinking about how astonishing my trip was, and how there was literally no side effects, not even a headache.<br><br>
Since that first trip, I have done it approx. 12 times. The thing is, I believe towards the end of those trips, I was taking it too frequently, and 2C-E lost its magic at around the 10th trip. My last trip was a disaster as I had combined it with 2 other RC's, and its been close to 7 months since I've touched an RC since that trainwreck of a trip.<br><br>
All in all, 2C-E is simply outstanding, but just respect it, like with any other phen. <br><br>
Perhaps one day I can be reunited with the feeling of nirvana that I had my first time, but I believe even that once was enough to effect me for the rest of my life, leaving an anti-depressent impression with me.<!-- End Body -->
