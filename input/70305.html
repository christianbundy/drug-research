Due to my job I am often (more often than not) unable to partake in the use of cannabis.  After doing much internet research on 'herbal alternatives' I decided Damiana would be worth a shot.  Most 'herbal smoke' websites sell Damiana in bulk for several dollars plus shipping, but I procured half an ounce of dried Damiana from a local herbalist store for less than one U.S. dollar (plus I didn't have to wait a week for it to ship).<br><br>
After several tests of smoking the dried herb (usually in the form of a joint) I have concluded that despite much debate, I definitely experience some psychoactive properties associated with Damiana.<br><br>
While the Damiana experience is nothing like a cannabis smoking experience, I find that it can offer an enjoyable sense of well being and relaxation and in my situation it provides a satisfying substitute for cannabis.<br><br>
After just four or five hits on a medium size joint I can feel a mild buzz and euphoria set in.  Usually the mild buzz is VERY mild and other times it is quite noticeable and I am not sure what causes the inconsistency.  However, despite the amount of 'buzz' that comes there is always a general mood lift and relaxing euphoria that presents an 'all is well' feeling.  I did notice a slightly greater appreciation for art and music but I think that is mostly related to the feeling of euphoria.  I have only rarely experienced any of the aphrodisiac like qualities commonly associated with Damiana.  There does seem to be a feeling of increased blood circulation but I never feel any effect on my heart rate.  Smoking anything is not good for you so I do not use it daily, but in my sporatic use I have not yet noticed any adverse health effects.<br><br>
As always, do your own homework before imbibing any substance.  Damiana is known to cause problems for diabetics and to interfere with absorption of iron.<!-- End Body -->
